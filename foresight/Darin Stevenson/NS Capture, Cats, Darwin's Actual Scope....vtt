00:00.000 --> 00:07.920
hello everybody if I had realized that I might be motivated to make a

00:07.920 --> 00:14.400
recording while I was out walking today I would have brought something to screen

00:14.400 --> 00:24.200
the wind and usually a cotton ball or even some facial tissue wrapped around

00:24.520 --> 00:31.120
the mic with a rubber band something like this it's enough it works it works

00:31.120 --> 00:37.560
fine for my recording setup

00:40.480 --> 00:47.840
yeah I'm not going to talk about that all right so what is on my mind first of

00:47.840 --> 00:59.800
all I am where am I I am at a lake it is very windy and no shame for any of you

00:59.800 --> 01:06.080
who decide this is too much wind noise for you but those of you who are bold

01:06.080 --> 01:13.280
can accompany me in this strange adventure where I am risking my life

01:13.280 --> 01:22.720
primarily from widowmaker tree falls to get a little exercise on Sunday in the

01:22.720 --> 01:32.360
midst of some really interestingly stormy weather lots of wind gusts

01:32.360 --> 01:47.000
occasional bouts of serious rain but not the long slow calm kind of rain that is

01:47.000 --> 01:55.760
often well less threatening when the minute when the wind picks up the

01:55.760 --> 02:07.000
primary threat seems to be trees falling and where I live there's a lot of sand

02:07.000 --> 02:15.800
actually that's ridiculous let me be more clear as I understand it most of

02:15.800 --> 02:30.160
Golden Gate Park is a giant sand dune with some complex aquifers underneath it

02:30.160 --> 02:40.240
so I guess long ago the humans imported a bunch of topsoil so to speak and spread

02:40.240 --> 02:53.480
it all around and one of my friends well actually no longer my friend what ex

02:53.480 --> 03:02.000
communicated me for let's see I had a tiny bit of a sniffle and I was outside in

03:02.000 --> 03:11.560
the gardens without a mask on or no I had a mask on actually but as I wasn't

03:12.600 --> 03:23.960
severely quarantining I guess my friend decided I was a bad man turned out that

03:23.960 --> 03:34.400
it was less than tiny allergies that I was experiencing not even a cold and I

03:34.400 --> 03:42.640
certainly wasn't getting in anyone's face so yes she once remarked you know

03:42.640 --> 03:49.120
there's so many non-native trees here and they just don't form deep roots and I

03:49.240 --> 04:05.480
thought I mean especially now it's very obvious to me that she having the status that we would

04:05.480 --> 04:13.800
associate with a person of color particularly whose ancestry comes from India might have

04:13.800 --> 04:24.680
been making a psychological right right a displacement or a projection in metaphor

04:24.680 --> 04:31.720
without knowing it because what I saw we see a lot of trees fall here in fact I'm

04:31.720 --> 04:38.600
looking at five or six that fell recently right now yeah there's a bunch of them wow

04:39.200 --> 04:50.680
I mean it's you know it's literally dangerous to be out in weather this windy the secondary

04:50.680 --> 05:01.560
danger for pedestrians is stuff going in your eye or being impaled on your umbrella but anyway

05:01.560 --> 05:16.040
back to the tree things so my friend who excommunicated me is a docent at the botanical

05:16.040 --> 05:25.640
gardens I think still and I would be surprised if she did not understand that you're talking

05:25.640 --> 05:32.920
about a maximum of two or three feet in most places of topsoil sometimes less and then just

05:32.920 --> 05:47.880
saying right so when trees fall over I don't think it's because they're non-native right they fall

05:47.960 --> 05:58.040
over they don't form complex root systems not because they're not native but because it's pretty

05:58.040 --> 06:13.720
hard to do in sand right so yeah part of the it's funny part of the the trail here has been

06:13.960 --> 06:17.000
cordoned off

06:21.320 --> 06:28.760
yeah I guess there's also being hit in the head by things that fall that aren't branches for

06:28.760 --> 06:34.360
example pine cones and stuff or little pieces of branches that could wipe you out as a human

06:35.960 --> 06:41.160
it doesn't take a lot of weight coming from the sky you know 20 30 feet above your head

06:41.560 --> 06:52.600
to hurt you or even kill you especially if you're not wearing a hard hat so yeah lots of risk

06:52.600 --> 07:04.520
what's the f side well a couple of things one who as one gets older you start to have to pick

07:05.480 --> 07:10.680
more or less explicitly between something resembling

07:12.840 --> 07:17.960
more adventure or something resembling more safety and the more safety line

07:19.800 --> 07:27.160
is devastating in a bunch of ways because although you could handle maybe you could handle

07:27.880 --> 07:34.680
box life um without too much trouble a while ago when you start getting older

07:36.040 --> 07:43.080
the comfort of box life begins to become rattle into the comfort of the grave so to speak

07:44.200 --> 07:46.760
metaphorically and so

07:47.640 --> 07:48.140
so

07:51.240 --> 07:59.320
one necessarily chooses and it's a choice that you make each day now it's similar with

08:00.520 --> 08:05.960
our minds do we adventure or do we stay in familiar terrain

08:06.200 --> 08:15.320
um and why and what what turns out to happen is it's a bit like exercise

08:16.760 --> 08:20.920
if you don't if you don't keep it up

08:25.320 --> 08:31.640
it tends to oh wow there's a little yeah see I just saw a branch fall that

08:32.600 --> 08:36.680
could have definitely hurt someone thankfully it was um

08:38.920 --> 08:46.680
slowish oh wow I just heard another one yeah it's like I'm out here and it's it's like I'm

08:46.680 --> 08:52.200
hearing gunshots right except they're not gunshots they're tree breaks

08:54.840 --> 09:01.320
so it's probably good that trail was cordoned off because I might have been stupid enough to go

09:01.400 --> 09:13.000
up there and I can tell from here basically it's a bunch of cypress trees and these things naturally

09:13.000 --> 09:24.680
produce um I think it's mostly cypress and they naturally produce these long slender branches

09:24.680 --> 09:33.800
that are prone especially when water soaked to just snap off right it might be some kind of

09:34.520 --> 09:40.600
you know evolutionary benefit or something maybe maybe those branches both fertilize the ground as

09:40.600 --> 09:49.720
they as they fall apart or um bring other organisms or root possibly or maybe there's no

09:50.680 --> 09:58.520
you know obvious benefit if we're doing what we might imagine is Darwinian accounting

10:04.760 --> 10:12.840
which brings me to a variety of topics I've long held to switch to the topic of house cats

10:13.480 --> 10:20.840
that house cats are basically they can be understood from a variety of interesting perspectives

10:20.840 --> 10:29.080
including that they are effectively ambient psychedelic organisms meaning that if you begin

10:29.080 --> 10:38.840
to bond your mind with the mind of a provocatively intelligent house cat rather than a really lazy

10:38.840 --> 10:44.520
one but even the lazy ones or it's like they're smoking opium or something all the time um

10:45.400 --> 10:55.560
or rather they don't need to smoke anything uh the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland is sort of an

10:55.560 --> 11:10.280
example of someone who has noticed the strangeness of the cats but I have long held that um

11:12.680 --> 11:22.040
in terms of intelligence and non-human intelligence and alien like not alien is in bad alien is in

11:26.200 --> 11:35.240
family member from another origin right more like that um yeah the house cats those are

11:36.680 --> 11:40.040
like the square root of an octopus is a house cat you know

11:42.680 --> 11:51.000
and maybe if you you know house cat to the second or third power equals praying mantis or

11:51.080 --> 11:59.720
something like this and you know you can flip it around um the the the intelligence of the

11:59.720 --> 12:10.040
ambush predators is very unique and profound um and the intelligence of a house cat which is a

12:10.040 --> 12:18.120
really peculiar an animal with a very peculiar history um developmental history very peculiar

12:18.600 --> 12:28.680
and trippy because it goes from being a wild alpha predator to being a half domesticated

12:28.680 --> 12:38.200
beta like you know delta predator or something that effectively causes its primary symbiont

12:38.280 --> 12:52.520
right um captures a food source in humans trippy right very strange very unexpected um from some

12:52.520 --> 13:07.800
perspectives now of course the natural contrast to a house cat is the dog um similar similar

13:07.800 --> 13:21.560
developmental history uh and look um cats aren't not pack animals they just uh you

13:21.560 --> 13:35.800
know lions at least um have what we call prides in english groups and are there other

13:35.800 --> 13:46.200
examples i don't know there are probably examples of couplings and friendships but not

13:47.400 --> 13:52.840
primary necessary groups i just don't know enough about the feeling animals to know

13:55.640 --> 14:02.760
but there's at least one example of uh where they form you know cohorts and pods

14:03.720 --> 14:13.720
and i imagine young lions and perhaps mountain lions and so forth may certainly when they're young

14:13.720 --> 14:20.280
right they um travel and hunt and play with their siblings who knows if there's inter

14:21.960 --> 14:31.720
interfamily activity of that kind i was talking to my friend uh jay the other night

14:33.400 --> 14:40.520
actually was last night and we were talking about this this topic and i love to wax uh

14:40.520 --> 14:47.880
enthusiastic about the intelligences of the ambush predators because they are in a sense

14:48.040 --> 15:05.560
like if you want security and um familiarity dogs work beautifully right those are the solar

15:06.280 --> 15:12.440
animal essentially of the pair and look there are solar cats and there are lunar dogs but

15:12.440 --> 15:25.080
fundamentally um the dog is the solar animal uh daytime predator right um although not entirely

15:25.080 --> 15:33.160
you got coyotes and wolves that are nocturnal um maybe i had that wrong actually uh nighttime

15:33.160 --> 15:40.680
predator nocturnal and similarly cats also nocturnal but perhaps more so than dogs

15:41.640 --> 15:47.400
um tend to sleep all day stay up all night left to their own devices probably

15:49.480 --> 15:53.160
i don't know what they would do in their natural situations because i don't see those

15:53.160 --> 15:57.320
animals in those situations but i do think of dogs as solar

15:59.880 --> 16:03.160
not explicitly and not only and cats as

16:03.160 --> 16:09.640
though now there's going to be some serious wind

16:11.960 --> 16:19.240
so we were talking about this the other night and okay what was the topic all right the topic

16:19.240 --> 16:22.520
was actually pretty deep it was

16:23.320 --> 16:36.280
a topic that i've spoken of some recently but even since then the insight has been enriched

16:37.560 --> 16:44.200
it's the topic of what happens when something captures the nervous system of an animal

16:45.560 --> 16:48.440
and there's lots of stuff that capture our nervous system

16:49.400 --> 16:58.920
um a simple example of this is that you know it's the pavlovian thing right if we smell

16:58.920 --> 17:04.680
something delicious in fact i'm just i'm merely thinking of something delicious and my mouth is

17:04.680 --> 17:14.040
starting to water but if i smell something delicious much more so so that's an example where

17:14.600 --> 17:26.600
where you can see that i have no control i have no mental control over

17:26.760 --> 17:29.160
so

17:36.840 --> 17:41.160
gale force winds just short of hurricane speed

17:43.880 --> 17:47.320
i have no control over whether my mouth waters or not that i know of

17:47.400 --> 17:54.760
of might be able to influence it with nlp or hypnosis or something but i have no

17:57.720 --> 18:06.280
my salvation and similarly if i hear one of those gunshot branch cracks and it's loud

18:06.280 --> 18:08.440
enough and near enough probably y'all jump

18:13.480 --> 18:19.000
when you see corvids at least around here

18:25.240 --> 18:26.760
approaching food on the ground

18:27.480 --> 18:36.520
they will often sort of hop toward it and leap backwards

18:39.080 --> 18:43.880
i was thinking a lot about that particular behavior the other day after observing it because

18:45.000 --> 18:46.360
trying to understand

18:49.880 --> 18:53.640
one thing i can imagine now which it didn't occur to me before

18:54.360 --> 19:04.680
i mean it's not crazy it's natural it's just different from the very safe norm

19:05.400 --> 19:10.920
that usually applies and the difference is profound enough that i am well aware i could

19:10.920 --> 19:17.640
be killed it's not very likely but it's probably 50 times more likely than it was yesterday

19:18.040 --> 19:21.160
all right so

19:27.160 --> 19:31.240
the thing that occurs to me now and i couldn't figure it out before but now it seems relatively

19:31.240 --> 19:38.760
obvious snakes eat birds and one of the best ways to catch bird

19:39.480 --> 19:46.360
would be to hang out near the corpse of an animal right

19:48.920 --> 19:55.640
you're an ambush predator you have that that feline intelligence that praying mantis intelligence

19:55.640 --> 20:02.200
that octopus intelligence the jumping spider intelligence right you have this

20:02.520 --> 20:11.480
trap setting capable capable of setting a trap intelligence praying mantis is straight

20:11.480 --> 20:20.200
upset traps on flowers right just no doubt about it you see them do it all the time

20:21.400 --> 20:23.240
so i wouldn't ambush predators

20:28.360 --> 20:30.120
and since corvids eat meat

20:32.920 --> 20:37.800
they eat other stuff too they eat seeds and bugs and worms and stuff it depends on the birds and where they are

20:43.400 --> 20:44.360
since they eat meat

20:50.360 --> 20:56.520
what might happen is a snake might or other ambush predator possibly not sure what a bobcat maybe

20:57.240 --> 21:04.920
what else would eat birds i don't think i mean coyotes eat birds but they also eat dead things

21:06.680 --> 21:12.600
snakes don't usually i don't know of any snakes that eat corpses

21:15.080 --> 21:23.800
now you can teach cage snakes to eat dead mice i don't know if they eat dead mice in the wild

21:23.800 --> 21:30.440
not clear to me it seems pragmatically effective that they should i just don't know

21:33.080 --> 21:43.000
but yeah i can imagine snake hangs out near bird food of any kind right dead things seed piles you

21:43.000 --> 21:53.320
name it and just waits for birds and waits close enough that when the bird gets to the food item

21:54.680 --> 22:00.920
it's within striking distance of the snake so that would explain

22:02.360 --> 22:10.120
evolutionarily how the peck jumped back like it's literally like that that

22:12.840 --> 22:19.080
that song that has the lyrics jump back jack in it the bird like goes forward and then leaves

22:19.160 --> 22:25.240
backward it may do that a few times and after like two or three times it'll it may just fly

22:25.240 --> 22:31.160
off and leave the food alone that does happen i've seen it but what's going on there isn't that the

22:31.160 --> 22:38.600
bird is thinking i'm scared i think what's going on is that the bird's nervous system has been

22:38.600 --> 22:48.280
captured by something like an evolutionarily developed and look the thing may not be genetic

22:48.280 --> 22:56.760
there's got to be nine other ways of influencing organisms that aren't merely genes and most of

22:56.760 --> 23:00.760
those ways might we would argue would would necessarily have some effect on genomes because

23:00.760 --> 23:09.000
they they become selection variables in that theory and we're going to get some weird stuff

23:09.000 --> 23:14.520
about that in a minute um so they might have they might have selective

23:16.680 --> 23:18.920
functions so to speak or effect

23:21.560 --> 23:26.920
but yeah what i think is going on is that the organism's nervous system has been captured

23:27.800 --> 23:34.280
and like a goose that sees a ball rolled a few feet from its nest during a certain season

23:34.680 --> 23:40.280
and it will go the goose will crane its neck at least this is what i've heard

23:41.160 --> 23:46.520
crane its neck from research crane its neck go toward the ball and roll the ball back into

23:46.520 --> 23:52.200
the nest whether or not there's a ball there anymore at all and you know whether or not it

23:52.200 --> 23:56.360
much resembles an egg so you can see that

24:00.360 --> 24:08.760
there are these protocols you know in the age of computers we would be likely to call them programs

24:09.400 --> 24:13.560
because we're just reaching around for some metaphor but it's a

24:13.800 --> 24:20.600
historically physically structured vulnerability to capture

24:22.840 --> 24:27.800
when an organism detects high heat suddenly it recoils

24:30.920 --> 24:37.160
it may recoil from other things water food that may not be safe or smells wrong

24:37.880 --> 24:44.920
um you know one kid on the bus uh disgorges his breakfast on the floor

24:45.640 --> 24:52.600
now you pretty soon have what a oh this could be good just siren

24:54.280 --> 24:57.960
we might get a demonstration of this effect let's see

24:57.960 --> 25:08.040
uh yeah pretty soon you've got you know

25:11.720 --> 25:20.520
sudden unexpected public vomitorium on the bus right because once two more kids

25:20.520 --> 25:26.520
follow suit and they're certainly not doing that on purpose right they're not trying to do that

25:26.600 --> 25:29.080
they don't want to do that they can't help it

25:32.520 --> 25:37.560
so uh

25:41.560 --> 25:44.920
we didn't get the example i wanted so um

25:48.200 --> 25:52.440
you can see that there's a structured response

25:52.680 --> 26:00.920
um that's probably ordinarily rather than being activated

26:03.560 --> 26:05.960
we can think of it both ways and we probably should

26:07.400 --> 26:13.560
rather than being activated by stimuli it could also just be ordinarily inhibited

26:14.440 --> 26:20.920
and under some circumstances that inhibition collapses and the coyote howls

26:21.880 --> 26:27.240
in concert with the approach of a siren not because it wants to

26:28.120 --> 26:34.280
not because i mean possibly it's in pain it is possible we don't know and it's reasonable to

26:34.280 --> 26:48.520
imagine it might be um when you present uh wildly exaggerated stimuli to an extremely sensitive

26:49.320 --> 26:53.320
organisms

26:58.600 --> 27:07.960
to a hypersensitive organism right if a wasp can detect one molecule of a substance within

27:07.960 --> 27:14.040
a two-mile range within a two-mile circle as i understand it some wasps are capable of that

27:14.040 --> 27:20.760
degree of sensitivity if you subject them to for example

27:23.240 --> 27:28.600
some kind of human perfume laundry soap for example laundry soap stench

27:30.840 --> 27:37.880
could be physically painful to them so we don't know whether the siren is physically painful

27:38.760 --> 27:41.720
but we do know that it resembles other coyotes calling

27:42.680 --> 27:52.520
and so when the dogs howl in the coyotes um howl at the siren there's a good chance that

27:52.520 --> 27:59.000
they're just being triggered right their body is howling not their mind and

28:01.640 --> 28:09.560
um you know we hear people talk about sensory experiences like the hair stood up on the back

28:09.640 --> 28:16.760
of my neck um i got goosebumps and obviously goosebumps are a thing that happens when we're

28:16.760 --> 28:26.920
cold too but uh there are certain physiological transformations uh heart palpitates right we

28:26.920 --> 28:33.160
like i don't know if we like it i think we like it because we're our most of our experience is

28:33.160 --> 28:43.480
kind of deadened but we like horror movies sometimes or we may like um scary rides because they

28:46.280 --> 28:53.080
deprive us of the control we might ordinarily have over our body's sensations

28:54.840 --> 28:59.800
or the selection of sensations right actively selecting sensations

29:00.520 --> 29:10.040
um and subject us to extraordinary forces and sensations

29:15.160 --> 29:16.440
so we too can be triggered

29:18.440 --> 29:24.680
um it would be interesting to see the library of programs so to speak they're not actually

29:24.680 --> 29:31.560
programs i don't think but to see like the library of a single creature now obviously if you

29:31.560 --> 29:36.760
observe a single creature very closely over time and you observe many of them many of their kind

29:36.760 --> 29:49.000
quote unquote you will begin to understand something of the library uh so praying mantises for example

29:49.000 --> 30:01.640
will they have a complex striking uh behavior it's a pray capture behavior but they can use

30:01.640 --> 30:09.720
it like a punch as well and they have a complex uh threat display where their body transforms

30:10.440 --> 30:21.240
you know into a creature oriented to both fight and shock uh a possibly predatory animal creature

30:29.320 --> 30:35.320
so we were talking about the peculiarities obviously right like social media is weaponizing

30:35.400 --> 30:47.160
this against us it one could say it is studying in a sense human activity and then producing

30:47.960 --> 30:58.280
hopeful monsters that capture it amplify it um and make it contagious that's one of the dumbest

30:58.280 --> 31:05.240
uses of technology that anyone could imagine i mean it's almost as dumb as just throwing bricks

31:05.240 --> 31:13.320
at people's heads the problem here is that they can't see the brick right it has the same effect

31:13.960 --> 31:19.320
in that they get dumber every time they're subjected to it most of them some of them

31:19.320 --> 31:25.560
have a good buffer some of the humans um but yeah they get dumber every time like

31:26.280 --> 31:29.880
every iteration makes them dumber and

31:35.480 --> 31:43.880
the problem there is really dangerous because anything that reduces your awareness or sensitivity

31:44.280 --> 31:55.720
over time is prone to create a situation where you can't you won't be able to perceive what you've

31:55.720 --> 32:03.720
lost and this is part of the problem with ordinary human aging one might argue that social media

32:03.720 --> 32:11.560
ages certain aspects of us um precipitously and invisibly

32:13.960 --> 32:20.440
since our bodies don't age in response though i think actually internally they do we don't notice

32:21.720 --> 32:26.760
anything that affects the thing you notice with right creates a really good

32:27.720 --> 32:39.400
a really effective process that hides its own it hides its own progress and it hides the damage it

32:39.400 --> 32:50.600
does it naturally does this so we want to have awareness when we approach technologies or media

32:56.760 --> 33:02.600
we want to have awareness of what's getting compromised how quickly how deeply

33:05.640 --> 33:11.160
and how can we if it if it becomes necessary for some reason that we interact with the technology

33:11.160 --> 33:18.680
anyway or if we want to we want to have the intelligence necessary to make determinations

33:19.640 --> 33:29.480
about what that curve of harm looks like to whatever degree we are able and then adjust

33:29.480 --> 33:34.920
our behavior accordingly so as to preserve the assets that would otherwise be lost

33:34.920 --> 33:48.200
now you can see that the pros for example when they approach a food source on the ground

33:49.000 --> 33:59.240
start to go at it and then jump back they're testing to see if anything moves nearby the food

33:59.880 --> 34:05.400
during that process and if it does they will become aware that the food is a trap

34:07.320 --> 34:18.360
now obviously also once humans became tool makers of some kind they probably made bird traps too

34:19.320 --> 34:27.800
of various kinds and so the bird is trying to check whether you know probably a

34:29.560 --> 34:34.760
whether there's a organismal trap and b whether there's a physical trap even though it may not

34:35.320 --> 34:40.440
its body probably isn't a complexly differentiating between those two things

34:40.600 --> 34:48.440
all right so triggering

34:56.760 --> 35:04.840
I think even likely for an organism to take advantage of programs that are normally

35:05.080 --> 35:08.760
let's not call them programs let's call them abilities

35:10.200 --> 35:12.680
for or what do I want to call them

35:18.120 --> 35:18.920
abilities

35:25.320 --> 35:27.800
each organism seems to uniquely develop

35:31.560 --> 35:31.960
of

35:35.400 --> 35:40.280
yeah this is this starts to run into problems between the difference between language and

35:40.280 --> 35:45.400
description and what animals and organisms actually are and are doing are being

35:52.120 --> 35:59.960
so imagine a broad spectrum of unique forms of sensitivity and or intelligence

36:00.680 --> 36:13.240
that naturally result in super effective like meta effective

36:16.840 --> 36:18.360
relational or physical

36:21.960 --> 36:26.760
skills one can imagine that it might be possible for an organism to

36:27.480 --> 36:31.880
especially for humans for example because we have a lot we have a great deal of luxury

36:31.880 --> 36:38.680
compared to most animals in consciously determining our developmental spectrum spectra

36:44.920 --> 36:51.480
so the humans we probably have access to

36:51.880 --> 36:57.640
to at least probably thousands of potentially developable

36:59.000 --> 37:06.280
abilities that result when enacted in something resembling either relational or physical

37:06.280 --> 37:13.000
super function or both and one tends to lead to the other right because for example

37:13.800 --> 37:21.000
brilliant athletes who become known for their athleticism

37:23.320 --> 37:32.360
acquire relational benefits what we call fame which radically increases both there

37:34.040 --> 37:39.640
the opportunity space for reproduction but also for just enjoyment

37:40.440 --> 37:47.640
unfortunately at the same time because of how strange the humans are in modernity and maybe forever

37:49.720 --> 38:00.040
that will also attract enemies opponents undesirable possibly obsessive attention from other humans

38:01.720 --> 38:04.280
and maybe under some circumstances from the sky itself

38:09.880 --> 38:18.760
so my friend and I were talking about cats and she said something resembling you know

38:21.000 --> 38:27.000
well i was talking about how cats can be triggered right if they and that sometimes house cats

38:28.920 --> 38:38.040
dogs you can see dogs doing behaviors displaying behaviors that and i guess i'm anthropomorphizing

38:38.120 --> 38:41.640
bit that may be natural for humans or at least some humans

38:45.080 --> 38:50.200
you know when a dog makes a silly mistake a silly physical mistake or like

38:51.720 --> 38:58.760
it misses the bite or it slides chasing the ball it crashes into the wall or

38:59.880 --> 39:04.040
and by the way that's you can see triggering right there because the dog ordinarily does

39:04.040 --> 39:09.080
not crash into things but under circumstances where it becomes hyper focused on the ball

39:10.040 --> 39:16.120
it will crash in many dogs will just crash into walls or other nearby objects

39:16.120 --> 39:23.320
so

39:27.560 --> 39:37.400
i have seen okay we're in gale force winskin dogs appear to exhibit emotions that resemble shame

39:38.360 --> 39:45.080
and or embarrassment i'm granting that that's my interpretation

39:47.080 --> 39:49.080
after cert after being witnessed

39:52.840 --> 39:57.080
they seem to be aware of observation in a way not dissimilar to how we are

39:59.240 --> 40:04.600
if i suddenly step on the side of my foot for example and begin to stumble because i missed

40:04.600 --> 40:11.880
step the first problem is the pain in my ankle but the second problem is did anybody see me

40:12.520 --> 40:18.920
you know i will quickly glance around to see if i have been seen to have failed at something

40:18.920 --> 40:29.960
as simple as taking a step right so i was i was explaining that it was my experience when i began

40:29.960 --> 40:37.080
to learn more about cats because my girlfriend had a pair and certainly i encountered them many

40:37.080 --> 40:42.360
times before but i think this pair of cats was the pair i was most intimate with him

40:42.360 --> 40:54.760
throughout my life to memorialize them mexicat and panther which who was her son

40:55.240 --> 41:05.880
mexicat was a very hyper intelligent sensitive loving soft mother cat very fluffy furry white

41:06.600 --> 41:11.240
found in the desert with a piece of her tail missing as a kitten i think if i remember right

41:11.800 --> 41:16.040
and panther was one of her children big black fluffy

41:16.040 --> 41:26.040
cat and panther would when we were playing occasionally and i've seen other cats do this

41:27.480 --> 41:36.280
very few of them won't be triggered if you accept the gambit so this is this is a gambit in animal

41:36.280 --> 41:47.400
chess called cat belly when dogs give you their belly it may or may not be submissive but it's

41:48.280 --> 41:56.120
they're they're showing their vulnerability because their primary powers as an animal

41:56.120 --> 42:01.080
are

42:05.160 --> 42:12.520
the primary powers are like a spear in a dog they lunge and penetrate

42:15.720 --> 42:25.400
the cat is different it can lunge but it normally attacks with paws because those are razor sharp

42:26.120 --> 42:32.600
and grippy and once it gets a grip then it can penetrate usually the neck of a creature often

42:32.600 --> 42:41.640
the neck with jaws both animals have bone breaking jaw power the cats is less because it's smaller

42:41.640 --> 42:49.720
the house cat anyway um but what what she was saying i was saying that basically sometimes

42:49.800 --> 42:58.120
i would pet panther and he would you know roll over on his back and this seemed to be an invitation

42:58.120 --> 43:07.240
for you know some gentle aware belly petting um gentle and aware both because you know this is

43:07.240 --> 43:16.680
an animal's vulnerable underside and previous experience had taught me that under certain conditions

43:17.640 --> 43:25.400
cats become triggered and when they are triggered they may bite unintentionally

43:26.360 --> 43:32.920
and usually they can manage the force so that it's not really bad it's still painful

43:34.600 --> 43:41.400
and they also can there's some word for this it's not worry that's what a dog does it's

43:42.360 --> 43:50.040
some kind of shredding thing they basically um grasp with their front paws and may claw with them

43:50.680 --> 43:57.080
and then shred or gash with their rear paws and so what would happen is i'd be petting panther

43:58.280 --> 44:05.720
we'd be having like a love session and you know he really he really enjoys that but then sometimes

44:05.720 --> 44:12.680
he would get triggered and capture my hand bite it and try to rip at it with his back claws and then

44:14.280 --> 44:26.440
he would he would sort of snap out of it and display signs of that i interpreted as sadness

44:27.000 --> 44:37.160
shame embarrassment i didn't mean to do that this kind of thing and uh it took me a long time to

44:37.160 --> 44:46.360
understand what was going on i certainly didn't understand to the degree that i you know in any

44:46.360 --> 44:53.080
thing that resembles what i'm saying now i was unconsciously aware but not cognitively and

44:53.080 --> 44:59.800
conceptually aware of what was going on i didn't have a model but i did learn very quickly that

45:01.080 --> 45:07.720
when cats show you their belly it's either one of two things usually going on either they really

45:07.720 --> 45:15.720
will enjoy the intimacy and danger of allowing it effectively a god right an animal that is

45:15.720 --> 45:21.160
unimaginably powerful full compared to you um you can kill a cat probably just by crushing

45:21.160 --> 45:28.520
its rib cage in your single in the grip of one hand right you can kill it if you wanted to kill

45:28.520 --> 45:35.160
a cat hopefully you don't um it would take very little effort on your part to destroy the animal

45:36.920 --> 45:42.600
physically and there's very little the cat could do about it so and the cat may not know your

45:42.600 --> 45:50.200
physical strength but it probably suspects it from examining you so when the cat rolls over either

45:51.400 --> 46:01.160
um it has learned to inhibit the triggering that is likely to happen when you approach

46:01.160 --> 46:09.960
its belly with your hand and begin stroking it um and so it just enjoys the ecstatic feeling

46:11.160 --> 46:19.640
of being vulnerable like being loved where one is most vulnerable so to speak

46:19.640 --> 46:27.320
in human language um but other cats and again look the cat rolls over and displays its belly

46:28.120 --> 46:33.480
so something's going on there but it's not necessarily my friend was saying a display of

46:33.480 --> 46:45.240
submission or you know because when the cat is on its back all 20 of its face knife footraisers

46:46.120 --> 46:49.160
are accessible and the bite and so now

46:57.080 --> 47:01.400
it can grip with its fore paws bite

47:04.440 --> 47:05.960
and shred with its hind legs

47:06.680 --> 47:17.400
and this is a for for many animals I suspect this is a disemboweling move right it opens up

47:19.240 --> 47:22.280
first of all just opens up gashes on the animal if you're a large cat

47:23.480 --> 47:25.400
if you're a small cat it still messes them up

47:28.840 --> 47:34.040
so yeah we had a big laugh because she was like the cat rolls over and people think it's a submission

47:34.120 --> 47:39.960
move because they've been watching dogs or something it may or may not be partly submissive

47:41.240 --> 47:45.480
but basically the cat now has full access to all of its weapons

47:48.760 --> 47:53.400
it's almost like the cat is saying like the cat is daring you

47:54.360 --> 48:02.520
right do you want to put your hand in the chainsaw

48:04.200 --> 48:09.320
it's like a Tasmanian devil in loony tunes I just rips things apart

48:13.400 --> 48:15.800
so I thought that was hilarious hilarious take on

48:16.760 --> 48:22.040
cats but if you want non-ordinary experience

48:25.480 --> 48:30.040
if you're someone who seeks that the best place to seek it is in

48:32.680 --> 48:38.600
devoted contact with the living place with specific animals and birds

48:39.080 --> 48:46.200
you know it doesn't matter whether plants have spirits or plants have minds

48:47.000 --> 48:51.720
they are organisms and we are organisms and we are organisms from the same world

48:52.600 --> 48:59.080
so in one set of categories that makes us the same thing the same being

48:59.960 --> 49:07.080
we are that that tree is me outside my body I am the tree outside its trunk

49:09.560 --> 49:17.000
and I'm not saying this is a fact but it is categorically true before even we are organisms

49:17.000 --> 49:26.680
we are beings so it goes like the concentric circles go like mystery universe then beings

49:26.680 --> 49:34.200
and organisms and earth organisms and then you know on down the line to animals human animals

49:34.200 --> 49:42.200
and that's just what if what if our category tree is missing three important elements and I would

49:42.200 --> 49:54.200
argue it is so that we can't even see them in language there's no way to detect them in concepts

49:55.160 --> 50:00.200
because we have no placeholder for them in our categorical libraries

50:00.200 --> 50:07.560
and I think actually this is a huge problem for all humans

50:12.600 --> 50:16.280
but particularly for we who speak English because our category tree

50:18.200 --> 50:26.680
is it's almost like it was hit by a shotgun or something it's missing big chunks of crucially

50:26.680 --> 50:38.440
important placeholders shelves containers so forth that would draw our attention to

50:39.880 --> 50:48.040
modes of existence that we no longer have a placeholder for and so since we don't most of those modes

50:48.040 --> 51:01.240
get they get exported to the supernatural the psychic the superstitious the religious but

51:01.240 --> 51:08.840
they shouldn't they don't need to be the actual situation is so weird that it's weirder than all

51:08.840 --> 51:15.720
of supernatural speculation it's weirder than all religious speculation it's weirder than all of science

51:16.680 --> 51:25.320
so none of those should become the authorities of identity those are conceptual frameworks

51:26.520 --> 51:35.080
right you might argue one might reasonably argue that humans are particularly vulnerable

51:35.320 --> 51:48.120
to structured reactions that are not necessarily physical but are similarly involuntary and our

51:48.120 --> 52:02.120
conceptual right what would be an example well weirdly I was listening to the most enlightening

52:03.080 --> 52:10.280
podcast last night on I think a philosopher called Dugan that it is in thought that it is

52:10.280 --> 52:20.760
thought or Durgan that it is thought influenced influences Putin's policy dramatically

52:20.760 --> 52:29.880
and for the first time I heard

52:32.520 --> 52:38.840
powerful criticisms of the concept of liberal being liberal

52:43.080 --> 52:45.320
so yes where was I going all right

52:51.640 --> 53:00.920
examples of such cognitive traps are the Christian belief that everybody who doesn't accept Jesus

53:00.920 --> 53:16.680
is going to hell and that there's a Satan now similarly the doctrinal liberal belief

53:17.080 --> 53:28.040
once it becomes doctrine once you have to either be liberal or fascist the liberal belief that

53:28.040 --> 53:38.120
you get to invent your identity you get to invent your gender you are free to completely dispose

53:38.200 --> 53:45.160
of all conventions and anyone who doesn't dispose of these conventions is evil

53:46.680 --> 53:50.280
particularly if they do not dispose of them in the way that you dispose of them

53:50.920 --> 53:59.480
now you have sectarian liberality right and this can become extremely dangerous virulent

54:00.440 --> 54:03.400
and compelling for humans we

54:06.360 --> 54:15.720
adopt programs from not tradition but traditional language and the traditional

54:15.720 --> 54:21.960
presuppositions about identity meaning and value also which games are played

54:22.920 --> 54:33.960
that are imported when we learn a modern language particularly in my case I can speak

54:35.400 --> 54:40.440
only telling me about English okay

54:41.320 --> 54:43.960
hmm so

54:47.000 --> 54:49.400
wow that's interesting

54:55.720 --> 55:01.160
I've walked around the lake I think I'm on my third circuit

55:02.840 --> 55:06.920
I'm sure you heard that sound that sound was the sound of a spear

55:07.880 --> 55:15.320
falling from a cypress into the ground a foot from me it was pointed straight down

55:16.600 --> 55:23.560
it was pointy on the end it stuck into the ground and it had a cone on it it was small but

55:26.520 --> 55:31.960
had I been struck by that likely I'd have been injured possibly seriously

55:32.200 --> 55:40.760
so it's probably time to stop the adventure but I'm not going to just yet

55:41.560 --> 55:48.040
because the sun has come back out and there's a break in the rain and it's a good time to

55:49.880 --> 55:55.000
stretch my legs I think of course I could walk in safer places

55:55.720 --> 55:56.520
um

55:59.320 --> 56:02.760
that startled me so I branched in thought

56:07.720 --> 56:12.840
yes so the humans are vulnerable okay when we learn a language like English a bunch of

56:12.840 --> 56:18.280
games are imported like courtroom mind or war mine or mine and yours or us and them

56:19.160 --> 56:22.280
now us and them exist in most languages and conceptual frameworks

56:23.240 --> 56:28.440
uh but the way the particular character of the English the modern the colonial

56:29.320 --> 56:31.800
the neocolonial the pericolonial

56:36.120 --> 56:41.960
you know what that is it's probably crashing crashing trees it's tree branches snapping yeah

56:43.400 --> 56:49.160
scary yeah be careful uh there I've seen branches fall on the path it's very very windy

56:49.720 --> 56:55.640
they can kill you I'm not saying don't walk I'm out here walking too but just be aware because

56:57.640 --> 57:05.400
it is yeah yeah but I almost got hit a moment ago by like a spear that's stuck in the ground

57:05.400 --> 57:11.400
and it was like a foot from me so be you know be aware those those cypresses they naturally

57:11.400 --> 57:21.560
drop large branches so on that side you're at risk around this side not so much yeah okay my pleasure

57:33.480 --> 57:37.400
yeah there were some gunshot branch cracks

57:42.120 --> 57:56.600
all right I keep getting distracted but thanks for bearing with me those of you who have hopefully

57:56.600 --> 58:03.160
I'll give you some uh some juicy morsels here um all right so

58:03.800 --> 58:04.300
so

58:06.200 --> 58:14.440
complex array of what I would call malware comes packaged with English and it's not

58:16.120 --> 58:18.520
actually it's not in the language

58:23.000 --> 58:26.200
per se the malware isn't necessarily in the language

58:26.840 --> 58:38.520
the malware is packaged in metaphors models of identity meaning value relation function

58:39.320 --> 58:41.320
um

58:45.560 --> 58:57.160
efficacy and basically good and evil that come from the cultural or anti-cultural right the malware

58:57.160 --> 58:59.560
traditions that

59:06.200 --> 59:14.360
influenced how we tend to utilize the language together particularly today and over say the

59:14.360 --> 59:22.920
past two three hundred years um the malware package that's attached to languages evolves

59:23.000 --> 59:28.760
over time along with the language it's not clear that the languages contain malware rather it's

59:28.760 --> 59:38.680
the suppositions underlying their deployment and particularly their deployment um beyond

59:39.400 --> 59:47.240
the personal like the person-to-person environment in the larger social and

59:47.400 --> 59:53.880
and disease riddled you know um cultural

59:56.200 --> 59:58.680
dumpster fire that is you know modernity

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:12.600
back into the gusty winds but not too dangerous here

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.840
so there's no trees likely to drop a branch on me near me

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.720
all right so

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:32.760
recently I've been listening to people like David Berlinsky and actually there's a primary

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:37.800
author whose name I can't remember but also

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:47.640
um a man whose name I'm going to mispronounce David Gilertner and if you want to find one of the

01:00:47.640 --> 01:01:04.440
things I listen to um just search on mathematics and Darwin and okay so Darwin's book was called

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:12.520
The Origin of Species it is by it is you know he was the Einstein in a sense of biology

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:25.320
in that he gave us a map that appeared to be valid and explanatory for a broad range of

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:33.480
uh observable phenomena um and doctrinally

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:48.360
it is canon to oppose it in any way is to earn broad denigration attack insult

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:55.880
and this is unfortunate because science should never be about doctrine

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:03.960
science should be about discovery and logical rational thought

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:11.320
it should not cater to biases or presuppositions in fact it shouldn't cater to anything

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:19.080
but the facts and an ever-improving description of the relationships between them that we observe

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:24.680
obviously this involves explanatory manifolds

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.760
so intuition and suppositions about identity function

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:36.920
distinction and and you know the scientific method is fundamentally dissective

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.320
so it tends to break things down into parts and then examine relationships

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.920
that by itself can be an error but um

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:57.560
nearly every biologist believes well maybe that's not true many many modern biologists believe that

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:10.040
that the book entitled the origin of species

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.960
does in fact tell us how species arose

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:25.240
and so is generally accepted as an origin of life argument tells us how we got species from

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:34.600
the origin you know organisms now it doesn't make any I don't I don't actually know the

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:42.600
book well my doubt explains about origin of life because that's still quite mysterious

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.640
even though the mechanical physicalist

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:57.960
eliminative materialist version is either soup you got a complex soup on earth that

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:06.840
eventually produced cells or you know RNA and then there's some you know leap from RNA

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:15.400
to cells and DNA and bacteria and protists and archaea and so forth

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.480
but nobody knows how you get from chemistry to life

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:31.560
there are precisely zero successful models of this

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:39.800
uh lots of people have speculations some of those speculation the belief is generally

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:47.240
and what is taught is that life is the mechanical result of the combination of chemicals

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.840
and forces on earth

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.200
um

01:04:54.520 --> 01:05:03.640
and a number of scientists who are not trying to import god into biology

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:14.280
are making the claim for intelligent design by falsifying something resembling

01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.320
Darwin's blind watchmaker claim

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:27.720
i.e okay so the one of the old proofs of the existence of god was the unimaginable complexity

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:36.440
of organisms now our human experience of that complexity and our cognition about it has changed

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.360
quite a bit over many years

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.560
particularly since Darwin and has been influenced by a bunch of doctrinal garbage

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:53.000
that really has nothing to do with it but a long time ago someone possibly bacon

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.800
argued maybe it was Francis Bacon i don't i can't remember

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:03.480
argued that the existence of organisms proves the existence of god because

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:13.480
if you were walking along a if you were walking along a path in the forest

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:18.600
and you look down and you saw for example

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:25.560
i'm going to use a sort of weird example um a colander

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.160
right

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.640
uh or a knife

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:39.080
i'm using a very simple physical object a knife you would not presume

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.800
be very unlikely for you to presume that the knife had been produced by the accidental combination

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.800
of substance and forces

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:52.040
there are certain kinds of objects

01:06:53.880 --> 01:07:00.040
that naturally to our intuition imply a mind was involved in creating them

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:11.800
and fundamentally these objects can be said and in some cases blatantly obviously do

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.160
they can be said to encode information

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.000
so for example

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:30.120
dna is a digital data storage and propagation machine if we think in those terms i don't

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:36.200
but i'll use the language common to biologists of my day they tend to think as the they think

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:41.720
they think of cells and organisms as machines which i think is hilarious i get what they mean

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:49.160
um they don't mean diesel engine they mean

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:57.720
a structured process that causes the transformation combination and distinction

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:02.040
of various substances and structures over time

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:08.440
i mean something resembling that

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:17.000
i don't think of them as machines but we'll use the language so where was i the machines

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.360
there are precise precisely zero

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.480
instances we know of

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:33.560
of where complex ordered information was produced without a mind

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.160
the biologists are presuming

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:49.880
unjustifiably that the cell is such an arrangement there is no evidence for that in fact

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.640
if we do the math these scientists argue

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:59.800
um i think one of the guys wrote a book that might be called darwin's delusion

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
and by the way what they're saying is effectively this

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:13.000
darwin got the theory right for downstream transformations of genomes mutations

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:21.720
changing parts of an animal from you know a bat wing to a bird wing or something

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:30.440
right um mutations that don't wipe out the organism and we'll get to an interesting feature

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:43.400
of that in a minute so the the scientists that are questioning this and look we don't have any

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:51.240
good arguments for origin of life panspermia is a change of arena right that's a rhetorical fallacy

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:58.600
you just move the you move the question elsewhere without supplying any useful further information

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:08.280
about it right um because you have the same problem with panspermia that you have with

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:14.040
origin of life on earth if life traveled here from elsewhere it had to begin somehow

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:20.440
and so it either began on a planet like ours or it began in an interstellar space or

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:26.840
it began somewhere maybe something we don't even understand you know again

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:35.640
the origin of life could be so profound that the concepts we presently rely on

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.880
uh

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.360
are insufficient

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:49.960
all right um though the scientists rarely argue this

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:58.840
so what they're saying so first of all we have no good explanation for the origin of life

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:07.240
many biologists believe that it's essentially a mechanical accident there's no evidence for

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:13.960
the involvement of an intelligence uh the east scientists believe that there's no evidence for

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:24.040
the accident in fact they cite mathematical analyses of for example the probability of

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:27.880
accidentally producing what

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.360
a useful protein i think is the example they gave

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:51.240
i can't recall if they were examining for you know an amino acid or what specific

01:11:51.320 --> 01:12:00.120
um biochemical element they were they were speaking of but i think what they said

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:08.600
is that the chances of producing a useful protein by accident okay the search space is

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:16.680
something like one in ten to the seventy and that's just one protein we're not talking about

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:23.720
you accidentally produced an organism um that resembles the probability of being able to locate

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:34.280
a single point particle say uh proton single proton in a search space nine like as large as

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:41.160
nine of our universe as we presently understand it the chances of you might as well call it

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:46.120
imp or linsky says if you want to say it's impossible i'm on your side if you want to say

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.160
it's improbable i'm on your side but let's be clear it's monumentally probable

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:59.640
and you know something i've argued for probably almost 20 years is that the complexity of the cell

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:06.120
radically defies anything any explanation that the humans can come up with at all

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:12.040
and this has turned out to be prophetic in that every 10 years or so

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:20.520
the complex as the complexity as the apparent complexity of the cell expands

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:30.680
for our science perhaps sometimes geometrically the possibility of explaining it recedes with every

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:38.280
expansion um and it recedes at a similar pace right it's like you thought you knew what was

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:45.000
going on you now found out there were 10 trillion variables you weren't including your chance of

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:59.080
explaining that mostly just disappears into infinity you know in my perspective uh i think our

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:09.240
physical theories are insufficient to explain biological phenomena and their origins and their

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:19.480
meanings and almost certainly their purposes which of which reproduction is not you know in the

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:37.080
physicalist lexicon that's the crucial thing to do but there's probably 900 other things they're

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:45.720
doing and there's certainly 15 of those that are nothing like what we suppose if you actually observe

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:51.480
organisms with an open mind you're going to discover something that generally defies description

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:58.840
it's not there for description for the purpose of humans describing it there's nothing to do

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:09.480
okay what the heck is this it's an artificial rock i don't understand oh i see it's a rat trap

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:18.680
wow it's a rat trap that looks like a rock wow humans are crazy

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.760
hmm i think i should visit my friend the tree

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.040
so

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:45.240
the scientists are in question here are very upset that textbook biology and the

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:58.200
the broad scale supposition of mechanical accident his origin for life a proposition for which not

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:11.640
only is there no evidence or nearly none um if we run some of the analytic math so that we come to

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:21.000
understand what the actual probabilities we we should be looking at are at this phase in our

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:33.720
understanding the math points in the direction that unless unless something really strange here

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:42.680
happened unless you hit the lottery you know unless you won the lottery 9 000 times in a row

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:51.880
like you you won almost every time you played there's no chance of producing not not never mind

01:16:51.880 --> 01:17:02.360
organisms just RNA DNA the complex protein synthesis apparatus of cells all of these things

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:10.920
or not no chance but an unimaginably almost infinitely unimaginably small chance literally

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:18.680
you know zero with a bit you know i don't know 5 000 decimal points after it and then a one

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:29.640
so uh i looked up the author um

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:38.040
although perhaps burlinski has collaborated with him stefan mire they have some essays and books

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:47.560
the deniable darwin darwin's doubt and i suspect they also make arguments that darwin himself doubted

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:53.800
that his theory was any explanation for the emergence of organisms on earth or

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.200
for the poorly defined idea of species

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:11.080
so it turns out that the origin of life arguments that are doctrinal are mostly nonsense

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:19.160
uh it's not that they're that it's entirely impossible that the emergence of life on earth

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:28.280
was a purely mechanical accident it's we have the actual problem you know minus uh the supposition

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:36.040
of god in the original argument that if you find something finely articulated and what could be

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:42.760
more finely articulated than a blue j it makes i mean just at at the level of its cells

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:54.120
its 900 magnitudes of complexity beyond any machine we've ever built a single cell

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.180
so

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.160
staggers the the computational complexity of the entire history of humans doing math

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:15.240
and it does that over the temporal space of like 10 seconds or maybe even one and we're talking

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:20.760
a single cell so you have a cell either hyper structure like a blue j or a raccoon

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:22.840
you're looking at something that

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:35.480
is pure science fiction there's no chance of something that sophisticated and agentive

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:43.800
was produced by accident at least not in any way that we can presently propose

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:56.040
is when we find in nature extremely complex objects invariably they are the produce of

01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:05.880
minds with zero known exceptions so it's it's sort of the opposite of the problem we have

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:15.880
with um sorry i'm getting battered by the weather um it's the opposite of the problem we have

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:22.520
with the technical probability of there being life on other planets technically

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:33.560
due to how statistics and probability function if you have only a single

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:44.680
example of something you have no chance of determining the probability therefore the

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:59.000
probability is stated as zero so until probabilistically according to how we use statistics and probability

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:07.240
um there is zero probability of life on other worlds because it's unknown you have no data

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:14.120
with no data you can't produce a probabilistic estimate there are other ways to estimate the

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:23.400
probability intuitively we are very unlikely to believe that in a universe as vast as ours

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:29.400
this is the only planet with life that life we would have to believe that life

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:36.440
cannot spread from solar system to solar system or that there are no mechanisms for that transfer

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:42.280
to take place because if there were especially if there were fast methods

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:55.480
um something possibly sheldrake's morphogenic fields might represent

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:05.240
a sort of layer in in the universe or in time space in which once you manage to get an organism

01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:13.080
on one world somewhere in time it's now vastly easier to get it on another one

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:22.520
um i doubt any of these scientists are fans of sheldrake meaning burlinski,

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.280
alertner and mire

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:37.800
but what i'm what i'm getting at is it could be that there are features of the everything

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:49.000
and i prefer that term or really the every one thing way all nests there are features of the

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:58.440
grand unity that we don't know anything about and could easily i think could reasonably possibly

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:06.520
set up a network between planets where information is transferred either at incredible speed or

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:15.160
instantaneously there might be forms of fields capable of doing this but this is my argument not

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:24.920
there's um what is their argument so their argument is that if you take the entire biospace

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:33.000
of organisms that we believe have ever existed on earth this includes you know bacteria viruses

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.200
the whole thing everything that number is something like 10 to the 40

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.720
if you then

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:54.040
divide the search space 10 to the 70 by the number of chances you have to produce say one useful protein

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.680
you're left with i don't know 10 to the 30 or something

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:10.760
um which is effectively no chance it means that over the history of life on earth there wasn't

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:20.120
time to accidentally assemble a useful protein uh unless something was going on that we don't

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:31.720
understand right and this inclines them to believe that that the explanation of intentional

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:43.080
terraforming or biospace was vastly vastly more probable than this was a mechanical accident

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:49.400
you got some chemistry together you got some forces together

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:59.720
out pops organisms that make unimaginably complex proteins and you know rna dna mrna

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:08.280
all of these things right uh that stuff just pops up you know on a roulette wheel right you

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:19.880
just keep spinning the wheel long enough out comes archaea so yeah wildly unlikely

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:35.160
whatever darwin showed us it wasn't how species originated a really good grasp on

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.600
certain features of of biology

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:53.080
mutation selection all this but nothing for how species arise right how do you get a different

01:25:53.080 --> 01:26:04.600
animal from a prototype we don't know and it's very unlikely to be accidental so it turns out

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:14.280
there's another problem which is something like the incredible amount of wind and rain pounding

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:22.520
into my face at the moment no i'm kidding there's another problem with where the kinds of mutations

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:29.800
that would give you a different animal from a prototype animal have to happen early in

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:39.560
blastogenesis i might have that wrong but they have to happen fairly early

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:51.720
in the process of producing an organism from oocytes right from from egg and sperm and so forth

01:26:52.520 --> 01:27:02.360
um although uh the language is more complex than what i'm when i'm presenting here i'm not

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:09.960
sure a sperm is a i think there's a different word for the sperm uh so you have to produce

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:17.160
a mutation early in the process to get a different animal and if you produce mutations early in the

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:25.400
process what you get is a dead animal like if you make any mistake early in the process

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:33.080
it's invariably fatal so if you get an early mutation

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:44.680
they said like someone said it was probably um an alert I think he said you know you have like

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:52.120
19 tails or way too many organs that don't fit inside the animal or you leave out like it doesn't

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:59.080
make blood right something fundamental goes sideways and the only way to get different animals

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:08.280
that we know of that we can imagine is mutations early in the in the process of generating the animal

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:19.240
um again those mutations tend to be fatal so you can't use mutations early in the process

01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:27.000
and late in the process later in the process doesn't produce different animals it produces

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:33.880
different traits so effectively if i understood their argument there's no space

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:41.480
in the developmental arc of an organism that we can understand

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:51.160
that would allow a mutation to produce a new animal so how do you get stuff like the Cambrian

01:28:51.160 --> 01:29:03.160
explosion it looks like on earth we have something rather than um gradual meticulous evolution of

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:14.920
animals which i think was long held to be the likely case we have sudden like pulses

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:27.240
of unexpected diversification blossoming of myriad species myriad different organisms

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:40.760
and that certainly isn't explained by anything we have no idea how you get i mean i have some

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:50.200
propositions about this i would argue that um it's probably it could be helpful very helpful

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:59.560
to look at the organisms of earth as a single organism an organism that naturally diverges from

01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:07.720
its origins or naturally enacts its original

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:21.000
uh what naturally enacts its original endowments and propensities by diversifying

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:33.320
that leaves me challenged to the same problem that any biologist be challenged with which is

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.240
explain the the mechanism that produces the diversification

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:45.560
we have no explanation so we go back to the problem of you find a wristwatch

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.840
all right you find something as complex as a wristwatch and by the way let's be very clear

01:30:51.880 --> 01:31:00.840
a cell is i don't know 10 to the 900 times more complex than a wristwatch so you find one of those

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:11.400
you know imagine i don't know imagine you're walking around on a

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:14.680
on a new planet

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:25.880
and you find what i don't even know a hyper computer the size of a pinhead

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:36.120
you discover that there's these little pinhead like crystals on the ground when you examine them

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:42.360
you determine that they're hyper computers they can warp time you can do all kinds of impossible things

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:52.040
and you decide oh the universe must just have accidentally produced these

01:31:55.880 --> 01:32:03.560
that like the possibility of accidental production of an organism is so much more remote

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.280
than the accidental production over wristwatch

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:19.160
there's no chance there's no way we could understand

01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:27.720
how such complexity could be accidentally produced in the time frame we suppose now

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:38.280
if you know it's not even clear that the universe has been around long enough to do that not not

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:46.520
clear enough to me um given our estimates of its age and presuming that what we're thinking about

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:51.720
is time is even relevant at the scale of the universe which it may not be could be totally

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:58.280
some other property that governs that and possibly most likely one we have no concept for

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:09.720
all right so what else what other problems so many problems

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:10.920
um

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:20.200
there are still people who believe and do science around the supposition

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:27.480
that it's a mechanical accident and it's reproducible we can figure out how to produce the

01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:38.280
mechanical accident in the lab and thus produce life forms from forces and substances

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:52.120
the hubris implicit in the

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:55.560
um suppositions

01:33:58.440 --> 01:33:59.720
of the materialists

01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:03.720
and those who

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.640
unjustifiably

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:19.000
presume that no intelligences were involved in the production of the intelligence with

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:29.240
which they examine the question all right it's an accidental you know it's an epiphenomenon right

01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:38.760
of the nature of time space planets and stars all right they just accidentally produce these

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:48.040
minds there's nothing mind like in them there's nothing metamind like there's nothing transcendent

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:59.000
in them and it's an entirely mechanical process unguided by anything all right it's just not

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:10.280
the only thing that guides it are in some way the forces uh which would be you know chemical

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:17.400
bonding properties chemical transformation properties gravity electromagnetism strong

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:25.400
force the league force etc etc seems unlikely to me so that's been a fascinating i never really

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:35.560
believed that to be honest um i never supposed i didn't trust the doctrines

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:47.000
i can sense dark doctrines and sort of smell the stink of them in various branches of science

01:35:47.000 --> 01:36:01.560
and philosophy and i tend to be uh i let's just say i have great antipathy for them

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.960
in my own view there are a variety of intelligences

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:16.600
i don't merely suppose that intelligences were involved in the composition of organisms i take

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:25.640
the claim much further it seems very likely to me that something beyond intelligence was involved

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:34.520
probably in the construction of time space because you have a similar problem there

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:43.880
right which is the fine-tuning problem and it's a huge problem now there is one way to

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:54.840
sort of what's the right word there's one way to account for the fine-tuning problem

01:36:54.840 --> 01:37:07.240
that's a little strange but interesting to mention it is that you have a sort of a popcorn machine

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:14.840
right but instead of producing popped kernels of corn it produces universes and most of those

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:30.440
universes are not viable the forces don't interact quote unquote properly or in such a way as to

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.680
what what is meant by viable is achieves extent in time

01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:45.640
so

01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:53.640
you keep bubbling these universes up from some universe progenitor field okay

01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:06.680
and the non viable universes mostly quickly dissolve and only the viable universes persist

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:15.640
so you will naturally if you find yourself anywhere if you find yourself at all you will find yourself

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:21.320
in a persistent universe otherwise you won't have a self to find or find with

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:29.560
and this is sometimes offered as an explanatory

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:30.920
uh

01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:37.160
unexplanatory prosthesis

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:40.120
for

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:50.760
for the strangely perfect you know the goldilocks universe

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:56.600
and the goldilocks solar system both right because you have to have both you can't have a

01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:02.760
goldilocks universe i mean you can't have a goldilocks solar system in a non goldilocks universe so

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:14.760
in this model something just keeps producing nascent universes and some of those turn out

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:19.480
to be viable and you will only have minds and bodies and organisms in those that do

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:27.800
therefore that you know sort of explains the uh the existence of the fine tuning problem

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:33.240
what was myers objection to that it was kind of brilliant i know he was using someone else's

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:48.520
objection i wonder if i can recall it i don't think i can but yeah i find this fascinating and

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:57.160
brilliant because these are serious scientists they are not theists um even though one of them

01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:04.200
might be religious maybe a couple of them are i'm not sure um but they're not attempting to

01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:11.560
import god right they're not trying to sneak god past your scientific nose they're saying look

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:18.920
the complexity we're discovering here cannot have been produced there's not enough time to have

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:30.680
produced even some of its more basic features in terms of the age of the earth now i could see

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:39.720
that someone could say produce the features off world somewhere import them to the earth and

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:44.840
then things go along fine i can imagine that line of argument but you you you may have the

01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:51.000
same problem elsewhere what's the actual lifespan of a planet presuming that that's that life only

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:56.680
occurs on planets which is something i don't presume since i don't know where life originates

01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:03.400
i i tend to be open minded and speculative about that but yeah we've got a huge problem with the

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:08.920
origin of life on earth in modern science the problem is steeped in doctrine the doctrine

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:16.920
makes no sense never made sense similar to the move to evacuate the universe of meaningful

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:22.360
intelligences right because we were we were science was so busy trying to get rid of god

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.160
that it threw everything away and just decided no it's all it's all just mechanics dude there's no

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:38.760
there's no evidence of any kind of um there's no evidence of any kind of intelligence version

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:49.480
of what we used to call the ether which probably got replaced by the the the

01:41:51.880 --> 01:42:00.120
the propensity of time space to curve around mass to become curved at at at complex structure

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.040
and now more than like there may be forces that we don't know about too right i mean i'm

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:12.120
quite sure there must be constants and forces that we haven't discovered that might naturally

01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:17.000
mechanically produce life but we can't argue for the existence of those until we have some

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:24.440
evidence of them and we can't make arguments that this the complexity we're seeing just plopped out of

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:32.200
a roulette wheel there's no real chance of that being true as far as i can see

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:39.560
so i am now home and safe and alive i am grateful for all of you who have

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:45.160
braved this long journey with me the terrifying noise of the wind in the mic

if you'd like to support my work more directly i'd be very grateful for that

01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:08.920
