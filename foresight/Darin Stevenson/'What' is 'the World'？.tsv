0	10000	Hello everybody. Welcome.
10000	24000	So grateful to have this time together while we are all still alive here on Earth.
24000	52000	A planet that I profoundly adore and deeply believe in the beingness of, you know,
52000	68000	the idea that Earth is a being is probably both very old and also not as universal as
68000	80000	we might imagine. It's hawk time here.
80000	102000	Hawkeye in the sky circling in another one or two. One in a tree being harassed by a stellar's jay in an example of an ancient symbiosis, not merely enmity.
102000	120000	Hawk is not merely the enemy of the Corvid because they inform each other's intelligences and developmental arcs, evolutionary arcs.
120000	148000	What may superficially appear to be enmity or competition, you know, is never merely the one valued delusion
148000	163000	that language and modern human culture are likely to presume, suppose, impose on our thought through various games in language and so forth.
163000	183000	In fact, all relationships and all subjects of nomenclature, all, they called, it'll come to me, all nomenada.
183000	197000	Nomenada are those things toward which language points our attention, concern, or capacity to distinguish.
197000	226000	And that English part has a lot in common with the idea of extinguishing and what gets extinguished. The unity and the infinite valued situation that we find ourselves in when considering in consciousness the identities or properties or qualities of beings,
226000	255000	circumstances and relationships. We should learn and remind each other to be extremely suspicious of any one valued kind of polemic or dialectic.
255000	277000	The idea that that is a tree and that is only a tree is ridiculous, insulting, stupidifying.
278000	287000	The woman was saying, where we're going, where we're going, you have a choice. And then she began to enumerate the different restaurants.
287000	307000	But notice how she said, I noticed, how she said, you have a choice, the singular, you have a choice. As if, you know, you either have a choice or no choice.
307000	336000	And so if you don't have no choices, you have a choice. And this is one of the common debilitating identity games that underlie English and that get imported into consciousness smuggled in when we learn English in the milieu of
337000	359000	native speakers of this language, which is not merely colonial and colonizing, yet has these qualities and histories associated with it.
359000	378000	So back to the earth as a being, you know, some indigenous, for example, some, for example, indigenous cultures do not see the earth as a being.
378000	405000	And it's not clear which cultures were aware of the idea of a planet at all, and when this idea may have arisen in any culture we may direct our attention towards.
406000	416000	It does seem a multibird goose attack.
416000	419000	The male is angry.
419000	435000	The neck is all craned over and he's ready to do the I'm going to bite you bit to the other words.
435000	445000	And this one appears to have possibly suffered some kind of a neck attack, but maybe not.
445000	457000	So, you know, we have these weird ideas and they seem entirely ordinary to us, at least since Galileo.
457000	471000	The idea that this is a solar system in a galaxy in a universe that space is mostly empty, that planets are objects, not beings.
471000	491000	When in fact, more than likely, the, not more than likely, almost certainly, the planets are not merely not inert and they are not merely beings.
492000	519000	They are, perhaps, and I think it's very likely, they are transcendental forms of which the physical aspect is the minimal component of the form, much like humans and what we think of as souls or our spirits.
519000	526000	You know, as a regular everyday human being, your body seems to be what you are. You are your body.
526000	546000	And so, you experience threats to your body as if they are threats to you, fundamentally, because you don't have an experience, maybe you don't have an experience, of being but not being your body.
546000	558000	I remember seeing a cartoon yesterday of someone sitting up in bed and the cartoon was entitled, In the Body Experience.
558000	564000	Instead of out of body, in of body experience.
565000	583000	But you know, many of us have had the experience of being outside our body, of having our perspective and perception located in space distinctly from where our body is.
583000	602000	Very common that this turns out, relatively common, that this turns out to be the upper left hand corner of the room as it might be perceived relational to our body.
602000	613000	And that upper left thing is kind of interesting, because it implies right hemispheric stuff going on.
613000	625000	Now, some people will say, particularly materialists, physicalists, especially eliminative materialists, that that's just an illusion.
625000	638000	But such people will also say that the mind with which they are forming that conclusion is illusory, not understanding that their argument undermines their argument.
638000	662000	And if your mind is merely an illusion, and if illusions are that which is not real or does not correspond to reality in some way, is not veritical, then there's no reason to impose validity on any assertion that can be made by such a mind,
662000	674000	including the assertion that the mind is illusory, or consciousness is illusory, or an epiphenomenon of brain function, or etc., etc., etc.
674000	693000	Many ridiculous arguments suffer from declarative self-inclusion, where if the argument is taken seriously, it naturally undermines itself according to the principles of set theory,
693000	708000	because by including its origin in the proclamation, i.e. minds are just an illusion, well, the thing that you're making the statement with and the thing you're interpreting the statement with,
708000	720000	not to mention the thing that causes you to believe the statement to be valid, you've just rendered all of these untrustworthy in a fundamental way.
720000	739000	So, you know, I can imagine, to go back to the Earth as a being thing, it's not clear who knew ideas about planets and stars and so forth,
739000	754000	and when some people or group or culture or cohort knew these things in terms of the developmental history of our species,
754000	776000	everyone probably had an idea of home. This is the world, quote-unquote, but that didn't necessarily mean a planet, and this is our world, the territory between these three mountains and those two rivers, for example,
776000	795000	inclusive of this, that, and the other thing, this is our home, and, you know, most of the humans thought, it seems, many of them anyway, that they were the original people,
795000	815000	so we are not a people, and the article matters here, we are the people, we are the people, and this is clear from anthropological research,
815000	834000	which is not always accurate and is often misconstrued by those researchers that compose the perspectives and write about them for, you know, academic purposes and so forth.
834000	854000	Yeah, these matters are very murky. What is a world? Did they understand planets? It seems very clear that people like the Dogon who appear to have had contact with some form of non-human intelligence were aware that there are planets and that this is a planet,
854000	880000	and there were stars, and that a particular star was the home of sky people, and they knew essentially impossible things about that star, for example, they knew, I believe, that it was a binary, which is impossible to detect without, you know,
881000	898000	really advanced mathematical knowledge and telescopes and things, they knew that the star had a planet, which is impossible to detect, I think, so there were ancient peoples who might have been aware of the idea of a planet,
898000	925000	but what it meant to them is very difficult to understand, and it seems impossible that it could have meant what we think of as a planet. In fact, it's similarly impossible that they would imagine space or space time in the abstract way we do,
926000	941000	thinking of it, for example, as a vacuum populated by a variety of celestial objects, i.e. things, right?
942000	968000	So, we'd have to go sort of people by people and time by time to gain any reasonable understanding, and even then it would be difficult, especially if there were no written records, we would only have their traditional knowledge to depend on, which in some cases is relatively reliable and a few thousand years old,
969000	980000	and in other cases is not very reliable, and in some other cases is much older, 20, you know, 10, 20 thousand years old.
980000	1005000	So, it would be very difficult to understand what they thought about stars and planets, and it's probably not true that they were animists in the senses that we think about animism.
1010000	1039000	Because for us animism is a weird thing, it's like you get rid of the qualities of being in beings and situations and circumstances and so forth, you throw that all away, and you re-add it in a sort of panpsychic gesture.
1041000	1057000	So, because we start out from the abstract and we re-add it, there would be impossible for these older peoples to have thought abstractly about beings' places.
1058000	1074000	Mountains were not necessarily gods, but in nearly no case was it possible that they weren't, they didn't have at least the status of beings, and probably the status of something we don't have a category for.
1075000	1082000	And this is the category that I use the word transcendentience to point at.
1082000	1087000	It is more than a being, it is a progenitor of beings.
1087000	1092000	Without this there is no beings, without this there are no minds.
1092000	1114000	The sun and the world clearly belong to this class, we don't really have, the only category we really have in English that points this way, that nominates the sun and the moon and the earth to such a status would be god, a god.
1114000	1119000	And so we have these weird ideas of like Gaia and stuff.
1119000	1143000	But these ideas mostly only come to us, not necessarily from ancient peoples, from modern anthropologists painting things onto perspectives they were exposed to in living with and communicating with older peoples, indigenous peoples.
1144000	1147000	And so forth.
1147000	1157000	And so it's very difficult for us moderns, especially those of us who speak English and don't speak an indigenous language.
1157000	1164000	That duck tried to eat the butterfly, that's hilarious.
1164000	1168000	I don't know why that's hilarious, I just find it hilarious.
1168000	1171000	It's not innately hilarious.
1171000	1177000	It just reminds me of certain comic strips.
1177000	1186000	So yeah, we unfortunately come, we learn about a world of things through the language that we speak.
1186000	1204000	And initially these things are deprived of beingness, of originness, of uniterity, of ultimacy, right, ultimacy.
1204000	1215000	Meaning not merely ordinary, not a thing, can't be a thing, unthingness.
1216000	1225000	Prioritized above all language concepts and so forth, ultimacy.
1225000	1244000	And uniterity meaning not a separate subject of discernment or distinguishing, but rather an instance of the entire history and future of everything.
1245000	1247000	An instance.
1247000	1267000	I think Alan Watts once said something resembling in the same way an apple tree could be said to verb, right, it apples.
1267000	1274000	Meaning the constant production and appalling of the tree.
1274000	1290000	In the same way the apple tree apples, the world persons, right, the world just produces these myriad forms of beings, including apple trees.
1290000	1306000	As an expression of its own nature, history, origin, purpose of expression, and so forth.
1306000	1308000	So what is the world?
1308000	1311000	Well, it's not a what.
1311000	1327000	One way to answer the question is, or one way to respond to the question is, without the world, izzings, izzesses, don't exist.
1327000	1329000	There are no izzings.
1329000	1343000	And izzings are being as this moment, present beingness, the doing of being by being.
1343000	1346000	Clearly the waterfowl agree with me.
1346000	1348000	I think it's very obvious.
1348000	1353000	They're like, yes, of course this is so.
1353000	1365000	But the world is the precursor to the possibility of things like beings and minds and relationships and circumstances and so forth.
1365000	1377000	And it's also the peculiar stage for what we refer to with the word consciousness, without very well understanding what that might mean or what we mean by that.
1377000	1382000	Unless we suppose, see, this is the problem.
1382000	1385000	In English, these things are additive.
1385000	1401000	It is as if when we say you are conscious, we are adding a property to a container when nothing like that is even possibly going on, except in language.
1401000	1408000	There's no chance that language is the possession of a container.
1408000	1410000	No chance.
1410000	1435000	If anything, it's the natural expression of communal origination, futurity, relation, in and as a localized exemplar of transcendent hyper-systems that produce things like
1435000	1455000	time-space, galaxy stars, black holes, white holes, quasars, pulsars, nebula, moons, the keeper belt, ice chunks, comets, meteors, all of these celestial beings.
1455000	1481000	So these are exemplars of an originary pulse that we refer to often as the primary miracle in science.
1481000	1490000	In what? Cosmology, scientific cosmology.
1490000	1498000	The miracle we call the, as if there's only one, big bang.
1498000	1504000	Which implies some kind of, you know, just got soaked.
1504000	1509000	Well, I got wet actually, not soaked.
1509000	1517000	I don't know, for those of us, uh, periodically minded, it implies that something was having it on with something else and then it blew up.
1517000	1528000	And then stars and, you know, time-space and all that, uh, comes out of the exgasm.
1528000	1533000	Yeah, that's the Give Me One Miracle branch of cosmology.
1533000	1539000	Give me one miracle and I'll explain everything else.
1539000	1544000	The thing about science though is that it's not fundamentally explanatory.
1544000	1549000	It's fundamentally utilitarian for most human purposes.
1549000	1552000	There are exceptions.
1552000	1566000	And by utilitarian, I mean it forges theories, puts those theories in combat against each other in a kind of rock, paper, scissors thing.
1566000	1578000	And then the ones that win propagate and then we make machines to both test and implement physical observations.
1578000	1585000	And, uh, mostly, like, physics is a lot about prediction, right?
1585000	1592000	What happens next, given x, y, and z, um, and some other variables?
1592000	1597000	What do they tell me how the system will evolve?
1597000	1602000	And the better your story about how it evolves, the more accurate we presume the theory to be.
1602000	1607000	Um, but I'm not really here to talk about that.
1607000	1609000	So what is the world?
1609000	1623000	Well, again, the question is kind of ridiculous because without the world there are no questions, right?
1623000	1633000	So one of the things that is around here and for us is the moment-to-moment origin of the possibility of purposeful thought relation,
1633000	1639000	conception, nomenclature, theories, and so forth.
1639000	1649000	You can see that it doesn't fit inside the category tree because the category tree doesn't exist without it.
1649000	1651000	It's very similar with the sun.
1651000	1655000	Let's take that thing away, poof, right?
1655000	1665000	All human thought history experience, religion, math, science, art, insanity, war, everything, gone.
1665000	1668000	Poof, gone. Meaningless.
1668000	1684000	So, um, obviously the sun must be held in an extremely specialized, uh, perspective, categorically,
1684000	1691000	where it's an exemplar of supercategory, beyond categories.
1691000	1694000	Because without it you don't get minds.
1694000	1701000	Without minds, categories don't matter anymore.
1701000	1712000	So this is why I think stars and planets and moons and things are transcendental.
1712000	1730000	And I tend to, um, concern myself somewhat with what that means and how to better understand it, even conceptually.
1730000	1752000	But the, the idea for me is that the idea that I usually play with here, I can play with others, is that one must preserve much like Gidellian incompleteness in mathematical systems.
1752000	1754000	Ha!
1754000	1757000	I just got wet again.
1757000	1776000	One must preserve the super, super categorical character, necessity, of transcendentals, that by their existence create the possibility of thought.
1776000	1783000	We mustn't subsume those into the conceptual systems in an ordinary fashion.
1783000	1794000	Uh, especially if we are concerned about the verity of our rationales.
1794000	1811000	Um, rational meaning to make parts of, uh, to both distinguish and connect, to denote and connotate these distinguishings and connections.
1811000	1816000	Of course the connotation thing is more like dreaming than logic.
1816000	1821000	The denotation thing is more like logic than dreaming.
1822000	1834000	So, for me, also what I wanted to say is that for some indigenous peoples, um, the sun and the earth were well known to be beings.
1834000	1846000	For example, I suspect this is what my friend, Ryan Firstdiver, uh, who I strongly recommend you look up his YouTube channel.
1846000	1848000	Um, brilliant.
1848000	1852000	One of the last remaining Blackfoot Beaver men.
1852000	1855000	Um, one of my closest friends.
1855000	1860000	And, uh, one of my favorite teachers.
1860000	1867000	By the way, don't be fooled by Ryan's external cultural costume.
1867000	1875000	Um, you know, he may listen to rap music and, uh,
1875000	1883000	scrap with, uh, the superficial culture and its icons and so forth.
1883000	1893000	Inside that human being is a profoundly deep, uh, intelligence, a brilliant writer.
1893000	1899000	Um, one of the most heartful people I've ever known.
1899000	1905000	Again, looks tough on the outside, soft as soft can be in his heart.
1905000	1916000	Loves the animals, the living places, honors the old agreements to the best of his ability, rescues the animals from the humans.
1916000	1922000	Um, very much a heroic being in my view.
1922000	1939000	Ryan, I think would say that although the sun and the moon are understood in Blackfoot traditional culture as sky persons or something like this, persons of the sky.
1939000	1950000	Um, as are the Morning Star and the Companion Star, the False Morning Star, which is what we call Jupiter.
1950000	1958000	Uh, though those are sky people and they were here once.
1958000	1969000	They've been, they've come down to the earth and they still come down to the earth to visit and communicate and transact with humans who get their attention.
1969000	1977000	Um, and there are various ways to acquire their attention, which is also a fairly dangerous thing, you know, project to undertake.
1977000	1982000	But although they are the sky people, the earth is like the Hogan, right?
1982000	1991000	Or the, not necessarily the teepee, but like the communal home of the sun and the moon.
1991000	2003000	Um, where perhaps, this is my own edition, don't quote me on this, uh, their children live, perhaps.
2003000	2011000	Um, and there are old stories where they were here together on the earth.
2011000	2022000	They had children, um, I believe seven particularly, which would be hard to not imagine corresponds to the planets.
2023000	2030000	Um, all of those beings lived here in the traditional story.
2030000	2037000	Um, the moon, uh, is, takes a lover.
2037000	2049000	The sun becomes incensed, haha, what a pun, at this because the sun can smell, can smell the lover around the house.
2049000	2061000	And then there's a huge fight, the moon goes insane and becomes a sort of like a banshee like monster that is chasing them.
2061000	2075000	And the sun gives each of the children a pouch in which there is a power of protection and the sun, I mean, the moon hunts them.
2075000	2080000	This is a very abbreviated version of the story.
2080000	2100000	Uh, eventually there's a sort of day-in-a-maw, I think, a climax where the sun, or one of the children, I can't remember, cuts off one of the moon's legs.
2100000	2115000	And the moon bleeds, and then the moon goes up into the sky, and this is a explanatory figure,
2115000	2129000	or ceremonial, you know, traditional story figure that explains the moon's, um, cycling, right?
2129000	2140000	Uh, what's going on is that the leg is being cut off and then regrown, uh, over the lunar cycle.
2141000	2144000	Then of course they all go back up into the sky.
2144000	2152000	Now, the thing that is clear is that those planets are not objects, and the moon is not an object.
2152000	2156000	It's unclear what category they belong to.
2156000	2168000	It isn't gods, but it's certainly both inclusive of humanity and transcendental to it at the same time.
2169000	2187000	As I understand from Ryan, the Blackfoot people generally, traditionally, do not believe in the idea of the transmigration of souls or the existence of souls.
2187000	2195000	Um, there is sort of such a thing as a ghost, in a way, but it's not the same concept.
2195000	2206000	In fact, the whole foundation of categories and concepts in Blackfoot is fundamentally different,
2206000	2224000	and one might even say, in a sense, not translatable to the western, uh, templates of identity, um, abstraction, function, role, circumstance, situation,
2224000	2226000	relationship, and so forth.
2226000	2235000	For one thing, uh, it seems to me from what I've learned that, and I'm happy to be corrected about any of this, by the way,
2235000	2238000	I'm not an expert on any of these matters.
2238000	2240000	I've just been lucky enough.
2240000	2243000	I'm like a kid who got some mud splashed on him, right?
2243000	2246000	And I'm like, oh, this mud is very interesting, right?
2246000	2248000	But I don't really know.
2248000	2252000	I didn't grow up in the mud, um, so to speak.
2253000	2261000	Uh, but, you know, like, identity is rarely explicit, uh, in Blackfoot traditional culture,
2261000	2274000	because we don't know moment to moment whether the appearance of someone or something is the most important feature to attend.
2274000	2281000	So, I may see someone coming from far off, ah, there is a being, I might say.
2281000	2288000	As they get closer, I may see certain signs that they belong to a specific people or place.
2288000	2297000	Ah, they are a, uh, a blood tribe man appearing on a horse, appearing, right?
2297000	2301000	But that's not necessarily that I know it's a blood tribe man.
2301000	2307000	All I know is that there are signs that it's a blood tribe man,
2307000	2312000	because that could be the sun, that could be anyone.
2312000	2321000	It depends sort of on who they come from, like, who is being represented by the being who is coming.
2321000	2328000	And as they approach closer and closer, there are different linguistic forms to treat with the situation.
2328000	2336000	As we get closer to something resembling, uh, denotative identity.
2336000	2350000	Ah, this is indeed, you know, uh, the man whose indigenous name is thus and such,
2350000	2353000	or the woman whose indigenous name is thus and such.
2353000	2361000	It is indeed that she represents, you know, her people and her tribe and herself.
2361000	2364000	But it's possible for there to be lots of other outcomes.
2364000	2369000	And this is something that in English is not understood.
2369000	2373000	When we see Joe, we think, oh, that's Joe, end of story.
2373000	2379000	Which really almost can't be true, because there are so many phase states of Joe,
2379000	2388000	and so many purposes for which Joe might be here, or not here, or arriving, or departing,
2388000	2394000	or all of these things that we don't pay much attention to in terms of identity in English.
2394000	2403000	And we should, because they are crucial features of understanding role, identity, relationship, origin, future,
2403000	2412000	futureity, ultimacy, all of these things, right?
2412000	2420000	You know, I heard a story, uh, that was claimed, and you know, once again, it's not my,
2420000	2424000	it's not my goal here to say, oh, this is a true story, or this is not a true story.
2424000	2431000	What I am saying here is that in the sense of theoria, a useful story, a useful perspective,
2431000	2434000	this perspective is useful.
2434000	2440000	I heard a story where a man claimed to have been working at a secret government installation.
2440000	2443000	He had disguised his voice to tell this story.
2443000	2448000	I have also heard that this story was somehow debunked.
2448000	2453000	I don't care. I don't care, because I'm not trying to tell the truth.
2453000	2459000	I'm trying to illumine a perspective that I think is important and useful.
2459000	2468000	So in this story, um, it was claimed that each of the planets that we know of,
2468000	2475000	that we exist in a specific layer of a multi-layered reality.
2475000	2483000	And in our layer, the earth, is the primarily inhabited planet,
2483000	2487000	the, um, biorelational hyperstructure in the solar system.
2487000	2495000	Um, it was not clear whether the other planets presently have life or not,
2495000	2504000	but it was claimed that in other, there's a layer in which every planet in the solar system is inhabited.
2504000	2509000	Uh, and from this one, it looks like earth is the only one.
2509000	2513000	There are layers in which the earth is not inhabited, and the other planet,
2513000	2517000	another planet is inhabited, or another couple of planets are inhabited.
2517000	2524000	Um, and not necessarily by life as we suppose it must exist.
2524000	2530000	And this is a very interesting story, because I had been shown something similar to this.
2530000	2538000	A perspective in which what looks like craters on worlds in this layer
2538000	2542000	are actually cities in other layers.
2542000	2546000	Now this is very science fiction-y, and I'm not trying to claim it's true.
2546000	2551000	I'm claiming that it's a useful perspective to entertain in consciousness.
2551000	2555000	Um, why is it useful?
2555000	2565000	Well, it draws into question the strange, unjustifiable certainties
2565000	2569000	that we are, that are imposed upon us.
2569000	2572000	Uh, oh, that's really interesting.
2572000	2579000	I was wondering what is underneath these radish plants,
2579000	2586000	and what is underneath them are roots, not radishes.
2586000	2593000	Um, you know, think about the difference between,
2593000	2598000	think that you don't, you haven't seen people gardening or growing food, right?
2598000	2603000	And you come across some plants,
2603000	2606000	and you look at the surface of the plants,
2606000	2615000	and you see the leaves and the, you know, the stems and things.
2615000	2620000	And you think, well, that doesn't look edible.
2620000	2622000	You're probably right.
2622000	2625000	It's not particularly edible and or nutritious.
2626000	2633000	But then, under the ground, where you are not looking yet,
2633000	2637000	there are radishes and potatoes and carrot symptoms.
2650000	2653000	And it is similar in reality, right?
2653000	2659000	The superficial appearances and the expectations imposed on us in English
2659000	2663000	are not indicative of the character of nature or origin or reality,
2663000	2665000	whatever reality might mean.
2665000	2672000	And that also presumes that, you know, I am disinclined personally
2672000	2676000	to believe that observation causes wave collapse
2676000	2680000	and other seemingly ridiculous to me stories.
2680000	2684000	I just don't believe it.
2684000	2686000	I think something's going on,
2686000	2689000	and something probably very fascinating is going on,
2689000	2691000	but it isn't that.
2691000	2695000	I certainly also don't believe that if I turn away from a tree
2695000	2700000	and I'm not observing it directly, it's not there.
2700000	2704000	No, there's no chance that that's going on, as far as I'm concerned.
2704000	2708000	I'm willing to entertain the idea in discussion and so forth, of course.
2708000	2712000	But do I think it's a reasonable or rational idea?
2712000	2714000	Hell, no!
2714000	2716000	I have friends that think,
2716000	2719000	when you stop looking at things, they're not there anymore.
2719000	2721000	Well, that's kind of a problem,
2721000	2724000	because that would mean that you're a highly privileged observer.
2724000	2728000	It would mean that your cells aren't observers,
2728000	2730000	simply because they don't have eyes.
2730000	2737000	So your cells can't tell that the oven behind you is now missing from reality.
2737000	2742000	And none of the insects or other animals or plants qualify as observers.
2742000	2746000	This is the problem I have with, like, if a tree falls in the forest,
2746000	2749000	there's no one there to hear it, it doesn't make sound.
2749000	2754000	Forest is filled with living beings.
2754000	2758000	Maybe the human concept of sound,
2758000	2760000	if there's no humans there,
2760000	2763000	it's unreasonable to say that
2763000	2771000	the human concept of sound pertains to what then occurs.
2771000	2775000	But forest is filled with living beings,
2775000	2778000	and I'm pretty sure they experience vibrations in the air,
2778000	2782000	and many of them have actual ears,
2782000	2786000	and all of them have cells that can detect vibration,
2786000	2790000	and some of them have specialized structures, like antennae and things like this,
2790000	2794000	that can detect all kinds of things, probably.
2794000	2799000	So the idea that the human is the ultimately privileged observer
2799000	2802000	that causes wave collapse is fucking insane.
2802000	2804000	I just don't believe it.
2804000	2808000	And, you know, convince me, right?
2808000	2812000	If you want to have an argument about this,
2812000	2818000	my one friend, Sebastian, I know, wants to argue about this with me.
2818000	2823000	By all means, let's have an argument and we'll debate the problem.
2823000	2827000	I think, again, you have the same problem as you have with statements
2827000	2832000	that encompass their own origin here.
2832000	2836000	There's some kind of a recursion problem in this argument
2836000	2843000	that I can find, but I need someone to make a relatively clear claim
2843000	2846000	that I can then refute first.
2846000	2849000	I could do it myself, but that would be tedious
2849000	2857000	and reminiscent of onanism, intellectual onanism.
2857000	2860000	So what are the planets? What is time space?
2860000	2863000	Well, almost all the...
2863000	2869000	I mean, this is a question that I've been in love with for a long, long time.
2869000	2873000	When ancient people looked at the sky, what did they experience?
2873000	2878000	What did they think that was, if they thought it was something?
2878000	2884000	And, you know, I would argue that probably they were far less conceptual than we are.
2884000	2889000	So it's not like they're trying to think, what is that?
2889000	2891000	That's very conceptual.
2891000	2897000	Rather, they're probably having an experience more like diving into water,
2897000	2903000	where suddenly when you look up at the night sky, the universe changes.
2903000	2907000	You change, everything changes,
2907000	2917000	and you are aware in a participatory sense of the nature of the sky,
2917000	2932000	of its status as ultimate progen...
2932000	2934000	I can't make this word.
2934000	2936000	I can't make this tense of the word.
2936000	2940000	Progenerative, right?
2940000	2946000	It is that from which all things derive their being.
2946000	2951000	Parental or hyperparental.
2951000	2954000	Filial. This is my family.
2954000	2956000	And these are not thoughts.
2956000	2962000	They are experienced viscerally, emotionally, cognitively,
2962000	2968000	in a way not dissimilar to what happens when we dream, right?
2968000	2971000	The one thing you're not really doing much of when you're dreaming,
2971000	2975000	otherwise you're either going to wake up or become lucid, is thinking.
2975000	2980000	You're experiencing the relationships, the situations, the exchanges,
2980000	2982000	and so forth, the transformations.
2982000	2984000	You're not thinking about them.
2984000	2986000	If you start thinking about them, you're going to wake up.
2986000	2990000	And if you think about them very gently, you will then realize you are dreaming.
2990000	2998000	As I did the other night when I found myself in my dad's father's garage,
2999000	3006000	and I knew that this was impossible because the house has been sold,
3006000	3011000	and those objects that I were seeing had all been disposed of,
3011000	3016000	I knew like, okay, right now I'm seeing something that it can't be true.
3016000	3017000	It can't be there.
3017000	3023000	I'm definitely not seeing where I am, right?
3024000	3030000	And so what I suspect very strongly, and I think that this experience
3030000	3033000	is directly accessible to us,
3033000	3037000	is that when the ancients looked at the sky,
3037000	3042000	it was a bit like diving into the water of originary transcendentians.
3042000	3044000	And this is why they revered it.
3044000	3047000	I live in two-nose hotels, a warm cafe.
3047000	3048000	He knows everywhere.
3049000	3058000	I love it when I see, I mean, I guess I just love being itself,
3058000	3064000	but I love the animated, when I see animated enthusiastic conversation
3064000	3067000	among human companions.
3067000	3071000	So yeah, I think when they looked up, they left the world.
3071000	3077000	They had a participatory experience of a transcendental kind of a living water.
3078000	3083000	And it wasn't an accident that they likened the sky to an ocean.
3083000	3085000	That wasn't superstition.
3085000	3086000	It's true.
3086000	3092000	If you just go upscale one scale, like one ladder rung from the world,
3092000	3094000	the sky is transcendental.
3094000	3096000	It is like water.
3096000	3098000	It's filled with islands.
3098000	3101000	There are stars.
3101000	3104000	There are planets.
3104000	3109000	But you don't have to know anything abstract at all.
3109000	3111000	You don't have to know those are stars and planets.
3111000	3113000	You don't need any of that.
3113000	3116000	You can actually just dive into the water.
3116000	3119000	And I've had experiences that border on this when I was very young
3119000	3124000	and I looked up at the sky before I had been trained to think abstractly
3124000	3132000	about what up means, what is up, what the sky is, what space is,
3132000	3138000	what planets and stars are, what celestial phenomena are.
3143000	3149000	I'm watching a turtle swimming in a pond with some carp
3149000	3154000	that they're all sunning themselves in the heat of the day.
3155000	3163000	And I strongly suspect that space time is much more like this lake
3163000	3168000	than a void populated with objects.
3168000	3178000	It is a transcendental medium populated with transcendental phenomena.
3178000	3183000	And in case you don't believe me, just take a look at the photographs of that stuff.
3183000	3188000	Take a look at Jupiter. Does that look like an ordinary thing to you?
3188000	3194000	Take a look at the star birth nebula or the crab nebula or the butterfly nebula
3194000	3196000	or a quasar or a pulsar.
3196000	3200000	You think those are ordinary material phenomena?
3200000	3203000	Really? Where did you get that idea?
3203000	3209000	Because they sure don't look that way to me and neither does the moon nor the sun.
3210000	3220000	I admit that the moon looks desert-like and bereft of what we would think of
3220000	3223000	as vitalistic phenomena.
3223000	3230000	It kind of looks like, what it actually reminds me of is something like
3230000	3238000	the idea of the extremely elder, brilliant, rich crone.
3238000	3244000	But I definitely do think of the moon as feminine and the sun as masculine.
3244000	3247000	I'm capable of inverting those perspectives.
3247000	3254000	And I know that there are cohorts of moderns who would want to take me to task
3254000	3258000	for thinking that there's anything like binary gender.
3258000	3261000	Be my guest. Let's have at it.
3261000	3264000	I'm going to stay on the side of binary gender.
3264000	3267000	And beyond that, again, this isn't one thing mined
3267000	3271000	because I don't think there's merely binary gender.
3271000	3277000	I just think that conceptually, symbolically, and metaphysically,
3277000	3281000	the concept of binary gender is crucially important
3281000	3288000	and not to be disposed of for political or ideological purposes.
3288000	3293000	Expanded? Sure.
3293000	3299000	Possibly even contradicted for specific purposes.
3299000	3309000	But, yeah, I want, in my cosmology, binary gender is actual.
3309000	3315000	It's not the only game in town, but it's real enough.
3315000	3318000	And again, you know, in...
3327000	3335000	Alright, somebody's counting and it's fucking up my mind.
3335000	3337000	We can have a number of different templates,
3337000	3342000	but I'm not going to dispose of the one that seems to me foundational.
3342000	3347000	And in Blackfoot, I would be surprised
3347000	3353000	if the concept of gender is merely binary.
3353000	3359000	I did have some discussions with Ryan about this a long time ago.
3359000	3364000	I think there's an essay on my medium page regarding this.
3365000	3373000	But it's not my goal to explore that particular topic here.
3373000	3381000	Rather, I'm trying to say something about the character...
3381000	3395000	My experience of the character and influence and profundity,
3395000	3401000	and perhaps even fissundity of the moon,
3401000	3405000	which I do think of as feminine, and I also think of the Earth as feminine.
3405000	3408000	You know, if you ask me, like, well, why would you do that?
3408000	3412000	Because the Earth appears to generate children.
3412000	3420000	And in my private cosmology, which I'm not trying to convince anyone of,
3420000	3427000	I'm not asking anyone else to believe or think the same way I do about these topics.
3427000	3436000	If it's useful, entertain it. If it's not, do as you will.
3436000	3442000	So the Earth is sort of, in my weird cosmology,
3442000	3458000	an ever-virginal mother that generates infinite kinds of children
3458000	3463000	by the magical fertilization of the sun and time space.
3463000	3471000	So it lives in a kind of ocean, floats in the ocean, like a big bathtub,
3471000	3477000	orbited by the moon, who is sort of a fairy godmother in this cosmology,
3477000	3482000	and we can have more than one.
3482000	3490000	Fertilized by the rays of light originating in the sun,
3490000	3494000	which actually probably originates somewhere else than the sun,
3494000	3516000	and the sun is an expression of this property or potential of originary and fertilizing power.
3516000	3523000	Again, I'm not asking anyone to adopt my cosmology,
3523000	3532000	but this is how I usually prefer to think unless I am entertaining
3532000	3541000	another perspective for purposes of conversation or exploration.
3541000	3546000	And look, I didn't invent this cosmology.
3546000	3550000	This is a cosmology that was transmitted to me,
3550000	3558000	and this is the reason why I find it compelling,
3558000	3563000	because it wasn't invented by humans.
3563000	3569000	It's a knowledge way that comes from non-humans.
3569000	3577000	And it wasn't explicitly delineated in the way language makes it sound.
3577000	3590000	Rather, it was suggested as a useful perspective to entertain.
3590000	3593000	So is the earth a thing?
3593000	3598000	Well, in language, okay, you know, you can think of it that way,
3598000	3602000	it's going to be unfortunate, the repercussions that will happen if you believe that,
3602000	3606000	that it's just an object.
3606000	3614000	But, yeah, in English language, sure.
3614000	3626000	As you approach the direction of conceptual correspondence with the real, the beautiful, or the true,
3626000	3633000	it quickly becomes impossible that the earth is a thing.
3633000	3637000	It becomes quickly impossible that the earth is not at least a being,
3637000	3640000	and probably something transcendental to beings,
3640000	3644000	that produces beings perhaps as a kind of side effect
3644000	3649000	of its nature, identity, relations, and activity
3649000	3654000	in a multi-layered universe that's quite different
3654000	3661000	from our relatively mechanistic suppositions about time and space.
3661000	3673000	Because in the actual universe, everything is more than merely alive.
3673000	3678000	And we don't have, if there's a concept in English for more than merely alive,
3678000	3680000	I'd love to know what that is.
3680000	3684000	The only word I can easily locate in my vocabulary is transcendental,
3684000	3688000	but that doesn't tell you that it's more than merely alive.
3688000	3692000	And you can say the word spiritual, this just leads to a bunch of confusion,
3692000	3702000	because there's this kind of weird property dualism that arises in the,
3702000	3712000	in the sequelae of supposing that there are spirits or souls.
3712000	3716000	And whatever's actually going on doesn't seem property dualistic to me.
3716000	3723000	I can't say what it does seem, primarily because our fucking catalog of categories
3723000	3732000	is missing fundamentally crucial position like tags.
3732000	3739000	For example, a tag that means more than merely alive,
3740000	3746000	pro-generative of beings' life and minds,
3746000	3755000	actively holy, or actively divine,
3755000	3758000	originary.
3758000	3761000	We need, we need some placeholders for these kinds of things,
3761000	3765000	these kinds of qualities, characteristics.
3765000	3773000	But even the idea of characteristics, even the idea of language and its nominata
3773000	3776000	already inclines us to error,
3776000	3783000	because the transcendental is beyond abstract reference.
3783000	3787000	That's the problem, you know.
3787000	3795000	If we had a category that implied to us that it was beyond,
3795000	3799000	that the reference in this category are beyond abstract reference,
3799000	3801000	you can see that there's already a problem,
3801000	3804000	because now we're going to refer to them abstractly in language.
3804000	3808000	We think we can encompass them if we just make the right shape of category.
3808000	3810000	Well, what if it's not true?
3810000	3813000	What if there's some things that language just fails to point toward,
3813000	3816000	or misleads us when it does?
3816000	3820000	What if the goal isn't to refer to things,
3820000	3832000	but to actually reacquire the direct experience of original participation,
3832000	3839000	in the sense that Owen Barfield may have meant it,
3839000	3845000	and in the sense that I was implying when I talked about what I strongly suspect happened
3845000	3852000	to ancient peoples when they looked at the sky, or a mountain, or a lake.
3852000	3856000	They didn't see things.
3856000	3863000	They immediately felt the transformation of their consciousness
3863000	3873000	in a transcendental way that lifted them above their mere humanity
3873000	3881000	into direct filial, memorial, and visceral participation.
3881000	3885000	The same way as when you jump into a lake of water,
3885000	3889000	or you slide down an ice sheaf,
3889000	3901000	or you bungee jump into a crevasse.
3901000	3906000	This kind of thing.
3906000	3908000	It is impossible.
3908000	3922000	You can make face noises about the flavors of food.
3922000	3925000	Will you be able to taste the face noises?
3925000	3927000	No.
3927000	3933000	There might be unusual humans who have forms of sensorial memory,
3933000	3940000	or if I suggest the word strawberry, they begin to taste it,
3940000	3946000	as if the memory of strawberry is in their mouth or something.
3946000	3948000	But not me.
3948000	3950000	You can talk about apples all you like.
3950000	3953000	I will not be able to taste the flavor of apples.
3953000	3965000	Can I be hypnotized or entranced to think I am tasting apples?
3965000	3967000	Possibly.
3967000	3969000	Will I actually taste them?
3969000	3977000	It seems wildly unlikely to me.
3977000	3981000	So I suspect that when the ancients looked up at the sky,
3981000	3984000	and I have reason to suspect this, not just from thought,
3984000	3988000	not just theorizing, but from my own direct experience,
3988000	3991000	when they looked at the sky,
3991000	3998000	it was like diving into an immediate relationship
3998000	4004000	with the spirit of time-space, origin.
4004000	4008000	And so they did not so much have superstitions.
4008000	4013000	Their religions were not superstitious.
4013000	4018000	What their religions were doing, the Egyptians and the Aztecs
4018000	4022000	and people who came before them,
4022000	4031000	what they were doing is they were making images
4031000	4038000	of beings and situations they directly knew participatorially
4038000	4042000	in their relationships with the world,
4042000	4049000	the sky, origin, the sun, the moon, the planets.
4049000	4057000	Much as a solo diver, for example,
4057000	4064000	might represent dolphins, whales, octopuses, coral reefs,
4064000	4073000	shellfish, crayfish, lobsters, clams, shrimp, cuttlefish, squid,
4073000	4078000	fishes of every kind, sea anemones, sea urchins.
4078000	4082000	When we look at the effusive,
4082000	4088000	what we think of as symbolism of the Egyptians,
4088000	4091000	rather than thinking, oh, they were very inventive,
4091000	4095000	we should think perhaps they're actually telling us something
4095000	4101000	about their direct experience of the features of character
4101000	4104000	and relation they directly encountered
4104000	4110000	in exploring time-space by diving into it, participatorially,
4110000	4113000	just as if they could rise up off the earth,
4113000	4116000	just as if they could fall into the sky.
4116000	4121000	They could dive into the sky the same way we dive into the ocean.
4121000	4126000	And they didn't need spaceships because they had something better.
4126000	4129000	I mean, spaceships really suck.
4129000	4137000	If you've got to have those, time-space is terrible for that.
4137000	4139000	They had something better.
4139000	4145000	They had what I would call a traveling body, which I believe we all have.
4145000	4150000	We're just trained not to think so and not to believe in it and so forth.
4150000	4154000	And I think the traveling body was naturally awakened in them
4154000	4156000	when they gazed skyward.
4156000	4159000	And so then, from that perspective,
4159000	4162000	they may have understood that earth was a planet,
4162000	4177000	having looked back upon it from a disembodied traveling perspective
4177000	4180000	of a far above the earth.
4180000	4184000	So I suspect that humans had seen the earth from space
4184000	4193000	long before the American astronauts or the Soviet astronauts went up there.
4193000	4199000	And these are some of my thoughts on what is the earth
4199000	4204000	and many related ideas.
4204000	4211000	Again, I'm so grateful
4211000	4217000	for our time together today and the fact that we're all still alive
4217000	4225000	and can attempt meaningful anemnesis about what it means to be human,
4225000	4232000	to be alive, to participate in physical reality,
4232000	4245000	and to think in new and hopefully liberating ways that result in education
4245000	4248000	rather than merely education.
4248000	4250000	Thank you for joining me.
4250000	4256000	I look forward to learning together again very soon.
4256000	4258000	Bye-bye for now.
4258000	4260000	May your way be beautiful.
