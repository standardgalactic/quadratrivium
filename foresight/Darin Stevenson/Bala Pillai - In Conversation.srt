1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Testing.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yep.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ah, yes.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
do me the favor

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
of

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
saying your name

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so that I don't mispronounce it.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yep.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Balapile.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Balapile.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, and I am Darren Stevenson,

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
so we are here in a conversation together

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that I wanted to record.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Because it was becoming,

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
as I expected,

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
it too very interesting.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Balah had been discussing

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
something

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
in

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
ideas

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
from a specific

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
person

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
whose name you can say.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Actually, maybe you can just go over

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
briefly.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, I'll do that.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What I was talking about is

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the notion of

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
network state.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
As in any T, W, R, K

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
second word state, S, T, A,

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
T, E, network state.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Um,

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
chat called Balaji Srimivasan,

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
quite a

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
personality, known personality online.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Um, used to be CTO

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
of Coinbase.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But,

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you know, it's not just a crypto guy,

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
it's no crypto, very well read,

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
you know, history, background,

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
people.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You could summarize him as a pro-anarchy guy,

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
right, who doesn't take

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
limits of, um,

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
government and all that as limits.

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So,

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
his,

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
what the network state means is,

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
right,

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you can form

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
enough of the ethos,

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and the common

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
wealth

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
of a group of people

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
online,

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and then later,

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
right, enough of the cohorts

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
can, you know,

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
could have agreed

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to where they want to stay,

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and live in a place where they,

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
uh,

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
where they get along.

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Where they're physically approximate

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
so that they can collaborate

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
in each other's

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
life development.

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yep.

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Right, so that,

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
um, this is much more,

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
it's not impossible to do at a distance.

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yep.

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But it's much more difficult.

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Absolutely.

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, there are more challenges.

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Um, yeah, it's just,

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
it's a different space of

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
challenge for

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
those who are not proximal.

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Um,

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
but you said something

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that I thought was hilarious.

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You were like,

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm brilliant.

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Go ahead, you were talking about somebody

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
buying a house.

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay, the background word is this, right?

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I've gone through all those states.

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What do I mean by all those states?

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You know,

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
living,

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
grew up in a semi-rural village,

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you know, where everybody

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
knew everybody and,

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you know, it's a tropical place

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
so that you're never worried about

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
money because it seemed like,

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
why do you, you know,

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
food was available all over the place

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and you could go and sleep in anybody's house.

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So what's your problem?

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You know, right?

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That was, um, and then,

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
but my parents

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
have moved from India

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
to Malaysia,

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
right?

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
My father had gone through the struggles

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
in India and in some,

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
in Malaysia, he was continuing

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
in Malaysia

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and he was driven

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to have,

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
to have lots more money under the pillow,

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
right?

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And on that, later,

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
he was just full on into like,

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
being a stingy guy

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
who saves and saves and saves

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and for good reason because of his

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
background, right?

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Right, his history, yeah.

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
After that, and the British rule

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
in India, right?

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
His tough times, right?

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Uh, there were tough times. So in Malaysia

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
it's easier but he didn't realize it

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
that easier. So he,

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
he went on a spree of, um,

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
ah, so what he would do

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
is buy one property upon property

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
upon property and including

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
our house itself,

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
what we call,

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the house, the family house,

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
his only concern was

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
to replace, you know, if you buy this house,

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
ah, what's the replacement value?

143
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If I were to sell it, how much money would I get,

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you know? Um,

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
he didn't care about much

146
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
anything else and then

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
me, right,

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
ah, has to pay for that

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
because it has completely broken up

150
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the family.

151
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
As compared to,

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
you know, now my adopted village,

153
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Darren, is a village

154
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
in Indonesia, in Java.

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a zero crime village

156
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
similar to the kind of village

157
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
my father was born in, right?

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Uh, they didn't live there

159
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
on age 18

160
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and there,

161
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the values

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
fit with the village, the people

163
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
despite the rest of the world not

164
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
wanting to have anything to do with zero crime

165
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
villagers because it's got

166
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
consequences, right?

167
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's got consequences.

168
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
For example, people won't

169
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
be fronting wealth because they won't

170
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
be much wealth, it'll be culturally

171
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
communist, right?

172
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes, yes.

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But you will not worry about old age

174
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and children being taken care of because

175
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the people love to take care

176
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
of other people.

177
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, they are living in a

178
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
traditional

179
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
a traditional context

180
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
where

181
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
everyone takes care, not

182
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
not every single person,

183
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
most of the people take care

184
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
of each other

185
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and they understand

186
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
so this changes their role

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
as a human being,

188
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
right? Transforms

189
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
their role as a human being

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
from I am here for me

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and mine

192
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
or just I am here for me

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
to we are here together

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
for each other.

195
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah.

196
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If you don't have that,

197
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I will argue, if you don't have

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
we are here together for each other

199
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
you don't have humans yet.

200
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You have something

201
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
weird. It's not human.

202
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's it.

203
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And I want to

204
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
stamp it even further.

205
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, by all means.

206
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I mean

207
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I've grown up in like

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
fighting a lot of people,

209
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
probably

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
post

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you know, post university

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
even in university it didn't

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
occur to me.

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Maybe particularly from the 90s onwards

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
okay, basically

216
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm into unconditional love

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
that

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm with again and again.

219
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Bala, why are you being...

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The thing that I find hilarious about what you said

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
is that

222
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
linguistically it's backwards.

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's not that you're into unconditional love,

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
it's that you didn't

225
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
defect from it.

226
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Right?

227
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's the natural position

228
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
for human beings.

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You simply didn't defect

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
in my view, but please continue.

231
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm with you.

232
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah, so exactly

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because my mother

234
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
grew up

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
in such a place.

236
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So she didn't know anything

237
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
else and she went to great lengths.

238
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh my god.

239
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Consequences.

240
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But leave all of those

241
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
cause, you know,

242
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
talking to you, one of the greatest things about

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
talking to you Darren is, you can talk

244
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
about things that are, you might

245
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
have a long life

246
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
taught its age, unconventional, so kind of like

247
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
censor that a bit, you know.

248
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, you can do whatever you want

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
so I love it, you know, okay.

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So I

251
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
loved, you know,

252
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
my mother was the epitome of unconditional

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
love and I love that.

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Beautiful.

255
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You know, it didn't occur

256
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
full on to me at that time, right?

257
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It occurred enough, but because

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
occurred enough as in, you know,

259
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
when the world became

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
difficult, there's one person

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
that you could go to who has got time, patients

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
for you. She listened

263
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and she won't, you know, abruptly

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
stop you halfway or say that

265
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that's a silly idea.

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
She will take it that it's possible

267
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
that her child may know something that she doesn't,

268
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
you know, right?

269
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And that was

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
special, right, in this

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
kind of like cruel world, right?

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Extremely beautiful, yes.

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So I want

274
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
to continue that and I was not going to

275
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
stop, agree

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
with anybody who said it's impossible.

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You know, you can't.

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And later in life,

279
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
of late, I realized, no,

280
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
they,

281
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
many who say it's impossible

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
are only saying it because

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
our narrative has so much

284
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
become zero or

285
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
100 binary.

286
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's like, if something is not

287
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
exact, you know, it's like, can you guarantee

288
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
me that 100%

289
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
you know, that person who is

290
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
in your village, you can have unconditional love?

291
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, the real answer is

292
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
why do you even, why can't it be

293
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
fuzzy at the edges?

294
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Say again.

295
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Even when we do math

296
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
or graphs, you know, we cut off the

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
extremes and that's good enough

298
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
if you can manage it 90% but, you know,

299
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
there are outliers but you don't need

300
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
to like spend your whole lifetime

301
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
passing the last 2%

302
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you know.

303
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay, you've touched on something, wait,

304
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
you've touched on something I want to highlight.

305
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Please

306
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
nurture your

307
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
line of thought and where you are going

308
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
so that you can hold on to it for a second.

309
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But I

310
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
want to say something, the zero 100

311
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
thing. So

312
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
as children

313
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
eventually

314
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
we attempt things

315
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
that are at least

316
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
initially, they are

317
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
impossible. Okay?

318
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It is initially

319
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
impossible for you to

320
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
stand up.

321
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It is initially impossible for you to take

322
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
a step.

323
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It is initially impossible

324
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
for you to jump

325
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
or run

326
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
or walk or speak

327
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
or swim

328
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
or hold your breath underwater

329
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
or ride a bicycle

330
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
or write language.

331
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
All of these things start out

332
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
initially impossible

333
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and if we

334
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
evaluate them on the basis

335
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that is usually used in our cultures

336
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
pretty much nothing is possible

337
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
because you can't, the only things that are

338
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
possible are things where you go from

339
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
zero to 100 in one move.

340
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Right?

341
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
In a single move.

342
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Never happened.

343
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Right?

344
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So we do have this mindset

345
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and I was reading

346
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I just want to share something from

347
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
a book called the dawn of everything that I was

348
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
reading last night.

349
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We're talking about

350
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
our views of history being wrong

351
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and we basically have two views. It was

352
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
wonderful. We all took care of

353
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
each other and then we fell from that

354
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
now it's every man for himself

355
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and there's no way to change it.

356
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The best you can hope for

357
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
is slight adjustments

358
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
to the tyrannical nonsense

359
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
of human society.

360
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And I say this

361
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
as long ago as 1936

362
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
the prehistorian V. Gordon Child

363
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
wrote a book called man makes himself

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
apart from the sexist language

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
this is the spirit we wish to invoke.

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We are projects

367
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
of collective self-creation.

368
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We approach human history that way.

369
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What if we treat people

370
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
from the beginning

371
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
as imaginative intelligent playful

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
creatures who deserve to be understood

373
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
as such? What if

374
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
instead of telling a story about how

375
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
our species fell from some idyllic

376
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
state of equality

377
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
we ask

378
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
how we came to be trapped

379
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
in such tight conceptual

380
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
shackles

381
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that we no longer even imagine

382
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the ability of reinventing our societies.

383
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They say ourselves

384
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
but what they mean is

385
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
our societies.

386
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We can't imagine it because it seems

387
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
like it's like a task like eating

388
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the moon

389
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
or drinking the ocean.

390
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So no one imagines

391
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
that it's only possible

392
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
it's necessary

393
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
to be intelligent.

394
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The entire history

395
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and future of life on this planet

396
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
may depend on the single

397
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
on this single pivot

398
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
can humans form

399
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
intelligent

400
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
aware collectives

401
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
with and for each other

402
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and with and for the history

403
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and future of life on this planet.

404
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Now of course we can

405
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
on the small scale.

406
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We can do it immediately

407
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
we can do it. You and I are not going to

408
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
have any problem doing that

409
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
right here, right now. We'll be doing that

410
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
together, right?

411
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So it's immediately

412
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
if you just shrink the scale from

413
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
everything to something

414
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
you can do it right now

415
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
with any few people

416
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
who are motivated and sincere

417
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
you know, yeah.

418
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Please continue.

419
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Right on, right on. Excellent.

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So, so good to hear.

421
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So good to hear.

422
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And you know

423
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
much of it is

424
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
self

425
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
it's like self fulfilling prophecy

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
or self created meaning

427
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
one of my biggest answer backs

428
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
has worked right against this notion is

429
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
against this notion of

430
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
it can't be done you know it's impossible

431
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
it's

432
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
this whole

433
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
hopelessness is

434
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
you know guys

435
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
if we were living

436
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
you know

437
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
before the first village

438
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
right and

439
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
the first village would never have happened

440
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
you know like

441
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
often I'll see in

442
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
online forums

443
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
like

444
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
the ones that you quite a lot

445
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
in this one the p2p foundation

446
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
right quite a lot of people from

447
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
around the world

448
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and often

449
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
the people are so good at

450
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
nitpicking right

451
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
right and I'm like by the way these are

452
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
people who probably never accomplish anything

453
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
other than nitpicking

454
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
but go ahead.

455
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah.

456
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
They're professional nitpickers

457
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
right what do you do for a living I sit around

458
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
on a computer screen and pick

459
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
nits

460
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
so

461
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm like saying hey look

462
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
right

463
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
you

464
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
just imagine you know

465
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
if our ancestors

466
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
very little they made the first village

467
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
happen if they could not get along

468
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
right

469
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
if they were egotistical

470
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
the first village would not have happened

471
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
in all likelihood it would have taken many attempts

472
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
for the first village to

473
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
to happen

474
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
you know to stay and be

475
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
maintained continue as first village

476
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
but we know that it

477
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
happened and then it went on to become

478
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
a small town and

479
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
those language and

480
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
so if those people

481
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
can kind of hold their negativity

482
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
their pessimism down a bit

483
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
right to let

484
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
the blossoming as the blossoming

485
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
see in nature right despite

486
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
all the earthquakes and whatever

487
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
negative you know there may be

488
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
there still is you know

489
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
flowering and blooming and you know

490
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
joy and aesthetics

491
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
in nature

492
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
right

493
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
why can't we

494
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
look at the good

495
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
and ignore the bad

496
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
right unless the bad totally

497
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
you know cannot be

498
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
right if the house

499
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
catches on fire we'll get some water

500
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
yeah

501
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
right yeah

502
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you know

503
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
but it's not

504
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
a matter of okay it's not a matter

505
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
of this it's a matter

506
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think and by all

507
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
means correct me if you see it differently

508
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
yeah it's a matter of

509
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the

510
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
the

511
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
the

512
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
okay look

513
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
we got two different

514
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
kinds of options right

515
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
you can put humans together

516
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
you can get them to agree

517
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
to come together as a group let's say

518
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
a small group seven people

519
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
okay

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and you can

521
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
say again

522
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I said entirely

523
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I mean nobody would argue

524
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
same person can argue against that

525
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
if you said seven people you know like

526
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
okay

527
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
right you can get seven people together

528
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and

529
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
tell them either one of two things

530
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
okay

531
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
you're just going to learn how to

532
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
get along and help each other

533
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
yeah

534
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and be for each other

535
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and be together as one unit as well

536
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
as being individuals

537
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
you're either going to learn how to do that

538
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
or we're going to give you some principles

539
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
but the fundamental problem is that

540
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
there has to be a catalyst

541
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
right

542
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
there has to be a profound catalyst

543
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
that makes the people want

544
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
to be together

545
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
and to grow together

546
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and to learn together so either

547
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
the catalyst

548
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
for most people

549
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the catalyst is either the fear

550
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
of really bad experiences

551
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
of being human

552
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
or

553
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
it's the

554
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
it's FOMO

555
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
it's a version of FOMO

556
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I know that being human can mean

557
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
so much more than living in this box

558
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and watching television but I don't know

559
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
how to get to that

560
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
the fear of missing out

561
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
right those are two highly

562
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
motivated highly motivating

563
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
things but the third highly

564
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
motivating thing is a fire

565
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
right like the village is on fire

566
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
get up let's go

567
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
right or

568
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
or you know

569
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
in a city

570
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
you will see humans

571
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
form highly effective

572
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
cooperative pods

573
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
little groups right pods

574
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
spontaneously

575
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
if there is a car accident

576
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
if there is an earthquake

577
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
right

578
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
what will happen if there is an earthquake

579
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
is you will see three things

580
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
people who are sort of neutral

581
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
they don't know what the fuck to do

582
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
so they're kind of milling about

583
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
the people who are

584
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
acquisitive

585
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
these people are looking for opportunities

586
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to profit off the situation

587
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and then people who are

588
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
you know they convert to altruists

589
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
right we're going to help each other

590
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
get through this right now

591
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Hey, follow up to you

592
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
you remind me of something

593
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
critical I want to ask

594
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I wanted to ask you

595
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
let me ask you

596
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
of course

597
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
keep your thought along but I want to ask you this

598
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
you know

599
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I've gone through a tough life

600
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
situation the last few years

601
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
and one thing you say

602
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
for me

603
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
has been a dog named Benji

604
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
right

605
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
this is not surprising even slightly

606
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm listening

607
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
yeah no surprise there

608
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I want to ask you

609
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
this one thing

610
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
it goes into the granular

611
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
of

612
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
unity

613
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
is diversity

614
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
it's not

615
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
once people don't have to riddle themselves with

616
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
finding

617
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
we can find unity within diversity

618
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
or allow for diversity

619
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
within unity

620
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
what you will find

621
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
is something like your hand

622
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
right

623
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
where you have a bunch of unique

624
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
members

625
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and there's

626
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
no problem with the index finger

627
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
being its own finger

628
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
no problem

629
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
but they always

630
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
work together for each other

631
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and the synergy that the palm

632
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
right where they come together

633
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
the synergy where the palm of the hand is

634
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
that stuff is powerful

635
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
in fact that's the stuff that makes most

636
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
of the trouble

637
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
for humans

638
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is we're making the bad form of synergy

639
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
right

640
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
we're like oh with synergy

641
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
you can go faster you can get more

642
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
you can

643
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
you can mutate

644
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and propagate wildly if you have synergy

645
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
but I'm listening

646
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I didn't hear

647
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
your question

648
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
you were talking about diversity and unity

649
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
good good good

650
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
the small subset

651
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
within that

652
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
with my dog

653
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
the dog loves

654
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
to come

655
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and lick

656
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
the inside of my mouth

657
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
right

658
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and

659
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
you know

660
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
it's a mix between

661
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
a golden retriever and a food dog

662
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
right

663
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
very

664
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
humanly

665
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
very into humans

666
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I have no idea what people listening to

667
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
our conversation will think when you say that

668
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
but keep going because I'm going to go somewhere

669
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
that I think you're actually going to go to

670
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
but let's see

671
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
anyway

672
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I have this overall view that

673
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
all creatures and plants have been

674
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
made

675
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
maybe we don't know like a bed bug

676
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
we don't know why

677
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
but it's got a logical reason

678
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
but it's got a reason

679
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
so when my dog

680
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
when this dog comes and licks me

681
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
wants to you know out of his instinct

682
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and he's so determined to like what to do

683
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I let him

684
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
so as time goes on

685
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
it's fine

686
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
because

687
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
but now let me go to the

688
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
the gist I want to get to you

689
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
he

690
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
you know we have I think

691
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
adopted a practice of giving

692
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
it's different

693
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
from

694
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
gating

695
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and giving can never be as good

696
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
as

697
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
satisfying as

698
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
gating

699
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
oh that is

700
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
such bullshit but I understand

701
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
that that's the tradition

702
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
yes go ahead

703
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
okay but you know

704
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
for the dog

705
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'll cut to them

706
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
yeah you're right

707
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
it's very happy

708
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
number one

709
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and it's happy more time

710
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
much of its happiness comes from

711
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
giving

712
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
it's like instinctively

713
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I mean I would argue that the dog

714
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
doesn't even make that distinction

715
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
yeah

716
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
that's it

717
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
it never makes that distinction

718
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
it understands receiving

719
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
so to speak

720
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
perhaps it differentiates that

721
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm not sure

722
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
but its body understands the difference between

723
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
he's holding a chunk of meat

724
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and he isn't

725
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
body understands that

726
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
but the thing about the dog

727
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
okay look it's doing something crazy

728
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and you know

729
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
this isn't to suggest that everyone should

730
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
French kiss their dogs

731
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
for those of you for whom it's natural

732
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
by all means

733
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
let them you know let them lick your mouth

734
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I think many in the west

735
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
would consider that disgusting

736
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
or dangerous or unhealthy

737
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
because the dog has a lot of germs

738
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
so to speak

739
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
but here's the actual thing that's crazy

740
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I will argue

741
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
something really bizarre here

742
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and I'll take responsibility for my argument

743
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I will argue that your dog

744
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
is already

745
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
your dog has senses

746
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
that sense your mind

747
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
yeah

748
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
the same way you can smell the dog

749
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the dog can smell your mind

750
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
right yeah

751
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
senses that can sense your mind

752
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
it has senses that can participate

753
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
with your mind

754
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
it has senses that are telepathic

755
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
it has senses with which it can

756
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
bond its intelligence to yours

757
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and give something

758
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
truly astonishingly miraculous

759
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
to you

760
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
humans all the time and the humans don't recognize

761
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
it at all they don't even notice it

762
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
they just feel better when the dog's around

763
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
they can't see what the dog's actually doing

764
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and I'm going to argue

765
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
that what most of the dogs are actually doing

766
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
is they're trying to

767
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
they're trying to do something like

768
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
the Vulcan mind meld

769
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
in Star Trek

770
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
where Spock becomes

771
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
the two minds become one mind

772
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
it's trying to do something like that

773
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and it's trying to do that for

774
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
a way of heroic purposes

775
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
one of the best things it could possibly

776
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
do if that were its goal

777
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
would be to get its microbiota

778
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
into your gut microbiome

779
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and your microbiota

780
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
into its

781
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
once you start sharing

782
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
the digestive

783
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
microbiota especially

784
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
the first

785
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
sort of landing zone

786
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
for microbiota and humans one of them

787
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
anyways the mouth

788
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
so

789
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
when dogs are sniffing poop

790
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and doing whatever they're doing

791
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
presuming they do such things

792
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
they're

793
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
connoisseurs of bacteria

794
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
it's obvious to me from observing them

795
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
so I would argue that

796
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
the dog is actually trying to become

797
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
one fit more

798
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
one organism

799
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
with you

800
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
so that its microbiota get into your mouth

801
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and your microbiota get into

802
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
its mouth and some on both sides

803
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
survive

804
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
and they reproduce and they become families

805
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
of trillions of organisms

806
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
trillions

807
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
there's 43 trillion

808
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
bacteria inside a human body

809
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
and once again right you have the same thing

810
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
you have unity and diversity

811
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
the diversity supports

812
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
the health of the unity

813
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
yep

814
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and especially

815
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
on this part right

816
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
especially if you say look

817
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
what is the reality when people talk about unity

818
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and

819
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
diversity

820
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
in today's governance world

821
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
when they talk about unity

822
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
they're talking about conformity

823
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
isn't it

824
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
conformity does absolutely

825
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
cannot be that the basis for unity

826
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
no

827
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
this is why

828
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
if you're putting a cohort together

829
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
you don't

830
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
want to have to give them rules

831
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
you want them

832
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
to discover the process together

833
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
so that it's organic

834
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I think

835
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
but in a dire situation

836
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
where there's something interfering with them

837
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
discovering it together

838
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
the catalyst should

839
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
should declare the

840
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
principles

841
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
yes

842
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
the catalyst should

843
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
communicate the principles to us

844
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and what I was going to say is that

845
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
a long time ago

846
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
let me just say something really simple and stupid

847
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
by the time a human collective

848
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
needs rules

849
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
70%

850
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
of that collective has gone missing

851
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
in action for one reason or another

852
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and it's offline

853
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
yep yep

854
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
by the time you have to tell people what to do

855
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
the intimacy is

856
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
not there

857
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
there's no intimacy between them

858
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
they can't sense each other

859
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
they're not sensing each other

860
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and doing predictive analysis for each other's needs

861
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and vulnerabilities

862
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and things like that

863
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
which humans in a tightly knit group do that

864
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
all day long every day

865
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
they just naturally do that

866
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
they're vigilant

867
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
in a way

868
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
they're vigilant of everything

869
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
as if they were the unity

870
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
as if the concerns of the unity

871
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I don't know it's really hard to say it in language

872
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
because it sounds like a rule and it's a game

873
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
it's not a rule

874
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
hmm

875
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
but once you make it a rule

876
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
you're going to have a tough time

877
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
like by the time God had to write stuff in stone

878
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
on top of some mountain

879
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
and send Moses down to his people

880
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
with what

881
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
10 rules

882
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
you gotta imagine like

883
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
things must have been really bad

884
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
for something that

885
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
severe to have to happen

886
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
you gotta tell people

887
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
don't kill each other

888
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
you gotta tell them

889
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
not to steal

890
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
right

891
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
you gotta tell them to wear a loincloth

892
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
all right

893
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
or you know what don't rub your butt on your food

894
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and

895
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
time you have to

896
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
tell them these things

897
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
something's gone horribly

898
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
haywire like not

899
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
in a little way

900
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
in like an apocalyptically

901
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
bad way

902
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
it can only go from here to disaster

903
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
kind of way

904
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and

905
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
text

906
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I mean writing it down

907
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
overall

908
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I mean in a large

909
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
in a large way

910
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
it's taking us backwards

911
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
especially

912
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I mean

913
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
as with any technology

914
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
good and bad

915
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
and also

916
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
unfortunately for humans

917
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
pretty much unavoidable

918
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
given the situations

919
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
unavoidable

920
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
okay look

921
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
the problem with text is you have

922
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
okay if I am speaking with you

923
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
or you are speaking with me

924
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
right yep

925
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
we both have an idea of to whom we are speaking

926
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
and also to whom we are

927
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
listening

928
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
once you have text

929
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
you have the possibility which is

930
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
very dangerous for human cognition

931
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
the way human cognition

932
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
psychologically

933
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
it's anatomy very very dangerous

934
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
if you have a thing which is this

935
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
speech without someone speaking

936
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
it to you

937
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
now you can't

938
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
tell whether that's an actual

939
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
person

940
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
whether it's a machine

941
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
whether it's God

942
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
or

943
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
whether it's a problem in your consciousness

944
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and since you can't tell

945
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
which one of these it is

946
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
things go badly

947
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
once you have

948
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
disembodied speakers

949
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
things go badly

950
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
for humans

951
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
generally it's also a sign

952
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
that things have already gotten

953
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
weird

954
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I mean when I think about getting

955
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
humans together for each other

956
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and this is perhaps the most exciting thought I am capable of having

957
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I have to admit

958
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
it seems

959
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
almost impossible or wildly

960
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
unlikely to my

961
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
pragmatic

962
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
mind

963
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
my pragmatic thoughts

964
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
how do you tell them

965
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
what do you want them to do

966
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
what's so exciting that

967
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
we are going to get together

968
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and actually go on a mission

969
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I have various answers to those

970
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
questions but it sure seems

971
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
just as we were talking

972
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
as we were speaking about earlier

973
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
in the conversation it seems to be

974
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
a 0-100 problem

975
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
it isn't

976
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
it isn't a 0-100 problem

977
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
but it seems that way

978
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
until

979
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
you get a few experiences of

980
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
making it work

981
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and you can make it work

982
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
for an hour

983
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
you don't have to make it work for the future

984
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
or the world

985
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
you can make it work for two hours for five people

986
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
now

987
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
they will get a taste

988
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
oh shit we can do this

989
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
we can actually do this together

990
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
because

991
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I would argue

992
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and I know this is a very dangerous thing to say

993
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
but I am quite certain of the truth of it

994
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I would argue that a team of

995
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
five people could transform

996
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
a nation

997
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
in 90 days

998
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
any nation

999
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
probably almost any five people

1000
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and if this was ever true in human history

1001
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
it's more true now than it's ever been

1002
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
because

1003
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
the history and future of life on earth

1004
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
depends on

1005
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the humans becoming intelligent

1006
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
yeah

1007
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
the humans must become intelligent

1008
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
or either that

1009
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
or you have to kill off 97% of them

1010
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
or something

1011
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
right

1012
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
if you want to keep the world alive

1013
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
because they will just keep making machines

1014
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
not arguing to kill anybody

1015
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
to be clear

1016
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I am saying if you want to preserve life on earth

1017
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
we either have to

1018
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
the entire history

1019
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the meaning of the history of life on this world

1020
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
and the future

1021
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
of those histories

1022
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
we have got to get the humans playing a game

1023
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
that isn't lethal

1024
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
together

1025
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
right

1026
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
it's the fundamental priority

1027
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
it's more important than any other thing I can think of

1028
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
if we care about

1029
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
will there be a world for our grandchildren

1030
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
if we don't care about that

1031
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
it's still really important

1032
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
but

1033
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
so

1034
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
so then you have the problem of

1035
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
in this case

1036
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
in the little toy

1037
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
universe that I'm creating here during our discussion

1038
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
in this case what you do

1039
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
is you get five people together

1040
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and you teach them how to solve an intractable problem

1041
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
locally to where they live

1042
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
right

1043
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
so that they have the experience of

1044
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
taking on a problem that just can't be fucking solved

1045
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
synergizing

1046
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
you know

1047
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
solving the problem

1048
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
now they have experience

1049
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
this was

1050
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
this topic was related to

1051
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
our agreement

1052
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
to come to listen to talk together

1053
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
today

1054
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
because we were talking about teams

1055
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I was talking about teams and that's when you sent me

1056
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
a message on Facebook right

1057
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
yep

1058
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
yes correct

1059
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
so there's something about collaboration

1060
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
collaboration

1061
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
how can we

1062
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
make what you are

1063
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
trusting and which is what I'm trusting to

1064
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
in your messages

1065
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I love that word

1066
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
saying

1067
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
okay

1068
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
that's an alternative

1069
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and you put it in such a way that

1070
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
again

1071
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
a lot of the usual suspects

1072
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
cannot even object to it

1073
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
because it's beyond

1074
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
also look

1075
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I don't care

1076
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I want to be really clear

1077
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
yes I don't care about the usual suspects

1078
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
objecting because here's what's going to happen

1079
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
once you get humans being

1080
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
actually human together

1081
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
and

1082
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
the public

1083
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
is able to observe that happening

1084
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and

1085
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
see the results

1086
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
and see what it's like to be

1087
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
to have the scope of our humanity

1088
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
some portion of that return to us

1089
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
relationally

1090
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
behaviorally

1091
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
in terms of our role and our felt sense of

1092
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
role if you can give him some of that back

1093
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
those objectors

1094
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
are going to last about six days

1095
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and then they're going to be on

1096
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
forming their own teams

1097
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and be left out

1098
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
no idiot is dumb enough

1099
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
that when they see the humans making that

1100
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
nectar of being human together

1101
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
they're going to be like yeah I don't want to be part of that

1102
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
that's the original

1103
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
that's the original

1104
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
money

1105
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
that's what money is a representation

1106
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
of is that nectar

1107
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
yeah

1108
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
that's right that's right

1109
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
it's the synergistic nectar

1110
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
yeah

1111
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and then the humans can learn things like this

1112
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
you can teach children this and you're like

1113
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
look your parents are doing this thing

1114
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
with money

1115
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and what they're really trying to get

1116
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
is this other stuff that you and your friends

1117
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
make naturally when you play together

1118
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
they're not getting any of that

1119
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
so they're trying really hard to get money

1120
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
you don't have to do that

1121
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
the thing that you and your friends are doing

1122
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
can develop

1123
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
can grow

1124
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
and can be maintained

1125
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
like you can get five people together

1126
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
and then five of them split apart

1127
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
two of those form

1128
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
new ones

1129
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
the other three

1130
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
join existing ones

1131
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
so that there's sort of cross-pollination

1132
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
between

1133
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
team and pod groups

1134
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and this is something that works really really well

1135
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
the game that I'm talking about is the game that every organism

1136
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
in nature is playing

1137
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and the humans are

1138
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
made to play this game but they're playing

1139
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
sort of the opposite of it

1140
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
which is kill the unity

1141
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
and make representations of the dead things

1142
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
and then sell them

1143
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
to each other

1144
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
so

1145
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
if you give them a game that's authentic to play

1146
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and they like it

1147
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
it's going to become really

1148
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
contagious

1149
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
if you give actual humans something

1150
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
to do that's amazing and the other people see

1151
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
you'll have

1152
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
objectors at first

1153
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
but it's not going to last long

1154
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
don't say that again

1155
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I want to process that

1156
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
say the last two sentences again

1157
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
the goal is to do something

1158
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
so momentous and beautiful

1159
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
that nobody can stand

1160
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
to be left out

1161
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
nobody

1162
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
everybody wants in

1163
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
that's full on I can

1164
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
sense that because

1165
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
and that's an achievable thing

1166
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
in a way

1167
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
just you and I speaking

1168
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
of such matters is the beginning

1169
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
of that

1170
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
can you see why I say that

1171
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Bala?

1172
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and I know 100%

1173
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and I have happened in my background

1174
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
these people who are labeled

1175
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
poor and whatever in the zero crime villages

1176
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
but these kids are so rich

1177
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I mean

1178
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
they are alive

1179
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
to be human

1180
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
if you get excited

1181
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
with the cockroach being upside down

1182
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I mean whatever

1183
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
toys can come from

1184
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
what the rest of the world

1185
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
might call nothing but

1186
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
they're excited

1187
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
because like you were saying

1188
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
walking is impossible

1189
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
running is impossible

1190
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
jumping is impossible

1191
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
but

1192
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
they're not overwhelmed

1193
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
by all of the

1194
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
text around the world

1195
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I suppose

1196
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
yes and also

1197
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm guessing

1198
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
do the children have phones?

1199
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
no

1200
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
they don't

1201
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
by the way

1202
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
this is like an alien

1203
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
comes to earth

1204
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and finds your village

1205
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
and looks and says this is a very unusual village

1206
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
here

1207
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
where are your children's phones

1208
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and you say

1209
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
they don't have any and the alien says

1210
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
oh I'd like to raise my children here

1211
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
do you think it would be okay?

1212
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
can I

1213
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
can we do this together?

1214
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
wow

1215
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
it's almost like asking

1216
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
do your children

1217
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
wear a mechanical parasite

1218
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
that destroys their attention

1219
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
motivation

1220
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
awareness

1221
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
it's not the only thing the phones do

1222
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
but

1223
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
it's a lot of what they do

1224
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Darren you remind me

1225
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I'll be going back

1226
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
again in a couple of months

1227
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
back to the village

1228
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and

1229
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
the permanently based there

1230
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
very soon I'm just

1231
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
organizing to do that

1232
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
tying some of those

1233
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
with the

1234
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
urban world

1235
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
what was beautiful

1236
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
every time I'm there

1237
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
the kids

1238
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
automatically want to help the mother

1239
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I mean

1240
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
it was very common

1241
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
it was very common me growing up

1242
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
my sisters would help the mother

1243
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
and I would help the father

1244
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
and stuff like that

1245
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I mean they didn't have to do too much

1246
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
but

1247
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
now I've played

1248
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
my kids

1249
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
to some extent but just generally

1250
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I noticed

1251
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
people are finding it very hard

1252
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
to get their kids to do chores

1253
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
yeah

1254
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
but when I go to the village

1255
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
the kids

1256
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
seem to like wow

1257
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm given a chance to be an adult

1258
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
yes

1259
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
amusement

1260
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and like wow they're treating me like an adult now

1261
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
they're not completely saying

1262
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I can't do this and I can't do that

1263
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
and so

1264
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
because

1265
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
my brother-in-law

1266
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
my

1267
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
my

1268
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
sorry my

1269
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
my brother-in-law's children

1270
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
essentially

1271
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
my nephews like

1272
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Anises

1273
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
bring breakfast I'm upstairs and they're downstairs

1274
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and they're bringing coffee and this

1275
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and this is like 8 years old

1276
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
she does a good job

1277
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'm so happy

1278
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
with that

1279
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
and a mother or my wife

1280
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
doesn't have to

1281
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
push up she looks forward to

1282
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
doing this

1283
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
it's like

1284
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
what you'll find is like

1285
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
in our culture

1286
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
the children are competing

1287
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
to get things

1288
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
they want to get things

1289
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
in the village culture

1290
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
the children are competing to

1291
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
it's not merely

1292
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
give

1293
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
they are competing

1294
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
to participate

1295
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
meaningfully

1296
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
with the family

1297
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
the village the planet

1298
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and the adults

1299
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
and the children

1300
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
participate meaningfully

1301
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
and so the chance to bring coffee

1302
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
is better than just sitting there looking at my thumb

1303
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
and

1304
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
they don't have a smart phone to defect into

1305
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
so they're not going to defect

1306
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
that way so you know

1307
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
they wouldn't be doing any other thing

1308
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
but the chance to bring coffee is meaningful

1309
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm serving my ancestors

1310
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
they are still alive today with me

1311
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
in the same room

1312
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
this is magic

1313
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
we are still alive together

1314
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and then maybe

1315
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
if it's just this

1316
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
a rite of passage as in

1317
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
one of the things all want to be

1318
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
they don't want to be

1319
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
treated like kids

1320
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
like we know nothing

1321
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
too often

1322
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
some of that works in their favor

1323
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
because some of the children

1324
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
respond to that by becoming

1325
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
monumentally

1326
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
intelligent

1327
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
because they're like

1328
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
that dumb kid

1329
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
my dad called me dumb

1330
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
so I learned quantum physics

1331
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I'm just giving

1332
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
a ridiculous example

1333
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
some of it does sort of help

1334
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
the children

1335
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
but that shouldn't be

1336
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
the cultural

1337
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
you know

1338
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
that shouldn't be the cultural tradition

1339
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I'm listening

1340
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
so wait Darren

1341
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I want to imprint this into my head

1342
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
which is

1343
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
number one there's an issue

1344
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
there's a big problem of getting kids

1345
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
to like do the

1346
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
sensible things

1347
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
and one of the reasons why

1348
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
they don't want to do this

1349
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
they want to get things

1350
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
they want to either get things

1351
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
or they want to defect

1352
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and they're addicted to electronic stimuli

1353
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
and things like that

1354
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
so they're used to

1355
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
constantly referring to an object

1356
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
with their attention

1357
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
the children there don't have to do that

1358
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
if they have a phone

1359
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
even if they have a computer

1360
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
if they have a phone

1361
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
if they have a video game

1362
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
if they have a television

1363
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
if they have even a radio

1364
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
it starts to be

1365
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
the same kind of thing

1366
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
and also because

1367
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
we've totally

1368
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
you know

1369
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
okay I have to say

1370
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I'm sorry

1371
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I have to say

1372
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
the thing all those things are replacing

1373
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
is meaningful relation

1374
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
in the village with the others

1375
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
all those things

1376
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
they are replacing that

1377
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
they are the money version

1378
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
of the nectar that's produced naturally

1379
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
when the people are there

1380
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
for each other

1381
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
this great sweetness

1382
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
combination of silence

1383
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
laying hopscotch

1384
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
in front of the hall

1385
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
seeing the kids

1386
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
from the neighbor's house coming

1387
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
not wearing something different

1388
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
all of that

1389
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
is little sparkles

1390
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
you know

1391
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
talking

1392
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
learning how to speak a bit better

1393
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
it is because you and the children are there together

1394
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
for each other

1395
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
even the children who aren't yours

1396
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
and you know

1397
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
the children

1398
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
they like

1399
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I don't know how to put it

1400
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
the children are carrying

1401
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
assets

1402
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
that the adults don't

1403
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
recognize

1404
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
and dispose of

1405
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and punish the children for carrying

1406
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
everywhere around here

1407
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
mostly a little bit of you know

1408
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
there are a few intelligent parents that know better

1409
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
but

1410
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
the children are bringing something

1411
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
to the table

1412
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and the adults pretend

1413
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
to be rude

1414
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
you are dependent on us

1415
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
and since we have to protect you

1416
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
you are dependent on us

1417
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
and this creates a kind of slavery

1418
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
children in the west

1419
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
are sort of conceived of as slaves

1420
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
this is why we send them to school

1421
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
which is basically a slave making process

1422
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
this is why they go to university

1423
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
get degrees and so forth

1424
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
in the representational layer

1425
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
of human culture and society

1426
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
which is

1427
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
mostly pretty bad

1428
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
mostly different kinds of slavery

1429
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
children are meant for something else

1430
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and they can tell the adults are suffering

1431
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and they have assets

1432
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
that will ease the suffering of the adults

1433
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
if they don't eradicate it

1434
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
the children are carrying

1435
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
something like medicine

1436
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
children are living medicine

1437
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
the adults are living medicine

1438
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
especially when they are together

1439
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
for each other

1440
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
then they naturally make the medicine

1441
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
together

1442
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
does that make sense

1443
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
yes yes

1444
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
in this case medicine isn't like a pharmaceutical

1445
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
medicine is

1446
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
medicine is

1447
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
the food and drink of our soul

1448
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
or our heart

1449
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
medicine is what

1450
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
we open

1451
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
we open

1452
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
we learn

1453
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
being ready to learn

1454
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
as opposed to taking for granted

1455
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
that

1456
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
the

1457
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
representationally

1458
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
sends

1459
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
the wrong signals

1460
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
it does

1461
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
it completely messes up our thought

1462
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
don't want to make a mistake

1463
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
go on sorry Darren

1464
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
no please I'm sorry

1465
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
please continue

1466
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
often I'm not able to

1467
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
it's kind of like

1468
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
often I'm not able to articulate it

1469
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
but I understand

1470
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
the moderns are captured

1471
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
by a layer of

1472
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
processes that they enact

1473
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
as behaviors like drive the car

1474
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
to the grocery store

1475
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
get the groceries

1476
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
get the job get the pay

1477
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
take the kid to the doctor

1478
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
pay the attorney do the taxes

1479
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
watch the television show

1480
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
mind the smart phone

1481
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
clean the house

1482
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
chores

1483
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
what we would call chores

1484
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
but really those are like

1485
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
those are all

1486
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
all those processes are mostly vampiric

1487
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
they are extractive

1488
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
they take something from us

1489
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
and they give us a representation

1490
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
now we can

1491
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
negotiate that layer very carefully

1492
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
if we're smart so that we get

1493
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
actually nourishing food

1494
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
when we go to the grocery store

1495
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and we don't get poison for example

1496
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
candy bars and whatever

1497
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
yep

1498
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
but the representational layer is powerful

1499
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
it's well established

1500
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
it affects everything on earth

1501
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
it's lethal

1502
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
it steals life

1503
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
it's

1504
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
an actual vampire would be

1505
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
terrified if it saw the representational

1506
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
layers

1507
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
relationship with humans because

1508
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
it would realize that that must be

1509
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
it's god

1510
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
that must be the god of the vamp

1511
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
that's what spawns vampires

1512
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
vampires come from that

1513
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
if there are such things

1514
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
right

1515
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
but yes the medicine

1516
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
the village makes together

1517
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
this medicine

1518
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
is very powerful and it has

1519
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
a unique protective effect

1520
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
vampires bounce off of it

1521
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
it makes like a shield

1522
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
right

1523
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
and so vampirism doesn't get established

1524
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
in the children or the adults

1525
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
and they're busy playing every other beautiful

1526
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
game

1527
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
everybody will be happy even when

1528
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
things are difficult they're still

1529
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
going to be way happier

1530
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
yeah

1531
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
everyone will be taking care of

1532
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
each other

1533
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I'm listening

1534
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
they're in one way of like maybe

1535
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
peeling away

1536
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
the representational layer

1537
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
just expose it to people

1538
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I've tried that and it works

1539
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
because I

1540
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'll tell you this right

1541
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
even the people there in the village

1542
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
and stuff

1543
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
in Central Java

1544
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
it was very famous you know

1545
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
spice trade Asia, immersion

1546
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
people were discovering things

1547
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
and all that stuff

1548
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
from nothing

1549
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
the village just became better

1550
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
and better as humanity went on

1551
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
but all of that is kind of like

1552
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
blocked off by modern writing

1553
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
and books and even anthropology

1554
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
because

1555
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
but okay this thing I want to tell you

1556
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
once I'm in the village

1557
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I realize you know what

1558
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
these people are the richest

1559
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
people on planet earth

1560
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
even though they are very little

1561
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
currency

1562
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
sorry there's a lot of currency

1563
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
but very little money

1564
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
yeah

1565
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
why

1566
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
yeah because money

1567
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
money eats

1568
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
the spirit of relation between humans

1569
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
it does

1570
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
it destroys that shit

1571
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
it's like pouring acid there

1572
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
to get rid of it

1573
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
because now there's a single standard

1574
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
to rule all things

1575
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
like

1576
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
the terror in the fantasy

1577
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
story of the lord of the rings

1578
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
one ring to rule them all is that

1579
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
the ring that rules

1580
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
the seven elvish magic rings

1581
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
that keep the world alive

1582
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
rules them is malignant

1583
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
and that's money

1584
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
the one ring that rules

1585
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
them all in Tolkien's language

1586
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
cash is the

1587
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
best metaphor for it around here

1588
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
it's hard to say

1589
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
it's hard to say that it isn't

1590
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
objectively

1591
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
evil

1592
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
because it's effect on the humans

1593
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
okay look I could show you so many

1594
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
features of this

1595
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
god alright

1596
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I used to feed some blue jays

1597
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I met these blue jays

1598
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I'd bring them peanuts

1599
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I took great joy in feeding them

1600
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
yeah

1601
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
and the male would come to my hand

1602
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
he'd land on my hand

1603
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
take a peanut female wouldn't

1604
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
okay

1605
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
for important reasons

1606
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
one day

1607
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
the female got angry with me

1608
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
and I didn't really understand why

1609
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
what I had noticed was this

1610
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
the blue jay couple

1611
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
forms a vigilance pair

1612
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
the girl stays up high

1613
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
the boy can go down an adventure

1614
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
only when the boy is up high

1615
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
does the girl come down

1616
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
oh shit I just realized that

1617
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
fuck

1618
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
so

1619
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I was interfering in that

1620
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and it would have been okay if I interfered

1621
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
in it once or twice

1622
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
a day

1623
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
but it's not okay if I interfere

1624
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
with it for two hours

1625
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and the reason it's not okay

1626
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
is that they live in the terrain of a pair of

1627
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
cooper's hawks and those hawks hunt blue jays

1628
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
oh

1629
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
alright so here's what I'm doing

1630
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I'm giving them the effect

1631
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I'm telling the story

1632
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
yeah

1633
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
if you put something in front of people

1634
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
or animals

1635
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
hmm

1636
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
that's so compelling

1637
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
that it not only changes their behavior

1638
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
it changes what they

1639
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
can be

1640
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
right it drags what they

1641
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
can be down

1642
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
to fewer

1643
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
much more explicit things

1644
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
hmm

1645
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
so

1646
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
identity becomes binary

1647
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
when I was throwing those peanuts on the ground

1648
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
for the girl bird

1649
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
because she wouldn't come to my hand

1650
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
she was having

1651
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
to go to the ground

1652
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
without

1653
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
radar above her

1654
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
because the male

1655
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
was off stashing the peanut I'd just given him

1656
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I wasn't

1657
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
paying attention to their

1658
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
vigilance necessities and I was providing them

1659
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
the stimulus that was so compelling

1660
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
that they would break

1661
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
their culture

1662
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
of mutual support

1663
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
right it would break

1664
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
that culture

1665
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
yeah

1666
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
it's so compelling that their bodies

1667
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
it's like putting meat in front of a dog

1668
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
right the body

1669
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
is going to respond

1670
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
you know if you

1671
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
if you watch you know just put like a stack

1672
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
$100 bills tie it up

1673
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
with a rubber band

1674
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
and put it on a street

1675
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
and watch the humans

1676
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
like it will drag their behavior down to

1677
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
you know

1678
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
the most likely

1679
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
yeah

1680
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
yeah

1681
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
it captures the nervous system

1682
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
can you see that it's

1683
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
a representation

1684
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
that's powerful enough to completely capture

1685
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
the nervous system of an animal

1686
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
and for the blue jays that's peanuts

1687
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
and for the humans that's cash

1688
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
or these days crypto

1689
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
and overall

1690
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
it's because I mean

1691
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
if they were enough

1692
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
of what I'm saying like zero crime

1693
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
villages right

1694
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
meaning there's

1695
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
okay I have to ask you

1696
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
sorry go ahead if there were enough of the zero crime villages

1697
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
okay if there was enough

1698
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
of that

1699
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
and people go and live inside there

1700
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
like say my wife comes from Indonesia

1701
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
despite all the amount

1702
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
of money

1703
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
quite a lot of immigrants who come here

1704
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
work here want to stay in Malaysia

1705
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
you know they come from around the region

1706
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
with much poorer places maybe like

1707
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Nepal or

1708
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
used to be Thailand

1709
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Sri Lanka

1710
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
countries that have got constant

1711
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
political problems and stuff

1712
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
so

1713
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
people

1714
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
really have a tough time finding a job

1715
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
and stuff like that

1716
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
when they come here many of them they want to stay here

1717
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
because life is better

1718
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
for them here right

1719
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
but this Indonesia

1720
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Java when they come here they want

1721
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
to go back

1722
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
why do they want to go back

1723
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
they see their village

1724
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
as the safety

1725
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
the security of the village

1726
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
the nest

1727
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
is too cozy for them

1728
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
want to trust

1729
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
anything else they want to go back

1730
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
go to the nest

1731
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
so

1732
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
what I'm saying is

1733
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
oh I see wait

1734
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
their way of life is so familiar

1735
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
that the new way of life

1736
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
even though it's amazing

1737
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
they go back to the old one anyways

1738
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
is this what you mean

1739
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
yes or do you mean

1740
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
not just old

1741
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
it's not just old at least one thing

1742
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
is add to the old

1743
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
all plus I won't be sent into an old folks home

1744
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
oh

1745
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
right

1746
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
they just

1747
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
whatever comfort you may give

1748
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
to them in an old folks home

1749
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
they don't want it

1750
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
they want to be

1751
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
poor with their kids

1752
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
their grandkids

1753
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
they want to care

1754
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and be cared for

1755
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
by family members

1756
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
who know their idiosyncrasies

1757
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
not some institution

1758
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
okay that was brilliant

1759
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
yes that's very very true

1760
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I would almost go so far

1761
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
as to say that for most of us

1762
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
that is

1763
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
a implicit

1764
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
feature of our human

1765
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
experience is that

1766
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
as we get older

1767
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
most of us soften

1768
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
and we become vulnerable

1769
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
and

1770
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
it's

1771
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
loneliness is much more difficult to bear

1772
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
than it was

1773
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
when we were younger

1774
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
and we may be infirm and have illnesses

1775
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
and we may need help with certain things

1776
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
so that

1777
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
if I'm in a house where there's children around

1778
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I feel relatively safe

1779
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
if there's something I can't handle

1780
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
they can take care of it

1781
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
you know

1782
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
or my

1783
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
brothers and sisters

1784
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
there's family

1785
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
and if there's not family there's the neighbors

1786
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
and they are family

1787
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
humans naturally

1788
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
do this they family up

1789
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
unless

1790
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
something gets in between them first

1791
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
and one of the main things that gets in between them

1792
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
at least where I live

1793
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
is money

1794
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
the fact that you guys don't have that

1795
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
see

1796
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
in the village

1797
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
the lack of the importance of money

1798
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
is almost like saying

1799
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
we get water that isn't

1800
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
we get relational water

1801
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
that hasn't been pre-poisoned

1802
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
you see

1803
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
it's the same thing you said earlier

1804
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
you said I

1805
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
what did you say

1806
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I'm in

1807
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I'm inclined to

1808
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
unconditional love

1809
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
or something like this

1810
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and I said no you just never defected

1811
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
the villagers don't defect

1812
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
there's nothing that would motivate them to defect

1813
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
a big stack of money

1814
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
they might just laugh at it

1815
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and say like no

1816
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
hmm

1817
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
you know

1818
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I mean

1819
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
to add to what you're saying

1820
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
the helicopter

1821
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
they kind of bail out

1822
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
of their village for a while

1823
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
to get some money

1824
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
to build a house

1825
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
once they get that

1826
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
minimum amount they're back

1827
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
and they don't want to be

1828
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
in the town anymore

1829
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
they want to be back in the village

1830
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
familiar people

1831
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
that's hilarious

1832
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
do you see how much more intelligent that is

1833
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
than what we do

1834
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
in a situation like that

1835
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
where everybody has a shot at surviving

1836
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and so do the relationships

1837
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
that most matter

1838
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
in your heart

1839
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
in the other place

1840
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
where they just go to the village

1841
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
and they stay there

1842
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I mean they go to the town

1843
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
to get the money

1844
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
and then they just stay there

1845
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
they continue to stay there

1846
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
because they bought extra houses

1847
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
they're dying inside

1848
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
they're dying

1849
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
they're going to live

1850
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
after they die

1851
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I mean they're not going to die

1852
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
they must

1853
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
leave so much wealth to the next generation

1854
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
things will be better

1855
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
no they create

1856
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
everybody is doing it

1857
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
crime culture

1858
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
you know despite

1859
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
disparity what we have

1860
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
yeah it's funny because

1861
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I think it's really important when I hear you speak

1862
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
you say

1863
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
and

1864
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I'm not sure

1865
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
that a lot of people even know

1866
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
that such things exist

1867
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
at all

1868
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
in the world

1869
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
obviously

1870
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
yeah no most people would be like

1871
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
what does that even mean

1872
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
although the statement

1873
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
makes it real you know the language makes it

1874
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
relatively clear what it means there's no crime in here

1875
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
but

1876
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and by the way if there's no crime

1877
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
like you probably don't

1878
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
you don't really need cops

1879
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
you might need a fire department

1880
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
but you don't need cops

1881
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
and you don't need weapons

1882
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
you don't need lawyers

1883
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
you don't need guns

1884
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
yeah you don't need an anti-corruption body

1885
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
yeah

1886
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
right right right

1887
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
you don't need courts

1888
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
you don't need prisons

1889
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
all of the people correctness

1890
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
the most ugliest things

1891
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
is like

1892
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
cosmeticized dirt

1893
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
it's really dirty

1894
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
but you put lots of makeup

1895
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
and you stop anybody saying the truth about it

1896
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
yes

1897
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
yes all these things are

1898
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
I mean

1899
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I usually don't think in religious

1900
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
terms but when I see

1901
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
the festering malignance

1902
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
of the prisons and the courts

1903
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
and the cops and the armies

1904
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
and the military and so forth

1905
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
it's hard for me not to think

1906
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
that they're demons

1907
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
they do

1908
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
what actual demons would actually do

1909
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
so it doesn't really matter

1910
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
whether their origin is metaphysical

1911
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
or not they're the same damn thing

1912
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
now look

1913
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
here where we live

1914
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
in the west in America

1915
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
the institutions

1916
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
that

1917
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
that underlie

1918
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
our

1919
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
social agreements

1920
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
our governments

1921
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
which is

1922
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
a big mess of a million little

1923
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
branches

1924
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
our police

1925
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
the military

1926
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
the fire department

1927
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
the hospitals

1928
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
the schools

1929
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
those things

1930
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
yeah

1931
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
some of them are decent

1932
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
we couldn't get along

1933
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
without cops because shit would just turn

1934
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
into the wild wild west we think

1935
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
so we have to have

1936
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
cops

1937
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
and sometimes the cops are

1938
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
an absolute nightmare

1939
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and sometimes they save your life

1940
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
they sort of have both

1941
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
both valences

1942
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
the fire department almost always

1943
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
just does good

1944
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
you know is put out fires

1945
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
okay

1946
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
of all the single jobs

1947
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
you could pick that one seems pretty

1948
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
virtuous the hospitals kind of similar

1949
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
the schools

1950
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
the schools start to get sketchy because

1951
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
it's about slave making and stuff

1952
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
but

1953
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
do you think universities are worse than the schools?

1954
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
the intensity

1955
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
of the

1956
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
light

1957
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
the intensity of the disease

1958
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
in the university is

1959
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
similar

1960
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
to grade schools

1961
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
in high school

1962
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
it's just more sophisticated

1963
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
and highly complex

1964
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
let's just call this

1965
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
the malware in the education

1966
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
system

1967
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
it's in every

1968
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
step

1969
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
it's in every step of the system

1970
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
so the malware is in the whole

1971
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
staircase but the way

1972
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
the malware works up near the top of the staircase

1973
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
and the universities is different

1974
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and there's you know 15 new kinds

1975
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
as of last year

1976
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
that stuff is mutating

1977
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
right as fast

1978
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
as you could try to eradicate it

1979
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
it's

1980
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
it's

1981
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
emerging in new forms as you

1982
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
watch it

1983
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
it's very

1984
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
it's highly

1985
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
resistant to

1986
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
technical intervention

1987
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
it's primary vulnerability

1988
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
is relational

1989
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
intervention change the relationships

1990
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
the malware can't

1991
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
function

1992
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
hey Darren

1993
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
would the US

1994
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
have less of a problem

1995
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
less of a

1996
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
problem

1997
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
if it wasn't

1998
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
if it was

1999
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
five separate countries

2000
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
not messy

2001
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
it's interesting

2002
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
okay the honest answer is of course

2003
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
we don't know

2004
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
the simple

2005
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
wait let me finish

2006
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
the simple correct answer is

2007
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
any attempt

2008
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
at responding would obviously just be my opinion

2009
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
whereas some of the things

2010
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
that I'm talking about are not merely

2011
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
my opinion these are

2012
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
in a sense

2013
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
obvious features of our situation

2014
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
but

2015
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I think

2016
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
that solution

2017
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
or that transformation

2018
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
would change a lot of things

2019
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
we've never really experienced anything

2020
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
much resembling it

2021
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I don't have any data

2022
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
and it's not like we're just asking

2023
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
in a vacuum we're asking

2024
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
in the time and context in which we live

2025
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
so we're asking like

2026
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
if the US split into five bodies in 2024

2027
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
you know

2028
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
what effect do you think

2029
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
that would have on malware and education

2030
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
one

2031
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
feature of the setup that I like

2032
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
is

2033
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
if you've got five petri dishes

2034
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
in which to attempt to

2035
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
spawn

2036
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
something

2037
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
more intelligent than our educational system

2038
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
you'd have five shots at it

2039
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
instead of one

2040
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
but you can actually have

2041
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
as many shots as you want

2042
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
because the fact that

2043
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
you know

2044
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I mean anybody who wants to is free

2045
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
to start some kind of new educational system

2046
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
most people aren't that bold

2047
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
and there have been attempts

2048
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
in the states we have Waldorf schools

2049
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
for example

2050
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
which are wildly different

2051
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
from standard educational system

2052
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
you don't hear much

2053
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
talked about

2054
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
what happens to Waldorf students

2055
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
for example as

2056
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
they go hard

2057
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
are they

2058
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
better citizens than the others

2059
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
because

2060
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I don't know what the data is on that

2061
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
what is that Rudolf Steiner's game

2062
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I think it was

2063
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
yeah Rudolf Steiner as well

2064
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
one of my girlfriends

2065
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
had been raised in a Waldorf school

2066
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
and I'd known a couple of other people

2067
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
who were

2068
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
and even when I was young

2069
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
some of the same

2070
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
ideas were used to

2071
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
build

2072
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
a school that had one classroom

2073
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
for all the ages

2074
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
so like a central eye

2075
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
like you know unity

2076
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
we'll keep all the ages together

2077
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
they can learn together

2078
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
help each other

2079
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
instead of segmenting them

2080
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
didn't go very well

2081
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
for who knows 10 reasons to Sunday

2082
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
but

2083
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
but yeah I don't know

2084
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
it will go well because

2085
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
the malignancy

2086
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
spread across so many aspects

2087
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
yes look

2088
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
look

2089
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
you know I can imagine

2090
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
a science fiction story where we go

2091
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
to

2092
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
we pick

2093
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
70 billionaires

2094
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and we go to them

2095
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
and we tell them

2096
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
we will educate your children

2097
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
we will give your children an educational

2098
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
experience that they will

2099
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
always be excited about

2100
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
and they will outperform anything you can buy

2101
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
from anyone else

2102
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
and so you build the system

2103
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
experimentally that way

2104
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
you learn how to do that

2105
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
right that way

2106
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
and then you just attack

2107
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
the whole fucking school system from there

2108
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
with the same

2109
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
with whatever you can produce from that breeder reactor

2110
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
right

2111
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
how do we actually get children

2112
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
meaningful

2113
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
human experience

2114
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
and at the same time deep

2115
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
representational intelligence

2116
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
and one of the best ways to do that is just to

2117
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
teach them the

2118
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
structure of representational cognition

2119
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
once they see that

2120
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
they will never bow to it

2121
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
they will manipulate it from above

2122
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
just like humans should always do

2123
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
it's okay if we have representations

2124
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
we have to manipulate them from above

2125
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
we have to not be manipulated

2126
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
we have to not be puppeted by our own

2127
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
representations does that make sense

2128
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
yep

2129
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
yep

2130
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
and you can teach this

2131
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
this is teachable stuff

2132
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
right this is stuff we could discover

2133
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
those features of language

2134
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
and modern thought

2135
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
those features simple

2136
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
semantic and linguistic and philosophic features

2137
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
that you could teach to children and adults

2138
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
that would mostly

2139
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
free them

2140
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
at least in their minds

2141
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
from I don't know

2142
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
68% of the traps

2143
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
they're going to face in consciousness throughout

2144
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
their lifetime

2145
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
like

2146
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
we're walking around wearing like

2147
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
iron cages in our minds

2148
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
us humans

2149
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
so far most of us

2150
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I am myself included to the degree

2151
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
that I live in a city I'm

2152
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
subject to the same

2153
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
problem

2154
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
I'm a prisoner dreaming of a jailbreak

2155
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
where it sounds like for you

2156
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
you know where outside the jail is

2157
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
and you intend to get there right quick

2158
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
yep

2159
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
yeah

2160
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
is Benji with you

2161
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
wow

2162
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
say that again

2163
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
is Benji with you where you are

2164
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
yeah I mean

2165
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I thought I heard him

2166
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
barking oh not right now

2167
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
no not right now

2168
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
earlier he was

2169
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
he was just staying here

2170
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
before I started talking to him

2171
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
yeah cause I heard him

2172
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
okay okay

2173
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
yeah

2174
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
it's quite a character once

2175
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
but

2176
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
it's saved my sanity

2177
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
now so

2178
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
it has me

2179
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
to really much better understand

2180
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
the village scene

2181
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
cause you get lost one of the things

2182
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
is

2183
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
me too

2184
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I wanted to achieve

2185
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
you know you've got this right

2186
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
so

2187
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
all kinds of people like not just

2188
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
everybody like 10 out of 10

2189
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
100 out of 100

2190
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
1000 out of 1000 people

2191
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
only know achievement by hey

2192
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
how much wealth do you have

2193
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
that's what I said

2194
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
yeah it's a sick standard

2195
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
that

2196
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
turns everything to one thing

2197
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
so when you ask them you know

2198
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
determine your value

2199
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
as a person

2200
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
they want to know what property you own

2201
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
who you're married to

2202
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
you know are you

2203
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
are you well bred

2204
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
do you come from power

2205
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
do you come from money

2206
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
like for example

2207
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
you know I got suspended by

2208
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
LinkedIn you know

2209
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
of being forthright

2210
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
because fellas were

2211
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
doing con job in Singapore

2212
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
so I was like stop

2213
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I mean just generally it pisses me off

2214
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
like nobody

2215
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
speaks up against a

2216
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
blatant con

2217
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
yeah okay I agree

2218
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
but let's agree

2219
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
together that we will try to

2220
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
discover how to do things that are effective

2221
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
yep

2222
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
right so that even

2223
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
if we take on some kind of small

2224
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
mission together even the mission of this

2225
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
conversation cause this you know this works

2226
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
then let's just have

2227
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
the some simple agreements

2228
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I'm not trying to write these in stone

2229
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
but we will try to help each other see better

2230
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
and if action is required

2231
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
we will try to find very effective ways

2232
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
to act

2233
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
because LinkedIn

2234
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
is like putting a

2235
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
firecracker in the fire department

2236
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
like they're just waiting

2237
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
for someone to go sideways

2238
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
it's the same with Facebook

2239
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
those are battlegrounds

2240
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
that's enemy

2241
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
own terrain

2242
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
this is part of why I am

2243
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
careful

2244
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
mostly careful on Facebook

2245
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
it's funny you know

2246
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
a few days ago I did something I

2247
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
never ever do

2248
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I posted

2249
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
some comments from a news

2250
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
source on a political

2251
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
issue

2252
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
and it wasn't any

2253
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
rowdy it wasn't any specifically radical

2254
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
statement

2255
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
over the next two weeks

2256
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
that post got zero views

2257
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
none

2258
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
no one saw it

2259
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
wow shadow ban

2260
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
yeah not an accident

2261
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
so devious isn't it

2262
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
such a devious thing to do

2263
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
well I'll tell you

2264
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Valala

2265
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
there's we could

2266
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
we could take that model

2267
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
and flip it over

2268
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
that model

2269
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
okay

2270
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
that thing gives us a model of what not

2271
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
to do

2272
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
if you have a really good model of what not

2273
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
to do

2274
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
you can flip it over

2275
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
and no one will not want to be there

2276
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
like

2277
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I have a model of how to build a system

2278
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
on the internet

2279
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
that

2280
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
puts this back together

2281
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
keeps all our data and communications

2282
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
private

2283
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
okay helps us get smarter

2284
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
every time we make a move

2285
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
with a machine of any kind

2286
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
okay yep

2287
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and produces a social

2288
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
adventuring system

2289
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
so that people form teams to

2290
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
accomplish you know

2291
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
instead of putting a ball through a hoop

2292
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
right

2293
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
we accomplish something in the actual world

2294
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
of humans

2295
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
you've been developing it

2296
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I have a model

2297
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I can show you a model of how we could do it

2298
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
and also

2299
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
here's the thing that's actually

2300
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
a little more compelling

2301
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
okay the way

2302
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
that system works is a model of how we can play

2303
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
together

2304
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
without machines

2305
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
we don't need machines to do it

2306
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
we naturally do it together

2307
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
hmm

2308
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
if most of the malware isn't running

2309
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
we naturally do this together

2310
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I'm just trying to

2311
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
demonstrate that there's a way that we can take

2312
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
the electronic infrastructure of the internet

2313
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
and do something completely

2314
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
the opposite of what we're doing with it

2315
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
and it would be

2316
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
everything that currently exists

2317
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
and it would I mean

2318
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
there's so many abilities you could have

2319
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
with it

2320
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
that we don't have

2321
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
and look I'm not a big fan

2322
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
of link the humans to machines

2323
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
that's not

2324
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
my favorite game plan by a long shot

2325
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
the problem I have

2326
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
is that the humans are linked to

2327
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
machines

2328
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
hmm

2329
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
we might want to capture some humans

2330
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
and give them a shot at liberty

2331
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
or at least discovering

2332
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
what that might mean

2333
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
we might need to capture their machines

2334
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
yes

2335
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
we might need those

2336
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
machines doing something different

2337
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
then what they're doing

2338
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
like something non vampiric with the humans

2339
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
yep

2340
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
these are just thoughts but

2341
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I do

2342
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
I think very deeply about these matters

2343
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
because I want

2344
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I want the experience

2345
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
of being with other humans

2346
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
doing meaningful things

2347
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
that's what I actually want

2348
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
yep

2349
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
really

2350
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
say that much

2351
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
because

2352
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I

2353
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
like

2354
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I just

2355
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I kind of like

2356
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
when I said enough of these machines

2357
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I just run away

2358
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
yes

2359
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
both go

2360
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I don't want to explain

2361
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
and be politically correct

2362
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
and use the language to

2363
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
just go

2364
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
hey

2365
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
but I hear you

2366
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
100% on

2367
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I tend to do things

2368
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
more effectively than I

2369
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
have

2370
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
meaning

2371
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
in the transition

2372
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
you have to get into the machines

2373
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
that they are attached to

2374
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
to get them off the machines

2375
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
for example

2376
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
if all the kids are going to have phones

2377
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
we have to give those kids

2378
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
something on their phones

2379
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
that it doesn't eat them alive

2380
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
and

2381
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
to even

2382
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
get them to instruct them

2383
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
to get them to work together

2384
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
on an offline activity

2385
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
and

2386
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
what I have in mind

2387
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
as I talk to you here

2388
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
is confederating and intense

2389
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
making a bit more intense

2390
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
village life

2391
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
in a village and small town life

2392
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
in Indonesia

2393
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
a country of 20 million people

2394
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
one of the

2395
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
last bastions of reality

2396
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
you know

2397
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
the funny thing is

2398
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
it's ironic

2399
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
if you

2400
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
one of the questions that I had

2401
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
in our conversation

2402
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
for you that I haven't asked you yet

2403
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
is do you want your village to have a voice

2404
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
yes

2405
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
with which it speaks to the world

2406
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
yes

2407
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
okay so I thought

2408
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
perhaps this might be so

2409
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
and what I'm trying to tell you is

2410
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
that's not

2411
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
impossible

2412
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
but to protect the village

2413
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
that voice might have to be anonymous

2414
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
sure all of that's good

2415
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
if okay but if something

2416
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
if the world realizes

2417
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
there's a zero crime village

2418
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
that's not gonna go well dude

2419
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
that will not go well

2420
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
because they'll come over

2421
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
then they'll think

2422
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
they'll get past it is it

2423
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
there's 15 things

2424
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
that can go wrong with that

2425
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
but I did have the same idea

2426
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
early in our conversation I thought to myself

2427
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
wait

2428
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
there's a zero crime village

2429
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
holy cow like we need to get these people on the radio

2430
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
to the other villages

2431
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
we need to link the zero crime villages

2432
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
around the world

2433
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
these people need to have a voice

2434
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
and then I thought wait a minute

2435
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
that sounds like

2436
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
setting up a

2437
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
sky beacon to 15

2438
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
different kinds of vampires

2439
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
just like I can't wait

2440
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
to extract whatever nectar they're managing

2441
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
to produce over there

2442
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
and commodify that and bank the

2443
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
bank the profit

2444
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
you know

2445
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I've said that you know what it is

2446
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
a whole bunch of things

2447
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
has it like it's not that easy

2448
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I'll give you a few examples

2449
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
if you go to India

2450
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
if you go to even Malaysia

2451
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
pretty much

2452
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
all good sources of natural water

2453
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
from the mountains

2454
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
has been taken over by a Nestle

2455
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
or a company like that

2456
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
this is what I mean by vampires

2457
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
they're straight up vampires

2458
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
they go after the water

2459
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
I'm with you

2460
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
they know how to do the TV

2461
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
advertising and the search engine

2462
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
all that stuff

2463
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
we'll give you candy bars

2464
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
you know

2465
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
but

2466
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
in Indonesia

2467
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
the politics

2468
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
is such

2469
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
that it's very hard to

2470
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
it seems like

2471
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
many layers

2472
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
and it's not

2473
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
it's not mainstream

2474
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
it's not organized so that you can say

2475
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
this is one layer

2476
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
this is exactly

2477
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
it's just kind of like a bit all over the place

2478
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
so it's like

2479
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
meaning for example to get the mountain water

2480
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
right by a Nestle

2481
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
they have to get 18 different approvals

2482
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
and those

2483
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
they're not in 4 or 5 camps

2484
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
they're like all over the place

2485
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
so you can't

2486
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
people don't try

2487
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
seems like they try and give up

2488
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
and it doesn't go anywhere

2489
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
so they go after a few things

2490
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
like national telephone

2491
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
they can get somewhere

2492
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
but not anything that has got

2493
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
too much of a regional

2494
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
local footing

2495
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
like water from a river from a mountain

2496
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
whoever

2497
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
the people

2498
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
in the villages nearby

2499
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
the people affected by that river

2500
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
have enough of a sea

2501
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
and sometimes have enough of a

2502
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
stop it

2503
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
doesn't get there

2504
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
so yeah

2505
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I can't

2506
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
explain exactly all why

2507
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
but one big difference

2508
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
between Indonesia

2509
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
and quite a lot of

2510
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
the rest of the world

2511
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
I mean this just makes me think

2512
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I'm sorry to say this but it just makes me think

2513
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Nestle is right now talking

2514
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
to Bard about how to break that trap

2515
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
right Nestle is going to

2516
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
straight up use AI and go like

2517
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
okay this trap has 19 parts

2518
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
for this

2519
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
here's three solutions with a 70% chance

2520
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
of success and here's 19

2521
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
with a 58

2522
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
that will not last

2523
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
that safety won't last

2524
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I mean who knows what's going to happen

2525
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
the world is wildly unpredictable

2526
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
we could be living in a

2527
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
from now on it might just be like a storm

2528
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
of black swans

2529
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
events that we never predicted

2530
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
but

2531
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
there's certainly much

2532
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
more of those now than there

2533
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
ever were

2534
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
in our lives

2535
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
but go ahead

2536
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
somehow

2537
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
you know

2538
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
the alternative

2539
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
to me like life in Malaysia

2540
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
has gone downhill and when I sense

2541
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
the US has gone downhill

2542
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
at a very fundamental

2543
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
give the individual

2544
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
in a

2545
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
soul

2546
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
you know

2547
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I mean

2548
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
like

2549
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
why must there be like

2550
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
virtually no choice except to be

2551
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
to go into an old folks home

2552
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
why can't the family unit be together

2553
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I mean what's

2554
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
yes because

2555
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
it's the difference between a modern culture

2556
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
and a traditional culture

2557
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
and look

2558
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
some

2559
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
in some nations

2560
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
there is still

2561
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
traditional culture there's even some of it

2562
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
here in the United States where the children

2563
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
just naturally care for their parents and grandparents

2564
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
and so forth

2565
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
but mostly it comes from other countries

2566
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
because

2567
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
for some reason

2568
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
during the origin of this nation

2569
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
that value

2570
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
was not

2571
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
emphasized

2572
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
it was much more about

2573
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
the privilege entitlement

2574
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
defection

2575
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
and addiction of the individual

2576
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
you know like I said is basically

2577
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
just malware

2578
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
it's relational malware

2579
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
or you know perhaps that's one useful way

2580
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
to think about it it's not the only way

2581
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
but yeah that tradition wasn't preserved

2582
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
if you go to Japan it's there

2583
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I don't know how much in

2584
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
various places in China it is

2585
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Russia is a bit more like

2586
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
the United States

2587
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
France and England

2588
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
more like

2589
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
the United States but some other countries

2590
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
the tradition is alive

2591
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
and in most

2592
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
countries that didn't suffer

2593
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
eradicative colonization

2594
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
that tradition

2595
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
you know

2596
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
lives

2597
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
it's naturally I think it's naturally

2598
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
human it's not the only game

2599
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
in town but I think it's naturally

2600
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
human

2601
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I mean the problem

2602
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
in modern countries is we want convenience

2603
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
and grandma and grandpa are wildly

2604
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
inconvenient

2605
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I'd rather defect by watching some

2606
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
comedy channel on TV

2607
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
than deal with you know

2608
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
whatever's going on with my ancestors

2609
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
it's a defection based culture

2610
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
sorry go ahead

2611
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
there is other ramifications too

2612
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
like all folks right

2613
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
yeah

2614
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
no the all folks who like the children

2615
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
sorry go ahead

2616
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
no like the whole

2617
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
90%

2618
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
for example 90% of

2619
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
medical expenses

2620
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
of that sort right

2621
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
it's incurred in the last year

2622
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
of a proper person's life and stuff

2623
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
and like that's not why not die

2624
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
a year earlier

2625
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
yeah

2626
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
well the main reason

2627
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
you don't want to die a year earlier

2628
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
is because there's nothing has been fulfilling

2629
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
in your life you've been living a life

2630
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
of just defecting from

2631
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
whatever you might have otherwise

2632
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
participated in

2633
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
it's very safe

2634
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
but it's extremely lonely and boring

2635
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I mean like

2636
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
you die in your village

2637
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
together with the other people

2638
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
and so you're not drug

2639
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
onto

2640
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
onto a really hopeless

2641
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
medical system

2642
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
and you know

2643
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
supposedly wants to

2644
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
keep you alive but

2645
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
it is actually vampiric

2646
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
yeah

2647
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
literally it just sucks

2648
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
the life out of you and then it sucks the money

2649
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
out of your family for sucking the life out of you

2650
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
it's like a double vampire

2651
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I mean if someone said hey would you want

2652
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
it on this game we're gonna suck the life out of this person

2653
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
you're gonna get that life and we're gonna suck the money out of their family

2654
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
you're gonna get the money you want some

2655
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
a lot of people would sure say yes

2656
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
so

2657
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
and come on

2658
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
with all the challenges

2659
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
and don't you think

2660
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
don't you think

2661
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
AI would be used to like

2662
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
make this explicit and

2663
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
this is not really

2664
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
this is a forced in bargain

2665
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
that's not a bargain

2666
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
yeah I mean

2667
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
although the problem is that the AIs

2668
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
are curated and it would be

2669
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
just as much of a problem if they weren't

2670
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
like the humans have really invented

2671
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
something very

2672
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
very dangerous here

2673
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
and it's not without

2674
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
promise

2675
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
but as we know

2676
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
from looking historically at humans and

2677
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
technology

2678
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
that shit goes

2679
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
sideways right

2680
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
after the idealism

2681
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
is overcome

2682
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
by piracy

2683
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
today

2684
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
despite all

2685
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
the negatives

2686
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
of the US

2687
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
medical insurance system

2688
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
and how it's based

2689
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
and all that stuff

2690
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
enough

2691
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
let's say at the

2692
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
public intellectual level

2693
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
enough of us know that

2694
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
also in Canada

2695
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
seems to be doing it a bit better

2696
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
in other European countries

2697
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Australia seems to be doing it better

2698
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
than the US

2699
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
exactly there are examples of countries

2700
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
that do it pretty well we might imagine

2701
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
okay but

2702
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
that doesn't seem to be portable

2703
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
into the US

2704
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
we can't look at a guy who gives an excuse

2705
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
oh we are the US

2706
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
okay look

2707
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
what you don't okay look the problem

2708
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
here is that

2709
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
and this is an

2710
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
ironic problem

2711
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
we actually call this country

2712
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
the US

2713
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
that is the word us

2714
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
and that

2715
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
along with many

2716
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
unfortunate features

2717
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
of our history

2718
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
incline

2719
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
the citizens of the United States

2720
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
to think

2721
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
in a way that is fundamentally

2722
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
black and white

2723
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
fundamentalistic

2724
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
you know it's fundamental in its

2725
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
fundamentalist

2726
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
in its understanding of us

2727
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
and them

2728
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
who are we and who are they

2729
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
and most of the us's

2730
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
are fake

2731
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
right the same way most of them

2732
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
are

2733
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
but if you identify with one of those fake us's

2734
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
you inherit a bunch of them

2735
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
and this is a kind of an us and them

2736
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
economy

2737
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
that the US is amazing

2738
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
at

2739
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
it's like being amazing at

2740
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
filling your own organs with cancer

2741
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
or something relationally

2742
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
it will never work intelligently

2743
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
but this is

2744
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
a fundamental problem with us

2745
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
yeah it's bad

2746
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
despite the fact that

2747
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I mean your states

2748
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
and municipalities have enough

2749
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
independence for example

2750
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I do

2751
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
but Miami goes up

2752
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
yep

2753
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
they can

2754
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
but they generally don't because

2755
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
the malware

2756
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
the influence

2757
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
of the malware is powerful

2758
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
right

2759
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
politics in the United States

2760
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
is a lot about

2761
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
what

2762
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
various kinds of theft

2763
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
counterfeiting value

2764
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
counterfeiting value

2765
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
more effectively than your opponent

2766
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
get the money

2767
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
and then

2768
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
a sort of

2769
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
complex back room favor

2770
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
exchange among politicians

2771
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
so

2772
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
it's like

2773
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
the structure of the system might be

2774
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
sound we've never implemented

2775
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
that system does that make sense

2776
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
it's just a layer of

2777
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
it's like a multi-layer

2778
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
cake of seven kinds of piracy

2779
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
floating on top of the structure

2780
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
as it stands as a legal

2781
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
or

2782
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
you know sociological

2783
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
agreement system

2784
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
mostly the structure

2785
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
doesn't get implemented

2786
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
what gets implemented is piracy

2787
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
and vampirism

2788
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Ramaswamy

2789
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
was running

2790
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
for a while and

2791
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
articulates that you can sense that

2792
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
for example

2793
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
he talks about

2794
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
getting rid of the

2795
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
FBI

2796
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Trump

2797
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
because Trump was

2798
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
caught by the civil servants

2799
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
that you can't

2800
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
there are too many laws

2801
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
that stop you from firing

2802
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
civil servants

2803
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
but

2804
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Ramaswamy was saying that

2805
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
that is the case when you're

2806
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
firing individual civil servants

2807
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
but if you're having a mass

2808
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
restructuring

2809
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
the law allows you to do that

2810
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
and with

2811
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
the Supreme Court as it's stated

2812
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
as it's constituted

2813
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
because it's got

2814
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
enough of a majority of Trump appointing

2815
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
a conservative

2816
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
who are ready for

2817
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
who see the sense

2818
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
of

2819
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
the president has the right

2820
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
to restructure the FBI

2821
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
by executive order

2822
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I mean this guy is

2823
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
possibly even the constitution

2824
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I mean

2825
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Trump is basically

2826
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
okay

2827
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Trump

2828
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
is really dangerous

2829
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
in my view for two reasons

2830
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
the first is that he is

2831
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
successfully circumvented

2832
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
regulation in the past

2833
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
and

2834
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
the second is that

2835
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
he has not only

2836
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
he has no respect for regulation

2837
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
he's a scoff law

2838
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
right and a scoff law

2839
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
will

2840
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
earn the vote of

2841
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
every male scoff law

2842
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
in the United States just for that one

2843
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
reason

2844
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
and okay the third thing that's dangerous

2845
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
about him is he has shown

2846
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
much smarter people

2847
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
what is possible

2848
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
and what he has shown is possible

2849
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
is as follows

2850
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
the United States as a nation

2851
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
can be captured

2852
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
by a single male human being

2853
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
he's shown them that

2854
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
he's basically shined a flashlight

2855
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
on a part of the game

2856
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
that nobody really believed

2857
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
was possible he's doing the impossible

2858
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
he's going from

2859
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
he's gonna go from 0 to 100

2860
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
he's gonna have a go at the impossible

2861
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
and he's old enough that he probably doesn't

2862
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
give much of a shit if he fails

2863
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
he's got nothing to lose

2864
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
right it's all

2865
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
anything he gets done is gravy

2866
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
right

2867
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
like he can do anything

2868
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
that works

2869
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
so yeah this is

2870
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
this is dangerous shit

2871
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
he's shown others

2872
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
who are much more intelligent than him

2873
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
that the prize can be had

2874
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
you can take the virgin home with you

2875
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
for sure

2876
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
you can have a whole family

2877
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
you know

2878
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
that whole thing you can just grab that whole

2879
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
damn thing in one fell swoop

2880
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
right and here's how you do it

2881
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
you start with these moves over

2882
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
here you place some judges on the Supreme Court

2883
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Bing bang boom

2884
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
casino payoff

2885
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
right that's really

2886
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
dangerous he's shown others that it

2887
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
can be done

2888
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
he's relatively stupid in my view

2889
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
or at least he plays that face really well

2890
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
but

2891
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
damn what a fucking dangerous

2892
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
idiot oh my god

2893
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
but

2894
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
hey Darren

2895
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
when you had Hillary

2896
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
you know running against

2897
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Hillary Clinton running against

2898
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
didn't it occur to you

2899
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
that my god the US has failed

2900
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
if these people

2901
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
are running for president

2902
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
that's brilliantly said but yeah

2903
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
no that occurred to me

2904
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
some

2905
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
okay I'm pretty sure

2906
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
that occurred to me when I was six

2907
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
and I watched

2908
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
John F. Kennedy being executed

2909
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
in Texas over and over again on TV

2910
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
and you know

2911
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
juxtaposed with some of his speeches

2912
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
no that dream died

2913
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
in me a long

2914
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
time ago my friend

2915
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I mean I was born

2916
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
the month after Kennedy

2917
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
was executed and I've seen

2918
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
that guy speak

2919
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I've never seen anything

2920
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
in politics resembling

2921
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
the appearance

2922
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
of true human

2923
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
virtue

2924
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
that I saw in him

2925
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I note that it's the appearance

2926
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I'm not saying the guy was a saint

2927
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I'm saying

2928
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
in a room full of demons

2929
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
he stood out brightly

2930
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
and that happened only a couple

2931
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
times during my lifetime

2932
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
you know

2933
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Carter might not have been a great president

2934
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
but he wasn't evil

2935
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
so to me like

2936
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
if you can allow

2937
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
a contest like that

2938
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
you fail and what else

2939
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
can you expect of a failed

2940
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
system apparently

2941
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
I think most Americans expect

2942
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
that the failure of the United States

2943
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
has to end

2944
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
with a bunch of bloodshed and violence

2945
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
preferably as much as possible

2946
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
maybe even apocalypse level

2947
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
right if we're going to go out

2948
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
we're not going to switch

2949
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
to a new system

2950
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
we're going to take the planet with us

2951
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
just like any insane psychopath

2952
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
we're not going to try a new way

2953
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
of doing this

2954
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
we're going to blow shit up

2955
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
because

2956
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
there's a feature

2957
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
in private cognition

2958
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
that can be inflamed enough

2959
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
and the human societies resemble

2960
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
the shadow

2961
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
of this problem

2962
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
so

2963
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
the kid who

2964
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
alright

2965
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I could probably tell you

2966
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
a lot about what happens

2967
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
when some

2968
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
kid picks up an automatic weapon

2969
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
and goes to a public place

2970
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
and just opens up on the people there

2971
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
because what's happening in that kid's mind

2972
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
is

2973
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
a reflection

2974
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
of a feature

2975
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
of our society

2976
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
and that feature is

2977
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I will win

2978
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
whether I

2979
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
deserve to or not

2980
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
and if I don't win

2981
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
everybody dies

2982
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
there's a feature of private cognition

2983
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
in that way

2984
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
there's a feature of our own minds

2985
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
that works that way and it gets reflected

2986
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
in the social cognition

2987
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
of modern humans

2988
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
and that's the thing that produces

2989
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
stuff like

2990
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I don't know

2991
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Hitler, Putin invading Ukraine

2992
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
maybe there's stuff

2993
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I don't know about that move

2994
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
but that looks insane to me

2995
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
from outside

2996
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Israel pounding Gaza into dust

2997
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
not dissimilar except in that case

2998
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
somebody punched them first

2999
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
so it seems

3000
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
yep

3001
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
yep

3002
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I think the people there

3003
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I remember when 9-11 happened in the United States

3004
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I had two thoughts

3005
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
the first was

3006
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
15 people just changed the course

3007
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
of the nation in 12 hours

3008
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
wow I thought it could be done

3009
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
and then the second was

3010
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
oh my god are we in trouble now

3011
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
we're gonna go chasing the wrong

3012
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
we're gonna go killing

3013
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
the wrong

3014
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
scapegoat

3015
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
for

3016
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
yeah we're gonna kill the wrong scapegoat

3017
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
and that's gonna create

3018
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
a future

3019
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
of enmity and hatred

3020
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
and blood oaths of vengeance

3021
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
and things like this

3022
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
both thoughts

3023
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
now I'm not an advocate

3024
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
of changing the course of nations with violence

3025
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I want to be very clear about that

3026
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
but I did notice that a very small

3027
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
group of humans in this

3028
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
was like the course of I don't know 48 hours

3029
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
they

3030
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
radically altered the course of an entire

3031
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
nation that made me realize

3032
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
that the principle was real

3033
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
small number of people

3034
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I just imagine the

3035
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I'm trying to figure out what's the opposite

3036
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
of a bomb and how do we make one

3037
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
what's the opposite of a bomb

3038
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
yeah what's the human relational

3039
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
opposite of a bomb

3040
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
and how do we make one

3041
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I want to make the opposite of a bomb

3042
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I want something that

3043
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
heals things back together

3044
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
explosively and contagiously

3045
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
it just starts crystallizing

3046
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
the whole network toward

3047
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
intelligent unity

3048
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I can imagine it

3049
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I can see it in my mind

3050
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
it's possible

3051
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
yes yes yes

3052
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
it's positive

3053
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
it doesn't occur to me right now

3054
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
but what occurs

3055
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
to me is I come across

3056
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
such

3057
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
what appears to be

3058
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
opposites but they may just be complementary

3059
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
at a level that

3060
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I'm not

3061
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
familiar with because

3062
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
it's not discussed enough

3063
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
you and me

3064
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
what you're writing is so rare

3065
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
but it's so appealing

3066
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
and it would be even better

3067
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
if there were a few more people

3068
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
who could engage at your level

3069
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
so that there can be interaction on it

3070
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
not just pedantic

3071
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
interaction as to what do you mean

3072
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
and what do you mean

3073
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
people doing their own

3074
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
homework right

3075
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
and then reflecting and then

3076
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
passing

3077
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
and weaving

3078
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
or actually

3079
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
initiating projects

3080
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
even better

3081
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
doing stuff together

3082
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
that's what I want to do

3083
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I'm good at

3084
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
cuddling people together

3085
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
you know

3086
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
a lot of people

3087
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
because of low confidence

3088
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I like to say

3089
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
oh I don't understand

3090
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
come come come

3091
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
look we can take them

3092
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
to nursery school

3093
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
if that's the case

3094
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
we can do very simple

3095
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
exploratory

3096
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
stuff together

3097
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
so that they get a taste for the water

3098
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
they don't have them in the water

3099
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
they don't have to become

3100
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
mercenaries or something

3101
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
right

3102
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
we just introduce them to the water

3103
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
a little bit at a time and say

3104
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
hey are you comfortable here

3105
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
okay let's go to the next step

3106
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
beautiful

3107
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
we can learn

3108
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
together how to do this

3109
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
in the same way your mother

3110
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
attended

3111
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
the mind of your childhood

3112
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
we can start out

3113
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
with the presumption that we're all

3114
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
intelligent, playful, creative

3115
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
human beings together

3116
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
and then we can just make simple

3117
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
moves

3118
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
like a kid learning how to stand up

3119
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
we can do it

3120
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
it's not hard to do

3121
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
humans naturally are good at this

3122
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
you can get them doing this kind of thing

3123
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I think

3124
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I do have a small group

3125
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I experiment with

3126
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
we try some actual stuff

3127
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I'm not just talking

3128
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
and I'm not

3129
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
I guess I'm afraid

3130
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
of being pedantic

3131
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I want to be active

3132
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
not pedantic

3133
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
okay

3134
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
you want to be substantial

3135
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
I mean you want to

3136
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
do

3137
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
yeah let's fail

3138
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
as long as we're doing something no problem

3139
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
yep

3140
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
that's it

3141
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
and as you were mentioning

3142
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I was thinking of the school

3143
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
in my village and the kids

3144
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
I wonder about that

3145
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
that must be amazing

3146
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
what's that like have you been in there

3147
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
have you been in a classroom do you know

3148
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
how they relate with the children

3149
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
the

3150
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
the school is not good

3151
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
the school is not great

3152
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
it doesn't open them

3153
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
but they're not bad compared to

3154
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
other schools as well

3155
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
they're not too kind of like a nannish

3156
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
or monitor

3157
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
they're not that either

3158
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
on the other hand they don't

3159
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
they don't allow for any creativity

3160
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
they want them to follow the rules

3161
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
yeah it sounds typically western

3162
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
or worse

3163
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
yeah regimented

3164
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
regimented so

3165
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
but

3166
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
when the kids come out of school

3167
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
back to their villages

3168
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
back and all that

3169
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
to me they're learning a lot

3170
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
when they're playing

3171
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
with their families

3172
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
they're imitating their dance

3173
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
they're preparing

3174
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
because parents are preparing

3175
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
for somebody's wedding or feast

3176
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
they're helping out and they're watching

3177
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
watching over people

3178
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
and parents are also going to

3179
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
to the plot of land

3180
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
and planting rice

3181
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
they're helping the parents

3182
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
with planting the rice

3183
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
and tending to the garden and stuff like that

3184
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
overall

3185
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
they're apprenticing

3186
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
the bigger role for them is not

3187
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
what I go to school and then after school

3188
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I was going to get a job no

3189
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
in the case of the girls

3190
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I'll be

3191
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
my mother

3192
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
they become good mothers

3193
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
and they become good healers

3194
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
taking care of people

3195
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
they seem to learn

3196
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
because it is traditional

3197
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
to take care of each other

3198
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
yeah

3199
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
so we just need to expand

3200
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
that to because

3201
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
expand that to hey

3202
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
whether you choose to do it at home

3203
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
or you choose to do a bigger thing

3204
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
between villages

3205
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
medical things or even computers

3206
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
all the other things

3207
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
that you need to do in today's world

3208
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
it's not you'll get bullied

3209
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
by countries that do

3210
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
with weapons

3211
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
you've got to act together

3212
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
to a level that

3213
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
you're able to defend yourself too

3214
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
you're productive enough

3215
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
making enough returns

3216
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
so that's enough of your people can be soldiers

3217
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
like they were like societies were

3218
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
I know but now

3219
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
will come the malware

3220
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm afraid

3221
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
once

3222
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
it's like it comes with

3223
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
the police and the soldiers to have soldiers

3224
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
you have money problems

3225
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
you need money

3226
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
now what will happen to the village

3227
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I am afraid I hear you though

3228
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
will you continue with your thought

3229
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I see so good

3230
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I like your candidness

3231
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
because you know what

3232
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
when you mention that

3233
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
one thing I agree

3234
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
pay attention to that

3235
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
what do we do about it

3236
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
how do we anticipate it

3237
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
the other thing that comes to me is

3238
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
when the

3239
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
societies were very strong

3240
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
the villagers

3241
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
didn't have police

3242
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
they didn't need

3243
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
any arms

3244
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
to have the strongest villages

3245
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
because

3246
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
they were able to anticipate

3247
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
somewhat like in nature

3248
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
how is it that

3249
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
there is quite a lot of law and order

3250
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
in a tropical forest

3251
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I mean we think of

3252
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
actually there's

3253
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
not law and order

3254
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
I'm not sure that there's a lot of

3255
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
well maybe I'm not understanding you

3256
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
properly yet

3257
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I'm not sure there's a lot of law and order

3258
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
there's a lot of non

3259
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
not defecting

3260
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
but go ahead

3261
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
do you mean law and order between

3262
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
the insects and the plants and the animals

3263
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
do you mean that kind of law

3264
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
or between tribes

3265
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
no I mean

3266
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
between the 10,000 species

3267
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
okay yeah

3268
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
I mean there's something there

3269
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I don't think it's law and order

3270
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
it's intimacy

3271
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
right it's one animal

3272
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
in a billion bodies

3273
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
so they don't defect from intimacy

3274
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
therefore no laws

3275
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
are required and there are no orders

3276
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
so you see like

3277
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
they can share the same I mean like

3278
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
you have birds and you have insects

3279
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
and lizards and ants

3280
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
and they can have

3281
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
like

3282
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
kind of like unawaresly share the space

3283
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
yes

3284
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
yep

3285
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
but if the lizard get hungry

3286
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
the insect better move

3287
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
if the bird gets hungry

3288
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
yeah

3289
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
all of that but you know like

3290
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
when you're walking through a forest

3291
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
whatever that seems like a minority

3292
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
the exception is

3293
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
share the food

3294
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
but that is not the

3295
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
versus

3296
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
in the case of human beings

3297
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
we've made it like the capital issue

3298
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
and it's not just

3299
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
we've made it it really is

3300
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
a big deal that

3301
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
we

3302
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
we've gone downhill

3303
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
yes

3304
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
no we're collapsing toward

3305
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
the worst potentials

3306
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
of our species

3307
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
rapidly

3308
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
we're

3309
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
we're all contributing to this collapse

3310
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
actively

3311
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
instead of doing any other thing

3312
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
and mostly I think it's because

3313
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
A we don't know what to do

3314
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
and B it doesn't pay as well

3315
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
thankfully

3316
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
now I'm old enough I don't care

3317
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I want to do something

3318
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
meaningful

3319
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
if I have to pay to do something meaningful

3320
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
fine

3321
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
let's go

3322
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
okay

3323
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
yeah I want to

3324
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I want to run the experiments

3325
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Darren this model that you

3326
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
have right

3327
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
would you

3328
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
do you think it has to be done in the US

3329
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
or it can be done in another country

3330
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
or it can be done it would be very

3331
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
be very radical

3332
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
it could be done somewhere else

3333
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
but yeah it could be done anywhere

3334
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
okay in fact

3335
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I argue I would argue that it's

3336
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
basically what nature usually

3337
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
is up to

3338
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
she's just observe nature

3339
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
she's doing

3340
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
this set of things that

3341
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
humans could do really well together

3342
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
and they naturally do it really well

3343
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
together wherever that isn't captured

3344
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
or interfered with

3345
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
okay

3346
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
but yeah the system

3347
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
as a system it could be done

3348
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
anywhere

3349
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
it can be done with existing technology

3350
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
it would change

3351
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I honestly I don't believe

3352
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
if we could actually produce what I have in mind

3353
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I don't think governments

3354
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
would last another four years

3355
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
we can do something so much better

3356
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
than governments that I'm really shocked

3357
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
nobody's had the idea

3358
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
to do that

3359
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
okay great great

3360
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
so

3361
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
what

3362
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
basically you can envisage

3363
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
the model that you have in mind

3364
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
and I can imagine

3365
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
the model you have in mind

3366
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
and within it

3367
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
teams of five for example

3368
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
doing problem solving

3369
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
and add it together

3370
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
yeah they can

3371
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
synergize with other teams easily

3372
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
in fact they're highly motivated to synergize

3373
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
with other teams

3374
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
okay

3375
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
essentially there's a kind of money

3376
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
which is something more like fulfillment

3377
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
that we can pay the humans

3378
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
and they can also make money

3379
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
with the analytics they produce

3380
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
without those analytics being traced

3381
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
to them personally

3382
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
so that they can have privacy

3383
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
fantastic

3384
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
because that's what I mean

3385
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
in like in Indonesia

3386
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
they like that

3387
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
they pretty much want that

3388
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
because they're not

3389
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
totally free from their

3390
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
military phobia

3391
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
yes for good reason

3392
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
eventually the soldiers will come

3393
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
they may not be here today

3394
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
but someday they are coming

3395
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
you know

3396
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
right everyone knows this

3397
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
all the old people know it

3398
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
yes yes yes yes

3399
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
so they I mean like on Facebook and stuff

3400
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
all of them don't use their own names

3401
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
right why would you use your own name

3402
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
it doesn't make any sense

3403
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
for most purposes it's dangerous

3404
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
please

3405
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Darren were you

3406
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
were you in the internet

3407
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
when there wasn't any

3408
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
any web and stuff

3409
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
that was just mailing lists

3410
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
I'm a computer technician

3411
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I've been working with computers

3412
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
since 1981

3413
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I've done

3414
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
some programming I watched

3415
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
the birth of the internet

3416
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
long ago

3417
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
in the beginning we used to have

3418
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
what were called bulletin board systems

3419
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
yeah

3420
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
you know you would dial

3421
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
yeah bbs is you'd dial up with it

3422
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
you'd have a 1200 or 2400

3423
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
modem

3424
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
you'd dial up with a modem

3425
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
you'd have some sort of a

3426
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
validation

3427
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
exchange with the server

3428
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
and then

3429
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
you were a user on a bbs

3430
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
most of those were used for

3431
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
sharing cultural

3432
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
objects

3433
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
art

3434
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
porn

3435
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
computer programs

3436
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
games

3437
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
particularly

3438
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
media

3439
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
yeah

3440
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
why I asked Darren

3441
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
the early days of the internet

3442
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
pretty much there wasn't any

3443
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
pseudonyms

3444
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
the mailing lists

3445
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
maybe the

3446
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
soft culture

3447
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
wait are you sure

3448
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
in what

3449
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
bbs was it not

3450
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
pseudonymous

3451
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
because you had user names

3452
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
yeah bbs

3453
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
in the beginning of the internet

3454
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
yeah

3455
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
oh yes

3456
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
mostly true

3457
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
campus background

3458
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
maybe because of the

3459
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
economic background

3460
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
because I worked

3461
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
at that time I was working

3462
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
for a complete ip shop

3463
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
in Toronto

3464
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
oh yeah

3465
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
and I saw

3466
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
the value of us being able to

3467
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
recognize this guy

3468
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
and see

3469
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
you know

3470
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
in a trustworthy situation

3471
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
well you'd still probably want

3472
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
the option of pseudonyms

3473
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
but in a trustworthy situation

3474
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
you'd use your

3475
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
your primary name

3476
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
yep

3477
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I imagine

3478
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
although you know with indigenous

3479
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
cultures

3480
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
they didn't have names like

3481
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Bob or Tony

3482
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I mean

3483
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
and their names would change

3484
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
under certain conditions

3485
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
it seems

3486
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
to me

3487
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
yep

3488
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
like if you marry into a new

3489
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
yeah there's lots of conditions

3490
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
that would change your name

3491
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
why do you mention it

3492
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
so okay let me make sure I'm hearing you

3493
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
so you're saying something like

3494
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I remember conditions

3495
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
under which it was very useful to know

3496
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
precisely who I'm speaking to

3497
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
no

3498
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
masquerading

3499
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
were you saying

3500
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
something like that

3501
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
going

3502
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
going to the heart of the matter

3503
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
just like you said

3504
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
don't

3505
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
the speaker should not be

3506
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
should not be split

3507
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
from the speech

3508
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
the stage value

3509
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
right yeah

3510
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
yeah I mean on the other hand

3511
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
there's 10 different people inside

3512
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
me and it's not because I'm schizophrenic

3513
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I'm human

3514
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
ah yes yes yes

3515
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
so now what

3516
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
must all of them bear the responsibility

3517
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
for the voice of any of them

3518
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
yes yes

3519
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
no no no

3520
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
well I don't know I'm not saying yes or no

3521
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I'm just saying

3522
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I hear you

3523
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
it's a complicated question right

3524
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
like I want to actually entertain the question

3525
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
hmm

3526
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
yeah yeah I think

3527
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
what is this for enough for some

3528
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
for enough things

3529
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
maybe all you know

3530
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
maybe the ethical things

3531
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
we want to

3532
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
the issue is

3533
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
where do we want accountability

3534
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
and where do we want this

3535
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
and I would say that

3536
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
um

3537
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
most of the time when we want

3538
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
accountability

3539
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
something has gone

3540
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
really badly wrong already

3541
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
right like

3542
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
yeah by the time

3543
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
we need accountability

3544
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
relational intimacy is broken down

3545
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
dramatically

3546
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
why don't you want the exploratory

3547
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
and why do you want them to wait till they

3548
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
are sure before they open their mouth

3549
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
why don't you want them to come in

3550
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
with the explanations

3551
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
why don't you have language

3552
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
that explicitly allows

3553
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
enables that

3554
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
the worst thing

3555
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
it's not the only truth

3556
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
but a fundamental principle is like

3557
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
once

3558
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
human cognition becomes oriented

3559
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
toward indicting someone

3560
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
or something

3561
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
it breaks down

3562
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
it's no longer very intelligent

3563
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
it's making a mess

3564
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
the

3565
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
vulnerability of the space

3566
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
the spacemen allow for lots of vulnerability

3567
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
yes

3568
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
yes yes I mean

3569
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
that's more brilliant than what I would say

3570
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
um that's really brilliant

3571
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
what you're saying there

3572
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
you're saying um

3573
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
it's crucial that we allow

3574
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
um

3575
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
the play

3576
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
the natural play

3577
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
of explorative learning

3578
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
and discovery and making mistakes

3579
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
and getting it wrong

3580
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
you know

3581
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
um and all kinds of other things

3582
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
that disappear once

3583
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
go ahead

3584
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
it should be children ready you know

3585
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
yeah

3586
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I mean

3587
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
what a brilliant thing

3588
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
you with your expansion

3589
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
made it for me

3590
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
yeah but you

3591
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
you were the one who said this first

3592
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I only tried to see

3593
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
what you were saying I was like no he's saying something

3594
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
even more radical than what you're saying Darren

3595
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
what I was saying was

3596
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
what I was saying was

3597
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
um

3598
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
by the time you're interested in indictment

3599
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
you've lost most of your intelligence

3600
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
and I find this to be true of myself

3601
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
but you said something crazier

3602
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
you were like

3603
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
uh in an actually trusted

3604
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
relational

3605
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
in context

3606
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
the free play

3607
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
of mistake

3608
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
doesn't lead and you know

3609
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
experiment and discovery and learning

3610
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
doesn't lead to judgment it leads to mutual

3611
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
benefit or something like this

3612
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
yeah yeah yeah

3613
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
yeah that's crazy

3614
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
all of this

3615
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
you can't say that

3616
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
who told you you could say things like that

3617
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
you

3618
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
mustn't go around saying things like that

3619
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
the humans will get ideas

3620
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
so that's it

3621
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
you know like

3622
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
what are you doing

3623
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
basically

3624
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
hey there

3625
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
essentially allow the kids to teach you

3626
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
yes

3627
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
hey this is how we do it

3628
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
this is how we dig a hole

3629
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
or how we catch a tadpole

3630
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
come you know

3631
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
teachers have been stopping us

3632
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
and we go inside

3633
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
and say you can't

3634
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
laugh or whatever the teacher

3635
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
can you give us a break

3636
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
you make the club something

3637
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
distract her

3638
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
when you go back to learning from the kids

3639
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
and then

3640
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
what do you think some outcomes

3641
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
make the old school teacher happy too

3642
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
yes

3643
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
exactly right

3644
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
you can please the old guard

3645
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
and innovate at the same time

3646
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
right

3647
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
doesn't have to be pure rebellion

3648
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
you can please

3649
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
you can please tradition and still innovate

3650
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
yeah

3651
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
so long as you're becoming patient

3652
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
you're persistent

3653
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
it should yield a better

3654
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
the better result

3655
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
the better outcome for everybody

3656
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
absolutely many yes

3657
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
patience

3658
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
this doesn't have to be done in the next 10 seconds

3659
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
that would work

3660
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
right because the kids are smart too

3661
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
you know

3662
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
and

3663
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
they're kind of like forced

3664
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
to

3665
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
accept the status quo

3666
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
and the teachers too

3667
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
finding maybe too difficult

3668
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
because they're all busy

3669
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
too much of an accent to it

3670
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
how they have to do this

3671
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
kind of a modern world

3672
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
with too many details

3673
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
too many chores

3674
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
in a way

3675
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
do you sense that

3676
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
that is part of the reason why

3677
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
the change is slow

3678
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
and all doesn't happen

3679
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
no the problem is worse

3680
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
is that

3681
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
the new teachers

3682
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
should be free

3683
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
to grow along

3684
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
with the children

3685
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
instead of to dictate

3686
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
the direction of growth

3687
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
to the children

3688
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
and they know nothing but to dictate

3689
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
that's it you know

3690
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
to dictate

3691
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
in english

3692
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I make a joke about this

3693
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
it's like a person holding a hard penis

3694
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
and they keep pointing it at you

3695
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
they're dictating

3696
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I know it's a very crude joke

3697
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
but

3698
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
in english

3699
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
that's a reasonable pun

3700
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
and it makes sense

3701
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
it's like they're hitting you over the head

3702
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
with the hardened

3703
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
member of authority

3704
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
it's a shitty job

3705
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
like no teacher would want

3706
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
no teacher

3707
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
would ever act that way

3708
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
or want that if they were having the experience

3709
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
of learning and growing with the children

3710
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
and nobody's

3711
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
going to tell me that we can't produce that

3712
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
we got the teacher on site

3713
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
we got the kids on site

3714
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
you got them together

3715
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
you should be able to pull off miracles

3716
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
it might take you a little while to figure out

3717
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
how but don't tell me you can't

3718
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I've seen it done

3719
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I've participated

3720
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
in it in schools

3721
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
where I had a teacher who was like

3722
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
we're going to take the one kid

3723
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
in this class who can't write

3724
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
at all

3725
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
and we're going to get that kid writing essays

3726
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
that are powerful

3727
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
and blow people away

3728
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I mean here's a secret

3729
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
that will blow your mind

3730
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
in 1990

3731
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
or something

3732
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
no way to

3733
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
probably

3734
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
I took an English class

3735
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
I hadn't been in school since I was 12

3736
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
I never went to high school

3737
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
I'm a self educated person

3738
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I took an English class

3739
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
because I'm a writer

3740
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
and the teacher asked me to teach the class

3741
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
for the next semester so I did

3742
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
and what I discovered was pretty

3743
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
amazing

3744
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
so there were about 90 kids

3745
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
they ranged in age from

3746
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
16 to 26

3747
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
we had three classes

3748
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
of about 30 kids a piece

3749
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
they were mostly upper middle class

3750
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
white kids

3751
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
most of them were like

3752
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
B, B plus

3753
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
average

3754
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
coming into junior college from high school

3755
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
of those 90 American kids

3756
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
in a wealthy

3757
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
suburb

3758
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
suburban town

3759
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
four of them could reasonably

3760
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
produce a written sentence

3761
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
in their only language

3762
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
and two of them could

3763
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
compose a paragraph

3764
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
wow

3765
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
those kids

3766
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
sucked at understanding

3767
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
or speaking or writing

3768
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
the only language they

3769
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
speak

3770
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
they were abysmal at it

3771
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
and I was blown away

3772
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
because I'm hyperlexic

3773
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I have a natural

3774
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
affine relationship

3775
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
with language and particularly

3776
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
English

3777
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
I've been that way since I was very little

3778
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
so for me

3779
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
this was staggering and shocking

3780
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
I was like

3781
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I wanted them to have more education than I had

3782
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
and they had

3783
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
catastrophically less education

3784
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
than I had

3785
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
though they had been

3786
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
in school an additional

3787
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
six years compared to me

3788
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
and

3789
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
kind of like

3790
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
somewhat role model parents too

3791
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I suppose

3792
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I don't know

3793
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
but

3794
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
my parents weren't

3795
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
particularly intelligent

3796
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
but they did read

3797
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
books

3798
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
and they did read books to me

3799
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
and I think my parents were frightened

3800
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
a little bit I know my mom was

3801
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
I don't think my dad was but my mom was scared

3802
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
because

3803
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I remember

3804
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
I was reading science fiction novels

3805
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
when I was five

3806
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
maybe earlier

3807
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
who brought them

3808
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
to you?

3809
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
my parents I told them what I wanted

3810
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
oh how did you know what

3811
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
so like I had seen

3812
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
advertisements for

3813
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
2001 Space Odyssey

3814
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
when I was watching Star Trek

3815
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
and I knew what the book was about

3816
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
and I read science fiction stories

3817
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
already

3818
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
myself I could read them by myself

3819
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
so I asked my mom to get me that

3820
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
book and she's like that's a grown up

3821
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
book and I was like I want that book

3822
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
that's the book I want to read

3823
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
so then I got it and I read it

3824
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
and my parents ended up reading it

3825
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
and in a way

3826
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I was kind of educating them

3827
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
because I had a lot of books

3828
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
eventually I became a book thief

3829
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
that's a story for another time

3830
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
I only

3831
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
stole books to read them

3832
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
though I didn't steal like valuable books

3833
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
and sell them

3834
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I stole books to read them

3835
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
when I was a runaway

3836
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
so I didn't have any access

3837
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
yeah when I was a runaway

3838
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I used to steal books to read them

3839
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
you said earlier that

3840
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
you know

3841
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
you thought yourself from 12 years old

3842
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
like um

3843
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
that would have been like

3844
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
almost unheard of isn't it

3845
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
no there are

3846
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
there are um

3847
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
okay especially these days

3848
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
it's different now

3849
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
there are a lot of children

3850
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
who are

3851
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
there's a cohort of young people

3852
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
who naturally become self-educating

3853
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
to varying degrees

3854
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
some of them become prodigies

3855
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
some of them become

3856
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
nobody's right some of them just disappear

3857
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
some of them go mad

3858
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
because they're lonely

3859
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
but yeah there's like

3860
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I know a couple other

3861
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
every once in a while someone will sniff me out

3862
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
and they'll approach me

3863
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
and they'll go like

3864
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
when did you

3865
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
you know what were you reading when you were a child

3866
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
and I'll say science fiction

3867
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
and they're like how about when you were little

3868
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
and I'll say science fiction and they'll go like

3869
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
yeah that's what I thought

3870
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
you know

3871
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
um

3872
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
because

3873
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
recently somebody sniffed me out

3874
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
and they were like you're one of you're just like me

3875
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
you're a feral

3876
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
you're a feral kid who lived

3877
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
in the wilderness

3878
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
and you're someone who's read

3879
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
a few thousand books and not two

3880
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
right

3881
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
um

3882
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
and they recognize the fingerprint

3883
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
of my mind right and I recognize

3884
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
there is when we have conversations

3885
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
like I'm talking to my twin or something

3886
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
it's ridiculous

3887
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
yeah there are kids that are like that

3888
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I imagine all over the world

3889
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
but like say if you were

3890
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
like if you were

3891
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
not going to school

3892
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
were you still at home

3893
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I ran away from home

3894
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
wow

3895
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
I lived in the forest

3896
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
in the Russian river

3897
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
yeah

3898
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
in California

3899
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
wow

3900
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I mean

3901
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
you just

3902
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
find it hard to believe that people would do that

3903
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
in a first world country

3904
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
because

3905
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
that's what

3906
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
number two

3907
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I would have thought that the comfort

3908
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
you want to mix of the two

3909
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
not just be in the process

3910
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
home that bad that you had

3911
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
that you didn't miss it

3912
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I would have been killed if I stayed in that town

3913
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
wow

3914
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I became

3915
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
by most like the home

3916
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
other young troublemakers

3917
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
like myself

3918
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
hoodlums

3919
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
I went from being like a straight

3920
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
A student

3921
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
to being a little bit of a hoodlum

3922
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
and where I was living

3923
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
in Stockton

3924
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
things were pretty bad there

3925
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
even though we lived in the good part of town

3926
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
and I eventually

3927
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
ended up

3928
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
in various kinds of trouble with

3929
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
young criminals

3930
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
now it's not as serious as like gang life

3931
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
is that shit's really serious

3932
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
this is pretty very minor

3933
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
compared to that

3934
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
but yeah I basically

3935
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
I realized that

3936
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
if I stay there

3937
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
I realized if I stay here

3938
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
I will either end up in prison

3939
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
or dead

3940
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
so

3941
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
given that belief

3942
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
anything's better

3943
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
than either of those outcomes

3944
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
pretty much anything

3945
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
so even just like

3946
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
like living outside

3947
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
is better

3948
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
so eventually I made it out

3949
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
it took a few attempts

3950
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
wow

3951
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
and then you were able to

3952
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
be out for years

3953
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
on stretch

3954
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
yeah I came home in like the last

3955
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
half of 17 so I was

3956
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
out for three and a half

3957
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
something like that

3958
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
okay

3959
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
okay wow

3960
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
your parents

3961
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
your parents would have been

3962
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
like

3963
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I mean both

3964
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
so sad and mad no?

3965
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
especially I don't know

3966
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
this is very personal but

3967
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
but my mom

3968
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
was relatively indifferent

3969
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
and I ran away to near where she was

3970
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
living

3971
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
because it was by visiting her

3972
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
that I realized that there was this

3973
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
enclave in the forest

3974
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
where

3975
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
it was a bunch of

3976
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
basically old hippies

3977
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
wow

3978
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
so there was like this enclave

3979
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
and it was very

3980
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
richly cultural

3981
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
unlike where I was living

3982
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
which was like

3983
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
zero culture like dead culture

3984
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
so yeah I wanted

3985
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
the culture I couldn't access

3986
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
the culture because I wasn't an adult

3987
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
but I didn't want to be

3988
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
in Stockton anymore

3989
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
trying to figure out how to steal cars

3990
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
with my buddy so we could get some weed

3991
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
or whatever the fucking

3992
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
agenda was

3993
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
yeah I just

3994
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I didn't want to be

3995
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
in that place

3996
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
anymore and I did not get along with my dad

3997
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
who I was living with so

3998
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
I went to the forest and

3999
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
some adults helped me

4000
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
I made it through okay nothing horrible

4001
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
happened to me while I was on the street

4002
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
I hitchhiked around

4003
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
you know

4004
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
didn't eat much food

4005
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
a lot of fasting

4006
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
oh

4007
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
yeah

4008
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
but

4009
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I hitchhiked through the US

4010
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
really

4011
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
hmm

4012
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
wow that's crazy

4013
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
yeah it was fun

4014
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
yeah that's

4015
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
really intense

4016
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
in what year were you hitchhiking

4017
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
I mean I'm hitchhiking in like

4018
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
the late 70s early 80s

4019
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
mine

4020
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
was 1980

4021
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
from

4022
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
January say

4023
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
oh wow yeah not at a similar time

4024
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
let's see how old was I in 80s

4025
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
hmm

4026
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
but you know it's quite

4027
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
I mean it was a different experience

4028
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I mean it was a rich experience

4029
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
I stood out

4030
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
like a sore thumb

4031
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
yeah well

4032
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
in the south

4033
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
right it was like impossible

4034
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
together

4035
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
right yeah

4036
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
and we learned some chords

4037
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
and stuff so I said hmm how do I

4038
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
overcome this

4039
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
I've got to find a white guy

4040
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
right

4041
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
to

4042
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
hitchhike with

4043
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
brilliant yeah you have to hitchhike

4044
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
by first hitch you have to

4045
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
racially hitchhike before you

4046
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
vehiculatively hitchhike

4047
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
right

4048
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
yeah that's hilarious

4049
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
oh my god yeah

4050
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I came across the really

4051
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
solid guy you know my house long

4052
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
right and there was this guy

4053
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I was on my way first

4054
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
just to go to a New Orleans for Mardi Gras

4055
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
hey talk about that you know

4056
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
we're talking in a very opportune

4057
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
pertinent time because Mardi Gras

4058
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
is going to be happening soon

4059
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
in now to about this time

4060
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
of the year right 1980

4061
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
yeah

4062
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
yeah

4063
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
so I want to go to New Orleans

4064
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
you know

4065
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
so

4066
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
with my buddy I'd reached up to Atlanta

4067
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
right from college

4068
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
hitchhiking with him to Atlanta

4069
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
so I went to Atlanta

4070
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
to New Orleans

4071
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
three days day in day out

4072
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
when I go to the exit you know which is a bit of a

4073
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
it's not that easy to go

4074
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
from downtown Atlanta

4075
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
like Salvation Army or something like that

4076
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
sure

4077
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
to the exit

4078
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
so anyway three days

4079
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
and I couldn't get it right nobody was stopping

4080
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I knew it okay

4081
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
so I said okay I'll take a greyhound

4082
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
to New Orleans

4083
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I go to New Orleans and that was

4084
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
heaven for me there was like

4085
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
the hobos and the hippies from everywhere

4086
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
for Mardi Gras

4087
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
and that guy

4088
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
looked like Jesus Christ in the hair

4089
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
yeah

4090
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
the oldest and self-blown hair

4091
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
brilliant yeah

4092
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
he didn't guru for him

4093
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
so

4094
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
because we got along

4095
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
really quite well like

4096
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
house and fire

4097
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
so

4098
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
yeah he had been

4099
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
hitchhiking for like 10 years

4100
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
so with him

4101
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
the world was a different world

4102
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
you know because

4103
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
people would stop for him

4104
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
I would be like back

4105
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
back a bit in the back and when the class

4106
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
stopped I would run

4107
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
and people would see

4108
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
they're safe enough so it's good

4109
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
right

4110
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
I went all around quite a bit of time

4111
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
in Boulder, Colorado

4112
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
and Kansas City where it's home was

4113
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
and then

4114
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
I wanted to

4115
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
following the Grateful Dead

4116
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
I was wanting to follow

4117
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
to Mount McKinley

4118
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
in Canada

4119
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
but got stopped at the border

4120
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
the Canadians wouldn't let me in

4121
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
so I spent some time in Seattle

4122
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
yeah no

4123
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I had a passport

4124
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
it was best in all that

4125
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
so it was always good

4126
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I went to University of Virginia

4127
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Charlottesville

4128
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
but the student visa

4129
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
runs out

4130
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
after you are a student

4131
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
you know the visa

4132
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
has got a termination date

4133
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
so when I

4134
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
my plan was

4135
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
to go to

4136
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
to the concert

4137
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
the last

4138
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Grateful Dead concert

4139
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
happens in like

4140
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
the equinox or something of that sort

4141
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
you know

4142
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
one of those dates

4143
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
the day when there's

4144
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
the largest amount of flight

4145
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
in Alaska anyway

4146
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
and I would come back because

4147
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
the flight was out of Seattle

4148
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
but the Canadians said no

4149
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
your visa

4150
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
your American visa

4151
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
is

4152
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
over

4153
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
so they won't let you back into America

4154
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
so since they won't let you back into America

4155
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
we can't let you into Canada

4156
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
I see

4157
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
I did not need a visa to Canada

4158
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Canada being in the Commonwealth

4159
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Malaysia is in the

4160
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
there was no need for a Malaysian

4161
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
to have a visa to enter Canada

4162
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
I see yeah

4163
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
you know

4164
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
but it was on the grounds that

4165
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
I wouldn't be allowed to

4166
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
leave

4167
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
if my basis was

4168
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
I was flying out of Seattle

4169
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
I wouldn't be allowed to enter

4170
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I would not have enough money

4171
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
and whatever

4172
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Canada can stop me from entering Canada

4173
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
not on the grounds that

4174
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
I don't have a visa

4175
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
but on the grounds that do you have enough money

4176
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
to sustain yourself when you're in Canada

4177
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
yeah

4178
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
that's reasonable in pretty much all the world

4179
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
countries all over the world

4180
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
have environment

4181
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
exactly

4182
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
I didn't prepare for that

4183
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
because on the thing that

4184
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I'm just going to come

4185
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
for the concert come back

4186
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
get on my plane now I'm home

4187
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
I don't want to be here

4188
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
I mean

4189
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
you have a short term goal

4190
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
you know

4191
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
you have a short term goal

4192
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
I'm sorry go ahead

4193
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
yeah me not

4194
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
realizing immigration

4195
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
things in a black and white

4196
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
very strict way

4197
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
that's pretty much the half tool

4198
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
but

4199
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
it didn't

4200
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
fully occur to me

4201
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
because in my head

4202
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
I'm still in America because I'm going to Alaska

4203
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
man

4204
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
but

4205
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
it didn't

4206
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
register in my head

4207
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
that hey

4208
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
doesn't matter what you think

4209
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
it's so funny you say that

4210
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
it's really funny that you say that

4211
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
because I was just thinking about

4212
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
when I was a runaway and when I was hitchhiking

4213
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
I was so naive

4214
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
that it literally didn't

4215
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
occur to me even

4216
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
slightly

4217
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
that I might

4218
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
want to be careful

4219
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
because what sort of an adult

4220
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
picks up a 13 year old boy

4221
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
on the side of the road

4222
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
yes

4223
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
never even occurred

4224
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
to me

4225
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
that I was filtering the adults

4226
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
right

4227
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
and I'm filtering them

4228
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
in a specific direction

4229
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
right which is has

4230
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
some interest

4231
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
in a 13 year old kid

4232
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
now thankfully

4233
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
only

4234
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I don't know how many times I was near

4235
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
trouble

4236
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
but only twice did I

4237
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
actually get close to trouble

4238
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
and both times

4239
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
I was able to

4240
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
to kind of like avoid them

4241
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
yes both times I was able

4242
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
to resolve the situation by

4243
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
acting tough

4244
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
yeah yeah

4245
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
it drives past my stop

4246
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
and I'm like hey my sauce

4247
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
back there and he's

4248
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
not speaking to me

4249
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
and it's late at night

4250
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
and we're out in the middle of nowhere

4251
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
and I just basically said

4252
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
I will

4253
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
cut your fucking head

4254
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
off with my pocket knife

4255
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I will stab you right now in the neck

4256
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
if you don't pull this car over

4257
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
and he was like boop

4258
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I got out

4259
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
oh wow

4260
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
oh so

4261
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
did you actually have a knife then

4262
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
yes I did

4263
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
oh good

4264
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I used to carry a dagger

4265
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
little dagger

4266
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
you're not that naive then

4267
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
I was

4268
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
it's just that in this case

4269
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
I realized

4270
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
like

4271
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
yeah

4272
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
I can still be

4273
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
I can still be very naive

4274
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
I'm not cunning

4275
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
the way some people are cunning

4276
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
and I honestly

4277
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
it never once

4278
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
occurred to me

4279
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
that most of the people that would like

4280
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
that most of the people that would stop for a kid

4281
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
that looked like me

4282
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
would probably

4283
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
have ulterior motives

4284
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
or at least

4285
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
a goodly you know some

4286
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
portion of the people

4287
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
never occurred to me one time

4288
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
not once

4289
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
is it

4290
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
because okay

4291
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Darren

4292
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
when I was in the US too

4293
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
like

4294
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I mean

4295
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
the country was a different country

4296
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
in the sense that

4297
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
I would have thought

4298
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
it's

4299
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
nowhere as dangerous as it is now maybe

4300
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
me I would agree

4301
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
yeah

4302
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
also I was in a strange

4303
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
I was

4304
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
in a strange sub context

4305
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
right I was in the Russian

4306
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
river

4307
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
so there's a lot of basically the three primary

4308
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
okay this is going to be really bad

4309
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
say here but

4310
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
the three primary populations

4311
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
there were rednecks, homosexuals

4312
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
and hippies

4313
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
and the hippies and the homosexuals

4314
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
got along fine

4315
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
the rednecks hated

4316
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
both the other camps pretty much though

4317
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
got along better with the hippies than

4318
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
the gay people

4319
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
so

4320
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
that was the context there

4321
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
and obviously

4322
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
you know

4323
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
yeah I could have gotten a lot of trouble

4324
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
but I never did

4325
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
I never did

4326
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
no one ever hurt me

4327
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
so growing up after the age of

4328
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
leaving home

4329
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
you hadn't been exposed to

4330
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
the dangers of

4331
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
such dangers as much

4332
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I was

4333
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
you have no idea how naive I was

4334
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
in your wildest estimations

4335
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
you will underestimate my naivety

4336
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I was

4337
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
yeah I was

4338
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I was very intelligent

4339
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
and skillful

4340
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
in certain ways

4341
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
but my god was I naive

4342
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
it's just one of the

4343
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
feelings I've always had yeah

4344
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
it never even

4345
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
okay look let me be really clear

4346
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
about this so you can understand the depth

4347
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
not only did it never occur

4348
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
to me that I was attracting the people

4349
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
who would have some interest

4350
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
in a 13 year old boy ever

4351
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
it never occurred to me

4352
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
not only that

4353
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
it never occurred to me

4354
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
that it didn't occur to me

4355
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
until just now

4356
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
40 something years later

4357
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
50 years later

4358
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
it never occurred to me

4359
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
that it didn't occur to me until this conversation

4360
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
today

4361
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
that's how naive I am

4362
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
wow

4363
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I never realized

4364
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
that I didn't realize

4365
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
until just now

4366
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
yeah

4367
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
it's that bad

4368
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
you know

4369
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
to me in my

4370
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
when I got rights there

4371
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
when I started getting rights and stuff

4372
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
the people who were picking us up were so generous

4373
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
that made a big difference

4374
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
and innocent

4375
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
usually it would be like a small town

4376
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
you know the tour in some way

4377
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
and then

4378
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
at the back

4379
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
yeah some of that too

4380
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
and

4381
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
all beautiful it was

4382
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
right beautiful it was

4383
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
I mean nowhere else in the world

4384
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I think I mean

4385
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
would you get that

4386
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
yeah it's true because the

4387
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
counterculture in the United States

4388
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
at that time was still

4389
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
kind of blossoming

4390
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
a little bit

4391
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
and how old were you

4392
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
were you like 18

4393
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
20 or something

4394
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
yeah I would have been

4395
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
21

4396
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
perfect

4397
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
so

4398
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
you know you present

4399
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
to

4400
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
the drivers

4401
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
obviously

4402
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
something they might

4403
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
find fascinating

4404
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
and

4405
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
adventurous

4406
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
to some of them

4407
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
yep

4408
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
so that works in your

4409
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
favor but yeah it was pretty good like

4410
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
most people were very kind

4411
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
some people gave me

4412
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
money or brought me food

4413
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
some people asked me

4414
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
you know like how do you survive

4415
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
they were curious

4416
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
occasionally

4417
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
like if it was raining

4418
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
or something somebody would be like hey

4419
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
you can just crash at our place if you want

4420
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
you know

4421
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
and obviously that could be very dangerous

4422
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
but never turned out to be

4423
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
not once

4424
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
because I mean I was 22

4425
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
so it didn't occur to me

4426
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
you know

4427
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
anything would happen to me

4428
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
I was least

4429
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
concerned about it

4430
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
to me it's like how do I get it right

4431
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
I don't know the money

4432
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
yeah that's all I was concerned with

4433
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
too I was just like how do I get

4434
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
to where I'm going I wasn't thinking about

4435
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
why someone would

4436
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
or wouldn't stop to pick me up

4437
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
in other words

4438
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
there was no

4439
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
there was no meta reflection

4440
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
right

4441
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
there was no

4442
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
there was no meta cognition

4443
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
yeah

4444
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
no meta cognition about my circumstance

4445
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
whereas you

4446
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
must have had some by your age

4447
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
yeah

4448
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
I mean

4449
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
more

4450
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I mean

4451
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
but you know violence wasn't

4452
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
like you didn't have the school shootings

4453
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
you didn't

4454
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
yeah

4455
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
the malware wasn't

4456
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
concentrated yet

4457
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
yeah

4458
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
and

4459
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
say for example

4460
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
people may say okay

4461
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
blacks are dangerous

4462
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
but

4463
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
right

4464
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
I'm almost black

4465
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
right exactly

4466
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
so

4467
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
you know

4468
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
I'm more likely to see you as an ally

4469
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
than as

4470
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
an enemy or prey

4471
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
yeah

4472
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
and I wanted to try it

4473
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I had to

4474
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
because part of

4475
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
that was the American equivalent

4476
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
of you being a sadu

4477
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
of you being like

4478
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
you know

4479
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
that's funny yeah I got you

4480
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
right yeah

4481
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
that's a hilarious way of saying it

4482
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
like you're

4483
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
yeah it's the American version of you're a holy man

4484
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
or something

4485
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
oh no you have faith in nature

4486
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
oh you have faith I see

4487
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
I see that

4488
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
come on don't be

4489
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
yeah that's what I had actually

4490
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
that is what I had back then

4491
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
in a way

4492
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
I had faith

4493
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
that it was

4494
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
possible to be myself

4495
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
without a house

4496
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
without a roof

4497
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
without money

4498
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
without food

4499
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
with nothing

4500
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I

4501
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
knew that

4502
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
money would be an issue so I had to

4503
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
watch out and you know

4504
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
in our places we stopped

4505
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
anyway we made it

4506
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
because we could get jobs in some

4507
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
places and

4508
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
little short term jobs

4509
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
especially

4510
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
in Boulder Colorado

4511
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
I remember

4512
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
in 4th of July

4513
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
around about 4th of July

4514
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
I was there and it was snowing

4515
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
right

4516
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
in Boulder California then

4517
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
it was a bit of a surprise but

4518
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
that was good climate I mean they had

4519
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
you know like a

4520
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
job placement

4521
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
for tramps and hobos

4522
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
you know

4523
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
but because I was with this guy called

4524
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Bernie

4525
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Bernie McGraw

4526
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Bernie McGraw

4527
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
yeah

4528
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
he knew the ins and outs

4529
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
where you go and get food stamps

4530
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
and where you get

4531
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
day jobs

4532
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
and stuff like that so

4533
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
rather quickly

4534
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
after 4 days I got a job as a

4535
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
dishwasher

4536
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
in

4537
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Boulder

4538
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
right and

4539
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
you know that was fun and

4540
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
the pay you get

4541
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
compared to what you need is like

4542
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
great because it was staying in like

4543
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
in Boulder

4544
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
after a while was staying in like

4545
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
an abandoned

4546
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
house in the edge of a river kind of

4547
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
like in a forest right

4548
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
so

4549
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
we had sleeping bags and stuff like

4550
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
rather

4551
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
winter proof sleeping bags so

4552
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
managed that was good you know

4553
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
there were other people later

4554
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
we met some people

4555
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
and we lived in the house for a while

4556
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
very liberal

4557
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
I mean very truly liberal place

4558
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Boulder was when I was there you know

4559
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
very

4560
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
very generous

4561
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
you know

4562
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
the first day I remember too

4563
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
I remember too

4564
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
I tell you this

4565
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
I

4566
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
already I had rather little money

4567
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
like 25 dollars or something

4568
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
like that and I had a camera and stuff

4569
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
and my buddy was hitchhiking with me

4570
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
he said let me borrow your camera

4571
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
and then he goes and fawns in

4572
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
fucking

4573
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
and so

4574
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
because of that

4575
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
I remember that day I had no more money

4576
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
I had no more money and I didn't

4577
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
have a camera and I was like

4578
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
how am I going to solve this well

4579
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
this is this I've got to

4580
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
learn this and I've got to learn how to

4581
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
be without any money so

4582
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
I walk along

4583
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
the street pearl street in

4584
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Boulder you know so downtown

4585
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
one street

4586
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
that is

4587
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
walk only no cars

4588
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
right so I think I walk

4589
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
and I signboard right

4590
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
on the side of a building and he said

4591
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Naropa

4592
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
this is this

4593
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
institute

4594
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
me

4595
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
wow this is like

4596
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
next to bumfuck

4597
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
U.S.

4598
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
I mean

4599
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
I'm not even Kansas City

4600
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Salina, Kansas by the highway

4601
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
this is like

4602
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
for me it's like nowhere

4603
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
and how come it's got a Buddhist institute

4604
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
this is my thing

4605
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
this is my

4606
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
culture yeah

4607
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
in the middle of America

4608
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
so I said I have to go upstairs

4609
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
so I go up and I see you know there's

4610
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
two guys and stuff and it's like a

4611
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
conversation and they're so wonderful

4612
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
they offered you know one of the guys

4613
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
offered his place for me to stay in

4614
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
because his buddy was

4615
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
had gone off somewhere so there was

4616
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
they can see

4617
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
so come and stay with me and stay at my

4618
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
place and it was great

4619
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
you know beautiful

4620
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
always the whole thing was beautiful

4621
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
and Seattle

4622
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
my last stop was fantastic

4623
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
you know after by the time I reached

4624
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
to like Seattle and stuff I'm on my own

4625
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
but

4626
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
I was walking you know I get

4627
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
I was walking and this guy in a pickup

4628
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
truck you know comes past me

4629
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
stops

4630
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
winds his window down looks at me and says

4631
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
are you going somewhere

4632
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
can I take you I was like wow

4633
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
because

4634
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
you know they were

4635
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
they could see me

4636
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
and I'm like wow it was

4637
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
great it was because

4638
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
I

4639
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
to me

4640
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
the folks then in Seattle

4641
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
were like a great above the rest of the world

4642
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
they were like really

4643
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
friendly to

4644
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
it is actually okay there is

4645
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
something weird about

4646
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
it

4647
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
how to put this

4648
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
so I have

4649
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
not traveled much

4650
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
I've mostly only been

4651
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
in central and northern California

4652
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
throughout my entire life I've been

4653
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
basically nowhere

4654
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
but a couple times I traveled

4655
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
a couple times I traveled a little bit

4656
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
and I went

4657
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
for example to Oregon

4658
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
or Washington State

4659
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
and

4660
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
I don't know

4661
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
I think

4662
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
I think

4663
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
that because I'm not well traveled

4664
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
I probably have a

4665
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
a distorted sense

4666
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
but the people in

4667
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Oregon were very different

4668
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
the people in Washington were

4669
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
very different it may be that

4670
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
it does actually seem

4671
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
to me that places

4672
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
have

4673
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
something that

4674
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
resembles a personality

4675
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
and that the humans in those

4676
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
places

4677
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
reflect that does that make any

4678
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
sense?

4679
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
yeah yeah yeah

4680
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
something like that

4681
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
that's a yep

4682
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
I'm an echo yeah

4683
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
because the man made me think much

4684
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
and I always say this

4685
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
I know this quite well

4686
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
because I go to India often

4687
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
I've gone to India quite a lot

4688
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
and they're forever complaining about

4689
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
the outside and places dirty

4690
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
and this and this

4691
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
it's a manifestation of

4692
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
the sum of the minds

4693
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
in

4694
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
in Hindu culture there are

4695
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
words for these things

4696
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
in English there are not

4697
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
in Sanskrit there are words for

4698
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
words

4699
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
you have a culture that's like

4700
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
8,000 years older than ours

4701
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
and the white people

4702
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
think they're intelligent

4703
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
what?

4704
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
you guys are playing with Play-Doh

4705
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
or something works

4706
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
you know

4707
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
my son

4708
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
he studies Advaita Vedanta

4709
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
I know there are words

4710
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
for all of these in Sanskrit

4711
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
and in

4712
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Indian philosophy

4713
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
there's very complex

4714
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
sophisticated language about

4715
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
all the different features

4716
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
of anything

4717
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
you might want to

4718
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
refer to in consciousness at all

4719
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
it's very interesting

4720
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
compared to

4721
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
how it is in English

4722
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
it's so much richer

4723
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
and more intelligent in some ways

4724
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
you remind me of one thing

4725
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I was talking to another

4726
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
buddy who might join us

4727
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
who's a good candidate

4728
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
to join our team

4729
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
I must ask you to hold

4730
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
I'm getting an important call

4731
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
okay

4732
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
oh it's too late

4733
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
I missed it

4734
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
it's alright, I'm here

4735
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
oh I see

4736
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
okay

4737
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
maybe I'll talk about that

4738
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
and we'll

4739
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
we can continue another day

4740
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
of course

4741
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
there's a word

4742
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Darren

4743
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
the word we are looking for is like

4744
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
sensibility

4745
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
meaning

4746
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
what is it that we are looking

4747
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
what is it that we are trying to get

4748
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
artificial intelligence to do?

4749
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
what is intelligence?

4750
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
acumen

4751
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
but they seem

4752
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
the western world seems

4753
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
to not want to talk about

4754
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
the word

4755
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
which is even more clear

4756
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
in the Indian language in Tamil

4757
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
and some of our local languages

4758
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
it's called Bhutti

4759
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Buddha's name comes from that

4760
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Buddha is not his name

4761
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
no

4762
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
but they call it

4763
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
like miss the sensible

4764
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
what I

4765
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
see I want to talk to you

4766
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
I mean one word in English is equanimity

4767
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
equanimity is it?

4768
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
yeah it means not biased

4769
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
you don't

4770
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
you don't collapse into extremity

4771
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
you're balanced

4772
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
hmm

4773
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
ah yes

4774
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
that says that

4775
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
your balance

4776
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
what

4777
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
I guess what to me

4778
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
why the western world my trip over

4779
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
it is when we talk about

4780
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
sensibility

4781
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
in the context

4782
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
they are thinking of cognition

4783
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
the western world

4784
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
when it talks about AI

4785
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
it's like forever going into cognition

4786
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
and we are saying no the body

4787
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
and the mind

4788
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
must be both taken into account

4789
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
in realizing what is the right

4790
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
sensible thing to see sensible

4791
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
or the right thing to do which is

4792
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
which we will say is a sensible thing

4793
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
to do the sensible thing to do

4794
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
includes what your body

4795
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
which means instinct

4796
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
what your instinctive reactions are

4797
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
because you're dealing with for example

4798
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
indigenous people

4799
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
and pretty much they're running on instinct

4800
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
you know we don't know about

4801
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
what cognition they have or they don't have

4802
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
it doesn't matter

4803
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
they're functional people on instinct

4804
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
so sensibility

4805
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
the word sense immediately implies

4806
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
you know the five senses

4807
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
for example right

4808
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
more cognition

4809
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
why had it occurred to you

4810
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
or does it occur to you why does the western world

4811
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
not talk about sensibility

4812
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
the question is very

4813
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
broad

4814
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
meaning

4815
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
like say when

4816
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
in the AI circles and stuff

4817
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
right when you're talking about

4818
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
ethics and whatever

4819
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
why not say

4820
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
hey

4821
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
which of these LLMs

4822
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
is more sensible

4823
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
takes into account

4824
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
sensibility

4825
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
which is different from intelligence

4826
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
and I think enough people would know

4827
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
that yeah

4828
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
because intelligence immediately in a big way

4829
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
kind of like

4830
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
in the slides

4831
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
or the leans towards

4832
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
academia

4833
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
leans towards

4834
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
it does

4835
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
but the common humans have no

4836
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
all

4837
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
they're missing

4838
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
what you have

4839
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
they're missing the experience

4840
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
of

4841
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
coherent

4842
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
daily life

4843
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
that

4844
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
most of whose

4845
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
rules don't need

4846
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
to be written or declared

4847
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
so what they have is something really

4848
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
weird they have a thing where

4849
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
all the rules are written

4850
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
and declared

4851
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
and you have to either obey

4852
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
the ignorant of

4853
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
or reject them

4854
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
and one of the reasons why

4855
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Trump is about to get elected in this country

4856
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
is because the rejection crowd

4857
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
is really pissy at this point

4858
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
in history

4859
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
everybody all the males

4860
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
all the ignorant poorly educated males

4861
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
who have no fucking

4862
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
no clue about

4863
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
what it means to be human and yet are

4864
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
anyway

4865
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
they want somebody who gets away with breaking the rules

4866
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
and they will elect that guy

4867
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
if we don't you know

4868
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
if something doesn't stop them

4869
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
and

4870
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
the guy

4871
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
so he's the opposite of sensibility

4872
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
but he masquerades as sensible

4873
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
right

4874
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
I saw some advertising with him

4875
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
between masquerading

4876
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
as sensible

4877
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
and having to be sensible

4878
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
to get elected and stay there

4879
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
in a way from the other

4880
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
prejudice

4881
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
you're not going to get elected if you're sensible

4882
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
there's no chance

4883
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
of that happening

4884
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
yeah that's

4885
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
no

4886
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
that's not going to happen

4887
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
you get elected not okay

4888
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
in America you get elected not because you're sensible

4889
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
you get elected because you're sensational

4890
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
it's a society of spectacles

4891
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
right

4892
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
the better your spectacle the better the brand

4893
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
of spectacle that you produce

4894
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
the more likely you are to be elected

4895
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
that's sick

4896
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
that's sad I mean

4897
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
it's screwed that up so bad

4898
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
I mean like

4899
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
here let me ask you this

4900
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Kamala Harris should not be there

4901
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
should not be up there

4902
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
should she

4903
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
I don't know

4904
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
how would I tell

4905
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
I mean supposing I really cared

4906
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
right

4907
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
how would I make the determination

4908
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
do I want

4909
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
a pissed off para-feminist

4910
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
having a voice in the government

4911
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
yeah I probably do

4912
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
her particularly I'm not sure

4913
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
I mean like

4914
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
like a fly on the wall

4915
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
you know

4916
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
I don't know Kamala Harris's

4917
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
talk very much

4918
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
maybe I'm actually thinking of AOC

4919
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
when you said her name

4920
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
at least AOC is

4921
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
I mean like she's

4922
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
she's smart

4923
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
yeah I mean

4924
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
yeah smart

4925
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
she

4926
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
I mean she knows how to get attention

4927
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
and it's not just

4928
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
she used to be good

4929
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
but I think she's going downhill

4930
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
by the way

4931
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
I've spent about 27 minutes

4932
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
of my life listening to politicians

4933
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
in 2020

4934
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
acts

4935
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
that's something I mostly

4936
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
just ignore to be clear

4937
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
and also to be clear for posterity

4938
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
if anyone listens to this

4939
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
I'm not well educated

4940
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
okay

4941
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
so and you're able to

4942
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
I guess

4943
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
for whatever you do

4944
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
it doesn't affect you too much

4945
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
or you find spots where

4946
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
you're not affected by

4947
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
you operate

4948
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
I have a simple principle

4949
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
at this accelerated age

4950
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
that I'm at almost 60

4951
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
not a kid anymore

4952
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
the simple principle is

4953
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
try not to actively import suffering

4954
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
outside

4955
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
so

4956
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
the news is basically all about

4957
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
importing suffering

4958
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
so I mostly buffer that off

4959
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
I may glance at it but I don't take it seriously

4960
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
and I rarely reflect on it

4961
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
it's mostly just me taking

4962
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
the temperature of modernity

4963
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
is the apocalypse likely to happen today

4964
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
or next week

4965
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
yeah

4966
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
it's mostly that

4967
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
do you pay much attention to news

4968
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
what's your relationship with it like

4969
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
not much

4970
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
I mean I pay attention

4971
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
to the news

4972
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
in the last 5-10 years

4973
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
some areas I'm a bit interested

4974
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
more like world issues

4975
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
well I mean like say India

4976
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Russia

4977
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
is hitting

4978
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
China to some extent

4979
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
of course

4980
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
I want to get

4981
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
for orientation

4982
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
then

4983
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
being a bit more attentive

4984
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
I'm still more

4985
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
I would read news

4986
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
that touches on our area

4987
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
like what I'm talking to you about

4988
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
getting funding

4989
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
or if it's not funding

4990
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
how do I go to the next step

4991
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
from where I am

4992
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
and the next step in

4993
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
your village

4994
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
becoming a voice

4995
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
and making connections

4996
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
and me

4997
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
finding a way to

4998
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
self sustain it

4999
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
to fund it

5000
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
when I sent you

5001
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
the link

5002
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
to

5003
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
we move

5004
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
we found this or whatever

5005
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
basically

5006
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
align with people

5007
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
who would

5008
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
invest in us or finances

5009
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
or help us out

5010
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
because we've got

5011
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
enough

5012
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
if we have a team

5013
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
enough of us have to be paid

5014
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
right

5015
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
such as the world

5016
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
so

5017
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
where can you get funding and who funds them

5018
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
and what are the requirements

5019
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
and who has been successful

5020
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
that kind of news

5021
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
that I keep up

5022
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
and then over and above that

5023
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
when you see me

5024
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
writing

5025
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
most of my writing is under

5026
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
the under

5027
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
the substrate of it is

5028
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
how do we

5029
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
why can't we be

5030
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
the same state

5031
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
develop

5032
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
why can't we be the same state

5033
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
high state we were

5034
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
500 or 600 years ago

5035
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
right in my neck of the woods

5036
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
and in particular

5037
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
like

5038
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
saying the villages

5039
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
why

5040
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
all of the things

5041
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
zero crime

5042
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
embodied currency

5043
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
embodied learning

5044
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
why can't we have that

5045
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
it's like

5046
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
why can't we have what I had from

5047
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
zero to seven with an unconditional love

5048
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
mother

5049
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
I can go and sleep

5050
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
and I want kids

5051
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
and I want my

5052
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
I want the work

5053
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
of hundreds of generations of

5054
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
my forefathers to continue

5055
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
instead of it going

5056
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
so downhill in one generation

5057
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
it has gone downhill too

5058
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
everybody

5059
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
is doing it meaning

5060
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
you go around with solicit doing crime

5061
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
and whatever just casually

5062
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
and you ask me what the hell are you doing

5063
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
and they say hey everybody you can't

5064
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
you don't do it everybody is doing it

5065
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
and I said no

5066
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
not everybody is doing it

5067
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
I'm not doing it come on

5068
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
for example a lawyer who is

5069
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
stealing and cheating and screwing his customer

5070
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
hey don't have faith in your intellect

5071
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
that you can do something else

5072
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
for example we stopped

5073
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
you know emerging we stopped creating

5074
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
anything new for 600 years

5075
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
why didn't we do part of that

5076
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
that needs law too

5077
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
I mean the young kids

5078
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
the younger people are a bit ready to

5079
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
listen to that the folks

5080
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
who are the lawyers and stuff

5081
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
big names no they're not interested

5082
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
in that they want to screw the system

5083
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
bloody hell I'm so

5084
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
but I guess they're not born in the

5085
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
kind of village and conditional love

5086
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
environment that I was

5087
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
look whenever you take

5088
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
a cohort like lawyers

5089
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
or doctors or dentists or

5090
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
teachers

5091
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
you're gonna find a large prevalence

5092
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
of what I'll call the worst common

5093
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
denominator

5094
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
which is the people who

5095
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
you know

5096
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
but what you're actually looking at

5097
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
is a topology

5098
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
and as you come to understand

5099
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
the structure of the topology

5100
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
you'll be able to find the people in

5101
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
the cohort who aren't defecting

5102
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
and those people will be excited to discover

5103
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
you as well

5104
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
this is a moment of mutual

5105
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
appreciation

5106
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
that's long been coming

5107
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
many of us would like the dreams of our

5108
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
ancestors

5109
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
not to be flushed down the toilet

5110
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
in a single generation

5111
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
and some of us would like those dreams

5112
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
to be actually fulfilled

5113
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
so that's

5114
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
those purposes live

5115
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
in the hearts of humans

5116
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
and if we can

5117
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
awaken them it will be very

5118
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
powerful

5119
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
and it doesn't have to be a cult

5120
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
it doesn't even have to be

5121
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
political it can just be human

5122
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
and you often you know in your writing

5123
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
you know you say

5124
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
this is an everyday

5125
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
thing

5126
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
this is normal

5127
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
yes

5128
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
I think that's what those guys in the

5129
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
book I quoted from earlier were saying

5130
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
too they're like we have this narrative

5131
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
that it's impossible to change this

5132
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
and that humans are fundamentally broken

5133
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
it's not true

5134
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,000
they're just trapped in why are they

5135
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:40,000
trapped in thinking they're broken

5136
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
so yeah these are things that I

5137
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
want to keep

5138
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000
exploring and understanding better and get

5139
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:52,000
people doing something around

5140
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
right experimenting

5141
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,000
play grow learn discover

5142
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,000
remember

5143
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
remember how we can be

5144
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
yeah

5145
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
I'm trying to

5146
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
you know in my own way

5147
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
yeah yeah okay good good

5148
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
so you know

5149
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
between Indonesia

5150
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
and San Francisco

5151
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
you know I'll

5152
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
on this you know formulate

5153
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
some more what's next steps

5154
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
we can take

5155
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
making this happen

5156
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,000
yes

5157
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,000
we let us

5158
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
let us bookmark that

5159
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
for our next conversation but there are

5160
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
some for sure

5161
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
and I'm absolutely

5162
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
willing to explore them together

5163
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
I just need to get some food in me

5164
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
