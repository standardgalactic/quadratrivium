00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello, everybody, including the Stellar's Jay.

00:14.000 --> 00:25.840
Welcome.

00:25.840 --> 00:31.400
I was listening to Eric Weinstein.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.240
And that is the way, the correct way to pronounce.

00:35.240 --> 00:39.640
It's Stein, not Steen, in this case.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.560
Just to help you remember in case you care too.

00:46.400 --> 00:52.400
And what he was talking about was complicated to

00:52.560 --> 00:59.560
synopsis.

00:59.560 --> 01:04.680
One of the subtopics was the danger of artificial

01:04.680 --> 01:09.360
intelligence, which is something I can and will

01:09.360 --> 01:13.520
riff on at length sometime soon, but probably not

01:13.520 --> 01:14.520
today, we'll see.

01:23.400 --> 01:32.400
And as some of you know, I've been deeply and rather

01:32.400 --> 01:40.400
urgently curious about a phenomenon.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.400
Phenomenon?

01:48.400 --> 01:51.400
I think it's the latter phenomenon.

01:53.400 --> 01:57.400
We'll find out later.

01:57.400 --> 02:00.400
Yeah, I've been deeply curious about something that

02:00.400 --> 02:05.400
took place in my life around the end of 2018 and

02:05.400 --> 02:13.400
involved a sudden transformation of my lived

02:13.400 --> 02:20.400
experience as a human being that was quite

02:20.400 --> 02:27.400
confusing.

02:27.400 --> 02:34.400
And I'd be inclined to think that this is personal to

02:34.400 --> 02:35.400
me.

02:35.400 --> 02:40.400
I'm traversing the boundary of what I might think of as

02:40.400 --> 02:44.400
a life phase or something has gone horribly wrong in my

02:44.400 --> 02:53.400
body or my mind or both.

02:53.400 --> 03:01.400
And of course, you know, it's relatively easy to

03:01.400 --> 03:05.400
become suspicious of oneself in a broad variety of

03:05.400 --> 03:16.400
exotic and often momentous ways.

03:16.400 --> 03:23.400
It certainly didn't feel like this is local to me,

03:23.400 --> 03:25.400
but then you always have the question, how would you

03:25.400 --> 03:32.400
know?

03:32.400 --> 03:49.400
To the degree that you're isolated or unable to...

03:49.400 --> 04:04.400
You don't have access to a broad group of people with

04:04.400 --> 04:16.400
whom you can explore quest, actually, together.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.400
And I want to be really clear that if you're trying to

04:21.400 --> 04:31.400
learn something, you want a tightly knit, brilliant,

04:31.400 --> 04:40.400
curious, passionate, playful, creative little cohort of

04:40.400 --> 04:49.400
three to eight people or something to do the work with

04:49.400 --> 04:58.400
because in any situation where you share motivations as a

04:58.400 --> 05:04.400
human being, and in case it isn't obvious, all of work.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.400
That's not a small category.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.400
The entirety of work.

05:09.400 --> 05:17.400
And all of war, the entirety of war, both of these two

05:17.400 --> 05:23.400
things primarily capture and, you know, weaponize in their

05:23.400 --> 05:34.400
own ways, deploy both the intrinsic urge.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.400
And I want you to hear the word urgency when I use that word

05:37.400 --> 05:41.400
there.

05:41.400 --> 05:59.400
The intrinsic urge to follow each other into something

05:59.400 --> 06:13.400
like triumph, glory, if you will, beauty, profundity.

06:13.400 --> 06:25.400
To follow each other into meaningful roles and noble and

06:25.400 --> 06:30.400
triumphant endeavors together.

06:30.400 --> 06:42.400
And if any of us take a moment and stop and ask ourselves,

06:42.400 --> 06:53.400
does any of my human experience muchly look like that?

06:53.400 --> 06:56.400
In a way, a lot of that is make something new happen.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.400
Children are very good at it.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.400
They just play.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.400
Of course, dismissing it with such a simplistic word doesn't

07:02.400 --> 07:05.400
help us understand what's really going on there.

07:05.400 --> 07:15.400
It's nothing like the common supposition of meaningless

07:15.400 --> 07:18.400
costumery and role-playing and so on.

07:18.400 --> 07:23.400
Notice that much of what the children do qualifies as role-playing.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.400
The adults are doing that but not realizing it, and they're

07:26.400 --> 07:31.400
often playing roles that actually suck, that are terrible to

07:31.400 --> 07:38.400
play for the sake of jobs and war and for the sake of the

07:38.400 --> 07:56.400
anatomy rather than learning and so forth.

07:56.400 --> 08:06.400
Eric said that one of his favorite quotes, which he said he

08:06.400 --> 08:13.400
loves, and I know what it is to crafted a phrase that one feels

08:13.400 --> 08:18.400
pretty excited to have participated in the birth of.

08:18.400 --> 08:23.400
This is possible in language and it's possible in English.

08:23.400 --> 08:30.400
Few of us have good reason to reach for it regularly.

08:30.400 --> 08:39.400
Most of us have suffered losses and injustices that would

08:39.400 --> 08:48.400
incline our hearts to rise from their common graveyards and

08:48.400 --> 09:03.400
speak posthumously about what killed them.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.400
That would be a heroic endeavor.

09:06.400 --> 09:11.400
You certainly want a small cohort of human agreement.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.400
The agreement to pursue, for example, what we refer to in

09:15.400 --> 09:19.400
English as a course of action together.

09:19.400 --> 09:24.400
For mutual benefit, insight, for justice not in the sake of

09:24.400 --> 09:30.400
punishing something that went wrong but in the sense of doing

09:30.400 --> 09:35.400
something so beautiful that everyone who ever lived would

09:35.400 --> 09:40.400
obviously agree and stand up and cheer where they present.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.400
That's what I mean by triumph.

09:42.400 --> 09:50.400
I don't mean game theoretical zero sum-ness.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.400
I beat him, whatever.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.400
I don't mean that.

09:55.400 --> 10:01.400
There's always an option more beautiful than any that's ever

10:01.400 --> 10:04.400
been tabled.

10:04.400 --> 10:09.400
In a sense, this is what we are going, this is what humans go

10:09.400 --> 10:14.400
nuts over when they become very interested in.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.400
Small sequences of time in a sporting event.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.400
Notice those two things.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.400
What is primarily meant by sport?

10:25.400 --> 10:32.400
The actual underlying meaning is we will become heroic together

10:32.400 --> 10:37.400
and there might be a subtext that goes something like,

10:37.400 --> 10:42.400
while threatening but not actually killing each other.

10:42.400 --> 10:48.400
While threatening to destroy the foe and even using similar

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
language.

10:49.400 --> 10:54.400
He devised that, you know, right?

10:54.400 --> 11:00.400
But largely if not completely avoiding explicit, you know,

11:00.400 --> 11:04.400
lethal physical violence the way something like war does.

11:04.400 --> 11:09.400
Obviously these two very confusing behaviors of humans have a

11:09.400 --> 11:13.400
lot in common and discovering what they have in common and how

11:13.400 --> 11:18.400
where that originates and how those forces could be redirected

11:18.400 --> 11:32.400
would be the mandate, not the mandate, the, it's not purview.

11:32.400 --> 11:40.400
It would be the description of, some of you will know the word I'm

11:40.400 --> 11:48.400
trying to remember.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.400
Somewhere between mandate and purview is this word and I think it

11:51.400 --> 12:04.400
starts with P, the provision of a worthy mission, right?

12:04.400 --> 12:10.400
A quest in which our triumph would liberate many beings.

12:10.400 --> 12:16.400
And if there's a simple definition of the kinds of quests that I

12:16.400 --> 12:22.400
think we come to human incarnation in order to participate in,

12:22.400 --> 12:26.400
ignoring that language is fallible and confusing, we might say

12:26.400 --> 12:33.400
something that resembles.

12:33.400 --> 12:38.400
Let us return degrees of liberty, insight, communion and memory to

12:38.400 --> 12:45.400
each other moment by moment while we dwell here in a very

12:45.400 --> 12:55.400
confusing layered array of desynchronizing masquerades proposed

12:55.400 --> 13:02.400
and in some cases mandated by something that is neither human nor

13:02.400 --> 13:04.400
sane.

13:04.400 --> 13:09.400
We will work against those things together to ensure a better life

13:09.400 --> 13:16.400
for our children, a happier eternity for our ancestors and indeed

13:16.400 --> 13:20.400
for all of the kinds of children and ancestors that the earth produces.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
And maybe we could extend it beyond there.

13:22.400 --> 13:27.400
No, all, all forms of ancestors, all forms of children in all of

13:27.400 --> 13:30.400
time on every world, right?

13:30.400 --> 13:35.400
As if they were one family, which I have good reason to strongly suspect

13:35.400 --> 13:50.400
they probably are.

13:50.400 --> 13:59.400
So Eric's one of his favorite quotes or something he said is,

13:59.400 --> 14:04.400
and I may be paraphrasing slightly, but it's such a short statement

14:04.400 --> 14:16.400
that whatever noise I'm likely to introduce will be very minimal.

14:16.400 --> 14:21.400
It will probably preserve the spirit of the speaker rather than depart

14:21.400 --> 14:28.400
into my own projections.

14:28.400 --> 14:39.400
He said many people will die never having heard their own voice.

14:39.400 --> 14:56.400
And he doesn't mean the kind of hearing that I am at present experiencing

14:56.400 --> 15:03.400
in my ears of my speech.

15:03.400 --> 15:11.400
He means something like,

15:11.400 --> 15:18.400
what your soul itself would compose given the liberty and skill required

15:18.400 --> 15:21.400
to do so.

15:21.400 --> 15:33.400
In a moment of cataclysmic passion that not merely transforms history

15:33.400 --> 15:43.400
but mediates it in such a way as to pierce the veils of both linguistic

15:43.400 --> 15:46.400
and social fictions completely.

15:46.400 --> 15:55.400
A shining sort of insight, a passion of meaningful form.

15:55.400 --> 16:08.400
And the ironic thing is that Eric has succeeded in doing something that

16:08.400 --> 16:12.400
it might be called a grunge in my private language.

16:12.400 --> 16:16.400
It's a branching. It's a specific kind of branching.

16:16.400 --> 16:26.400
There are statements that turn out to enact and at the same time describe

16:26.400 --> 16:39.400
what they themselves are doing.

16:39.400 --> 16:47.400
And one of the things that Eric is doing there

16:47.400 --> 16:49.400
isn't as dumb as speaking.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.400
It's not as simple as speak truth to power.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.400
It's interesting though that, you know, sometimes could be

16:55.400 --> 17:00.400
if it hadn't been captured and weaponized against its own origin

17:00.400 --> 17:08.400
by nefarious amalgams of zombie-like intention in the dead protocols humans run

17:08.400 --> 17:11.400
and call civilization.

17:11.400 --> 17:17.400
And maybe just there, I was doing what Eric was doing.

17:17.400 --> 17:27.400
Raising a sword against an entire dimension of actual injustice

17:27.400 --> 17:33.400
of immiserating humans and all beings on Earth

17:33.400 --> 17:36.400
because if the humans aren't happy, boy,

17:36.400 --> 17:42.400
will they visit the punishment to every possible place it can be visited

17:42.400 --> 17:50.400
and invent new ones today.

17:50.400 --> 17:56.400
He was doing what he was saying.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.400
He was lifting his voice.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.400
This is something that he obviously deeply believes in.

18:02.400 --> 18:07.400
And I think he wants to do more than speak.

18:07.400 --> 18:17.400
Even the opportunity, I doubt this guy would continue to sit on stages

18:17.400 --> 18:29.400
expositing the trouble and his perplexity at what might be understood

18:29.400 --> 18:37.400
as our mutual continued explicit toleration of and or active,

18:37.400 --> 18:43.400
or I should say mostly passive, both, passive and active membership in.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.400
This is what he would be very concerned about.

18:45.400 --> 18:50.400
And I think most people, given an exit route from that charade,

18:50.400 --> 18:56.400
they might be very cautious and frightened at first and timid.

18:56.400 --> 19:07.400
But if they're given a modest taste

19:07.400 --> 19:11.400
of the results of creative enactment, right,

19:11.400 --> 19:18.400
creative mutual enactment of such principles,

19:18.400 --> 19:21.400
they're not going to go back to McDonald's,

19:21.400 --> 19:28.400
to the McDonald's of human purpose.

19:28.400 --> 19:37.400
And one of the things Eric is saying is that something has gone horribly wrong.

19:37.400 --> 19:58.400
And give me a moment here.

19:58.400 --> 20:03.400
Something has gone horribly wrong in such a way

20:03.400 --> 20:08.400
that it appears at least here in the West.

20:08.400 --> 20:16.400
I can't, you know, and among many people known to me

20:16.400 --> 20:25.400
that a fundamental resource that ordinarily causes our interest

20:25.400 --> 20:29.400
and motivation and so forth has disappeared.

20:29.400 --> 20:36.400
It has at least been occluded if it hasn't been straight up stolen.

20:36.400 --> 20:43.400
Now, I don't know what happened at the end of 2018.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.400
It's pre-COVID.

20:46.400 --> 20:50.400
Having spoken with many people,

20:50.400 --> 20:59.400
they describe a sudden onset of radical disturbances.

20:59.400 --> 21:15.400
And some of them describe a felt sense of impending doom just before the transition.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.400
I know that I'm going to say something that's kind of spooky,

21:18.400 --> 21:37.400
but anything that can steal something from us that results in a significant loss

21:37.400 --> 21:48.400
of the ability to detect the problem can just keep stealing till we're dead.

21:48.400 --> 21:55.400
Anything that does that.

21:55.400 --> 22:07.400
It should be obvious to the proportion of humans perversely incentivized

22:07.400 --> 22:15.400
to go after the rest of the humans for whatever can be taken from them.

22:15.400 --> 22:20.400
And let's be clear, that's a significant cohort in terms of power.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.400
It doesn't have to have a big number.

22:23.400 --> 22:32.400
Seven powerful people without agenda, they're going to make shit happen.

22:32.400 --> 22:36.400
Here we see the dark side of the power of human agreement.

22:36.400 --> 22:44.400
And that dark side is weirdly all around us.

22:44.400 --> 22:55.400
It's very difficult to forge a vessel for discovery, insight, creativity, play, and triumph

22:55.400 --> 23:05.400
in an environment where every organization can be captured.

23:05.400 --> 23:12.400
Anything that succeeds can be captured.

23:12.400 --> 23:26.400
So we might have to together become experts in the short term one stroke, two strokes,

23:26.400 --> 23:40.400
successful quest or caper, mutual adventure, rescue, rehumanizing, liberating.

23:40.400 --> 23:50.400
We might have to become really good at forming a pod like group, training it briefly,

23:50.400 --> 24:02.400
running some experimental quests, and then going after something really worth achieving together

24:02.400 --> 24:06.400
and dissolving and then going on to the next phase.

24:07.400 --> 24:12.400
I've noticed that living systems in nature do this all the time.

24:12.400 --> 24:22.400
They have extremely meaningful, however momentary,

24:22.400 --> 24:27.400
semiotic or really pro...

24:27.400 --> 24:29.400
Well, something I can't say in English.

24:29.400 --> 24:36.400
It means pro-transsentient.

24:36.400 --> 24:44.400
Endeavors where we don't just build a vehicle, we lift the whole context, you know,

24:44.400 --> 24:54.400
two or three orders above where it normally sits.

24:54.400 --> 25:04.400
And what I would suggest is that whatever the fuck happened in 2018 was the opposite.

25:04.400 --> 25:11.400
Something drained a context.

25:11.400 --> 25:15.400
And it may have only been partly human.

25:15.400 --> 25:33.400
It may be that even the zombie functions that run as human civilizations and societies

25:33.400 --> 25:42.400
obey some kind of a synchronizing influence, right?

25:42.400 --> 25:53.400
Causing them to expand dramatically in concert with transformations of broader contexts

25:53.400 --> 25:57.400
we have no language for or can't detect yet.

26:03.400 --> 26:21.400
What Eric was saying was that

26:21.400 --> 26:34.400
if you observe someone who is really straining at the edges of their capacity to act,

26:34.400 --> 26:38.400
and this is something you will see in common between...

26:38.400 --> 26:42.400
And by the way, there's ways to mimic this so you don't have to actually do it.

26:42.400 --> 26:51.400
You can appear to be doing it and make shitloads of money and gain a lot of human attention.

26:51.400 --> 27:12.400
But if our cultures, our nations,

27:12.400 --> 27:21.400
our strange caricatures, like those assembled by an insane AI image generation system,

27:21.400 --> 27:32.400
if they are strange caricatures of our actual or possible humanity, then war in a sense is them fucking.

27:32.400 --> 27:42.400
And for the unfucked hallucinatory nightmare of not actually being human

27:42.400 --> 27:48.400
thing that our nations have become, and maybe always were,

27:48.400 --> 27:53.400
nothing, there's nothing more important than getting off that way.

27:53.400 --> 27:57.400
This should be obvious if we just track where the money goes.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.400
Where's the money?

27:59.400 --> 28:03.400
It isn't in infrastructure. It's not in social development or education.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.400
It isn't in healthcare.

28:05.400 --> 28:12.400
The money is in generating disasters, which, you know,

28:12.400 --> 28:19.400
this is why the zombie functions that run this way have as one of their organizing imperatives,

28:20.400 --> 28:29.400
I'm using that word again, to fail.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.400
Okay, we understand you're new here, Joe.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.400
You've only been here a couple weeks.

28:34.400 --> 28:38.400
We're trying to produce, you thought we were trying to produce a free energy device,

28:38.400 --> 28:43.400
and so you've brought us seven designs that, as far as I can tell as an engineer,

28:43.400 --> 28:44.400
probably produce free energy.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.400
Don't ever do that again.

28:46.400 --> 28:50.400
I'll let it go this time.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.400
We're not here to produce solutions.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.400
We are paid to study the problem.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.400
That's what we do.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.400
At great expense.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.400
We get a lot of money.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.400
Three million a month for a 25-person organization.

29:05.400 --> 29:10.400
We get a lot of money to not solve that problem.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.400
We'll let it slide this time, next time.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.400
You're not only out, we'll come after you.

29:15.400 --> 29:20.400
Don't go bringing stuff like this to anyone else, either.

29:20.400 --> 29:27.400
This is the problem that we have with the prison military industrial complex,

29:27.400 --> 29:37.400
that Eisenhower clearly saw clairvoyantly, but also not clairvoyantly.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.400
He didn't have to imagine it in the future.

29:40.400 --> 29:49.400
He was being faced with it during his presidency and was trying to do what Eric said, in a sense,

29:49.400 --> 29:57.400
which is to hear the sound of his own actual voice above the din of compliance

29:57.400 --> 30:10.400
and the nine kinds of compromised, cult-like, weaponized perspective

30:10.400 --> 30:24.400
that feeds the paper mills of national invective and propaganda.

30:24.400 --> 30:30.400
And that actually run the prisons, and that actually run the wars, and that actually eat the money, and so forth.

30:30.400 --> 30:34.400
But they don't just eat money. They were satisfied to eat the money.

30:34.400 --> 30:41.400
It might be worth paying them off just to keep them indolent.

30:41.400 --> 30:48.400
Yeah, if that, that wouldn't be the worst investment I could think of of, I don't know,

30:48.400 --> 30:55.400
$30 trillion over, what, 20 years or something? 15, who knows.

30:55.400 --> 31:01.400
And that's just the money, right? Wherever you see money of that magnitude, you can be absolutely certain.

31:01.400 --> 31:11.400
There's environmental, relational, cognitive, and metabolic obliteration, fields and layers of it all around where that money comes from

31:11.400 --> 31:25.400
and what it gets used to do, and what it gets used to ensure we don't do together.

31:25.400 --> 31:33.400
Yeah.

31:33.400 --> 31:39.400
I'll be back in a moment.

31:39.400 --> 32:05.400
So, what did the people who I've spoken with report directly to me and through others?

32:05.400 --> 32:24.400
A sense of impending doom, almost a sense of impending doom, like Frank Herbert's science fiction, which I think both things would be right in a bizarre way.

32:24.400 --> 32:45.400
A sudden feeling of relief, brief, right? Some of them described a brief feeling of relief as if something really heavy they'd been carrying had disappeared or been taken away.

32:45.400 --> 33:11.400
And then a total lack of motivation, disruption of sleep, eating, sudden dimming of awareness and senses,

33:11.400 --> 33:28.400
decreased desire for sex, but decreased desire for relationships,

33:28.400 --> 33:57.400
near absolute a very strong avoidance of work, the loss of the desire to go to work in a dramatic and unprecedented degree.

33:58.400 --> 34:14.400
Some of these things I felt myself, for most of the people I've talked to, it wasn't a temporary change.

34:14.400 --> 34:26.400
It was what Mariners might describe as a sea change. The whole context is different from what it was yesterday.

34:26.400 --> 34:55.400
And as Mariners will tell you, there's certain kinds of calm that, at least for ships long before motors, there's certain kinds of calm, certain flavors of it.

34:57.400 --> 35:01.400
That portend disaster.

35:05.400 --> 35:19.400
You know, one thing you will see as a theme in cultures older than our own, or even our own, not so long ago.

35:20.400 --> 35:36.400
And you will see it both in, it's funny.

35:36.400 --> 35:51.400
You'll see instances of this that have at least not terrible results, and you'll see other instances that are clearly tyrannical.

35:52.400 --> 36:05.400
Let's not throw the whole idea away, because we've seen tyrannical implementations of ideas like the German phrase suggests Arbite-Mockfrey,

36:09.400 --> 36:16.400
which in a relatively literal, simplistic translation is work makes free.

36:17.400 --> 36:33.400
So, you tell everybody that you're bringing into a gulag that work will earn them freedom when, in actuality, what you have here is a death camp.

36:34.400 --> 36:59.400
Nonetheless, humans need, and many tyrants have long been aware of this, humans need to feel useful and that they're contributing toward a meaningful communal identity and efficacy, triumph, glory.

37:00.400 --> 37:14.400
And, you know, if no one gives them something better to do, then war and hatred will serve.

37:14.400 --> 37:27.400
You can, when things are really bad, like they are right now, we're going through this period of an undeclared depression affecting millions of people worldwide.

37:27.400 --> 37:35.400
If I know 50 of them, there must be millions, hundreds of millions of people who are like,

37:35.400 --> 37:40.400
geez, you know, something that fucking went missing from my life.

37:40.400 --> 37:44.400
Am I getting older? What's the problem? What's the cause?

37:44.400 --> 37:56.400
And they must be doing, you know, 900 things to try to understand in their own way for those who were thus affected, which probably isn't everybody.

37:57.400 --> 38:02.400
I mean, in fact, it's not like there's a strict cutoff date of 2018.

38:02.400 --> 38:12.400
There are people who felt the loss far before then, and people who felt the loss sometime after then, and others who haven't felt it yet and may not.

38:12.400 --> 38:20.400
Humans are sort of like a dish that you splash liquid on the counter toward the dish, right?

38:20.400 --> 38:31.400
Let's say you splash beet juice toward the dish, and then what you'll see on the dish is lots of places are completely clean, nothing you can detect there.

38:31.400 --> 38:39.400
There might be molecules, but nothing visible, and then other places are crimson red.

38:39.400 --> 38:47.400
They're bloody in that sense of the metaphor that I'm weaving here.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.400
That's how actual phenomena work.

38:50.400 --> 39:07.400
The ones that affect everyone at once are, well, we would, you know, they have a quality that we would call,

39:08.400 --> 39:17.400
okay, so the situation is someone has placed, someone has moved the dish, right?

39:17.400 --> 39:27.400
And so the dish was on the counter previously.

39:27.400 --> 39:33.400
Now we're going to place the dish onto a body of water surface,

39:34.400 --> 39:42.400
and the dish will sink, and while it is sinking, let's say the dish is made of a mirror-like substance,

39:42.400 --> 39:50.400
it will reflect the surface and what is beyond the surface. It will look like the sky.

39:50.400 --> 40:11.400
So our cultures are a bit like zombies when they are not intentionally inhabited

40:11.400 --> 40:35.400
by humans free, mostly free, of perverse incentives and the urge to mimic virtue rather than enact it.

40:35.400 --> 40:48.400
Now obviously it may seem, and it perhaps often is, that in a state where you have to conserve some form of energy,

40:48.400 --> 40:58.400
I don't mean electricity or gas, you have to conserve some form of energy that is primordial to human potential,

40:58.400 --> 41:11.400
human awareness, human opportunity, human nature, human communal endeavor and recognition.

41:11.400 --> 41:19.400
If you're going to have to operate in an environment where that fundamental energy has largely disappeared

41:19.400 --> 41:27.400
for reasons that are not easily explained, I mean we might go looking for seers to help us understand this,

41:27.400 --> 41:39.400
or possibly scientists, but they're pretty unlikely to be capable of the kinds of observations we need to get data about such things.

41:39.400 --> 41:59.400
It doesn't mean obvious, right? Science is useful when it is useful, and there's lots of places where it is, regardless of how captured it's become.

42:00.400 --> 42:21.400
So one of the things Eric was saying was that we appear here in the West

42:21.400 --> 42:35.400
to have undergone a nearly complete evisceration of our collective motivation to enact virtue, to chase liberation together, to discover.

42:35.400 --> 42:45.400
I mean he's particularly concerned about something I'm concerned about too, I just don't have the same feeling as he does perhaps.

42:51.400 --> 43:03.400
He was using the analogy, which I think is a really good one, one of his hosts was saying, can we fix this?

43:03.400 --> 43:06.400
Can we just do the right? Is there something we can do that's right?

43:06.400 --> 43:28.400
And he was like, look, imagine that your wife is 8.X months pregnant, and suddenly, unexpectedly, because usually I think such things take us by surprise, her water breaks.

43:28.400 --> 43:33.400
The question isn't, can we just keep the baby in there a little longer?

43:33.400 --> 43:50.400
Even though that may become a question, the doctors may decide to do that from a broad array of confusions and intelligent sensitivities.

43:50.400 --> 43:57.400
And he's using this analogy to describe humans on Earth.

43:57.400 --> 44:11.400
What he is saying is, the water has broken, humans can't stay on Earth anymore.

44:11.400 --> 44:17.400
The womb is turning, the humans are turning the womb toxic.

44:17.400 --> 44:22.400
He's right about that. He's right.

44:22.400 --> 44:37.400
Except he's presenting it more as a natural process where, at least in some number of cases,

44:38.400 --> 44:48.400
what we might call a predominant or penultimate animal on a living planet that becomes,

44:48.400 --> 44:55.400
I mean, this is so ironic, there's so much history here he doesn't understand, but it becomes representational.

44:55.400 --> 45:10.400
And so, what that means is it's going to become more and more divorced from its own nature, origin, and context.

45:10.400 --> 45:17.400
An analogy of this, which I think Eric would appreciate, is the fish has become allergic to water.

45:17.400 --> 45:20.400
It's making itself allergic to water.

45:20.400 --> 45:29.400
It's not going to become a bird, it's going to remain a fish, but it will become more and more allergic to the water because

45:29.400 --> 45:37.400
it's intentionally doing something, 900 things to the water and 1000 new ones per second,

45:37.400 --> 45:48.400
that make it impossible not merely for there to be fish, but for there to be organisms at all.

45:49.400 --> 45:59.400
And Eric seems to think, well, one disagreement I would have with him is relatively simple.

45:59.400 --> 46:09.400
A moment.

46:13.400 --> 46:20.400
Eric would like it if, like Elon.

46:21.400 --> 46:29.400
And, you know, Eric disagrees with Elon in a way similar to what I do.

46:36.400 --> 46:47.400
Eric doesn't think Mars is a very attractive second wound, but Eric would like to give the humans the freedom to traverse the stars.

46:47.400 --> 46:55.400
He's really angry the physics hasn't succeeded in the past, you know, since relativity at least, if not from before that,

46:55.400 --> 47:05.400
has done mostly nothing except gaze, you know, hypno-aiically at string into the depths of string theory,

47:05.400 --> 47:14.400
as demanded by Ed Whitten, the god of string theory,

47:14.400 --> 47:19.400
which has failed, you know, to bring any horse to the race.

47:19.400 --> 47:21.400
It's a horse race in this case.

47:21.400 --> 47:25.400
String theory has neither horses nor runs races.

47:25.400 --> 47:30.400
It just proposes the running of races for 50 years.

47:30.400 --> 47:42.400
A time in which we should have made 10 important discoveries that could get us either to post scarcity consuming

47:42.400 --> 47:46.400
or to space.

47:46.400 --> 47:50.400
And by space he doesn't mean nearby solar systems.

47:50.400 --> 47:52.400
He means space, the big stuff.

47:52.400 --> 47:55.400
We can go to other stars.

47:55.400 --> 48:04.400
And I think that releasing anything resembling modern humanity on time space is one of the dumbest ideas I've ever heard.

48:04.400 --> 48:15.400
There's lots of analogies people use to describe the humans.

48:15.400 --> 48:20.400
Often these analogies of children misbehaving.

48:20.400 --> 48:27.400
Those analogies are okay, but the actual situation here is much weirder.

48:27.400 --> 48:35.400
All the life phases of the humans are misbehaving together.

48:35.400 --> 48:49.400
And goose stepping with the clockwork of protocols that are fundamentally lethal.

48:49.400 --> 49:01.400
You can imagine the situation in which in a human body there was an overwhelming, sudden, overwhelming,

49:01.400 --> 49:03.400
a curve rise.

49:03.400 --> 49:15.400
A sudden, overwhelming curve rise in a signal that causes cells to die.

49:15.400 --> 49:24.400
And they could die from, you know, maybe 10, there's probably 10 different ways for them to pass away.

49:24.400 --> 49:30.400
So you can imagine first a signal within a single body that does this.

49:30.400 --> 49:44.400
Essentially what's going to happen is that person will explode inflammation everywhere and then death.

49:44.400 --> 49:49.400
The humans are generating a death signal.

49:49.400 --> 50:01.400
And the one thing you really don't want to happen is for that to get out into time space at all, ever.

50:01.400 --> 50:11.400
And as I've mentioned many times before, I think Ed Whitten probably did us a favor,

50:11.400 --> 50:21.400
because if we'd actually made physical advancements over the past 50 years, it's entirely clear to me that they'd have been weaponized.

50:22.400 --> 50:31.400
In case you haven't read much science fiction and you're not particularly imaginative about what humans would do,

50:31.400 --> 50:37.400
given something like free energy, let me be absolutely clear.

50:37.400 --> 50:45.400
There is zero chance of a post-scarcity world for the humans as they exist at present.

50:45.400 --> 51:10.400
Because for there to be a post-scarcity world, the dominant financial, industrial, military, prison-eering forces would have to be either put out to pasture or destroyed.

51:10.400 --> 51:15.400
Or, you know, you don't really have to destroy them, you just have to replace them.

51:15.400 --> 51:23.400
They're not going to go quietly into the good night, though, unfortunately.

51:23.400 --> 51:27.400
Or into the long night, as it may be.

51:27.400 --> 51:39.400
Yeah, unfortunately those forces are so disoriented that if you threaten them directly, they'll take the world hostage.

51:39.400 --> 51:48.400
And anyone who can see anything at all knows this is true.

51:48.400 --> 52:04.400
In a sense, it's ironic, and there's a reason that we fight, quote-unquote, fight, that we interact with cancer in the human body by training a weapon on it, and that the weapon is radiation.

52:05.400 --> 52:18.400
Because what you have is a cell that has become highly proliferative.

52:18.400 --> 52:23.400
It just keeps making more of itself everywhere it can.

52:23.400 --> 52:32.400
And so it's also the most expensive metabolic proposition you can table.

52:32.400 --> 52:43.400
It will literally consume all of the metabolic energy of the body in many cases.

52:43.400 --> 52:53.400
So it's as if it's sort of the opposite of a power plant.

52:53.400 --> 52:56.400
It's a distributed, unpower plant.

52:56.400 --> 53:11.400
And one of the things I'm going to suggest is that what is happening to the humans right now, and has been for a good six years or so, six years or six to nine years, maybe.

53:12.400 --> 53:24.400
Is that there is a propagation of an unpower plant in a context we don't even have language for, or is very difficult for us to identify directly one of the two.

53:24.400 --> 53:30.400
And again, anything that attacks what you identify correctly with, right?

53:30.400 --> 53:37.400
I mean, this is in effect how you build a mind virus that can eat the entire population.

53:38.400 --> 53:48.400
If they think there's something happening that they're unable to detect, particularly if only special people can detect it,

53:48.400 --> 53:56.400
and I recognize the signature in a number of the current socio-political gambits, right?

53:56.400 --> 54:05.400
Where something's wrong, something's fundamentally wrong, and unjust, although those things are true.

54:05.400 --> 54:15.400
But only we know how to detect it, and those who don't agree with our detections aren't humans.

54:15.400 --> 54:19.400
We shouldn't listen to them.

54:19.400 --> 54:22.400
There should be no discussions with them.

54:22.400 --> 54:33.400
There are to be no discussions, except among those who agree that the thing we're detecting is the problem.

54:33.400 --> 54:38.400
And that problem is, for example, patriarchy, colonization.

54:38.400 --> 54:50.400
You can pick up any monster you want, and you can collect the monsters into a kind of monster bracelet that you just keep adding to.

54:50.400 --> 54:57.400
You know, it's true, for example, that mechanical time is tyrannical.

54:57.400 --> 55:01.400
It's true.

55:01.400 --> 55:11.400
Is wokeness, the answer is, is wokeness get to weaponize that fact for their benefit?

55:11.400 --> 55:20.400
Thus claiming, you know, watches are patriarchal, time doesn't exist, mechanical time isn't true.

55:20.400 --> 55:32.400
There are so many untrue things and so many injustices in common human thought and activity that if you're going to fund a meme set with them,

55:32.400 --> 55:41.400
we are the ones who collect and display the injustices, and no one else shall do so, is a great way, it's a great source of funding.

55:41.400 --> 55:46.400
Also, anything that suggests mutual victimhood, right?

55:46.400 --> 55:50.400
What does a victim have to do?

55:50.400 --> 55:52.400
Nothing, they just broadcast.

55:52.400 --> 55:55.400
By the way, that's sort of what cancer cells do.

55:55.400 --> 55:59.400
They don't do anything except reproduce and broadcast.

55:59.400 --> 56:02.400
They just broadcast like crazy.

56:02.400 --> 56:19.400
This leads to a problem called, oh god, the sudden explosive spread of cancer to many organs or tissues.

56:19.400 --> 56:22.400
I can't recall the name of it right now.

56:22.400 --> 56:28.400
My mind is on seven other subjects.

56:28.400 --> 56:33.400
Perhaps it will come to me.

56:33.400 --> 56:41.400
But yes, so they basically just, it's a reproductive, it's a cellular.

56:41.400 --> 56:50.400
Okay, so is a cancer cell still a cell?

56:50.400 --> 56:54.400
Obviously it belongs to the category.

56:54.400 --> 57:10.400
Cancer cells are a kind of, you know, one thing a cell can become as cancer is.

57:10.400 --> 57:23.400
But it's sort of like the question, I'm going to twist the language up, just warning you ahead of time here.

57:23.400 --> 57:29.400
When is an assassin not a comedian?

57:29.400 --> 57:42.400
When is a serial killer not funny?

57:42.400 --> 57:45.400
Categories can be very misleading, can't they?

57:45.400 --> 57:55.400
And if we demonstrate how misleading they can be with statements like that, or statements like,

57:55.400 --> 58:01.400
this is the most important statement you will ever hear in English.

58:01.400 --> 58:14.400
You can see how the humor is in a way the composition of a route in consciousness.

58:14.400 --> 58:30.400
And then the sudden unexpected either disappearance of the route just goes poof, it's gone, or a radical transformation of it.

58:30.400 --> 58:41.400
So that instead of, you know, we're going to a boat, and we walk along the path that should lead to a boat,

58:41.400 --> 58:44.400
and we get to where the boat is, it's time space, right?

58:44.400 --> 58:45.400
No, it's Saturn, right?

58:45.400 --> 58:54.400
No, it's a certain breed of dog, or it's cat behavior, or anything you want to put there.

58:55.400 --> 59:00.400
You can structure human consciousness so that it has basic expectations,

59:00.400 --> 59:08.400
and then you can obliterate those artfully if you are a good comedian.

59:25.400 --> 59:38.400
I think Eric is naive in that, and he'd probably be the first to admit this.

59:38.400 --> 59:44.400
If I sat down and talked to him and asked him some clear questions, I suspect he'd admit this.

59:44.400 --> 59:47.400
But he might say I don't care.

59:47.400 --> 59:49.400
I think he's naive in two ways.

59:49.400 --> 01:00:01.400
One, he thinks it's not just a good idea, but the natural next step in a progression to get humans propagating out there in time space.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.400
And I don't think that's a very dumb idea.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:17.400
The earth womb bubble is a context that's safe enough because it's enclosed for humans to experiment together at being human.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:26.400
And you have to wait until some really good experiments, some really beautiful and noble and creative experiments,

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:34.400
and experiments that recall the virtues, particularly the virtue of memory.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:51.400
You have to wait until such time as the group body of the humans are willing to compose and conduct and enact brilliantly beautiful experiments.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:01:08.400
And those out-compete, they naturally out-compete what we might imagine to be their opposites, which are the malignant experiments,

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:18.400
and their propagation and domination activities.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:25.400
And then I think Eric is naive in a second way, which is,

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:34.400
it wouldn't surprise me to discover that Ed Whitten is a puppet, tabled by intelligences, very profound intelligences,

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.400
that came to him with a bargain.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:49.400
Like, we're going to give you two things at once, and you must accept them both, but you must enact the second one.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:57.400
We'll give you the answers to the mysteries you're chasing, we'll feed them to you over time, and you'll be able to test them.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.400
But you must release none of those to the humans.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.400
What you do with the humans is entrance them with string theory.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:17.400
Because it is reminiscent of what's actually going on, but we'll ensure they don't get the keys to the stars.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:28.400
So, at least for another, it'll keep them busy for a couple hundred years, and then suddenly some clever young woman will be like,

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:41.400
Aha! I see the problem in string theory. This is wrong. She sweeps most of it away, and there revealed, you know, some ring of keys to the sky.

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:56.400
But I think he's naive. I think he seems to not take seriously the idea that other intelligences are necessarily engaged in structuring space-time.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.400
And if they weren't before, they sure as fuck are now.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:11.400
And it's not that they're unfriendly to humans. They're unfriendly to anything that masquerades as human.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:20.400
Anything that pretends to belong to the category the same way a cancer cell does.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:29.400
But it enacts a series of protocols that are fundamentally lethal to all forms of life, right?

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:35.400
The humans are indiscriminately on the sidle at the group level.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:49.400
Thankfully, most of the individuals, though that it does occasionally get down into the individuals, and you'll see someone, often a male, go on some rampage.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.400
And we're still some group of males, right?

01:03:53.400 --> 01:04:06.400
Get them really amped up about some real or feigned injustice, and then give them guns, and direct them at any population, and watch them mayhem ensue.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:32.400
The broken monkeys are ever more broken as our development proceeds, not ever less, as we might hope, imagine, and conceive of attempting to achieve together.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:49.400
So I think he's naive in that there are other intelligences involved, and they would not want the problem that infests our species at the group level to emerge into time space.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:05:00.400
And the fundamental, one of the most fundamental dangers there is that humans will just build machines that build machines, and we've seen plenty of science fiction about that.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:12.400
But I think you'd have a hard time imagining how quickly you could go from trees and birds and flowers and insects still exist to they don't anymore.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:25.400
Because I imagine you could get there in, just depends on how recursively self-amplifying what you do is, you can get there in an hour.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:34.400
You could probably get there in an hour with an effective enough prosthesis.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:50.400
And that doesn't mean, oh, there's no more life forms. That means that the entire history, the line of all of the living beings that ever lived here, ends there, poof, extinguished.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:56.400
And there are people who will say, well, humans were a bad experiment to begin with. Right, William S. Burroughs might, but I doubt it.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:06.400
I think he actually cares about the humans. And he's certainly aware there are other intelligences in time space.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:18.400
So what I'm suggesting is, if physics suddenly delivered vehicles capable of interstellar travel, perhaps instantaneous interstellar travel,

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:37.400
we would very quickly find ourselves faced with, not enemies, but authorities that would just raise one finger toward, you know, our entire species and say, nope.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:46.400
Stop doing stupid, deadly, lethal things and pretending those things are glorious.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:07:00.400
There's nothing glorious about laying waste to the entire living history of your world and the possibility of human minds, their origin, their nature, their intrinsic purpose of endowments.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:10.400
Stop putting an end to that. Stop trading that for trinkets and snack food.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:17.400
Become a coherent species.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:35.400
Doing any other thing is going to cost you everything. You no longer have the, you have wound the clock string of nature so tightly on your planet that there's no longer any play in it.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:45.400
And the clocks that that tension usually funds, you've taken them apart at their basis.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:08:01.400
So that thing is just building stress. And when it snaps, the repercussions will certainly, you know, be devastating to maybe everything.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:07.400
I mean, there's other naivetés. The humans think they're the only game in town. They're nothing like the only game in town.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:13.400
They're one of the weirdest games in town.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:30.400
Anyone who just steps outside human culture long enough to look back at us from outside will see

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:35.400
that it depends on what they're looking for. If they're looking for the beauty, they can find it.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:52.400
But if they're looking for absurd, omnicidal, self-devastation, I mean, our species acts like a guy who takes himself hostage while attempting to rob a bank.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:59.400
It's so ridiculous from outside.

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:08.400
And, you know, anciently evolved intelligences would not be entertained by our japes.

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:11.400
They would not see our species as intelligent at all.

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:17.400
At the group level, we are bad. We're doing bad things.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:23.400
Every single human being go to them and ask them. They'll tell you. Ask them the questions.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:32.400
Do you trust what your species is doing? Do you trust what some nation is doing?

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:42.400
Any of them who are still in any way sober or connected with their own minds will say no.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:52.400
Do you think the humans will establish a path to a sustainable and livable, humane, intelligent future?

01:09:52.400 --> 01:10:01.400
No, they will not. Not the modern ones. Not the ones we have running around today.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:08.400
So one of the things Eric was suggesting, which I agree with, is that something has affected our motivation very profoundly

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.400
in a relatively, you know, in the span of like one or two generations.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:16.400
And maybe in a span much shorter than that.

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:23.400
Again, we're used to changes happening in pulses over time, much like contractions lead to birth.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:29.400
We've eradicated the play in the clock spring.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.400
Now they happen now.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:37.400
Something that would have pulsed and given us a signal that it was coming just happens.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.400
There's no pulsing.

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:55.400
We have learned using science to detect transformations in particular signals.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:01.400
For example, signals from space to the surface of the earth.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:12.400
Such that there's a bandwidth, there's some bandwidths we can watch.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:28.400
And there's very good data to suggest that we can predict earthquakes by watching for a set of transformations.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:39.400
In the duration of...

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.400
Ah, there it is.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.400
Okay, up.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:54.400
Then...

01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:00.400
Sorry, I'm watching a blue heron.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:06.400
It was about to do the old signal dance.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:19.400
But then the wind where it's sitting became too...

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.400
too unstable.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:27.400
It made its footing unstable, its basis unstable.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:38.400
It's hard to do the dance when the thing your feet are on is moving.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:50.400
Wow, maybe that's one of the messages this whole recording is about.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:13:07.400
Because there's a lot of different variables that contribute to the stability or instability of the earth beneath our feet.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:16.400
Anyone who's tried, for example, you could put some pontoons on or some magic sauce on the soles of your feet.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.400
It'll allow you to float.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:22.400
It'll allow you to step out onto the surface of the water.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.400
Your chances of walking are zero.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:30.400
You're going to fall down right now.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:40.400
Because you need something probably more like complex ice skates than sneakers.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:46.400
The surface of the water is much more slippery than ice.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.400
So if you're going to walk on that.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:59.400
What I was saying was there are both certain signals from the earth that are sent in an electromagnetic frequency range.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:22.400
And at the same time, we can detect a change in how long it takes signals from, for example, GPS satellites to reach a location where they are received.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:33.400
Subtle transformations in those signals were noticed before the Fukushima earthquake.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:50.400
Now, of course, we have a big problem here and the problem is that academic science wants to continue failing to solve the problem of earthquake preparedness.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:15:03.400
So again, we come to a situation where somebody brings them an answer and that person does not get to continue in their career or is viciously attacked.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:12.400
So I just had an encounter with a crab spider inside a calla lily.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:19.400
I haven't seen them in so many years and I'm really glad to see them here.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:23.400
I'm unsure.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:31.400
I've looked for them in Golden Gate Park.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:35.400
I don't think I've ever seen one.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:42.400
I've only seen them in a very specific garden in which I have not seen them for many years.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:54.400
So that was kind of an exciting moment in nature.

01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:03.400
I must remember what is it?

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:05.400
I must remember the moon.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:11.400
The moon cycle.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.400
No to it.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:20.400
The ones I saw were female. I saw two of them in a small group of flowers.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:36.400
That implies a much larger population than those two for there to be two on such a small group of flowers.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:41.400
That could mean many things.

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:58.400
So yeah, I think we have to hope that the intelligence is involved in composing time space and probably involved in the composition of organisms

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:08.400
and possibly involved in the propagation of life across living worlds throughout time.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:21.400
We would have to hope that...

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:29.400
You know, when I was in the bathroom a moment ago, I took a break, restroom break, there was a mosquito.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:41.400
And it made me think of how humans, the kinds of mistakes that humans make in their attempts to control the mosquito.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:50.400
Quote, unquote, control the mosquito population as if it's a separate thing from them.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:18:06.400
And this is what I mean when I say, you know, we've defected from nature on purpose as a species.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:14.400
You know, my friend Ryan Furstiver works with animals in Lethbridge.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:34.400
He's part of the system in place to, in his words, protect the animals from humans.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:19:03.400
And in his way of life, he is fulfilling important obligations as a human being to remember the intimacy of the filial relations between humans and at least the living world.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:13.400
This causes him lots of problems.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:24.400
In his quest for a mate, for example...

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:33.400
That was funny.

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.400
I'll come back to Ryan in a moment. The jogger who just passed me, she said,

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:44.400
in the sense that I ask so many questions and then I don't leave space for other people to do that.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:47.400
I mean, that's familiar.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:58.400
There's an even worse problem than that, which my son was speaking of the other night.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:12.400
Imagine that you're so curious and insightful that you're constantly showing people problems in their behavior or their thought or their situation

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:21.400
and solutions, you're implying solutions, but they don't want a solution.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:31.400
What they want is a relationship. They're trying to bond with you and you're, meanwhile, directing critical thought at them.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:43.400
I don't mean critical in the DEI sense. I mean critical as in critical thinking skills.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:55.400
We have to be careful these days because many features of our lexicon are being gobbled up by, I don't know, hopeful monsters.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:21:01.400
We might call them.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:09.400
So you can imagine a situation in which, for example, someone like myself, I'm very interested.

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.400
I think we're bonding.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:19.400
My impression is that we're bonding around insight and questing and adventure and consciousness.

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:31.400
When I have never tabled that proposal for mutual agreement in any reasonable way,

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:40.400
and the other person is just trying to see, like, is there something warm here we can have together?

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:43.400
Human? Can we bond?

01:21:43.400 --> 01:22:02.400
If I say I like the show on TV, is that likely to elicit a catastrophic critique of modern media and how it dumps us down?

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:17.400
That's a really uncomfortable position where if I have to preview in consciousness all the angles of the circle

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:31.400
where critical gaze can produce an issue, a problem, a judgment, a criticism,

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:39.400
pretty soon I can't speak at all.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:49.400
I have close friends who struggle, and I love them, and I think they're heroic,

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.400
but they shouldn't have to be heroic alone.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:23:01.400
They struggle to compose a spoken sentence in any actual conversation,

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:05.400
and perhaps much more so with me than anyone,

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:16.400
because they imagine that I will bring the momentum of my critical faculties to bear on them when they speak

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:25.400
in the same way that I do when I'm looking at human civilization, society,

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:34.400
what we call industry, war, etc., media, which is not going to happen.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:40.400
If they ask me to do something like that directly, then maybe.

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:48.400
And I might nudge them a little here and there if I think they're trying,

01:23:48.400 --> 01:24:00.400
like we're actually engaged in an intellectual conversation like I was yesterday with my friend Brian.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:07.400
We were engaged in an intellectual conversation, and so we're both trying to nudge each other toward insight,

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:17.400
but again, I failed to put the proposal on the table that just says,

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:22.400
let's make some agreements, let's have some principles,

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:30.400
and one of them is that we will, in all honesty, integrity, and good faith,

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:38.400
attempt to help each other to see better together whenever we are seeing.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:47.400
We will resist the urge to nurture our pet biases and perspectives.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:51.400
We don't have to kill them, but we will resist that urge,

01:24:51.400 --> 01:25:01.400
and we will go for what in the song title is like higher ground.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:06.400
I think there's a couple of lyrics using that phrase, at least.

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:12.400
We'll go for a better perspective, and we're going to bring our hearts with us.

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.400
We're going to be emotional. We're not going to just be abstract.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:22.400
We'll bring our hearts with us, and we will climb together.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:29.400
We will help each other see more clearly, more usefully, more intelligently, more creatively,

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:33.400
than we have before, and some of that will be playful.

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:39.400
Some of that will be joking with each other.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:45.400
I heard a rather captivating advertisement that utilized,

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:50.400
and by the way, I'm sure this is being weaponized as we speak,

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:58.400
but I heard a rather captivating advertisement in which it was pretty funny.

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:09.400
Both the guys are British, but one of them is speaking in, what would I call it?

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:17.400
People would call it more privileged language, the language of privilege, the English.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:22.400
I'm not even sure if the primary speaker was British,

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:27.400
but he had a good chunk of British accent,

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:33.400
and was speaking in a relatively sophisticated character,

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:48.400
whereas the other guy is aping a sort of skillful moron.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:27:01.400
And the advertisement was for a language teaching program.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:06.400
So in the front, you have the guy who's giving you the pitch,

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:24.400
and in the background you have included a naysayer who is obviously japing, right?

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:31.400
He's playing a role, he's para, yeah, he's para-japing.

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:40.400
He's playing a character that is intentionally caricatured for effect,

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:52.400
and that kind of play is very effective for humans,

01:27:52.400 --> 01:28:08.400
because we have evolved to doubt first advertising itself,

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:20.400
and then the monopolar accolades of advertising,

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:26.400
this product will change your life.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:32.400
We'd like to hear detractors inside the advertisement.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:36.400
If people put detractors inside the advertisement,

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.400
their advertising can become vastly more effective,

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:43.400
and somebody has noticed this fact,

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:54.400
particularly some brilliant young advertising copywriter has noticed this fact.

01:28:54.400 --> 01:29:02.400
And I'm sure that's not the only time the tool's been employed,

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:08.400
but I found it sort of charming, which was bothersome.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:16.400
And in a sense, what you want as an advertisement, excuse me, as an advertiser,

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:26.400
is anything that creates stickiness in consciousness, brand recognition, you want that.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:50.400
And negative recognition can be useful, though it isn't always.

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:56.400
When it comes to topics like these, what's going on?

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.400
What problems are we facing?

01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.400
Who is we?

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:05.400
What does we even mean in 2024?

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:15.400
Is that an outdated or archaic idea?

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.400
And who has captured we-ness and is weaponizing it?

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:25.400
And then, you know, problems like, well, what do we do?

01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:27.400
What can we actually do?

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.400
Do you know what to do?

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:35.400
Darren, you see this problem.

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.400
You probably experienced the problem in your own life,

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:42.400
or you would not be focused in this way,

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.400
or the phenomena, even if we don't frame it as a problem.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:52.400
You see these phenomena in your own life, in your own experience.

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:56.400
Look, let me be clear.

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.400
My lifespan here is limited.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:14.400
I have reached the outer edges of the solar system of Darren's identity and imperatives.

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.400
I don't have to reproduce.

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:25.400
I'm not forced to try to make money every day by circumstances.

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:28.400
Which reminds me, I have to go back to my friend, Ryan.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:36.400
So, you know, Ryan goes out on calls where people have what they consider to be a problem with an animal.

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:45.400
And usually a problem with an animal is kind of similar to some people thinking they have a problem with indigenous people.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.400
And what is the problem?

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:51.400
They keep showing up.

01:31:51.400 --> 01:32:00.400
Currently, our modern nations and societies,

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:06.400
we have a problem with a specific, it's not funny at all.

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.400
I'm not laughing because it's funny.

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:12.400
I'm laughing because it's ridiculously confusing and a mess.

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:16.400
We have a problem with certain kinds of religious fundamentalists.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:28.400
Hopefully we have a problem with them who would like nothing more than to slaughter innocent people.

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:34.400
And there are different varieties of that disease among the humans.

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:57.400
We need to be very watchful when any population or organization becomes oriented by exclusionist propaganda.

01:32:57.400 --> 01:33:03.400
Or anything resembling kill them all and let God sort them out.

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:08.400
Or anything resembling kill the infidels.

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.400
Just slaughter them.

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:11.400
Take great joy.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.400
It's a holy purpose.

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:23.400
You can see the inversion of human purpose of intelligence in these charades that are devastating and horrifying when enacted.

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:28.400
Always being enacted all day long.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:34.400
27 million times per minute.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:47.400
We've created engines of dysphoric megalomania.

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:51.400
But any time we start to hear the cry, kill the infidel,

01:33:51.400 --> 01:34:02.400
we're very carefully concerned with how we try to deal with the problems arising from that.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:15.400
And it doesn't matter if the infidel, it doesn't matter who the infidel is.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:20.400
And we're certainly hearing noises like that.

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:27.400
In the West, they haven't quite reached the pitch where you can openly say.

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:38.400
Where, for example, woke culture or extreme right-wing culture can get away with straight up saying, you know, kill other people.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:40.400
But we're on the verge of it.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:35:04.400
Often in nations, if this kind of disease gets started, it's either because war has been selected as the next move.

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.400
She notices it.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:14.400
The dog saw that I was interested in something, so she came over and checked it out.

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:21.400
It's the natural response of the satellite intelligence.

01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:31.400
They would like you to check out what they're interested in, but if you're in the dominant position, they will certainly check out what you're interested in.

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:46.400
So yeah, war is, when we see this kind of thing going on, war either has already been happening or it's next on the agenda or both and more.

01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:58.400
Because you can bleed off if, okay, let's suppose, let's take a model, a toy box society.

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:19.400
The toy box society, and one thing that's happening in the society that is very alarming and disturbing, is that every few days, or even more often, some young or older male, and almost never females, goes batshit and saying,

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:32.400
loads up on guns in an homage to Kurt Cobain and kills a bunch of innocent people.

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:38.400
So in the sandbox, in our hypothetical mini world, we notice this is happening.

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:46.400
Well, there's two things you can do, and which one you're going to select depends a lot on what your underlying motivations are.

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:57.400
If your underlying motivations are intelligent and humane, what you do is you don't attack the symptom.

01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.400
You don't attack the young men.

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:15.400
You might remove them from the capacity to repeat the behavior, and sometimes that may mean killing them because they've already decided that they're on a suicide mission.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:18.400
For example, even then, you don't have to kill them.

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:30.400
But you study them, and you determine what was the genesis of this, and what you're going to find is that it's never merely mental illness.

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:33.400
Most likely, that's what you're going to find.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:39.400
You're going to find out that the structure in the sandbox, the structure of the society, is wrong.

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:40.400
It is bad.

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.400
It's malignant.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.400
It's lying.

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:51.400
And the poison it's producing gets concentrated, and men tend to concentrate it better than women,

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:54.400
or they both concentrated equally well.

01:37:54.400 --> 01:38:07.400
They just concentrated differently so that one of the common expressions in men is sudden, inexplicable, relatively inexplicable mass murder.

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:11.400
Or, you know, you get the serial version of it.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.400
You get a serial killer.

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:23.400
So when you see that, you can study and resolve, right, by changing the structure of your society,

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:32.400
and by repairing the value systems, the relational systems, the identity systems,

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:39.400
so that it's actually rewarding to participate, and there are endless opportunities for such participation.

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:43.400
There's no reason to have a society that isn't like that, right?

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:55.400
And yet, we do have the built-for-failure model that produces what might as well be cognitive, social, relational radiation.

01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:08.400
And along with that, we're facing lots of weird kinds of actual physical radiation from devices, and electricity, and LEDs, and Wi-Fi, cell towers, and so forth.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:16.400
And there's a group of people that will say, for example, there's no evidence of the name that's harmful.

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.400
Bullshit!

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:26.400
The membrane of every cell is an electromagnetic wonderland of delicate protein folding and other kinds of operations.

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.400
There's no way you can bathe those cells in noise and expect them to work well.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:37.400
And there are certain kinds of noise that will definitely kill them off, or reduce their function catastrophically,

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:43.400
and that can happen so quickly that our data gathering doesn't track it.

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:53.400
The data is 100 years behind what nature is up to at this moment in human culture, most of the data.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:58.400
You don't get a signal till long after it's too late to respond to it.

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:15.400
So the other protocol you can enact around when you notice that the men are, or that it's common, how should I put it?

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:24.400
It's too common, right? It's much more common than it should be, that young or middle-aged men explode into violence.

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:32.400
And it doesn't have to be, right, they kill up 70 people. It can be just focused on one person or a small group of people or something.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:40.400
Again, punishing them is the wrong fucking idea, unless you're a prisoner, in which case you make money from punishing them.

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:47.400
Now you have an incentive to pretend, no, the problem is in that man, right, in the case of our sandbox, right?

01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:52.400
It's not, it's in that man. We have to attack it back and make it pay for its crime.

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:59.400
There is no crime that has ever been committed that can be paid for. Crime is not a system of accounting.

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:05.400
It's not a commercial product. I mean, actually, it turns out it is a commercial product.

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:13.400
What I mean, though, is that if wrongdoing becomes an accounting system, we're fucked.

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:22.400
Because it means that basic relational integrity has collapsed and we're no longer cognizant.

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:40.400
We can't recognize that problem. It's the same thing I was mentioning earlier, where the matter at hand attacks what you would use to detect it with first.

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:51.400
And in case it's not obvious, there are similar features in nature, but do this.

01:41:51.400 --> 01:42:05.400
One of the great examples, which tends to produce mad organ dysfunction, as well as oncogenesis, right?

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.400
Cancer making. Oh, the word I was looking for earlier.

01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:24.400
Metastasized. That's when a localized cancer spreads suddenly and often explosively throughout related organs and or tissues.

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.400
Quite distant, metabolically, from the site at which it originates.

01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:40.400
Think of the distance between, for example, well, any part of your body, let's say, your throat and your spleen.

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:48.400
And if you're thinking of the distance at the scale of human measuring, it's very close by.

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:57.400
But if you're thinking of the distance at the scale of cells, you're probably talking about a distance.

01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:06.400
So are you. You're probably talking about a distance.

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:17.400
Oh, so funny. They were looking at a hair and hunting gopher and saying it's a beautiful site.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:21.400
Yeah, for a cell, that's a huge distance. That's like light years away.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:29.400
That's like there being a problem on earth and suddenly finding that the problem has.

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:35.400
And by the way, we should carefully think about such things this way.

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:54.400
It's like having a problem in a specific housing block in Cincinnati and then having it show up on a planet orbiting Rigel.

01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:01.400
And the humans think, oh, there's no reason, there's no reason to believe that anything can connect earth and Rigel wrong.

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:06.400
They both come from the same mother. They might as well be twins.

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:10.400
They originate from the same context.

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:15.400
And notice when I say wrong, it's like I'm banging a gong.

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:19.400
Wrong, you know, just we should resonate. Nope, you got that.

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:26.400
That one, you missed that question on the test humans.

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:35.400
Metastasization. Okay, so let's ask ourselves a really weird question, which is an important one.

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:46.400
What is the opposite of social and relational metastasization of memorial metastasization?

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.400
Stuff that attacks our memory.

01:44:48.400 --> 01:45:00.400
If humans are having a disease that attacks memory, they should back the fuck up and pause as a species.

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:06.400
And this is one, okay, so when a circle back, I know I'm bird walking a bit.

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:12.400
Our guy who's misbehaving one of the strategies you can employ.

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:19.400
If this starts to happen a lot in your society is you just direct the killing, right?

01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:25.400
So you start wars or you participate in them.

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:40.400
Or, you know, you redirect the loss of human dignity, meaning, identity, role.

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.400
You redirect that loss toward a scapegoat.

01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:50.400
And that works. And humans leaders have done this again and again throughout history.

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:54.400
It is well studied. It is well understood.

01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:59.400
This is a thing that we often do as a species.

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:06.400
And primarily, it's hard to easily say what the role of the women in general is.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.400
But this is something that happens to the men.

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:23.400
And the women are at least peripherally compromised or captured by this, if not directly.

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:45.400
You know, today, in our time, I imagine that conscription has become bisexual in the sense that it needn't make determinations about gender.

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:52.400
It can conscript anyone today.

01:46:53.400 --> 01:47:05.400
A transformation that I consider tragic and perhaps quite devastating.

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:29.400
So one thing you can do is you can sort of bleed off.

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.400
You should study the problem and change.

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:41.400
We should use criminal behavior to understand its origins and transform our societies to reflect those new understandings and continue that process

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:50.400
and realize that whatever enlightenment might mean, it means something like this.

01:47:50.400 --> 01:48:01.400
And some very conservative people will argue you're rewarding bad people for bad deeds.

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:12.400
And I will argue the context you're supporting necessitates bad deeds.

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:19.400
This may sound extremely liberal, but for example,

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:35.400
if our toy box nation is spending $10 trillion every 10 years on the possibility of war and devastating human conflict

01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:46.400
and spending the rest of its money mostly just ripping the environment to shreds and stacking up paper and banks as a result,

01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:53.400
we're not having a society yet.

01:48:53.400 --> 01:49:00.400
If the academics are teaching fictions to our children and each other and supporting them,

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:04.400
we're not having education yet.

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:09.400
And by the way, education is the one thing that you can go after

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:19.400
that will definitely affect your capacity to detect that something is going after it.

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:27.400
It's actually the breadth and depth of one's not just representational education, though that matters too.

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:36.400
It's the depth and breadth of the diverse bases of one's education

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:51.400
that produces people who are not easily either A, deceived, or B, conscripted, or C, extorted into participation in atrocity.

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:55.400
And neither can we just say, like, well, it's all atrocity these days.

01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:58.400
It's a big Disneyland of atrocity. True.

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:01.400
But that doesn't mean we can defect.

01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:06.400
We still have an obligation to discover what it means to be human

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:20.400
and to redirect our societies towards something meaningful, true, beautiful, noble, trustworthy, with integrity, honesty, sincerity.

01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:27.400
And the capacity to detect counterfeits of virtue.

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:33.400
I don't... I'm not...

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:38.400
I guess I'm concerned with the kind of insight that detects injustice.

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:43.400
But I might be more concerned at the moment, at this moment in history,

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:56.400
with the kind of insight that detects the counterfeiting of virtue.

01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:02.400
And again, in the signal environment, if we were...

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:06.400
If we'd been trained in signal intelligence,

01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:16.400
and we were observing the signals being sent in our cultures right now,

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:25.400
the dominating signal forms and species and motivations and so forth.

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:28.400
We would be more than worried.

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:36.400
We would realize, oh, shit.

01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:41.400
We're not merely being invaded, and this is true of all nations.

01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:49.400
We're not merely suffering in an obscure array of simultaneous invasions.

01:51:49.400 --> 01:52:04.400
The fundamental basis of our humanity, of our cognition, of our relationships, of our language, of our politics, of our infrastructure,

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:14.400
and particularly the military, industrial, prison, mimetic context.

01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:23.400
That shit's been captured and is being weaponized against us as a people, the whole people.

01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:35.400
I mean, it's a little bit weirder because it's like that scene in Blade Runner where Harrison Ford is about to be

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:50.400
forcefully conscripted one more time to go hunt replicants, which it has been deduced,

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:57.400
are not willing to go to their time-synced death chamber on time,

01:52:57.400 --> 01:53:04.400
and if they're going to be forced to, intend to take some of the other people with them to send a message.

01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:11.400
Bad message, bad way of sending it, but I get it.

01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:17.400
So he's facing his boss. I can't remember that actor's name at the moment.

01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:23.400
Maybe it'll come to me.

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:34.400
The boss outlines the proposal and Ford says, no, I'm fucking retired. I don't want to kill anyone anymore.

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:43.400
And the boss says, you know the game, either with us or your little people.

01:53:53.400 --> 01:54:18.400
I have such a deep reverence and respect for older humans now that I've tasted of their sorrows in my own life.

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:31.400
My God, the staggering isolation and loneliness burden of most elders,

01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:40.400
along with a problem that we've skirted in this, I've skirted in this dissertation.

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:50.400
The problem of what happens if you don't have to go to work?

01:54:50.400 --> 01:55:02.400
What happens to humans if they're, what actually happens if their needs are taken care of?

01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:07.400
Hello.

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:20.400
There's an intrinsic need in us to be engaged in meaningful physical, psychological, relational, societal endeavors.

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:29.400
And that can be captured and weaponized and that's, you know, history is, modern history anyway is replete with examples of this.

01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:37.400
But there is something fundamental in that we need.

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:52.400
Well, we can defect from relational starvation and educational asphyxiation or bombardment, both, right?

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:56.400
We can defect from either of those into work.

01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:14.400
But optimally, we need to be doing, there is an intrinsic need to meaningfully employ our human bodies, minds, spirits.

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:29.400
And we're getting a lot of, I'll retract that.

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:40.400
We're in a situation where the context has transformed to produce endless forms of make work

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:45.400
that are anything but rewarding, yet do serve the purpose.

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:49.400
It's like the junk food of work, right? It's junk work.

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:56.400
And throughout history, we've heard again and again the echo, the resounding echo of a promise.

01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.400
We will release you from work to become enlightened.

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:04.400
Okay, could happen.

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:12.400
We will release you from work or in prison hearing so that you can establish on enlightened society.

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:29.400
But the modes of that have to be established before...

01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:36.400
It's like you need to have that stuff spun up before you stop giving humans work.

01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:47.400
And in the interim, when it's not yet spun up and the human desire or possibility of meaningful work is evaporating worldwide.

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:58.400
You might want to pay attention to the origin of that signal because it might mean, and I think it does mean, at least in part and possibly in large part,

01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:11.400
that the role humans play in the network of minds and in the network of life on Earth

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:19.400
has gotten rid of the necessities that gave birth to humans.

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:28.400
Or it's gotten rid of its reach the boundary conditions under which you want to get rid of that process.

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:38.400
There are all kinds of processes where the earthquake in Fukushima is a good example.

01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:43.400
You have a nuclear reactor built on a fault.

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:47.400
The unthinkable happens tidal wave from earthquake.

01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:51.400
Earthquake itself may have damaged the reactor. I can't remember.

01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:54.400
But the tidal wave was like the death knell.

01:58:54.400 --> 01:59:01.400
So now you have a process that is spinning out of control and can kill everything around it for large.

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:04.400
And you can have the same problem on a planet.

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:09.400
You can have a planet where a process gets started that can spread to the other planets.

01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:11.400
It can metastasize to them.

01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:19.400
If there's a real-time relationship between planets in space-time, a possibility I would like to strongly emphasize as very likely,

01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:24.400
then what happens on our planet costs lives on other planets.

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:35.400
There's a degree to which the planets can act as a buffer against developmental damage to organismal membranes in time-space.

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:42.400
They can share that burden the same way three humans can lift 400 pounds without much trouble.

01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:54.400
But if one of those humans keeps stacking 100-pound weights and isn't lifting anymore, they're contributing burden,

01:59:54.400 --> 02:00:02.400
there's going to be a reciprocal transformation of the relationship, and it will not be fun.

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:09.400
It won't be pretty.

02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:15.400
You know, it isn't nature that's red in tooth and claw,

02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:25.400
though the problem faced by embodied organisms that have to feed themselves is real.

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:33.400
But compared to nature, the humans are blood-drenched.

02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:39.400
They're just like half-zombie, half-vampire, monster.

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:49.400
And of course, the individual humans aren't like that, but the species at the group level, they are completely disoriented,

02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:58.400
they are omnicidal, arbitrary in judgment, kill this one, save that one.

02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:05.400
Not intelligent.

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:09.400
Not survivable.

02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:13.400
So one of the signals we might be seeing here,

02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:22.400
when I talk about what took place in 2018 for me and many people that I know,

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:26.400
is we might be seeing a senescence signal.

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:32.400
If we are one of the cellular cultures of the animal that is Earth or the meta-animal, right,

02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:41.400
because she produces animals naturally as a result of having stabilized her environment and so forth,

02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:55.400
then, you know, something needs to interfere to either reduce our population dramatically,

02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:02.400
and perhaps it's not, I would argue that it's not our population that's the actual problem.

02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:13.400
The actual problem is object proliferation, dead structure that keeps reproducing instead of living structure.

02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:20.400
Okay, any agenda like that, any system like that, that's got a very fucking limited lifetime.

02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:27.400
It might have worked in the 1950s, it isn't going to work for 10 more years.

02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:32.400
So the object proliferation is actually the problem, and you can, you know,

02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:40.400
you can probably wreck up enough humans to interfere with that without eliminating the species or destroying the planet.

02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:50.400
If you were an intelligent, you know, what I'm trying to figure out is like the human relationship with mosquitoes,

02:02:50.400 --> 02:03:02.400
which is very deep and intimate, unlike what we would think,

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:09.400
is a caricature of what an actually intelligent non-human intelligence or collective of such intelligences

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:22.400
would be likely to propose and enact in relation to the problem with the humans and their predilection

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:33.400
to value objects and concepts over biospheres.

02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:42.400
That is definitely a disease you do not want propagating freely in time space.

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:52.400
Machines that build machines, machines in general, damage and array of resources the humans are unaware of the existence of.

02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:55.400
And one of those resources is biorelational time.

02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:07.400
That is the foundation of minds for embodied beings, and particularly around here.

02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:12.400
So, you know, the humans keep building new kinds of guns to point at new features of nature,

02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:18.400
and then pulling the trigger over and over again, especially in modern history,

02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:28.400
by which I mean like, I don't know, past 3,000 years or something in this case.

02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:36.400
What you don't necessarily need to kill the humans, you have to get them to stop making guns.

02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:46.400
You have to get them to make something that contributes to the ancient agreements among living beings

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:54.400
and their prosperity and survival and development and hope, and maybe even fulfillment.

02:04:54.400 --> 02:05:02.400
Because what parents don't so much mind a lot of suffering, if they know their children will prosper,

02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:07.400
eventually they don't care about themselves, they just care about those they love,

02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:12.400
and for many of those parents, those they love are the living world.

02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.400
There are the animals and plants and insects.

02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:21.400
They look very generously and adoringly upon the face of life on earth,

02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:31.400
and meet it with reverence and adoration, with wonder, with recognition, with re...

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.400
with an amnesis, right? Unforgetting.

02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:39.400
They need it, and it causes them to forget, and they drink that water.

02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:47.400
They need that water of life.

02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:50.400
There is a path for us forward.

02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:55.400
I think we have to cut our teeth on simple tasks we can do in small groups,

02:05:55.400 --> 02:06:00.400
and learn how to forge those groups, how to experiment,

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:06.400
and play at the experiment of understanding how to solve something

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:10.400
that will really be meaningful for us to resolve,

02:06:10.400 --> 02:06:15.400
or to help someone who is, you know, struggling, or in trouble, or is alone,

02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:21.400
or to help the animals, or the biosphere.

02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:31.400
You know, it's unfortunate that concern for the environment has become associated with wokeism.

02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:46.400
Again, it's another of the plastic gemstones that you can glue on to any mimetic pathology

02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:51.400
in order to help it propagate faster.

02:06:51.400 --> 02:07:00.400
And by the way, to be really clear, I'm very concerned about what I think of as wokeism.

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:09.400
However crudely that idea may be formed in my mind.

02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:20.400
The effective and creative response to actual injustice,

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:24.400
the intelligent response to such matters,

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:40.400
that's something I deeply believe in, I think, is natural to human beings, to care about that.

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:51.400
There's an owl here, a male, I'm pretty sure.

02:07:51.400 --> 02:08:03.400
There's also a band shell right nearby emitting amplified music.

02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:04.400
Way up top.

02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:05.400
Ah, thank you.

02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:14.400
Oh no, the lights came on.

02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:18.400
I wonder how painful that is for the owls.

02:08:18.400 --> 02:08:22.400
Oh, the lights adjust.

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:27.400
The lights are adjusting their brightness based on movement.

02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:39.400
It's very interesting.

02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:46.400
The first voice was the female.

02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:57.400
The higher pitched voice in the owls was the female.

02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:02.400
There goes the female and there goes the male.

02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:06.400
Following her.

02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:09.400
But not.

02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:12.400
They intend to continue there.

02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:14.400
It's really interesting.

02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:27.400
The male traveled with the female until she perched and then he diverged, not going to her perch.

02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:42.400
Which in a sense means the continuation of courtship and not what you can guess might otherwise ensue.

02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:47.400
Well, I've explored so much terrain today.

02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:55.400
There is a feature I want to highlight that the humans need meaningful mutual endeavors.

02:09:55.400 --> 02:10:00.400
This has been replaced by the idea of work.

02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:09.400
And simply we tend to have these two polar divisions, jobs and recreation, jobs and entertainment.

02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:17.400
And both of those are highly captured and dangerous in their modern formats.

02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:29.400
So we have to reestablish both and perhaps make a mix where we play at doing things together that are noble and true and virtuous and brilliant.

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:38.400
And hilarious and amazing and resurrecting, rescuing, healing, nurturing all these things.

02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:46.400
We have to play at forming behaviors of these sorts together and then enacting them.

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.400
Or so I strongly think.

02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:55.400
I suspect the distant music is spooky and haunting.

02:10:55.400 --> 02:11:03.400
I want to thank all of you who have traveled with me today and those of you who will travel with me in the future or the past.

02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:11.400
Please take a moment, if you will, to do what I won't hear request.

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:14.400
But you'll understand what I mean.

02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:21.400
I look forward to learning and exploring together again very soon.

02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:30.400
May your world and relationships be vital, beautiful and inspiring.

02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:34.400
Until next time, bye-bye for now.
