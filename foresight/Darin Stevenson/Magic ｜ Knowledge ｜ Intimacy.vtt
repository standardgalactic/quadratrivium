00:00.000 --> 00:10.200
Hello everybody. Welcome. I have just

00:10.200 --> 00:15.160
reattached my wind buffer to my wired

00:15.160 --> 00:22.560
Apple headset, microphones, or

00:22.560 --> 00:27.240
microphone. It's not particularly windy,

00:27.240 --> 00:30.880
but I'm sort of pleased with the simple

00:30.880 --> 00:34.120
solution of wrapping a cotton ball

00:34.120 --> 00:41.360
around the mic and securing it with a

00:41.360 --> 00:44.440
... there's probably a formal name for

00:44.440 --> 00:48.120
these objects, but a bread wire. Right?

00:48.120 --> 01:03.760
Those little wires that sometimes close

01:03.760 --> 01:10.680
the bread package. Hmm. A lot of contrails

01:10.680 --> 01:17.400
in the sky today. I suppose there are

01:17.400 --> 01:20.220
people who suspect that every time they

01:20.220 --> 01:25.480
see a contrail, they're seeing what

01:25.480 --> 01:33.240
chemtrails. Pretty sure most of those

01:33.240 --> 01:36.720
contrails are just vapor caused by vapor.

01:36.720 --> 01:42.600
The engines heat the air, makes a vapor

01:42.600 --> 01:47.200
trail. There might be occasionally, and

01:47.200 --> 01:51.440
some places, some things that aren't

01:51.440 --> 01:56.560
contrails, but I strongly suspect that

01:56.560 --> 01:58.960
people who spent their lives watching

01:58.960 --> 02:04.400
aircraft and contrails would alert us.

02:04.400 --> 02:10.880
I know this is a very controversial

02:10.880 --> 02:14.640
topic that borders on the conspiratorial

02:14.640 --> 02:19.200
but there are other strange problems

02:19.200 --> 02:25.920
like, I guess, maybe my objection isn't as

02:25.920 --> 02:27.440
strong as I once thought. This often

02:27.440 --> 02:29.280
turns out to be the case, but one of my

02:29.280 --> 02:32.840
simple objections was if somebody's

02:32.840 --> 02:34.600
spreading some kind of chemistry in the

02:34.600 --> 02:37.480
atmosphere itself and they're doing that

02:37.480 --> 02:39.200
on purpose, it's going to affect them

02:39.200 --> 02:40.640
and their children and their children's

02:40.640 --> 02:43.200
children and so forth. I suppose it could

02:43.280 --> 02:45.800
be that they don't have any children and

02:45.800 --> 02:48.480
they don't care. This is strange. This is

02:48.480 --> 02:52.400
the second bit of a carcass that I've

02:52.400 --> 02:56.520
seen today and it's interesting because

02:56.520 --> 02:58.920
I almost never see bits of carcass and I

02:58.920 --> 03:01.440
walk here every day. Is it just that

03:01.440 --> 03:04.520
today I'm noticing what I don't notice?

03:04.520 --> 03:09.080
Or is today a bit of carcass day? I just

03:09.080 --> 03:11.960
don't know. They're rather disgusting.

03:11.960 --> 03:17.560
Little chunks of fleshy, bloody, gristle

03:17.560 --> 03:22.920
and fur and things. Certainly

03:22.920 --> 03:29.640
unappetizing. I don't necessarily have

03:29.640 --> 03:35.040
a plan for this talk today. We'll see

03:35.040 --> 03:38.240
where it goes. I was thinking about

03:38.400 --> 03:44.200
some things. Various kinds of magical

03:44.200 --> 03:51.320
intent. The transactional kind where you

03:51.320 --> 03:57.160
trade something often or sometimes this

03:57.160 --> 03:59.600
is apparently whatever is referred to

03:59.600 --> 04:04.640
by one's soul for some boon or benefit

04:04.640 --> 04:07.280
in the short term. It seems like a

04:07.280 --> 04:10.200
wildly stupid idea to me. Hopefully I

04:10.200 --> 04:12.160
haven't accidentally done that myself.

04:12.160 --> 04:24.320
And the kind where you employ. Wow, what is that sound?

04:24.320 --> 04:31.760
Oh, it's a bird. Oh, it's a baby bird. It's a

04:31.760 --> 04:38.120
feed me sound. Oh, okay. There are two

04:38.120 --> 04:44.040
fundamental principles of something

04:44.040 --> 04:48.720
resembling our idea of magic, which

04:48.720 --> 04:53.840
let's face it. It's get or accomplish

04:53.840 --> 04:57.240
something without physically having to

04:57.240 --> 05:01.200
do the thing or, you know, chase the

05:01.200 --> 05:05.400
thing or something. Something like this.

05:06.960 --> 05:16.760
So in traditional Blackfoot knowledge,

05:17.960 --> 05:21.280
the language is problematical because

05:21.280 --> 05:25.520
what magic means in English is a broad

05:25.520 --> 05:29.280
array of things. Or actually, magic doesn't

05:29.280 --> 05:32.280
mean anything in any language. It's just

05:32.280 --> 05:35.440
a word. What actually happens with words

05:35.440 --> 05:38.040
is that we use them to mean things to

05:38.040 --> 05:40.720
each other in actual conversations,

05:40.720 --> 05:45.320
unless we're not having conversations

05:45.320 --> 05:49.560
and we're just saying things. And this

05:49.560 --> 05:51.560
becomes very confusing very quickly

05:51.560 --> 05:56.080
because then the presumption that words

05:56.080 --> 06:01.040
have meanings begins to pervade. We have

06:01.040 --> 06:04.360
to interpret the gap. What gap? The gap of

06:04.360 --> 06:07.920
no relationship, no no pre-existing

06:07.920 --> 06:11.560
context, random context, and so forth.

06:11.560 --> 06:15.520
There are ways in which that situation

06:15.520 --> 06:18.920
can become useful for us, but only if we

06:18.920 --> 06:21.720
deal with it very insightfully,

06:22.000 --> 06:24.720
intelligently.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.800
And what do I mean? I mean,

06:34.400 --> 06:39.800
the randomization of language is a kind

06:39.800 --> 06:43.200
of a paramagical substrate.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.400
What am I trying to mean by magic? Well,

06:48.400 --> 06:52.080
I'm not trying to mean illusionist's

06:52.080 --> 06:56.680
tricks. Fascinating though they are.

06:56.680 --> 07:02.200
And I'm not trying to mean the mere

07:02.200 --> 07:05.920
manipulation of the vulnerabilities

07:05.920 --> 07:09.920
in human thought and consciousness.

07:12.480 --> 07:17.720
I'm trying to mean something more like

07:17.720 --> 07:21.560
perhaps what people usually very naively

07:21.560 --> 07:25.120
mean with the word manifesting.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.200
An idea that I fundamentally mistrust,

07:29.200 --> 07:31.920
or maybe it's just the language that I mistrust,

07:31.920 --> 07:35.960
or maybe I'm ill-informed, which isn't

07:35.960 --> 07:40.680
as rare as I might like to be.

07:40.680 --> 07:45.160
Yes, I'm not, as my listeners know,

07:45.160 --> 07:50.800
a big fan of the secret, or the various cults

07:50.800 --> 07:54.920
that derive their central premises

07:54.920 --> 07:58.040
from such ideas.

07:58.040 --> 08:04.360
At the same time, there is something to

08:04.360 --> 08:08.360
a kind of envisioning or dreaming of the future

08:08.360 --> 08:11.160
that is very powerful.

08:12.160 --> 08:17.160
The question is, is it as trivially silly?

08:17.160 --> 08:21.160
Like what happens when you make that idea

08:21.160 --> 08:26.160
explicit is one of the questions. Because

08:30.160 --> 08:34.160
there's a fundamental difference

08:34.160 --> 08:38.160
between peripheral vision and foveal vision.

08:38.160 --> 08:43.160
Between explicit identity

08:43.160 --> 08:48.160
and potential identities.

08:48.160 --> 08:53.160
And in that blur, there's something transcendentally

08:53.160 --> 08:56.160
momentous and powerful.

08:56.160 --> 09:01.160
But if we make the blur explicit,

09:01.160 --> 09:05.160
irony often results.

09:05.160 --> 09:09.160
Meaning direct contradiction with

09:09.160 --> 09:15.160
stated purposes, goals, hopes, desires, intentions,

09:15.160 --> 09:19.160
cautions, and so forth.

09:19.160 --> 09:24.160
And so perhaps what actually bothers me about

09:24.160 --> 09:29.160
the manifesting cults is that they're taking something

09:29.160 --> 09:34.160
that I suspect properly belongs to the peripheral

09:34.160 --> 09:38.160
and making it foveal.

09:38.160 --> 09:42.160
Your foveal vision is the center vision.

09:42.160 --> 09:46.160
It's what you use when you look at something.

09:46.160 --> 09:50.160
It's your peripherals what you use when you spread your gaze

09:50.160 --> 09:54.160
and take in the whole.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.160
And as some of you know, that if you gaze at the night sky

09:58.160 --> 10:03.160
when you look at stars you can see the stars visible to your foveal vision.

10:04.160 --> 10:08.160
When you look toward them,

10:11.160 --> 10:15.160
I'm getting a little wet there.

10:15.160 --> 10:19.160
If you spread your gaze you will see stars

10:19.160 --> 10:24.160
that will literally disappear if you look at them.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.160
And this is kind of what my concern is

10:28.160 --> 10:33.160
as well as a sort of ideological trivialization

10:33.160 --> 10:38.160
of destiny, dreaming, visioneering.

10:45.160 --> 10:48.160
Yes, yes, yes.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.160
Ascent of the herbs. Beautiful.

10:52.160 --> 10:57.160
So yeah I'm getting somewhere near

10:57.160 --> 11:01.160
what sticks in my craw.

11:01.160 --> 11:05.160
And the weird thing about this problem for me

11:05.160 --> 11:09.160
is that by explicitly pointing

11:09.160 --> 11:13.160
at what sticks in my craw,

11:13.160 --> 11:17.160
this is part of the problem with thinking and part of the problem with language.

11:17.160 --> 11:21.160
Once I think I have a sense of what might be going on

11:21.160 --> 11:25.160
I tend to become kind of clingy about that.

11:25.160 --> 11:29.160
And in that clinginess,

11:29.160 --> 11:33.160
well, you know, it's not always

11:33.160 --> 11:37.160
conflicted but it's often produces

11:37.160 --> 11:41.160
significant conflict.

11:41.160 --> 11:45.160
Sage flower, scent, yum.

11:49.160 --> 11:53.160
In Blackfoot the two principles are

11:53.160 --> 11:57.160
similitude and contagion.

11:57.160 --> 12:01.160
And they mix together, they mate, they bond,

12:01.160 --> 12:05.160
they form very powerful abilities

12:05.160 --> 12:09.160
you might call them, as well as faculties.

12:17.160 --> 12:21.160
I'm not going to lecture about that today.

12:23.160 --> 12:27.160
These two principles are also

12:27.160 --> 12:31.160
found in other magical traditions

12:31.160 --> 12:35.160
such as

12:35.160 --> 12:39.160
voodoo, hoodoo,

12:39.160 --> 12:43.160
various

12:43.160 --> 12:47.160
witching ways.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.160
And perhaps also

12:57.160 --> 13:01.160
shamanism. Resemblance

13:01.160 --> 13:05.160
is a way to understand similitude.

13:05.160 --> 13:09.160
And similitude is a very sophisticated word

13:09.160 --> 13:13.160
that my friend Ryan First Diver uses.

13:13.160 --> 13:17.160
Contagion is fairly obvious.

13:23.160 --> 13:27.160
In a way,

13:27.160 --> 13:31.160
to refer to something

13:31.160 --> 13:35.160
directly in consciousness

13:35.160 --> 13:39.160
can often be a bit of a trap for us.

13:39.160 --> 13:43.160
Whereas to suggest it

13:43.160 --> 13:47.160
is much more powerful and in a sense magical

13:47.160 --> 13:51.160
by which I mean transcendentally potent

13:51.160 --> 13:55.160
historically

13:55.160 --> 13:59.160
women, females,

13:59.160 --> 14:03.160
are masters of

14:03.160 --> 14:07.160
indirect communication.

14:07.160 --> 14:11.160
Suggestion,

14:11.160 --> 14:15.160
entranced

14:15.160 --> 14:19.160
which places consciousness into a sort of

14:19.160 --> 14:23.160
a flow state that can then be

14:23.160 --> 14:27.160
directed

14:39.160 --> 14:43.160
or shaped, or both, redirected

14:43.160 --> 14:47.160
so forth.

14:47.160 --> 14:51.160
Yesterday at this spot there was a young woman

14:51.160 --> 14:55.160
sitting on a log up above me

14:55.160 --> 14:59.160
and she was practicing

14:59.160 --> 15:03.160
playing a particular kind of flute

15:03.160 --> 15:07.160
that appeared to be made of wood or possibly bamboo.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.160
I sat down, you know,

15:11.160 --> 15:15.160
without gazing directly at her because once again

15:15.160 --> 15:19.160
suggestion produces problems.

15:19.160 --> 15:23.160
Or, you know, it's occasionally appropriate.

15:23.160 --> 15:27.160
But usually if we're paying direct attention to something

15:27.160 --> 15:31.160
it's often that we have the desire to capture, possess, or manipulate it.

15:31.160 --> 15:35.160
And nobody really wants to be captured, possessed, or manipulated.

15:35.160 --> 15:39.160
There's that explicitness in

15:39.160 --> 15:43.160
language again, of course sometimes we do.

15:43.160 --> 15:47.160
Sometimes we partly want that.

15:47.160 --> 15:51.160
Or an aspect of us desires this while other aspects of us flee from it.

15:51.160 --> 15:55.160
This is the stormy cloud

15:55.160 --> 15:59.160
of what it's like to be human.

16:03.160 --> 16:07.160
I've made it

16:07.160 --> 16:11.160
to the high view.

16:13.160 --> 16:17.160
And there's that thing that looks a bit like Warden Cliff Tower

16:17.160 --> 16:21.160
but is actually

16:25.160 --> 16:29.160
the emergency public broadcasting

16:29.160 --> 16:33.160
speakers.

16:43.160 --> 16:47.160
The peripheral and the foveal.

16:55.160 --> 16:59.160
You know, dreaming consciousness largely corresponds

16:59.160 --> 17:03.160
to the former, waking consciousness to the latter.

17:03.160 --> 17:07.160
Without being

17:07.160 --> 17:11.160
explicit, allow me to suggest that in the daytime

17:11.160 --> 17:15.160
in bright sunlight

17:15.160 --> 17:19.160
the sunlight declares the color and identity

17:19.160 --> 17:23.160
of objects and situations. What they are doing is obvious.

17:23.160 --> 17:27.160
It's explicit, relatively explicit.

17:27.160 --> 17:31.160
Whereas the moonlight, if it's there, or even the total darkness

17:31.160 --> 17:35.160
in total darkness it's pure

17:35.160 --> 17:39.160
suggestivity.

17:39.160 --> 17:43.160
If you don't know where anything is, you can tap your way along the path with a stick

17:43.160 --> 17:47.160
if you're lucky, or skillful, or have practiced that.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.160
If you're very witchy, you can run

17:51.160 --> 17:55.160
in the darkness.

17:55.160 --> 17:59.160
I've never known someone who can do that. I can usually

17:59.160 --> 18:03.160
perambulate. I've heard of people who can run in pitch darkness.

18:03.160 --> 18:07.160
Having practiced a kind of a

18:07.160 --> 18:11.160
way that is natural to humans and animals, but

18:11.160 --> 18:15.160
rarely

18:19.160 --> 18:23.160
siren.

18:23.160 --> 18:27.160
Terrible noise.

18:27.160 --> 18:31.160
Dominates the entire oral sphere.

18:37.160 --> 18:41.160
Thankfully most situations

18:41.160 --> 18:45.160
are highly temporary.

18:45.160 --> 18:49.160
The moonlight suggests

18:49.160 --> 18:53.160
rather than declares identities, and thus

18:53.160 --> 18:57.160
pareidolia.

18:57.160 --> 19:01.160
I need to look up exactly how to pronounce that word.

19:01.160 --> 19:05.160
But the imaginative

19:05.160 --> 19:09.160
experience of shapes and faces

19:09.160 --> 19:13.160
in, for example, the whorling

19:13.160 --> 19:17.160
bark of trees, or the

19:17.160 --> 19:21.160
texture of the surface of the trail,

19:21.160 --> 19:25.160
or the clump of bushes that just happens to be

19:25.160 --> 19:29.160
in a shape that looks like a raccoon, and you can't

19:29.160 --> 19:33.160
at first tell it isn't.

19:33.160 --> 19:37.160
This dichotomy between suggestion and declaration

19:37.160 --> 19:41.160
is very profound.

19:41.160 --> 19:45.160
And similarly in dreaming, because in dreaming

19:45.160 --> 19:49.160
things, beings, and situations

19:49.160 --> 19:53.160
we may later decide, oh, that was my brother,

19:53.160 --> 19:57.160
that was our house, that was this, that was that. But in the actual

19:57.160 --> 20:01.160
dreaming experience, it's not really like that.

20:01.160 --> 20:05.160
It's just a house that's quite different from mine

20:05.160 --> 20:09.160
can be my house. My sister can be a man.

20:09.160 --> 20:13.160
All kinds of strange

20:13.160 --> 20:17.160
amalgams

20:17.160 --> 20:21.160
of possible and actual

20:21.160 --> 20:25.160
form, identity, function, behavior,

20:25.160 --> 20:29.160
ensue.

20:29.160 --> 20:33.160
Usually when

20:33.160 --> 20:37.160
I don't know, when those jays are making that noise, there's often

20:37.160 --> 20:41.160
a raptor in your mind, but maybe not.

20:41.160 --> 20:45.160
It doesn't sound as chiding. It sounds more like

20:45.160 --> 20:49.160
here I am, here I am, I'm over here.

20:49.160 --> 20:53.160
Well though, that looks like a raptor tree to me.

20:53.160 --> 20:57.160
That's a stellar's jay.

20:57.160 --> 21:01.160
Making the calls. See, there's that thing

21:01.160 --> 21:05.160
right of explicit categorical identity.

21:05.160 --> 21:09.160
See, there's that thing right of explicit

21:09.160 --> 21:13.160
categorical identity.

21:13.160 --> 21:17.160
See, there's that thing right of explicit categorical identity.

21:17.160 --> 21:21.160
So there are kinds of magic

21:21.160 --> 21:25.160
that don't really require

21:25.160 --> 21:29.160
trades.

21:29.160 --> 21:33.160
They're not transactional.

21:33.160 --> 21:37.160
And by magic, in this case, I mean

21:37.160 --> 21:41.160
the curation

21:41.160 --> 21:45.160
of time, space, and relationships

21:45.160 --> 21:49.160
in the hope of producing

21:49.160 --> 21:53.160
the resemblance of desired

21:53.160 --> 21:57.160
situations, transformations,

21:57.160 --> 22:01.160
relationships.

22:01.160 --> 22:05.160
Without manipulating them directly physically,

22:05.160 --> 22:09.160
although some kinds of physical activities, such as

22:09.160 --> 22:13.160
ceremony and or ritual, whether they are formal or informal

22:13.160 --> 22:17.160
may be involved.

22:17.160 --> 22:21.160
You know, one can envision

22:21.160 --> 22:25.160
very formally by deciding I'm going to sit

22:25.160 --> 22:29.160
in this place which is powerful

22:29.160 --> 22:33.160
and envision.

22:33.160 --> 22:37.160
But then, you know, think about, okay,

22:37.160 --> 22:41.160
so when you go to sleep,

22:41.160 --> 22:45.160
dreaming tends, for many of us,

22:45.160 --> 22:49.160
some of the time, to resemble breathing.

22:49.160 --> 22:53.160
It just happens. It happens, it's as if it happens

22:53.160 --> 22:57.160
to us and also within us.

22:57.160 --> 23:01.160
Now one can then form intentions

23:01.160 --> 23:05.160
around dreaming, for example, the intention to dream about a specific thing

23:05.160 --> 23:09.160
or the intention to the request

23:09.160 --> 23:13.160
that the dreaming aspect helps us better understand

23:13.160 --> 23:17.160
the situation or experience the transformation

23:17.160 --> 23:21.160
of some kind or gain what we think of as information

23:21.160 --> 23:25.160
about something that's otherwise difficult to know about

23:25.160 --> 23:29.160
as if the dreaming mind has powers that are

23:29.160 --> 23:33.160
irracular and transcendentally seeing and I think it does.

23:33.160 --> 23:37.160
The dreaming mind is an array of faculties

23:37.160 --> 23:41.160
but also some things we might think of as functions

23:41.160 --> 23:45.160
meaning it does stuff,

23:45.160 --> 23:49.160
important stuff, regenerating the organs,

23:49.160 --> 23:53.160
cleansing the metabolism, transforming the energetic

23:53.160 --> 23:57.160
situation in the body,

23:57.160 --> 24:01.160
what we might think of as spiritual energies or soul energies

24:01.160 --> 24:05.160
or life energies or electromagnetic,

24:05.160 --> 24:09.160
subtle electromagnetic stuff.

24:09.160 --> 24:13.160
All of these things the dreaming mind is naturally skillful with

24:13.160 --> 24:17.160
and it does its job much like our heart and lungs do

24:17.160 --> 24:21.160
without much instruction but it can also be

24:21.160 --> 24:25.160
instructed or skillfully developed much like our breathing

24:25.160 --> 24:29.160
perhaps like our heart rate, certainly like our habits of thought.

24:29.160 --> 24:33.160
So we can

24:33.160 --> 24:37.160
have the formal intention

24:37.160 --> 24:41.160
to vision-ear futures.

24:53.160 --> 24:57.160
And there's what I remember when I was younger

24:57.160 --> 25:01.160
the informally vision-earing futures

25:01.160 --> 25:05.160
and they many of them came to fruition

25:05.160 --> 25:09.160
but there was a mix, right? Like I formally wanted to play the guitar

25:09.160 --> 25:13.160
I formally wanted to be a graphic designer

25:13.160 --> 25:17.160
I formally wanted to publish texts

25:17.160 --> 25:21.160
I formally wanted to be a good

25:21.160 --> 25:25.160
fisherman even though I don't really eat fish

25:25.160 --> 25:29.160
I formally wanted

25:29.160 --> 25:33.160
to have a nest like Robert Wagner's

25:33.160 --> 25:37.160
that one sort of came true which I think is

25:37.160 --> 25:41.160
ridiculous although now I'm old and it doesn't matter

25:41.160 --> 25:45.160
much.

25:45.160 --> 25:49.160
I formally wanted to be a secret agent

25:49.160 --> 25:53.160
I also informally wanted

25:53.160 --> 25:57.160
I'm not sure why I have such a

25:57.160 --> 26:01.160
antipathy toward the formalization

26:01.160 --> 26:05.160
of certain kinds of things perhaps I'm not really concerned

26:05.160 --> 26:09.160
about their formalization I'm concerned about the way that

26:09.160 --> 26:13.160
cults utilize formalizations

26:13.160 --> 26:17.160
of principles and

26:17.160 --> 26:21.160
wisdom

26:21.160 --> 26:25.160
to capture

26:25.160 --> 26:29.160
and

26:29.160 --> 26:33.160
abuse people

26:33.160 --> 26:37.160
to disempower and blind them

26:37.160 --> 26:41.160
by giving them the wrapping paper

26:41.160 --> 26:45.160
instead of the gift

26:45.160 --> 26:49.160
hmm

26:49.160 --> 26:53.160
yeah I don't like that

26:53.160 --> 26:57.160
although sometimes it can be very helpful

26:57.160 --> 27:01.160
and this is hard to understand at first glance

27:01.160 --> 27:05.160
we'd like to have societies and situations that are so fundamentally enlightened

27:05.160 --> 27:09.160
that we just climb the ladder together beautifully and successfully

27:09.160 --> 27:13.160
toward self development, mutual development, insight

27:13.160 --> 27:17.160
skillfulness, awareness, wonder, awe, play, joy

27:17.160 --> 27:21.160
humor, eros, all these things

27:21.160 --> 27:25.160
we just climb the ladder together and

27:25.160 --> 27:29.160
are constantly lifting each other above positions previous

27:29.160 --> 27:33.160
or at least into harmonious balance

27:33.160 --> 27:37.160
where health and vitality and rejuvenation

27:37.160 --> 27:41.160
and resurrection

27:41.160 --> 27:45.160
are natural

27:45.160 --> 27:49.160
features of the situation right of course we all hope for this but

27:49.160 --> 27:53.160
in our actual situation sometimes we may

27:53.160 --> 27:57.160
it may be useful to fail

27:57.160 --> 28:01.160
talked about this before

28:01.160 --> 28:05.160
imagine a situation where

28:05.160 --> 28:09.160
everything you do succeeds the first time

28:09.160 --> 28:13.160
and so it requires very little effort and there's

28:13.160 --> 28:17.160
it's going to be extremely difficult to improve

28:17.160 --> 28:21.160
to experience a gain in skillfulness or ability

28:21.160 --> 28:25.160
or function

28:25.160 --> 28:29.160
in order for that to happen there has to be the possibility of

28:29.160 --> 28:33.160
making mistakes

28:33.160 --> 28:37.160
and perhaps of pain and suffering

28:37.160 --> 28:41.160
confusion, ignorance, all these things

28:41.160 --> 28:45.160
so it can be very useful at least in theory

28:45.160 --> 28:49.160
to

28:49.160 --> 28:53.160
to

28:53.160 --> 28:57.160
to

28:57.160 --> 29:01.160
to become

29:01.160 --> 29:05.160
enamored

29:05.160 --> 29:09.160
of a cult

29:09.160 --> 29:13.160
I have

29:13.160 --> 29:17.160
before

29:17.160 --> 29:21.160
and you know

29:21.160 --> 29:25.160
we join the cult, we are enchanted by it

29:25.160 --> 29:29.160
it's very compelling because suddenly we have

29:29.160 --> 29:33.160
belonging, we have an experience of belonging that can be otherwise quite difficult

29:33.160 --> 29:37.160
to

29:37.160 --> 29:41.160
in our modern

29:41.160 --> 29:45.160
common modern situations worst common denominator

29:45.160 --> 29:49.160
talk here but in our common modern situations it can be very difficult

29:49.160 --> 29:53.160
to find a coherent groups that are doing something amazing

29:53.160 --> 29:57.160
and beautiful to belong with and so

29:57.160 --> 30:01.160
this is part of why even though education

30:01.160 --> 30:05.160
is kind of a disaster it's also very

30:05.160 --> 30:09.160
wouldn't necessarily just want to get rid of schools

30:09.160 --> 30:13.160
clearly one might want to

30:13.160 --> 30:17.160
what

30:17.160 --> 30:21.160
mediate you know

30:21.160 --> 30:25.160
positively mediate and transform

30:25.160 --> 30:29.160
the existing institutions

30:29.160 --> 30:33.160
but the schools are very important because they give young people

30:33.160 --> 30:37.160
and the teachers and others

30:37.160 --> 30:41.160
the experience

30:41.160 --> 30:45.160
of belonging together

30:45.160 --> 30:49.160
and so to the cults and so to

30:49.160 --> 30:53.160
the various

30:53.160 --> 30:57.160
pedals on the strange flower of fandom

30:57.160 --> 31:01.160
musical groups

31:01.160 --> 31:05.160
films, sports teams

31:05.160 --> 31:09.160
also the

31:09.160 --> 31:13.160
usually lethally in more ways than one motivated

31:17.160 --> 31:21.160
military

31:21.160 --> 31:25.160
cohorts and such

31:35.160 --> 31:39.160
belonging

31:47.160 --> 31:51.160
belonging

31:51.160 --> 31:55.160
and obviously we get all kinds of pandering around this

31:55.160 --> 31:59.160
social media

31:59.160 --> 32:03.160
panders to this desire

32:03.160 --> 32:07.160
to belong and delivers

32:07.160 --> 32:11.160
largely

32:11.160 --> 32:15.160
counterfeit representations

32:15.160 --> 32:19.160
we steal the

32:19.160 --> 32:23.160
the real thing is stolen, ground up

32:23.160 --> 32:27.160
compromised

32:27.160 --> 32:31.160
essentially destroyed

32:31.160 --> 32:35.160
and

32:35.160 --> 32:39.160
we are sold a broad array

32:39.160 --> 32:43.160
of ever less rich

32:43.160 --> 32:47.160
and powerful counterfeits

32:51.160 --> 32:55.160
this is the common thing

32:55.160 --> 32:59.160
that happens a lot in our

32:59.160 --> 33:03.160
society

33:03.160 --> 33:07.160
now when we come together with and for each other

33:07.160 --> 33:11.160
and we forge intentional social

33:11.160 --> 33:15.160
contexts and cohorts

33:15.160 --> 33:19.160
pods if you will like a dolphin pod

33:19.160 --> 33:23.160
or a primate pod or a whale pod

33:23.160 --> 33:27.160
then we have both a kind of natural

33:27.160 --> 33:31.160
to these gambits and the capacity to lift each other out of them

33:31.160 --> 33:35.160
or even to manipulate them from within

33:35.160 --> 33:39.160
this is the rather covert

33:39.160 --> 33:43.160
version of

33:43.160 --> 33:47.160
the possibilities

33:47.160 --> 33:51.160
of our human

33:51.160 --> 33:55.160
sociality

33:55.160 --> 33:59.160
and this can be done

33:59.160 --> 34:03.160
in various different kinds of ways

34:03.160 --> 34:07.160
it can be done

34:07.160 --> 34:11.160
in rather serious ways

34:11.160 --> 34:15.160
and it can also be done in more or less playful

34:15.160 --> 34:19.160
or game like ways

34:19.160 --> 34:23.160
and these two can actually merge so that you can have

34:23.160 --> 34:27.160
playful games

34:27.160 --> 34:31.160
that actually transform

34:31.160 --> 34:35.160
or ameliorate the

34:35.160 --> 34:39.160
humanity and ear sats community

34:39.160 --> 34:43.160
spirituality

34:43.160 --> 34:47.160
that is so pervasive in our modern

34:47.160 --> 34:51.160
experience it's not the only thing going on

34:51.160 --> 34:55.160
alone when we're isolated it may seem like

34:55.160 --> 34:59.160
the entire context is just violations

34:59.160 --> 35:03.160
and this is what leads people to

35:03.160 --> 35:07.160
terror, agony, self harm, suicide

35:07.160 --> 35:11.160
what we think of as madness

35:11.160 --> 35:15.160
madness is a fairly natural result of the constant exposure

35:15.160 --> 35:19.160
to the kinds of double triple quadruple

35:19.160 --> 35:23.160
you know myriad sorts of binds

35:23.160 --> 35:27.160
right where

35:27.160 --> 35:31.160
that emerge in our experience

35:31.160 --> 35:35.160
of the broad

35:35.160 --> 35:39.160
array of competing anti-cultures

35:39.160 --> 35:43.160
anti-nations, anti-societies

35:43.160 --> 35:47.160
corporations that dominate

35:47.160 --> 35:51.160
our modern experience

35:51.160 --> 35:55.160
and concern

35:55.160 --> 35:59.160
and they are terrible but they're not the only thing going on

35:59.160 --> 36:03.160
and in order to you know it's not just that we discover what's going on

36:03.160 --> 36:07.160
when we begin to form intentional communal groups

36:07.160 --> 36:11.160
even if it's only for a short period of time see this is the key

36:11.160 --> 36:15.160
we can get escape velocity immediately

36:15.160 --> 36:19.160
in a small group with a shared intention to do so

36:19.160 --> 36:23.160
and we can sustain that over time

36:23.160 --> 36:27.160
and give it a heartbeat and that can even reproduce

36:27.160 --> 36:31.160
other little groups that bubble

36:31.160 --> 36:35.160
and prosper even in

36:35.160 --> 36:39.160
the counterfeit

36:39.160 --> 36:43.160
nightmares

36:43.160 --> 36:47.160
from and perhaps against

36:47.160 --> 36:51.160
and out of the

36:51.160 --> 36:55.160
desire to

36:55.160 --> 36:59.160
transcend

36:59.160 --> 37:03.160
these troubling situations

37:03.160 --> 37:07.160
so there are forms of

37:07.160 --> 37:11.160
magic that don't require

37:11.160 --> 37:15.160
or soul-selling and so forth

37:15.160 --> 37:19.160
but are very powerful and some of them are profoundly virtuous

37:19.160 --> 37:23.160
they are not

37:23.160 --> 37:27.160
composed for the sake of vengeance

37:27.160 --> 37:31.160
this is very dangerous motivation generally speaking leads to

37:31.160 --> 37:35.160
a lot of trouble in almost every case

37:35.160 --> 37:39.160
they are not war machines

37:39.160 --> 37:43.160
primarily for personal gain

37:43.160 --> 37:47.160
they may not be entirely selfless

37:47.160 --> 37:51.160
though they can be composed under such circumstances

37:55.160 --> 37:59.160
but they are resistant to capture

37:59.160 --> 38:03.160
yeah

38:07.160 --> 38:11.160
by selfish manipulative

38:11.160 --> 38:15.160
or war-like motivations

38:21.160 --> 38:25.160
and they can also be profoundly

38:25.160 --> 38:29.160
protective

38:29.160 --> 38:33.160
healing

38:33.160 --> 38:37.160
calming

38:37.160 --> 38:41.160
nurturing nourishing

38:41.160 --> 38:45.160
and these forms arise

38:45.160 --> 38:49.160
from an ache that I suspect we all come

38:49.160 --> 38:53.160
to human incarnation with

38:53.160 --> 38:57.160
the

39:05.160 --> 39:09.160
it's an ache for the positive

39:09.160 --> 39:13.160
version of justice which is the dissolution

39:13.160 --> 39:17.160
of injustices and their replacements with virtues

39:17.160 --> 39:21.160
now again if once either of these ideas become highly explicit

39:21.160 --> 39:25.160
there's going to be a lot of trouble

39:25.160 --> 39:29.160
most of the time

39:29.160 --> 39:33.160
if you're explicitly concerned with virtue

39:33.160 --> 39:37.160
this tends to produce irony

39:37.160 --> 39:41.160
if you're explicitly concerned with harm or vengeance

39:41.160 --> 39:45.160
or war you're going to have irony

39:51.160 --> 39:55.160
cleansing

39:55.160 --> 39:59.160
cleansing

39:59.160 --> 40:03.160
bathing

40:03.160 --> 40:07.160
smudging

40:07.160 --> 40:11.160
um

40:11.160 --> 40:15.160
nurturing grounding

40:15.160 --> 40:19.160
getting your feet, your bare feet

40:19.160 --> 40:23.160
out of the ground

40:23.160 --> 40:27.160
surrounding you know

40:27.160 --> 40:31.160
going into nature, going into the living waters of the river or the ocean

40:31.160 --> 40:35.160
the lake, the stream

40:39.160 --> 40:43.160
these are potent and powerful precursors

40:43.160 --> 40:47.160
to the formation of the kinds of intentions

40:47.160 --> 40:51.160
that naturally become

40:51.160 --> 40:55.160
that naturally influence

40:55.160 --> 40:59.160
without dictating futures

40:59.160 --> 41:03.160
and transformations of situations

41:03.160 --> 41:07.160
I was speaking with someone

41:07.160 --> 41:11.160
maybe about a week and a half ago

41:11.160 --> 41:15.160
and I asked him if he had ever prayed

41:15.160 --> 41:19.160
and I don't think I ever really got

41:19.160 --> 41:23.160
the impression that something was listening

41:23.160 --> 41:27.160
and that's a very rational

41:27.160 --> 41:31.160
response, sensible

41:31.160 --> 41:35.160
why should we engage in

41:35.160 --> 41:39.160
activities whose effectiveness we have no way to determine

41:39.160 --> 41:43.160
well you know that's one

41:43.160 --> 41:47.160
effective but I wonder if it ever occurred to him

41:47.160 --> 41:51.160
that whether or not someone was listening

41:51.160 --> 41:55.160
or something was listening

41:55.160 --> 41:59.160
the transformational effects

41:59.160 --> 42:03.160
could be profound either way

42:03.160 --> 42:07.160
they could be profound neither way

42:07.160 --> 42:11.160
they could be profound both ways

42:11.160 --> 42:15.160
they could be profound even if there was no way to understand

42:15.160 --> 42:19.160
how or why they were in fact profound

42:19.160 --> 42:23.160
because

42:23.160 --> 42:27.160
somehow

42:27.160 --> 42:31.160
our behavior

42:31.160 --> 42:35.160
transforms our potential

42:35.160 --> 42:39.160
and the fact or fiction

42:39.160 --> 42:43.160
in many cases

42:43.160 --> 42:47.160
either doesn't matter or

42:47.160 --> 42:51.160
can be very limiting

42:51.160 --> 42:55.160
so yeah

42:55.160 --> 42:59.160
these are things to consider

42:59.160 --> 43:03.160
I heard once that some president

43:03.160 --> 43:07.160
perhaps it was Bush

43:07.160 --> 43:11.160
a prayer

43:11.160 --> 43:15.160
it's like attempting to study

43:15.160 --> 43:19.160
I don't know

43:19.160 --> 43:23.160
something that cannot be

43:23.160 --> 43:27.160
cannot be detected

43:27.160 --> 43:31.160
by the methods we would ordinarily

43:31.160 --> 43:35.160
presume I heard this morning of an experiment

43:35.160 --> 43:39.160
to establish what's called the Weisman barrier

43:39.160 --> 43:43.160
in biology

43:43.160 --> 43:47.160
a feature of biology that is certainly wrong

43:47.160 --> 43:51.160
and yet has been canon for a very long time

43:51.160 --> 43:55.160
in modern, in terms of modern science

43:55.160 --> 43:59.160
and the experiment was absurdly stupid

43:59.160 --> 44:03.160
and yet everyone supposed that it was one of the greatest biological

44:03.160 --> 44:05.160
experiments that had ever been done

44:05.160 --> 44:07.160
well perhaps not everyone

44:07.160 --> 44:11.160
it was very common to suppose this

44:11.160 --> 44:15.160
yeah so had people pray

44:15.160 --> 44:19.160
for sick people and so on people who knew them and people who didn't

44:19.160 --> 44:23.160
and apparently the study produced

44:23.160 --> 44:27.160
the result that the people who were prayed for were actually

44:27.160 --> 44:31.160
less likely, slightly less likely to recover

44:31.160 --> 44:35.160
than those who were not prayed for

44:35.160 --> 44:39.160
experiments

44:39.160 --> 44:43.160
and rational thought

44:43.160 --> 44:47.160
and science are very powerful tools

44:47.160 --> 44:51.160
their scope though is quite limited

44:51.160 --> 44:55.160
compared to that which is

44:55.160 --> 44:59.160
you could say that which is the case

44:59.160 --> 45:03.160
but not that which is

45:03.160 --> 45:07.160
their scope is different from reality

45:07.160 --> 45:11.160
the scope of rational thought

45:11.160 --> 45:15.160
is similar

45:15.160 --> 45:19.160
in its limitations to the scope

45:19.160 --> 45:23.160
of the physical manipulation of objects

45:23.160 --> 45:27.160
I can move hammers all I want

45:27.160 --> 45:31.160
much of my experience

45:31.160 --> 45:35.160
cannot be reasonably

45:35.160 --> 45:39.160
affected, cannot be

45:39.160 --> 45:43.160
properly transformed or successfully

45:43.160 --> 45:47.160
transformed by my manipulation of hammers

45:47.160 --> 45:51.160
and if I should fall under the

45:51.160 --> 45:55.160
delusion

45:55.160 --> 45:59.160
that my capacity to manipulate hammers

45:59.160 --> 46:03.160
is the only way for me

46:03.160 --> 46:07.160
to achieve

46:11.160 --> 46:15.160
true and valid belief

46:15.160 --> 46:19.160
conceptual or procedural

46:19.160 --> 46:23.160
insight

46:23.160 --> 46:27.160
understanding

46:27.160 --> 46:31.160
then I'm going to be in a really bad situation

46:31.160 --> 46:35.160
one imagines

46:35.160 --> 46:39.160
someone that

46:39.160 --> 46:43.160
is a boatwright but specializes

46:43.160 --> 46:47.160
in the formation of the

46:47.160 --> 46:51.160
skeletal precursors to the hull

46:51.160 --> 46:55.160
and they think

46:55.160 --> 46:59.160
this is the only important thing the skeletal precursors

46:59.160 --> 47:03.160
can't have a hull without these

47:03.160 --> 47:07.160
they only build skeletal

47:07.160 --> 47:11.160
they only build the frame and the frame doesn't

47:11.160 --> 47:15.160
float and they think

47:15.160 --> 47:19.160
that they are an expert and that they know everything about boats

47:19.160 --> 47:23.160
because they do the most important thing which is produce the frame

47:27.160 --> 47:31.160
my presentation of the metaphor was a little

47:31.160 --> 47:35.160
sketchy there but I think you get the idea

47:35.160 --> 47:39.160
this is similar to the

47:39.160 --> 47:43.160
overvaluing of rational frameworks, models, explanations

47:43.160 --> 47:47.160
theory, experiment

47:47.160 --> 47:51.160
and so on

47:51.160 --> 47:55.160
when one does, when we do experiments

47:55.160 --> 47:59.160
we

47:59.160 --> 48:03.160
try very desperately to evict most of what's going

48:03.160 --> 48:07.160
on from the context so that we can control

48:13.160 --> 48:17.160
the resulting context

48:17.160 --> 48:21.160
and its variables well enough

48:35.160 --> 48:39.160
to acquire deterministic knowledge

48:39.160 --> 48:43.160
of cause, effect,

48:43.160 --> 48:47.160
future transformations

48:47.160 --> 48:51.160
and this is a very compelling method

48:51.160 --> 48:55.160
but it can also be blinding

48:55.160 --> 48:59.160
in tests to determine

48:59.160 --> 49:03.160
whether things like telepathy exist

49:03.160 --> 49:07.160
they do, I assure you

49:07.160 --> 49:11.160
I am as sure of telepathy as I am of breathing

49:17.160 --> 49:21.160
very few if any of the experiments

49:21.160 --> 49:25.160
took a fundamental feature of telepathy into

49:25.160 --> 49:29.160
the experimental context, what is this feature

49:29.160 --> 49:33.160
intimacy

49:33.160 --> 49:37.160
deep

49:37.160 --> 49:41.160
mutual concern and awareness

49:41.160 --> 49:45.160
which is naturally

49:45.160 --> 49:49.160
productive

49:49.160 --> 49:53.160
of various forms of non-ordinary awareness

49:53.160 --> 49:57.160
and sensing of the state needs, thought, concern, desires

49:57.160 --> 50:01.160
of the other, natural between

50:01.160 --> 50:05.160
mothers who adore their

50:05.160 --> 50:09.160
young and newborn children

50:09.160 --> 50:13.160
though it's not merely a matter of the young and the newborns

50:13.160 --> 50:17.160
natural

50:17.160 --> 50:21.160
between dogs and cats and their human companions

50:21.160 --> 50:25.160
probably other pets, natural between

50:25.160 --> 50:29.160
certain insects and humans

50:29.160 --> 50:33.160
birds, reptiles even

50:33.160 --> 50:37.160
but you know we hear

50:37.160 --> 50:41.160
well there's no evidence, nobody's written a paper about that

50:41.160 --> 50:45.160
there's nothing in the literature, I remember one day I was here at this lake

50:45.160 --> 50:49.160
talking with an ornithologist and I explained that by careful observation

50:49.160 --> 50:53.160
I had determined how to sex

50:53.160 --> 50:57.160
how to determine the physical gender of geese

50:57.160 --> 51:01.160
the snow geese, white cheeks, the Canadian geese

51:01.160 --> 51:05.160
Canada geese I think they're called

51:05.160 --> 51:09.160
which by the way I'm pretty sure isn't named after the country

51:09.160 --> 51:13.160
I think it's named after a man whose last name was Canada

51:13.160 --> 51:17.160
I think I heard someone saying this, they might have been

51:17.160 --> 51:21.160
having their friend on

51:21.160 --> 51:25.160
yeah I explained by careful observation over time because this is a quest I undertook

51:25.160 --> 51:29.160
I realized the geese can tell for sure

51:33.160 --> 51:37.160
each other's gender by sight

51:37.160 --> 51:41.160
and if they can tell we can tell but in the literature

51:41.160 --> 51:45.160
it is claimed that it cannot be determined, it can be determined by behavior

51:45.160 --> 51:49.160
but not by appearance

51:49.160 --> 51:53.160
and I didn't believe that

51:53.160 --> 51:57.160
so I went on a quest, it took me a few years, it wasn't until I met

51:57.160 --> 52:01.160
an old goose couple, an older couple

52:01.160 --> 52:05.160
which is very uncommon in nature because old geese don't survive in nature

52:05.160 --> 52:09.160
but in cities they can

52:09.160 --> 52:13.160
and then in them the distinctions were

52:13.160 --> 52:17.160
highlighted, exaggerated

52:17.160 --> 52:21.160
and so I said to this guy, I was like you know

52:21.160 --> 52:25.160
there are ways to visually determine the gender of these birds and he got very upset

52:25.160 --> 52:29.160
and literally said there's nothing in the literature about that

52:29.160 --> 52:33.160
and I was like how about we just look at some birds together

52:33.160 --> 52:37.160
and let's see if we can do it, nope, there's no evidence

52:37.160 --> 52:41.160
we hear this all the time, there's no evidence of faith

52:41.160 --> 52:45.160
healing, no evidence of God, no evidence of angels, demons

52:45.160 --> 52:49.160
I would argue that Facebook and Google are pretty strong evidence of demons

52:49.160 --> 52:53.160
not to mention

52:53.160 --> 52:57.160
many other bizarre features of our modern world

52:57.160 --> 53:01.160
so

53:19.160 --> 53:23.160
if you decide to not look for evidence or if you decide that

53:23.160 --> 53:27.160
previous experiments not done by you

53:27.160 --> 53:31.160
explain for all eternity what exists

53:31.160 --> 53:35.160
what doesn't, what it doesn't, doesn't do, what it can and cannot do

53:35.160 --> 53:39.160
then you have become

53:39.160 --> 53:43.160
theory-blinded

53:43.160 --> 53:47.160
because in point of fact

53:47.160 --> 53:51.160
we speak and think

53:51.160 --> 53:55.160
as if

53:55.160 --> 53:59.160
that which has previously been established

53:59.160 --> 54:03.160
is continuous and permanent

54:03.160 --> 54:07.160
when there's no evidence of any permanent thing

54:07.160 --> 54:11.160
and continuity is relative

54:11.160 --> 54:15.160
it's not concrete, it's relative

54:15.160 --> 54:19.160
and the nature of time itself can change, the nature of light can change

54:19.160 --> 54:23.160
and the behaviors can change, does change

54:23.160 --> 54:27.160
if you're dreaming you're still perceiving

54:27.160 --> 54:31.160
so

54:31.160 --> 54:35.160
it's very important to be able to distinguish

54:35.160 --> 54:39.160
between

54:39.160 --> 54:43.160
there might be stuff that's nonsensical in a dangerous way

54:43.160 --> 54:47.160
that we should avoid

54:47.160 --> 54:51.160
acting it, acting as if it's true

54:51.160 --> 54:55.160
on the other hand

54:55.160 --> 54:59.160
life and thought, our bodies, our relationships

54:59.160 --> 55:03.160
as human beings are fundamentally experimental

55:07.160 --> 55:11.160
the fact that there are concrete realities

55:11.160 --> 55:15.160
that

55:15.160 --> 55:19.160
doesn't mean

55:19.160 --> 55:23.160
that all previously known

55:23.160 --> 55:27.160
exemplars of fact

55:27.160 --> 55:31.160
are the concrete foundation of our existence

55:31.160 --> 55:35.160
or our reliable guides to futurity

55:41.160 --> 55:45.160
you know what

55:45.160 --> 55:49.160
Nassim Nikolas Taleb calls black swans

55:49.160 --> 55:53.160
which are previously unknown phenomena

55:53.160 --> 55:57.160
happen all the time, the current models of time space and such

55:57.160 --> 56:01.160
all come from black swans

56:01.160 --> 56:05.160
no one expected that Einstein was going to come along and go like

56:05.160 --> 56:09.160
I think this distinction between space and time

56:09.160 --> 56:13.160
while it seems very obvious

56:13.160 --> 56:17.160
intuitive is wrong

56:17.160 --> 56:21.160
and then Arkhani Hamed and others of his ilk came along and said

56:21.160 --> 56:25.160
this perspective that

56:25.160 --> 56:29.160
time space isn't must be

56:29.160 --> 56:33.160
fundamental to all that's going on

56:33.160 --> 56:37.160
not only is unlikely but can't be the case

56:37.160 --> 56:41.160
black swans

56:41.160 --> 56:45.160
come

56:45.160 --> 56:49.160
into our awareness

56:55.160 --> 56:59.160
and obliterate previously

56:59.160 --> 57:03.160
dominant biases

57:03.160 --> 57:07.160
and when they do so they are usually liberating

57:07.160 --> 57:11.160
we gain new degrees of freedom

57:11.160 --> 57:15.160
insight, wonder, play, ability, function

57:15.160 --> 57:19.160
so on

57:23.160 --> 57:27.160
the findings of science theory and experiment are provisional

57:27.160 --> 57:31.160
they will be overturned

57:31.160 --> 57:35.160
it's not they might be overturned, they will be overturned

57:35.160 --> 57:39.160
and so we should recognize that the terrain ahead

57:39.160 --> 57:43.160
isn't the ignorant

57:43.160 --> 57:47.160
you know

57:51.160 --> 57:55.160
I'm not sure what to say, there's a word I'm looking for

57:55.160 --> 57:59.160
the crippling suppositional

57:59.160 --> 58:03.160
certitude that oh we've already determined

58:03.160 --> 58:07.160
what a goose is

58:07.160 --> 58:11.160
and now we know, well I doubt it

58:11.160 --> 58:15.160
the fact is we don't know what anything is

58:15.160 --> 58:19.160
we have highly provisional toys

58:19.160 --> 58:23.160
and when we exchange those for wonder and curiosity

58:23.160 --> 58:27.160
passion and insight

58:27.160 --> 58:31.160
something inside us begins to die

58:31.160 --> 58:35.160
you know what we have mostly

58:35.160 --> 58:39.160
as moderns

58:39.160 --> 58:43.160
is not knowledge, it's representation

58:43.160 --> 58:47.160
and representation in language and concept

58:47.160 --> 58:51.160
is

58:51.160 --> 58:55.160
deceptively powerful

58:55.160 --> 58:59.160
and it is this deception

58:59.160 --> 59:03.160
see here is magic

59:03.160 --> 59:07.160
here is transcendental influence

59:07.160 --> 59:11.160
by which we can be captured and manipulated

59:11.160 --> 59:15.160
what we have is something

59:15.160 --> 59:19.160
that replaces intimacy with tokens

59:19.160 --> 59:23.160
words

59:23.160 --> 59:27.160
maps, models, hypotheses

59:27.160 --> 59:31.160
because actual knowledge

59:31.160 --> 59:35.160
is intimate like kissing

59:35.160 --> 59:39.160
and if you experience

59:39.160 --> 59:43.160
the inflowing and indwelling of this knowledge

59:43.160 --> 59:47.160
it will not be like thinking, it will be like orgasm

59:47.160 --> 59:51.160
it will be like kissing

59:51.160 --> 59:55.160
it will be like death

59:55.160 --> 59:59.160
it will be like birth

59:59.160 --> 01:00:03.160
some of you may notice a radical transformation

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:07.160
in the vector of my

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:11.160
my illocution

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:15.160
but yes, science

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.160
is powerful

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:23.160
but it is not the arbiter

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:27.160
of meaning, identity, purpose, value

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:31.160
fact

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:35.160
truth

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.160
and we see this kind of

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.160
refraction away from

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.160
science in many domains of our

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:51.160
modern social experience

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.160
the problem with that particular refraction is that some of that

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:59.160
is a weaponized sigh up

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:03.160
nations

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.160
are experimenting with how to kill each other's populations

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.160
with information

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.160
and so we have the mixture of the truth

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:19.160
of the danger for example of the covid vaccines

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.160
with

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.160
the intent

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.160
to deceptively harm populations

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:35.160
right, the

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:39.160
this is very common unfortunately in our modern

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.160
situation

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.160
but yes

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.160
all my father's life he thought he

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.160
knew what a tree was and then one day at the mirror

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.160
pool here in this garden where I'm standing

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.160
I accidentally enchanted him and we sat on this bench

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.160
where a woman is sitting now and he

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.160
began to have what might be described as an

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:33.160
emergence event and he turned to me

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:37.160
and he said we have to leave, I am dying

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.160
I'm going to become this tree and he was quite

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.160
he was simultaneously

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.160
hello

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:53.160
nice to see you today

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:57.160
he was simultaneously alarmed and ecstatic

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.160
he had never had an experience like this

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.160
drugs were not involved he felt he was becoming

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.160
the tree and I tried to calm

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.160
him I told him it'll be okay we can leave if we must

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.160
he said we have to go we have to leave and then a squirrel climbed up his

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.160
leg and up onto his shoulder and he said see see even the squirrel

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.160
knows I am a tree this is intimacy

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:29.160
and trance can produce

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.160
the potential for modes of intimacy that

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.160
I thought must extinguish

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.160
speech is very similar

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.160
I was talking with someone the other day about their dreaming experience

01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:49.160
and gosh who was it

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:53.160
whoever it was

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.160
he said I don't think

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.160
I remember speaking in a dream and I was wildly

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:05.160
surprised I was partially surprised because most of us think

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.160
it's the keyword we think that we

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.160
have the experience of having many of us have these

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.160
memory of an experience resembling conversation in

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.160
dreaming and that part is true it resembles conversation

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.160
but as it moves more and more

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:29.160
explicitly toward the semblance of speaking

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:33.160
the manifold that supports the dreaming is collapsing

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.160
the intimacy is disappearing

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.160
one way to end an experience is to speak about it think of

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.160
two people passionately kissing

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.160
and one of them then

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:53.160
for whatever bizarre

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.160
reason of dissociative confusion decides that the most

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:01.160
important thing in this moment is to say something

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:05.160
the speech ends the experience

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:09.160
language is deceptively weird in that

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:13.160
we think it gives us the power to communicate

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:17.160
it does but primarily in the layer of representations

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:21.160
which is not the same layer as experience

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.160
and certainly not the same layer as intimacy

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:29.160
where in this mess is science

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.160
science is

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.160
in our time at least demonic

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:41.160
and when I was a child I wanted to become a scientist because it seemed that these were the people

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.160
who best knew

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.160
complete knowledge of things being

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:53.160
circumstances, origins, futures and so forth and machines

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.160
were very fascinating to me because it was as if in my previous

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:01.160
incarnations these things didn't exist and now they do

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:05.160
and they seemed quite impossible

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.160
not even the thing like a zipper this is impossible

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:13.160
how much more impossible is a thing like a mouse

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.160
you know humans can compose

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:21.160
a zipper they cannot compose a mouse

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:33.160
so you see this kind of representational

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:37.160
knowledge is extremely dangerous because it evicts us

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:41.160
from

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:45.160
what I would call transcendent participation

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:49.160
and that's where our actual

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:53.160
spirit

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.160
our capacity

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:01.160
to forge purposes beautiful, noble and true

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.160
and to embody and enact them together arises

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.160
not from knowledge

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.160
from participatory intimacy

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.160
you know we

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.160
because we are embodied humans

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.160
eventually one way or another

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.160
most of us

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.160
the last majority of us have an experience that we call orgasm

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:41.160
and for some of us this happens in childhood

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:45.160
and for others it's in our teens and for some

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.160
it might not be even until our adulthood

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:53.160
and there are more life phases than those ones

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:57.160
as well

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.160
but there are

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.160
experiences of intimacy that make what we think of as

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.160
orgasm seem trivial in comparison

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:13.160
and these are four modes of intimacy

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:17.160
that's not true

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:21.160
no it's true

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:25.160
there's a broad array of experiences that are normally

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.160
well they are very successfully inhibited in us

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.160
moderns and there's a broad array of

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.160
modes of cognition the use

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:41.160
the reformation or the formation

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.160
of modes of awareness, consciousness

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:49.160
things that resemble thought and so forth

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:53.160
that are so different from everything we've ever imagined

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:57.160
and yet are natural to our kind of being

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:01.160
our form, our humanity, our animality

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:05.160
our values, our organismality, our beingness

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:13.160
there are

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:17.160
modes of intimacy

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.160
so ecstatic that you would never trade them for an orgasm

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:25.160
and this is part of why we hear

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:29.160
some mystics singing the praises

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.160
of

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:37.160
what the

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:41.160
ascetic path

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.160
the path of not

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.160
of non-indulgence

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.160
the path of chastity or temperance

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:57.160
and you know dreaming

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.160
really is very very profound

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.160
and in dreaming there can be modes

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.160
of adoration and eros that are vastly

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.160
beyond what we are inclined to usually experience while awake or

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:17.160
beyond what seems accessible to

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:21.160
to us while awake

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.160
in our life phase, in our development

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:29.160
but what I'm trying to get at here is that this thing we call

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.160
orgasm

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:37.160
it is in a sense

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.160
a

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:45.160
there's different ways to say this

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:49.160
it's a repercussion

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.160
of participatory intimacy

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:57.160
that can be physically produced

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.160
and since our first experiences with it

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.160
are usually catalyzed by physical sensations

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:13.160
rhythms

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:17.160
rhythmic pulsing, rubbing, so forth

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.160
we should understand that that is a

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.160
interstasis, a lesser exemplar of something for which there is

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:35.160
a forest of superpositions above that

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.160
and when I was a child and I was fascinated with science what I didn't realize

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:43.160
is that I had no way to understand this

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.160
although some people tried to say something maybe this is why

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.160
the problem ensued

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:55.160
there didn't seem to be anyone whose knowledge was deeper than

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:59.160
the knowledge of scientists

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.160
but the knowledge of the poets, of the mystics, of the philosophers

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.160
of the adoring ones

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.160
this knowledge makes

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.160
the powers of science

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.160
shrivel

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.160
they are still mechanically powerful and may in fact snuff our planet

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.160
and our people

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.160
yes they are physically very powerful

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:35.160
but where is the intimacy

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:39.160
it is that participatory intimacy that we

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:43.160
hunger for and when we hope

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:47.160
not for justice

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:51.160
but for

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.160
the diminution

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:59.160
the

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.160
transformative composting

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:07.160
of injustices

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:11.160
it is this participatory

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:15.160
intimacy

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:19.160
that we know

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:23.160
we sense would thereafter

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.160
obtain

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:31.160
and become

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:35.160
the water

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:39.160
the many forms of waters

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.160
in which our hearts

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:47.160
and histories and futures could then

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:51.160
swim

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.160
we

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.160
we

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.160
we poor moderns

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.160
have named nearly everything and thus evicted

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.160
all the named

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:15.160
features and beings and relationships and situations

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.160
from much of our experience

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:23.160
yeah

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:27.160
yeah

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:31.160
hmm

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.160
we have representational

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.160
knowledge

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:43.160
miles deep

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:47.160
how tragic for us

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.160
that is the

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.160
the alexandrian library of the skeletal remains of what

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.160
might have been understanding and insight

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.160
medicinal awareness

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:07.160
transformative ecstatic participation

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.160
magic wonder play

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.160
all

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:19.160
virtue

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:27.160
walking in the botanical gardens here

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:31.160
even though

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:35.160
this is a place curated by

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.160
my extremely confused at the group level species

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.160
the living beings here

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.160
they form a

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:51.160
a manifold over

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.160
the strange

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.160
dead inside evictions that otherwise prevail

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.160
as cities and roads

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:07.160
shops and buildings and so forth

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.160
and they are ecstatic

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:15.160
and in our way of being in time

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:19.160
this ecstasy would flow into and through

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:23.160
and around and between

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.160
all the aspects of our being in such a way as to draw us

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:31.160
into transcendent visionary awareness

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.160
and I don't say this

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:39.160
because I know it this isn't knowledge

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.160
I'm on the verge of experience

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:47.160
I'm on the verge of the experience of what I hear

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:51.160
suggest

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:55.160
we are not distinct

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.160
in the ways our common thought

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:03.160
suppose

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.160
or create

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.160
or create

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:15.160
and there are games afoot there are missions here so beautiful

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:19.160
that the entire history of language and knowledge

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.160
has nothing to do with them

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:27.160
there's no thing you can formally know

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.160
that's more interesting

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.160
than the kiss of your beloved

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:39.160
of that food grown by your grandmother in her garden

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:43.160
on endless afternoons

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.160
to make the foods

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:51.160
the families would consume

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.160
together

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:59.160
mostly in distracted confusion

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:03.160
especially once

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.160
the

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:11.160
the invention of televisions began to become dominant

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.160
and think for a moment of what the television is replacing

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:19.160
there's a reason that thing is so compelling

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:23.160
was so compelling it's a reason why we have these screens

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.160
they are counterfeiting something

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:31.160
and if you think just a little bit you will see what they are counterfeiting

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.160
and what it is is something resembling group dreaming, group telepathy

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.160
group organized, group missioneering

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:43.160
organized group anemnesis

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.160
and this is what we must reach for together if we are to retrieve

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:51.160
the faculties

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.160
the ecstasies

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.160
the beauty of our origins and natures and potentials

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:03.160
and that's a mission I adore

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.160
and do believe in

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.160
and if my humble

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:15.160
speaking

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.160
can contribute

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:23.160
then I will have lived this day

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:27.160
in a way worthy of

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:31.160
my ancestors and their dreams

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:35.160
my progeny and their dreams

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:39.160
which dreams must not

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:43.160
be euthanized

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:47.160
my thought, language, machine

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.160
modernity, war, prison-eering, commerce

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.160
tokenization, representation

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:59.160
and conviction

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:07.160
there are many ferns here

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:11.160
I've always loved the forms of the plants

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:15.160
the insects are impossible

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:19.160
the organisms on this world are fundamentally

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:23.160
impossible

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.160
the staggering burdens of representational

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.160
cognition ecstasy would naturally arise

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.160
because we ourselves are

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:39.160
and are surrounded by

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:43.160
infinite manifolds of impossibly beautiful wonder

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:47.160
organism

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:51.160
origin

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:55.160
spirit

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:59.160
purpose

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.160
the superposition from which the concept of beauty is derived

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:07.160
the living bubble

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:11.160
of being, history and future and purpose

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:15.160
that naturally

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.160
in beauties up from the soil

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:23.160
I die like trees

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:27.160
rain ecstatic

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:31.160
originary true vital

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:35.160
oh how I adore these organisms

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:39.160
how confused I mostly am

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.160
when deprived

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.160
of that fundamental participatory intimacy

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:59.160
which is true recognition

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:03.160
and explosive anemesis

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:07.160
thank you for joining me

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:11.160
I'm so grateful to have this time

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:15.160
take a moment to like

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:19.160
or comment or ask a question

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.160
or share something personal

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:27.160
in this way you will

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:31.160
help

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:35.160
help my humble efforts

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.160
reach more people

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.160
may your ways be beautiful

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:51.160
your hearts be light and your relationships

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:55.160
exquisite

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:59.160
thank you for joining me

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:03.160
I look forward to learning

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:07.160
together again very soon

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:11.160
bye bye for now
