0	8000	Hello everybody. Welcome.
16000	22000	I'm very grateful to all of you who pay attention to my posts.
24000	28000	And especially those of you who like or share them.
30000	34000	And particularly my patrons.
34000	38000	Few though they are.
38000	42000	You make a lot of light in my life and
42000	46000	help me to have the freedom to keep doing
46000	50000	this work. This joyful creativity.
50000	54000	This explorations.
54000	58000	So I'm really grateful.
62000	66000	Particularly to my longtime supporter H.
66000	70000	And my new supporter C.
74000	78000	And you know if you have a little
78000	82000	something that you can spare each month.
82000	86000	One, two bucks. It's fine.
86000	90000	Whatever you've got.
90000	94000	That will help me keep producing this content.
94000	98000	Keeping it real.
98000	102000	On the internet.
106000	110000	Circa 2024.
110000	114000	So for this year is that 2024 isn't
114000	118000	a year. The last year we will ever have
118000	122000	as human beings around here for the foreseeable future
122000	126000	was 2023.
126000	130000	And this dumpster fire of insanity that we are presently
130000	134000	experiencing is actually not
134000	138000	a year at all. In fact
138000	142000	you know your mileage may vary.
146000	150000	I'm pretty sure that things aren't things anymore.
150000	154000	All that stuff we used to think we knew what that was or what was going on
154000	158000	or what would happen next or who was
158000	162000	who or all of that knowledge thing and knowing stuff.
162000	166000	That's all gone.
166000	170000	Mushroom cloud of over the
170000	174000	horizon of identity.
184000	188000	And in some ways that's wonderful.
188000	192000	Because a lot of the whatness
192000	196000	and the isness and all that
196000	200000	was broken. But in other ways
200000	204000	we don't have any kind of
204000	208000	ship that we can ride in together because we really never forged a
208000	212000	we in the first place except on very small
212000	216000	scales.
216000	220000	And we didn't go around building ships
220000	224000	and you know by that I just mean
224000	228000	a trustworthy
228000	232000	vehicle
232000	236000	of purposeive
236000	240000	orientation together.
240000	244000	Almost all of the
244000	248000	potentials of our communal
248000	252000	relationships and behavior
252000	256000	has been
256000	260000	thoroughly
260000	264000	recursively recolonized
264000	268000	by the
268000	272000	thrisplike dead inside infinitely
272000	276000	hungry processes
276000	280000	that establish themselves
280000	284000	in the human cognisium, the network of human minds.
284000	288000	If we don't do
288000	292000	the necessary bonding
296000	300000	If we don't do the necessary engineering
300000	304000	of our relationships
304000	308000	with history, the sky, nature, the living places
308000	312000	the plants, animals and insects, the ancestors
312000	316000	are dreaming.
316000	320000	And what I will loosely refer to is the angels
320000	324000	the non-human intelligences
324000	328000	the accessible non-human
328000	332000	intelligences above the human cognisium.
332000	336000	That have been lost to us
336000	340000	lost to our direct
340000	344000	contact and experience for so long
344000	348000	even though most of us probably
348000	352000	were born
352000	356000	with these relationships intact
356000	360000	and they may have stayed intact briefly during our
360000	364000	earliest phases of our human
364000	368000	incarnation, childhood, inconsistency and stuff.
372000	376000	But that stuff gets
376000	380000	well, what does it get?
380000	384000	It rarely survives
384000	388000	the processes of in-languaging and in-culturation
388000	392000	which our parents and peers
392000	396000	impose on us believing that to be
396000	400000	some wonderful
400000	404000	inheritance.
404000	408000	And the problem there is that it could be.
408000	412000	If it were rich and veritable
412000	416000	and ancient and true
416000	420000	the processes of in-languaging and in-culturation would not
420000	424000	be so violent
428000	432000	so dissociative
432000	436000	malignly dissociative
436000	440000	so isolating, so terrifying
440000	444000	so confusing
444000	448000	but unfortunately
448000	452000	as moderns
452000	456000	with very few exceptions I mean the world
456000	460000	let's be clear about something when I make very general statements about the
460000	464000	humans I'm making a bad mistake
464000	468000	and it's one that I've pointed out many times. I am
468000	472000	making a mistake I would call generalizing
472000	476000	the worst common denominator over the manifold.
476000	480000	So the manifold is all the different living places and humans
480000	484000	presently alive on earth
484000	488000	and the generalization is that they're all modern.
488000	492000	Well a lot of them aren't and
492000	496000	each of the cohorts we might
496000	500000	explore or contact
500000	504000	their actual relationship with rather than just thinking about them
504000	508000	and this is the problem with abstract thought
508000	512000	we can dissociatively pretend to be in relationships we don't have
512000	516000	and then from there
516000	520000	we can evaluate the resulting abstractions
520000	524000	and this obliterates our intelligence
524000	528000	it's like a snuff film of the possibilities of
528000	532000	or relating with
532000	536000	the children
536000	540000	little children are painting and their paintings are amazing
540000	544000	so beautiful and colorful
544000	548000	and see in those little children
548000	552000	all of this worst common denominator stuff is not yet
552000	556000	established. They are still
556000	560000	alive inside
560000	564000	and there are many exceptions
564000	568000	beautiful exceptions
568000	572000	to this worst common denominator
572000	576000	evaluative behavior
576000	580000	misbehavior
580000	584000	that I'm concerned about
584000	588000	and we should celebrate
588000	592000	and recognize the exceptions
592000	596000	yes the bell curve, yes the averages
596000	600000	and yes they're
600000	604000	devastating because
604000	608000	their defection, the capacity to
608000	612000	defect from our humanity
612000	616000	to colonize and recolonize
616000	620000	to devastate
620000	624000	to
636000	640000	I'm looking for a neologism here
640000	644000	what it means to cause
644000	648000	to viciously impose forgetting
648000	652000	to amnese
662000	666000	it's funny
670000	674000	the terrible weapons
674000	678000	of colonization
678000	682000	and this word gets overused
682000	686000	these days for all kinds of things
686000	690000	but what I'm talking about is when
690000	694000	the possibility of human
694000	698000	of coherent human relation, intelligence
698000	702000	conservation of ancestral
702000	706000	land, places, living places
706000	710000	intimate symbiosis
710000	714000	of humans with the earth
714000	718000	and the waters and the sky
718000	722000	which is rarely
722000	726000	approaches perfection
726000	730000	and these places
730000	734000	actually became coherent and beautiful
734000	738000	and was sustained over time
738000	742000	and colonization is sort of
742000	746000	I remember
746000	750000	a bad cartoon
750000	754000	maybe from the early 80s called Godzilla meets Bambi
754000	758000	and then suddenly boom there's a footprint
758000	762000	and Bambi's smushed in the bottom of that footprint
768000	772000	and that's
772000	776000	that's a cartoonish
776000	780000	image
780000	784000	but the forces of
784000	788000	colonization rose
788000	792000	in peoples
792000	796000	and cohorts in societies and nations
796000	800000	that were
800000	804000	self-colonizing
804000	808000	and this is part of the problem that is overlooked
808000	812000	when we blame
812000	816000	history
816000	820000	on bad people
820000	824000	and particularly when we take the convenient
824000	828000	exit door and think
828000	832000	oh yeah it's patriarchy
832000	836000	it's those males
836000	840000	who are dominating things
840000	844000	slapping them with their generative organ
844000	848000	crushing them
848000	852000	and while that's not untrue
852000	856000	the secret
856000	860000	origins of these problems are
860000	864000	preserved against our discovery
864000	868000	of our convenient
868000	872000	indictments
872000	876000	because if we want to understand how it might be possible
876000	880000	for us in our time and our children's time
880000	884000	to establish actually coherent
884000	888000	intelligent human societies worthy of survival
888000	892000	never mind capable of self-sustainment
892000	896000	but virtuously beautiful
896000	900000	in spirit and purpose and behavior
900000	904000	then we're going to need a much better array of toys
904000	908000	array of perspectival toys with which to examine
908000	912000	what led to the problems we face today
912000	916000	and you know the common
916000	920000	common
928000	932000	the common figurines
932000	936000	that we like to
936000	940000	that are often selected for
940000	944000	admonition and
944000	948000	enlightenment and
948000	952000	elevation in our awareness
952000	956000	to the status of culprits
956000	960000	our
960000	964000	monotheism
964000	968000	patriarchy
968000	972000	commerce
972000	976000	commodity commerce
980000	984000	class
984000	988000	hierarchical class dichotomies
988000	992000	the
992000	996000	the one percent
996000	1000000	the wealthy
1000000	1004000	the kings and queens particularly
1004000	1008000	in various phases of the development of Europe
1008000	1012000	and the Middle East
1012000	1016000	I don't know
1016000	1020000	I don't know
1022000	1026000	you know personally I'm not well educated enough
1026000	1030000	historically to understand
1030000	1034000	the real birthplaces of
1040000	1044000	the colonizing
1044000	1048000	countries
1056000	1060000	I love the cadences of
1060000	1064000	German it's wonderful to hear people enthusiastically speaking German
1064000	1068000	as they walk past me
1068000	1072000	and you know we might think oh what synchronicity
1072000	1076000	yeah go ahead think what you like
1076000	1080000	but try to understand that what I'm saying is
1080000	1084000	we don't have the formula yet
1084000	1088000	that stuff we're exchanging around
1088000	1092000	like a new kind of poison
1092000	1096000	in the atmosphere of what we have ironically called social
1096000	1100000	justice
1100000	1104000	is not the elixir
1104000	1108000	nor is it the intoxicant that will give us insight
1108000	1112000	if you want insight
1112000	1116000	we're going to have to authentically go back
1116000	1120000	not merely into the history of our species
1120000	1124000	but very carefully into the history of our own lives
1124000	1128000	your life my life our childhood
1128000	1132000	the transitions
1132000	1136000	the phases of colonization
1136000	1140000	that we ourselves underwent as little children
1140000	1144000	that our parents underwent
1144000	1148000	that our grandparents underwent because
1148000	1152000	I
1152000	1156000	I would like you to
1156000	1160000	suspect with me
1160000	1164000	that not only
1164000	1168000	is the key to the cage hidden
1168000	1172000	you know the keys to the cages
1172000	1176000	not only is it hidden in our
1176000	1180000	in the arc of our developmental experience individually and collectively
1180000	1184000	uniquely keys in each one of us
1184000	1188000	we've been secreted
1188000	1192000	obscured occulted
1192000	1196000	but something even stranger
1196000	1200000	is real and accessible to us
1200000	1204000	which is that through a process
1204000	1208000	that resembles something we don't have a good word for
1208000	1212000	and I'm disinclined to forge
1212000	1216000	a convenient neologism here
1216000	1220000	because I want a really good one
1220000	1224000	so I'll describe instead of label
1224000	1228000	in the same way that
1228000	1232000	geologists look at the
1232000	1236000	strata the layers
1236000	1240000	in places where they have been laid bare to
1240000	1244000	access on the land
1244000	1248000	the only really good example
1248000	1252000	I have at hand easily accessible is the Grand Canyon
1252000	1256000	a place where a furrow has been dug
1256000	1260000	by a river into
1260000	1264000	the physical body of geologic time
1264000	1268000	and so the strata
1268000	1272000	are laid bare and I guess the other
1272000	1276000	more destructive and I think
1276000	1280000	confusing way to try to get at this information
1280000	1284000	or these recordings if you will these memories
1284000	1288000	is with core samples
1288000	1292000	carefully
1292000	1296000	drill a tube
1296000	1300000	of earth and stone and ice and stuff
1300000	1304000	in a sequence going down
1304000	1308000	and then you can lay them out in a linear fashion
1308000	1312000	and examine the record but what I'm trying to say
1312000	1316000	what I'm implying here is that
1316000	1320000	and similarly
1320000	1324000	with the origin of life
1324000	1328000	in the branch of sciences where
1328000	1332000	where we look in the various strata for
1332000	1336000	I'd love to know the etymology
1336000	1340000	of this word right now
1340000	1344000	we look for evidence of the previously existing
1344000	1348000	phases of life and development
1348000	1352000	that we imagine took place linearly
1352000	1356000	because we are
1356000	1360000	addicted to
1360000	1364000	one thing mind we are addicted to linear perspectives
1364000	1368000	we don't have to be we can break out of that one of the things we need to
1368000	1372000	we need the experience of being liberated from
1376000	1380000	so there are these strata
1380000	1384000	in the stone in the earth
1384000	1388000	that are like memorial
1388000	1392000	dreaming traces in a way
1392000	1396000	and what I'm suggesting is that in each one of us
1396000	1400000	and in our cohorts in our cultures
1400000	1404000	in our ethnicities in our ancestors in our progeny
1404000	1408000	there's a layered
1408000	1412000	richness of interiority that actually contains
1412000	1416000	the entire history of our species
1416000	1420000	there's a way of doing
1420000	1424000	a kind of archaeology
1424000	1428000	that isn't
1428000	1432000	merely objective
1432000	1436000	isn't merely empirical
1436000	1440000	that is partly magical
1440000	1444000	or partly transcendental
1444000	1448000	and when you hear stories for example
1448000	1452000	of
1452000	1456000	either accidental enlightenment
1456000	1460000	where you have some young child who at six just starts
1460000	1464000	sitting still and won't move and has to be fed
1464000	1468000	and some good who comes and says
1468000	1472000	this one has gone beyond and when you hear stories of intentional enlightenment
1472000	1476000	where quote unquote right where someone
1476000	1480000	very committed to the meditation path
1480000	1484000	mostly you will hear similar stories
1484000	1488000	where in fact what I'm speaking about
1488000	1492000	surfaces in consciousness
1492000	1496000	thus we hear the Buddha saying
1496000	1500000	something I don't know what the Buddha actually said
1500000	1504000	but we hear stories that the Buddha said
1504000	1508000	I have been billions of lives
1508000	1512000	I have been all of the beings in a way
1512000	1516000	this might be translated as
1516000	1520000	past lives
1520000	1524000	I strongly suspect that the actual situation
1524000	1528000	is much weirder than past lives
1528000	1532000	and is not
1532000	1536000	linear in the ways we would imagine
1536000	1540000	so that for example
1540000	1544000	imagine
1544000	1548000	just as an example that you are
1548000	1552000	alive locally to your consciousness right now
1552000	1556000	but
1556000	1560000	like a constellation
1560000	1564000	in the sky imagine for example
1564000	1568000	the big dipper as seen from earth
1568000	1572000	those stars
1572000	1576000	the shape of the big dipper
1576000	1580000	is seen
1580000	1584000	from a point in space
1584000	1588000	now I would like to know
1588000	1592000	the names of those stars
1592000	1596000	and how distant in space time they are from each other
1596000	1600000	because let's be clear if you saw it from another angle outside of it
1600000	1604000	it would not form a dipper
1604000	1608000	some of the stars might be invisible
1608000	1612000	or there might be other stars that were visible
1612000	1616000	in the arrangement
1616000	1620000	the illusion
1620000	1624000	it's not actually an illusion is it
1624000	1628000	the figuration of the big dipper
1628000	1632000	is we experience it because of
1632000	1636000	where we are looking from in time space
1636000	1640000	and so to us it's a little bit as if
1640000	1644000	there's a dot to dot drawing
1644000	1648000	there which over time has
1648000	1652000	undergone semantic degradation
1652000	1656000	so that we think of it as a ladle cup
1656000	1660000	because I promise you
1660000	1664000	long ago they were not thinking that's a ladle cup
1664000	1668000	they probably didn't think that
1668000	1672000	what was seen in the sky
1672000	1676000	resembled objects
1676000	1680000	appliances or tools
1680000	1684000	that would be a very unlikely
1684000	1688000	derivation I think
1688000	1692000	so we should take that seriously the unlikeliness of such a derivation
1692000	1696000	I mean hilariously a couple nights ago I woke up from
1696000	1700000	dreaming to give you a sort of related example
1700000	1704000	and I don't really know what was going on
1704000	1708000	and it was sort of hilarious
1708000	1712000	but not merely funny
1712000	1716000	I got the impression
1716000	1720000	of my refrigerator
1720000	1724000	I hopefully I'll come back to this later because I want to stay on point here but
1724000	1728000	I got the impression of my refrigerator it's a white refrigerator
1728000	1732000	vinyl surfaced
1732000	1736000	many refrigerators and it was
1736000	1740000	deified it was like this
1740000	1744000	angelic choirs and rays of divine light
1744000	1748000	coming off the refrigerator
1748000	1752000	which is a very ridiculous seeming to my rational mind anyway
1752000	1756000	completely ridiculous and even to my
1756000	1760000	the Luddite in me that abhors machines
1760000	1764000	it doesn't merely abhore machines
1764000	1768000	I don't merely abhore them I recognize that
1768000	1772000	coupled with the insensate
1772000	1776000	war and prison hearing
1776000	1780000	monsters that have captured and
1780000	1784000	colonized and are recolonizing our existing societies
1784000	1788000	and nations and populations and so forth those things are
1788000	1792000	death sign
1792000	1796000	those are the flags of a coming apocalypse and not just
1796000	1800000	an ever coming apocalypse right an apocalypse is happening now has been happening
1800000	1804000	for a good depending on how you want to count it
1804000	1808000	thousand years but much more so in the past 500
1808000	1812000	and much more so in the past one and so forth
1812000	1816000	a sort of title a tide a heartbeat of doom
1816000	1820000	where the humans just are ripping the foundations
1820000	1824000	of their own minds to shreds in terms of
1824000	1828000	the origins of the possibility of intelligence and
1828000	1832000	consciousness in the anciently conserved ecologies of the
1832000	1836000	planet which are the most precious thing around here
1836000	1840000	not us our origins the womb this planetary
1840000	1844000	womb that ever renews itself
1844000	1848000	and hopefully doesn't really need to be
1848000	1852000	penetrated in order to be fertilized right light
1852000	1856000	the divine virginal penetration
1856000	1860000	of light sunlight and time spaces
1860000	1864000	the water of time space penetrated by sunlight
1864000	1868000	coupled with the physical hypostasis of these
1868000	1872000	primordial more than merely beings
1872000	1876000	generates life here
1876000	1880000	and it is truly holy but as I was saying those stars in the
1880000	1884000	sky they are not
1884000	1888000	coherently related to one another
1888000	1892000	except by the angle of our perspective they don't
1892000	1896000	belong to some family of local
1896000	1900000	anatomy
1900000	1904000	local stellar anatomy I don't think I suspect they're wildly
1904000	1908000	distant from each other and would be seen completely
1908000	1912000	differently from another distant angle
1912000	1916000	say if we drew a circle around them
1916000	1920000	if we circled actually if we made a sphere
1920000	1924000	around the big dipper at the same distance
1924000	1928000	from which our perspective arises
1928000	1932000	we made a sphere then we just traveled to different perspectives on that sphere
1932000	1936000	very different things would emerge to our perspective and what I'm trying to say
1936000	1940000	is that imagine that although your sort of spirit
1940000	1944000	or soul however you want to think about it
1944000	1948000	and there's much better ways to think about it than a spirit or soul
1948000	1952000	your
1952000	1956000	your the localization that you think of as yourself
1956000	1960000	is probably similar to that big dipper
1960000	1964000	imagine that there are many many
1964000	1968000	beings we could start with a small number to make it easy
1968000	1972000	there's 12 just for kicks
1972000	1976000	and a couple of those beings are living in the Pleistus
1976000	1980000	the earliest time of the humans
1980000	1984000	and not all those beings are human but we're going to pretend they are for a minute
1984000	1988000	and they're living in all different times
1988000	1992000	and places of the earth
1992000	1996000	we're going to keep them on earth for the moment though that's not actually necessary either
1996000	2000000	so there's beings all throughout
2000000	2004000	the historical phases of the humans
2004000	2008000	and let's say half of them are before you and half of them are after you
2008000	2012000	so six before you and then you in the middle that you're the 13th one so to speak
2012000	2016000	and then there's six after you in the future
2016000	2020000	and those beings are all simultaneously existing
2020000	2024000	the Eunus, the me, the meanness, Darren, hopefully not the meanness
2024000	2028000	but the meanness
2028000	2032000	you perceive
2032000	2036000	yourself as localized in this
2036000	2040000	temporal spatial manifold of relationships
2040000	2044000	when actually you're a constellation of beings
2044000	2048000	with a nucleus much like
2048000	2052000	what we think of as the solar system
2052000	2056000	and sometimes you're the sun
2056000	2060000	in that family
2060000	2064000	sometimes you're
2064000	2068000	Saturn, it's funny we have this system where we
2068000	2072000	establish your relationship between each of the planets and everyone thinks oh that's a bunch of hokey
2072000	2076000	well those people who think that are very confused but also the people
2076000	2080000	who reify the system
2080000	2084000	of astrology are just as confused
2084000	2088000	because it's neither false nor fact
2088000	2092000	both of those extremes lose
2092000	2096000	the fragrance of insight
2096000	2100000	that is accessible to us as human beings
2100000	2104000	once things become explicit and we start trying to say what is a fact
2104000	2108000	and unless we're in a very limited
2108000	2112000	sort of cone of purpose of orientation
2112000	2116000	and behavior there are
2116000	2120000	applicable there's an applicable scope
2120000	2124000	to what we think of as empiricism but let's be really clear
2124000	2128000	what the moderns mostly do with empiricism is kill
2128000	2132000	I use that to kill stuff now remember my friend
2132000	2136000	Fernanda
2136000	2140000	from Brazil
2140000	2144000	she wanted to become a marine biologist until she discovered that what that meant was collecting
2144000	2148000	living creatures from the sea and killing them
2148000	2152000	taking them apart, studying the bits
2152000	2156000	of course there are other ways to do it but the classes that she was taking
2156000	2160000	she was magically in love with the sea creatures
2160000	2164000	as I am
2164000	2168000	until she discovered what empiricism is about
2168000	2172000	and what we do with it which is really the wrong thing
2172000	2176000	and you can see again here the terrifying
2176000	2180000	jagged pointy fingerprint of colonization
2180000	2184000	this is what I mean by colonization I don't mean
2184000	2188000	necessarily bad people mostly men
2188000	2192000	are the execution body of colonization because
2192000	2196000	historically primarily at least in the large
2196000	2200000	cohorts men were the
2200000	2204000	disposable soldier class
2204000	2208000	and there's so much, wow there's so much here
2208000	2212000	to look at
2212000	2216000	so yeah men were the inaction body
2216000	2220000	and
2220000	2224000	sometimes men, often perhaps men
2224000	2228000	were the
2228000	2232000	what, the infected
2232000	2236000	disassociated
2236000	2240000	orienteering
2240000	2244000	measureers, rulers
2244000	2248000	measures of value
2248000	2252000	measures of
2252000	2256000	history and futurity
2256000	2260000	and what will we make
2260000	2264000	of this potential of our lives and moment
2264000	2268000	of our cooperative potential
2268000	2272000	one of my new friends
2272000	2276000	Roger T. who I'm not sure how to pronounce his last name is why I'm not
2276000	2280000	doing it
2280000	2284000	who has this brilliant
2284000	2288000	sort of matrilineally communicated from his
2288000	2292000	wife method of alignment
2292000	2296000	producing alignment in human cohorts particularly in business but not
2296000	2300000	not necessarily merely in business
2300000	2304000	apex cooperators
2304000	2308000	it's a brilliant phrase, I'm not sure if he coined that phrase
2308000	2312000	or who coined it
2312000	2316000	but so yeah it looks like it was men and I'm not denying that there's a problem
2316000	2320000	with
2320000	2324000	I'm gonna make a joke here
2324000	2328000	with having the external three part flower downstairs
2328000	2332000	historically
2332000	2336000	but this measuring and what
2336000	2340000	the problem is that the males who perpetrated
2340000	2344000	and executed
2344000	2348000	iterations of recursive colonization
2348000	2352000	were first themselves colonized
2352000	2356000	this is the actual, this is the thing we need to see
2356000	2360000	and we know, we have some
2360000	2364000	we, I don't even know who I mean by we, let's just say that
2364000	2368000	culturally and sociologically we are, we have become aware as
2368000	2372000	moderns that
2372000	2376000	many of the people
2376000	2380000	who perpetrate violence
2380000	2384000	and subjugation
2384000	2388000	and murder and rape
2388000	2392000	and violation
2392000	2396000	were themselves subjected
2396000	2400000	to these
2400000	2404000	deprivations and impoverishments and terrors
2404000	2408000	in their developmental
2408000	2412000	arcs
2412000	2416000	and it's not clear
2416000	2420000	to me anyway
2420000	2424000	that in a coherent
2424000	2428000	or small scale
2428000	2432000	coherent human family,
2432000	2436000	tribe, culture
2436000	2440000	it's probably extremely uncommon
2440000	2444000	that these behaviors emerge
2444000	2448000	and some will say things like, well we've seen behavior like this in primates
2448000	2452000	okay
2452000	2456000	but did you see primates before humans invaded the jungle
2456000	2460000	and before
2460000	2464000	what is the human effect on the context in which the primates are developing
2464000	2468000	what is the effect
2468000	2472000	of the humans on, of the human behavior in the world
2472000	2476000	on the primate population
2476000	2480000	these features of that which exists are connected
2480000	2484000	they're not merely
2484000	2488000	we would ordinarily think rationally
2488000	2492000	that if the monkeys are in a jungle
2492000	2496000	in Africa where there are no humans, presuming there was such a jungle
2496000	2500000	that humans are somewhere else doing things like making war and going insane together
2500000	2504000	killing up everything that moves and most of what doesn't
2504000	2508000	it wouldn't affect the primates until
2508000	2512000	and unless the humans showed up in the jungle
2512000	2516000	because we presume that there's no way to communicate
2516000	2520000	the malignancy
2520000	2524000	from the humans to the primates unless they're proximal
2524000	2528000	because there's always a dimension
2528000	2532000	of the context where everything's proximal
2532000	2536000	the planet is a unified
2536000	2540000	manifold of historical
2540000	2544000	relational, futorial
2544000	2548000	what
2548000	2552000	transmissions, communication
2552000	2556000	so whenever I hear people saying
2556000	2560000	oh it's just natural for humans to be, I don't believe it
2560000	2564000	I don't believe that at all
2564000	2568000	it's conceivable
2568000	2572000	but what it looks more like to me is an infection most of the time
2572000	2576000	and maybe I prefer to see it this way, maybe I'm biased
2576000	2580000	Graeber and his writing companion in the dawn of everything
2580000	2584000	push back against the idea that humans
2584000	2588000	have been
2588000	2592000	catastrophically misbehaving toward each other
2592000	2596000	in life in general for thousands of years and it's the law of the
2596000	2600000	land and so forth, that myth needs to come down
2600000	2604000	I just don't trust it at all
2604000	2608000	but what I'm trying to get at is that the origins of the problems we face
2608000	2612000	not in the men, it's not merely patriarchy
2612000	2616000	and what has happened that's terrifying is that
2616000	2620000	the features
2620000	2624000	of our humanity
2624000	2628000	that are vulnerable to colonization
2628000	2632000	have been being colonized by something
2632000	2636000	and we can think of this something in a variety of different ways
2636000	2640000	for eons
2640000	2644000	and these colonizing
2644000	2648000	contagions
2648000	2652000	these colonizing pathological processes
2652000	2656000	oh wow here's the dog man
2656000	2660000	with so many dogs and yet he can keep them
2660000	2664000	all coherent
2664000	2668000	so
2672000	2676000	huh
2676000	2688000	an
2688000	2692000	huh
2692000	2702360	a chat with him at some point. Because he's really profoundly skillful at managing a large
2702360	2718560	group of unrelated dogs. Nearly certain those dogs don't come from one family, one household.
2718560	2726040	So we have to look carefully into the history, the histories, and not just the written histories,
2726040	2737680	the histories that are submerged within us. It's my direct experience that not just the
2737680	2742880	history of life on earth and not just the history of the humans, but the history of
2742880	2749840	what we think of as the universe and the history of its origins, the origin places and origin beings
2749840	2762200	is encoded in the strata of our being. And this is recoverable to us when so ever and to whatever
2762200	2773200	degree we may agree to recover it, to seek it, to quest for it, to inquire as Amen Hillman,
2773200	2792160	the half mad prophet, tells us he in his linguistic neuromorphosis tells us that the ancient language
2792160	2807240	is, are actually doorways into other, into lost potentials of our humanity. And for the moment,
2807240	2814480	at least, I'm not a big fan, what does that even mean? I have a large fan in my hand and I keep
2814480	2835080	waiting it. No, I find his playful and hilarious and terrifying, manic, manistic, prophetic, genius,
2835680	2846040	inspiring and nourishing and propelling. But one of the things he says is that, and I may have this
2846040	2855200	wrong, but he's saying something like the original idea that becomes in our time the word history,
2855200	2873440	actually comes from bringing a question to the probably adolescent symbols at the oracle places
2873440	2884000	in the ancient world. And he's talking specifically about places in Europe and what we think of now
2884000	2896520	maybe as the Middle East and Greece and so forth. Greece primarily, but also it's surrounding like
2896520	2904880	the Empire, I guess. I don't know where all the symbols were. I don't know where we have records
2904880	2910080	of them being, but what he was saying is that this idea of history, it's not stories about what
2910160	2922960	happened, it's to become pregnant with the urgency of a question and pursue that question beyond
2924960	2936800	our common inclinations to answer it, to declare some, oh, here's what happened. No, no. It's to become
2937680	2945120	the re-happening, the living an amnesis of the question. And this is the kind of potential we
2945120	2955520	are born to experience the exultation of. And there's nearly no one like Amen.
2958000	2965440	Other biblical scholars or classicists may criticize him and say things like, oh, he's taking a specific
2965520	2972560	sense of a specific word and he's promoting it to the primordial sense over all instances of this
2972560	2985520	word in such a way as to twist the perspective to produce the truly bizarre narrative that he wants us
2985520	2996960	to swallow about ancient Greece, the origins of Christianity, Christos, the Medusa, Medea,
2998240	3000240	medicine, all these things.
3000640	3011280	And hilariously, some of those critics, Dan McClellan among them,
3014160	3019680	might be technically, linguistically,
3022960	3027760	and perhaps even cognitively quote unquote correct, they're missing the point.
3028720	3029680	I'm missing the point.
3032800	3040720	Amen's unique and, you know, intoxicated.
3044080	3053840	The elixir that Amen is making is sygenic, generative of mind states, otherwise inaccessible.
3054000	3062320	And they're looking at something, it's just like people who've only seen airplanes or jet aircraft,
3062320	3069200	which are made for war or passenger or cargo, transit, they're looking at,
3070480	3075280	basically they're looking at a UFO, they're looking at something from outside. It wasn't even made by
3075280	3082000	humans. And it doesn't do the things that the human made aircraft do at all. It has no concern
3082000	3088800	about those things. It's concerned with transporting us to insight and re-establishing
3088800	3099600	anciently lost relationships and correcting nonsensical histories that for us have become prisons
3101600	3104320	of ignorance and blindness.
3112720	3113760	A time will tell
3118160	3125040	whether the elixir of Amen's performative, and I don't mean that in the derogatory modern
3126480	3134720	critical sense at all, the elixirs of Amen's performances are truly generative
3134720	3141840	of an amnesis and re-membering.
3145680	3158960	However, personally I find them profound and brilliant in an admittedly iconoclastic and provocative way.
3164720	3171280	So let's see if I can recover my threads here.
3179120	3188160	The colonized colonizers, the re-colonization. So now what's going on in modernly, okay,
3188800	3196640	we have the rise of the internet, which starts out looking pretty virtuous. It resembles in
3197920	3206640	potential the Agora of ancient Greece, where Socrates and other philosophers,
3206640	3215120	Rhapsodes and Sophists perhaps, gathered the common people day to day to pursue wisdom and
3215120	3228080	insight, but also to pursue convincing condemnation, indictment, judgment, opinionaring.
3232800	3239280	And the internet began this way, but it was colonized, and it colonized us.
3240240	3248880	And what was it colonized by? It was colonized by forces that advertise themselves as protectors.
3250080	3260560	The NSA, the National Security Administration, the ridiculous enforcement arms of the government
3260640	3272880	that rose in the wake of 9-11, as if 9-11 were produced specifically to generate those recursively
3274800	3285280	colonizing lethal organizations, and to create a future of panopticon-like
3285760	3297120	surveillance that would collapse not merely the possibility of a free society, whatever that
3297120	3303280	might mean, whatever it's possible for that to mean, but it would turn our own homes and
3303280	3308320	relationships into prisons, weapons that we could be threatened with.
3309280	3318080	And then with the rise of social media, which again in the beginning was a way to bring people
3318080	3325360	together and to celebrate our potentials for intelligence and creativity and insight and
3325360	3334240	play, quickly again became colonized by corporate agendas, driven primarily by two forces,
3334480	3346720	advertising the absolute, I mean, one of the most malignant demons of our modern world,
3348880	3356160	and governmental surveillance of citizens, these twin,
3356400	3366960	cyclopean, I mean, that's probably insulting the cyclops, but yeah, these monsters,
3367600	3377360	straight-up monsters that will eat our lives, minds, and children and sell the bones to the highest
3377360	3385440	bidder. So you can see this recursive, iterative, recolonization
3388000	3397680	of our relationships, our interiority, our thought, our dreaming, our bodies, our metabolism,
3398320	3409280	right? And it's as if it's a layered, it's a layered antithesis to an amnesis. It's a layered,
3410720	3420400	like an acid that just eats the foundations of memory and produces structured skeletal remains
3421360	3434560	that are commoditized and turned into the fuel for future iterations of new forms of recolonization.
3442000	3445920	You know, it's easy to distract us with indictments
3446640	3450480	that make little sense.
3454160	3466400	If we're actually concerned about the injustice of the histories of colonization, slavery, misogyny,
3466960	3467760	misanthropy,
3473520	3484320	misbiorelation, abiotic, omniside, then we need not so much to indict and prosecute the histories.
3484880	3490160	We need to understand the origins and we must establish coherent vessels
3491120	3505280	for our communal development, education, an amnesis, healing, enrichment,
3509440	3513600	and something, you know, what does decolonization mean?
3514320	3518560	But we can imagine, it means something like, well, you know, when the children have lice,
3518560	3527520	you put medicine in their hair. No, we need to do the opposite of, well, both things, maybe.
3528240	3536240	We need a very enlightened idea and direction for any such project, and it must be self,
3536960	3542480	it must iteratively decolonize itself.
3556960	3560480	That was really beautiful what that guy was saying, so he was saying like,
3561280	3565840	this guy's really interesting. He's clearly a not-ordinarily-minded person
3566640	3571840	because he has an enthusiasm that's far beyond what ordinary people would usually have, right?
3572400	3578400	And he was saying, you know, the last few, few times I told myself as I was out on my walk,
3578400	3585040	I'm going to pick up five pieces of litter. Each time I found like a pair of expensive
3585040	3591120	ray bands, or one I found $100, every time I found something valuable.
3592480	3597120	This is kind of what I'm, this is a strange sort of synchronicity.
3600560	3606720	We, if our orientation is indictment and prosecution,
3609760	3614000	it's the path is too expensive and will continue to colonize itself.
3615040	3619440	One of the ways that we'll do this is with nomenclature, actually two of the ways.
3619440	3623360	No, it's like the Spanish Inquisition. Every time you look, there's more ways, right?
3623360	3632880	But yeah, it's with nomenclature, in other words, jargon, and it's with ideology, ideological fanaticism.
3633360	3644080	So we have to be aware of those, we have to be aware of the way
3646640	3653200	that a purpose of orientation that starts out virtuous and altruistic
3654160	3661200	in a trustworthy sense is easily captured even by its own,
3664160	3669920	by the threads of its own origins. And so we have to find a way to preserve
3672720	3679200	the possibilities of virtue, insight, learning, healing, growth, so forth.
3680160	3687120	There's the terrifying machine signal
3689760	3694480	and then the horrible noise of death. Every animal that ever heard that was soon to die.
3696240	3702880	Our cells know this is the, you know, this is the bell of doom when you hear the engines.
3703040	3708640	Almost, I mean, there are a few exceptions. There's a few exceptions. I guess
3710240	3715840	the engines of the ships of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, for example,
3716560	3725360	are an unusual inversion of that paradigm. So what I'm trying to get us to remember here is that
3726240	3733440	all of the executors of colonization
3735920	3744000	were almost certainly victims of colonization first. They were infected with the thrisp-like
3744000	3751200	structure of processes that would convert them, their lives, their children, their ancestors,
3751200	3759440	the meaning of their origins and the shape of their future to omniside, dead terrain,
3760160	3766880	the production of commodities, the collection of commodities in the coffers of the powerful
3766880	3779040	and the wealthy who are themselves, sort of the seed bed, the dead inside seed bed of the pathologies
3779840	3780640	that become
3785520	3793920	the inaction body of the colonizing forces. And we must discover, and I mean, I think I have
3793920	3800480	some keys to this, which I have spoken of in the past, but we must discover and recover
3801120	3803760	the origins of the problem and clearly
3804000	3831520	Okay, I think we just got a clue here.
3832480	3838400	So these geese are flipping out and the males are getting all spun up and they're getting spun up
3840080	3843520	because a human gave a couple of them some crackers.
3848000	3854160	It'd be hilarious to discover that like the one of the origins of the problem of colonization
3854960	3861680	and I think there's probably a lot of evidence quote unquote for this is simply the introduction
3861680	3868640	of carbohydrates. Once you can store up huge amounts of carbohydrates, it's sort of like
3868640	3875600	what happens when you put a nectar bottle, you know, a bottle of dyed sugar water
3876560	3881760	in a population of hummingbirds. They might have been a little bit provocative before,
3882640	3886960	but once you put all those commodities in one place, now you got two problems. You've got to
3886960	3893440	protect them from people who might want to take them and it's a really attractive prize
3894000	3902080	because it represents what? Convenience. Okay, so we're going to see two things here fuel
3902720	3910560	and convenience and there's a third thing which is essentially
3915840	3916320	metals
3919440	3929600	particularly what we think of as precious metals and jewels, crystals, diamonds
3932640	3941440	gold, silver, platinum, copper, bronze, iron, diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires.
3944800	3953200	So and I'm not even getting close to what is actually going on. These are the later stage
3953680	3964640	catalysts of devastation. What did they really want when they sent ships to the new world quote
3964640	3972480	unquote? Well, they wanted gold. What were they after? Gold. They might have been thinking land
3973360	3979280	but mostly they were thinking gold. Did those savages have gold stored up somewhere? Let's get
3979280	3986080	that gold or at least this is the story we tell and that story is probably three quarters wrong but
3988080	3990080	it maybe resembles our own projections
3993360	3996160	and projection is a large part of the problem because
3998880	4006880	if you think your opponent is up to something various then you have to get there first. This is
4006880	4011520	the race to the bottom the perverse incentive incentivization
4013920	4024320	elucidated by Daniel Schmockdenberger and others of the Game B or new civilization project.
4028480	4032720	You know what has to happen obviously is that we have to establish some options that are so much
4032720	4044320	more compelling than the zero-sum competitive pathologies we're currently enacting and being
4045120	4049520	conscripted to and punished by and devastated for.
4049920	4062720	We aren't the people of the lie. We are the generation of lying. It's different.
4063600	4075840	The context is so catastrophically multi-layeredly toxic counterfeit
4076720	4087600	projective. Everywhere we see presentations that advertise virtue and underneath are
4089040	4097440	essentially self-purifying disease vectors and this is you know the concept that I use.
4097440	4106560	This is the origin. My quest to understand this resulted in a series of visions one of which
4106560	4112400	introduced the concepts of the Cognition which is the network of human minds, the Mimula which is
4112400	4118480	all the features of connection in that network and Thryps which compete for dominance of that
4118480	4133760	network under conditions in which the organic and natural orienteering principles that would guide
4133760	4144880	and nourish and protect our collective insight, memory, intelligence, altruism, virtue when those
4144880	4160720	breakdown boom, drifts everywhere. It's similar to certain biological processes like those that
4162160	4167360	burn down our neural networks with prion proteins for example. One of the things
4168160	4178160	Kurzfeld Jacobs disease or otherwise known as mad cow disease and similar prion protein
4180160	4193680	disorders. As I understand it, the prions are essential to the differentiation
4194000	4200880	of our nervous systems and neural networks in the brain in early development.
4202240	4209040	Similarly to how something kills off the flesh between our fingers so that you get these differentiated
4209040	4220160	very useful articulate appendages. Something resembling that happens in the brain in our early
4220880	4231520	developmental arcs with neurons. A lot of them have to be burned off and what that means is that's
4233520	4237840	one of the things that makes us each unique because we all undergo this kind of interior
4237840	4244560	extinction event and usually we think oh extinction is bad and it certainly is if we're burning down
4244640	4249600	anciently conserved ecologies to make more machines and stuff. That's insane. That's not
4250800	4260080	there's nothing coherent or biorelationally integral about that. That's just madness and
4261120	4268960	wrongness. And yeah you can take the bigger picture. Sure. You can say things like oh life is resilient
4269840	4270800	earth is resilient.
4274560	4279920	But I'd love to see where that perspective is arising from because if it's arising from some kind
4279920	4286960	of empirical or materialistic perspective based on what you think is the historical data and so
4286960	4292000	forth that's dissociative. That's dissociated. You're not connecting with nature at all. You're just
4292720	4302480	you're just being a disembodied grasping rationalist. So you're almost certainly going to be wrong
4302480	4311840	about nearly everything having to do with organisms if that's your that's your anchor in consciousness
4312400	4326880	and concern. A mother's concerns much more trustworthy. She bears children. She has to fund them
4327520	4335280	fund just to build their bodies from her own biology right the calcium of her bones
4336240	4340640	the metabolic products of her body her heartbeat
4341840	4351760	is becomes the context in which life emerges and while our planet is only metaphorically
4352880	4361280	feminine in this sense that metaphor goes very deep and is very powerful. It's not merely a figure of speech.
4366160	4372880	So we must recover the origins of the problem that led to our defection
4376000	4383600	from memory humanity insight virtue mutual intelligence mutual concern awareness
4384400	4400640	our real cooperative abilities and we must find ways to establish vehicles to conserve develop
4400640	4404800	enact
4409840	4420080	and and transmit communicate these potentials into the existing bodies of anti-culture
4420960	4431680	that largely own our species at this time our children and perhaps we may be so lucky as to
4431680	4438800	stumble into ways of being human that please our ancestors by fulfilling their dreams
4439360	4446160	and what they hoped for and worked for in the deepest recesses of their hearts minds and spirits
4450320	4457520	all of us moderns and for you know millions of lifetimes we have been slaves
4459040	4465680	to things that don't even exist we have been slaves to ghosts and shadows in the human cognisium
4467120	4476640	presenting as virtues or progress and delivering omniside amnesia torture despair
4477600	4486800	devastation of our our spirit our commonality the replacement of that with
4486800	4497840	prison-eering panopticon like surveillance systems that aren't killing us off directly at the moment
4498400	4510480	and this is this is actually part of the problem with the weird results of technology
4513440	4522160	there are fates worse than death and some of them involve the slow erosion
4522160	4531520	of our interior assets and potentials and if you can get at the thing with which we tell the
4531520	4539440	difference the thing with which we would otherwise notice what is happening then anything that gets
4539440	4550320	at that anything that gets at the fundamental basis of our capacity to discern change if you can
4550320	4560560	co-opt that then the entire bank of the history and future of life on earth of human beings of
4560560	4567680	our interiority is now open for rape and you can get away with anything you can imagine
4568400	4574080	you just have to go slowly enough you just have to turn the heat up in the water slowly enough
4574720	4585920	that it doesn't overcome the disabled senses that would alert us to we must oppose this
4587120	4592640	that would cattle that would organize and galvanize us into communal
4593200	4598240	into heroic communal
4600800	4606640	organization intelligence resilience and activity
4609520	4616240	so these are a few of the things that are in my awareness today or have risen in my awareness
4616320	4630000	while I muse with you my listeners in the hope of better ways of seeing in the hope of an amnesis
4631120	4636400	in the hope of pleasing the ancestors and the muses and perhaps the angels
4636800	4647840	I'm so grateful to have this time together and for your kind attention your enthusiasm your wonder
4648640	4657840	your curiosity the spirit within you of heroic questing recovery and rescue
4658000	4667760	that is innate to our human nature may your ways and minds and dreams be beautiful and healing
4667760	4679040	and profound and may you find joyful relation with all the aspects of yourself your histories your
4679040	4686800	futures your ancestors your progeny and all of the beings who are in fact a single family
4687840	4701840	thank you for joining me I look forward to learning together again very soon bye bye for now
