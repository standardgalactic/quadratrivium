00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Hello, everybody. Welcome.

00:12.000 --> 00:25.000
It is, perhaps May 3rd. Time has been a little strange for me lately because I've been laid up.

00:25.000 --> 00:38.000
After having a salad a couple days ago, my body freaked out.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
So I've mostly been in bed and doing a whole bunch of sweating.

00:45.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm not sure what I have in mind to share today. There's no organized colloquium,

00:56.000 --> 01:13.000
but it's been a little while since I made a recording, so I thought I'd have a go at it and just see where it goes.

01:13.000 --> 01:28.000
You know, a lot of our experience is structured by a broad array of expectations that are instilled in us

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
by the cultures we grew up in and the places where we live.

01:34.000 --> 01:43.000
And we should be willing to imagine that what it would mean to be human would be radically different

01:43.000 --> 01:53.000
if we were growing up in a different context.

01:53.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh, yes. The calla lilies and their predilection to attract, at least around here, crab spiders, which I love.

02:07.000 --> 02:15.000
They're really awesome. There's a male. You can see a male in this one.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
I was speaking with a friend and she was talking about her daughter's education in Italy

02:20.000 --> 02:27.000
and how radically different it is from what would happen to her here.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
And notice I say happen to her because there's a huge difference between being subjected to something

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
that effectively ruins your mind and perhaps your heart

02:40.000 --> 03:01.000
and being drawn into a rich developmental conversation that nourishes and supports your development.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
When she brought her daughter to Italy, the educational system there, they were doing things

03:08.000 --> 03:18.000
when she was 10 and 11 that we wouldn't do here, if ever, until college.

03:18.000 --> 03:35.000
And I've heard this story so many times, so many times before.

03:35.000 --> 03:44.000
Although it's possible to acquire a well-rounded and rich education in the United States,

03:44.000 --> 03:53.000
it's profoundly difficult, add or expensive.

03:53.000 --> 04:05.000
And if there's one thing I want to be absolutely clear about, it's that in nations as sophisticated and wealthy as ours,

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
there are at least two things for which there should be no charge whatsoever,

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
and those are education and healthcare.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
If we can afford $23 trillion to support the military,

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
we could take one of those trillions and educate our people and their children.

04:25.000 --> 04:35.000
And we could take another of those trillions and give them healthcare that was actually profound, advanced,

04:35.000 --> 04:43.000
sophisticated, and effective.

04:43.000 --> 04:51.000
In any country where healthcare is a business, you have a fundamental conflict of interest,

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
and the same is true of education.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
If people want to argue, like, we should all pull ourselves up by our own bootstraps,

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
my argument is go make a country where you do that and leave us alone.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
Just get the hell out of here.

05:14.000 --> 05:22.000
I remember I often have complex conversations with cabbies.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
Cab drivers are a particularly interesting kind of human,

05:29.000 --> 05:41.000
and I would argue that they were much more interesting before the advent of GPS and electronic navigation,

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
because they had to have a map.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
Their minds were maps.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
And I had a couple of close friends who were cabbies in the 90s.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
One of them was a poet. I wonder if I can recall his name.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
It's been so long since I thought of him.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
But what a brilliant and sensitive human being he was.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Ken Wainio was his name.

06:14.000 --> 06:23.000
And I think I published one of his stories in my magazine, Cyanosis.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
Oh, by the way, if any of you want a copy of that magazine, you can make a comment,

06:31.000 --> 06:39.000
and you can have a copy for about ten bucks.

06:39.000 --> 06:50.000
It's more of a book. It's a large book rather than a magazine.

06:50.000 --> 07:02.000
In the 90s, I was publishing this art and literary journal because I saw the Republicans going after arts and education

07:02.000 --> 07:15.000
with the obvious agenda of creating a situation where the general American populace

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
was ignorant enough to just be directly manipulable by propaganda,

07:23.000 --> 07:39.000
which you can see is an agenda which has largely, if not completely, succeeded a very short time later.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Tragically.

07:41.000 --> 07:55.000
But I remember not too long ago, I was in a cab with a driver from Pakistan,

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
and he was talking about their educational system and the education that he received there,

08:01.000 --> 08:08.000
and what happened when he came to the United States in an attempt to continue it.

08:08.000 --> 08:22.000
And basically, when he was like ten, eight, nine, ten, they were teaching the children advanced calculus, right?

08:22.000 --> 08:31.000
Or was here, and when he came here, he had to go through some of the, you know,

08:31.000 --> 08:41.000
in order to get a degree, he had to go through some of the American education stuff for which he had no records in the U.S.

08:41.000 --> 08:53.000
And the education that he received at eight, nine, or ten in Pakistan was superior to the understanding of the teacher

08:53.000 --> 09:06.000
at the college he was going to here to the degree that he was constantly correcting the teacher.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
You know, I myself left school when I was twelve,

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
and I recall a situation last week where,

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
you know, I was on Facebook, unfortunately, probably for everyone,

09:34.000 --> 09:44.000
and there was a picture meme of some guy, and it said something to the effect of,

09:44.000 --> 09:53.000
you know, we've gone from teaching Latin and Greek in high school to teaching remedial English in college,

09:53.000 --> 10:10.000
and some para-feministic females were yelling about the fact that, you know,

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
this guy was some kind of right-wing idiot, and we shouldn't listen to him.

10:16.000 --> 10:27.000
And I said, you know, I don't think it's a good idea to dismiss the truth based on your evaluation of someone's character.

10:27.000 --> 10:37.000
That's a formal example of the ad hominem rhetorical fallacy, which is to fail to address the subject,

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
and to instead concern yourself with character assault.

10:44.000 --> 10:54.000
And a number of women, some of them quite intelligent, piled onto my comment and just started telling me what an idiot I am

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
and how the ad hominem fallacy doesn't even matter.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
It's not really a thing.

11:01.000 --> 11:09.000
And I was like, yeah, if we're going to start dismissing knowledge and truth based on the character of someone who says something,

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
you can, like, it's the end of rational intelligence. It's over with.

11:16.000 --> 11:25.000
You know, it's not untrue that they were, you know, making accusations of patriarchy and colonialism and blah blah.

11:25.000 --> 11:34.000
You know, the general, the common left-wing, these days largely bullshit arguments.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
And what I mean by bullshit is it's not bullshit that there's been patriarchy.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
It's not bullshit that that's caused harm.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
It's not bullshit that there's been colonialism all over the place

11:46.000 --> 11:56.000
and the catastrophic devastation of cultures and peoples and women and children and men and all these things.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
All of that's true.

12:01.000 --> 12:10.000
But it's possible to weaponize this concern into something that makes us dumber every time we make a move.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
And that's what I mean by bullshit.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
The weaponization of the possibility of virtue.

12:19.000 --> 12:28.000
We should be very cautious about prosecutorial historicity.

12:28.000 --> 12:35.000
Because once we become very concerned with prosecution and indictment,

12:36.000 --> 12:45.000
most of our intelligence is going to be subject to the costs of those behaviors.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
And those costs are not sustainable.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
You have to be really careful with what you do with a mind and what you choose to do with it.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
Suspicion, indictment, prosecution.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
They maybe have their place in certain circumstances,

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
but if that becomes the primary intellectual agenda, it's over for human intelligence.

13:11.000 --> 13:25.000
Like that whole prospect of insight or intelligence collapses into war mind, righteous indignation.

13:25.000 --> 13:36.000
I was very surprised to see a couple of women who were clearly quite articulate and intelligent and well-read

13:36.000 --> 13:45.000
dismissing the ad hominem argument that I made, which was not only valid,

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
you know, apparently there's no such thing as facts anymore.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
And I get the whole idea that facts are relative.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
I'm a fucking, I study semantics.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
I'm not an idiot.

13:57.000 --> 14:04.000
In fact, I realized that facts are relative a long time ago, more than 20 years ago.

14:04.000 --> 14:11.000
But there are domains in which we must rely on,

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
we've got to have a foundation of some kind that is trustworthy.

14:16.000 --> 14:23.000
And if we're going to decide that there are no facts, that we all just get to make up whatever facts we like,

14:23.000 --> 14:36.000
I don't think anyone is capable of understanding the cascade of social, intellectual, ecological,

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
and relational catastrophes that they're from will ensue for certain.

14:43.000 --> 14:53.000
The idea that nothing is true simply because bad men said it,

14:53.000 --> 15:05.000
or nothing is true because truth is a patriarchal con game, a colonial war game.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
You know, there's a tiny bit of, there's a seed.

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
Wow, this guy's a genius.

15:16.000 --> 15:24.000
There's this guy who paints here and his spirit of his art is really profound.

15:24.000 --> 15:30.000
Yeah, that stuff's fucking leafily toxic.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
See, I was very surprised because here's the problem.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
You go back to what this man may have actually said.

15:38.000 --> 15:50.000
We're just talking about a meme here, but they're trying to do a character attack on a guy who's saying something that's so true and important.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
What the hell is the goal?

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
We're going to dismiss what he said because we think he was a bad man,

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
or an avatar of the patriarchy or the right.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Jesus, so here's the actual problem.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
I left school when I was 12.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
I'm a self-educated person.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
The technical term is autodidact, and I'm precociously self-educating.

16:19.000 --> 16:27.000
Many of my closest friends are similar,

16:27.000 --> 16:36.000
and some of them are at or above my own par.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
What shall I do with this lady?

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
She'll get crushed if she stays here, so I guess I got to try to move her.

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
Let's see what's going on here.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Give me a moment.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Come on, sweetness.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Just climb on the leaf. You're okay.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
I want to get you off the path.

16:58.000 --> 17:09.000
That's it. Good girl. Good girl.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
That was a female bumblebee.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Let me be really blunt about one thing.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
That bumblebee is female.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
The gender that can reproduce, let's be clear.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
It's not a joke. It's not a concept.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
It's a physical situation.

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
In any case, I'm a self-educated person.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
Briefly, I attended college for the first time when I was 24.

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
I took a couple of classes, one class in music theory.

17:52.000 --> 17:59.000
The teacher was horrible and hated teaching the class.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
One poetics class, also a really bad teacher.

18:06.000 --> 18:15.000
And one, I took a class English 1A, which was essay writing.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
And the teacher of that class at Santa Rosa Junior College

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
was a man named Richard Speaks,

18:26.000 --> 18:30.000
a relatively brilliant poet in his own right,

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
a fairly radical teacher, very 60s,

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
Zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance kind of guy,

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
regularly flirted with female students, married one of them,

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
who was probably 25 years his junior,

18:50.000 --> 19:02.000
targeted for a lot of attacks on his, what, romantic acumen.

19:02.000 --> 19:10.000
And, you know, occasionally, I love a little criticism at him.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
I wouldn't say that he was a chauvinist.

19:14.000 --> 19:21.000
I think he was fascinated and intrigued by women.

19:21.000 --> 19:32.000
He was an older guy, wrote a motorcycle, rolled his own cigarettes.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
He was a really good teacher.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
He was more like a rock star than an English professor.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.000
And I took a class with him and he tried to convince me to become a teacher

19:45.000 --> 19:53.000
because he said that he saw in me the gift

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
that would grow into something really amazing.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
But at the time, I couldn't understand undertaking a project

20:04.000 --> 20:11.000
that would require five years to complete.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
I wasn't even sure I would live five more years,

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
and this is a problem with not just my generation,

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
but the generation successive to mine,

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
where we find it incredibly difficult to believe in anything resembling a future,

20:27.000 --> 20:33.000
and therefore we can neither plan nor develop one.

20:33.000 --> 20:49.000
This is tragic and appropriate.

20:49.000 --> 20:59.000
And so Speaks asked me to teach with him the next semester

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
and teach the English 1A class.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
We were teaching Barry, what's his name,

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
Crossing Open Ground, Naturalist Author.

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
We were teaching Siddhartha and E.B. White,

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
who by the way, if you've never read any essays by E.B. White,

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
you're missing out on something profoundly.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
I mean, all of them are geniuses.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Also Joan Didion, oh my God.

21:33.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah, she became one of my heroes and profoundly influenced my writing.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
In fact, many of my heroes are women.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
And when I say that, I want to again indicate,

21:46.000 --> 21:54.000
I'm talking about the actually existing gender that reproduces.

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
And if anyone out there wants to have some kind of a fight with me over this,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
go ahead and raise your sword.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.000
I'll meet you on the battleground, we will go together to war.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
I'm not saying there are only two genders.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
I'm saying that biologically, in humans,

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
fundamentally there are two genders.

22:20.000 --> 22:28.000
Ideologically, different situation.

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
And I don't know why I'm feeling so militant about this today,

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
but the idea that someone might attack me

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
and claim that I'm making shit up to believe in a single reproductive gender

22:44.000 --> 22:50.000
and that kind of anything else

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
is a symptom of a catastrophic array

22:57.000 --> 23:06.000
of linguistic and conceptual distortions.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
Ideological distortions.

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
I have no problem with anyone who wants to be seen in a certain way.

23:17.000 --> 23:24.000
I have a huge problem with anyone who wants to police my language over that

23:24.000 --> 23:33.000
or tell me that it's a law, that there are 79 genders.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
Yeah, that's nonsensically ridiculous.

23:37.000 --> 23:45.000
It's also a symptom of a breakdown in an aspect of human social relation and cognition

23:45.000 --> 23:56.000
that I think we should be particularly concerned with and vigilant in.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
Now look, my opinions aren't as fundamentalist as they sound here,

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
but we're not yet having a conversation, right?

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I'm speaking ex-cathedra.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
This is my recording, I'm saying what's on my mind.

24:12.000 --> 24:20.000
I'm totally willing to enter into meaningful, generative conversations about such topics

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
with people who are more, you know, when we are interested in learning together,

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
that's very different from declaration,

24:29.000 --> 24:34.000
but for the moment this isn't a conversation, I'm speaking.

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
So, I agreed to teach the class with Richard and he was like,

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
look dude, I really want you to have the experience of being in front of a classroom and teaching.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.000
I think you're made for this and it'll go really well.

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
So, here's what I'll do.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
We'll call you a reader.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
I'll get you a little bit of pay.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
You can actually do some reading and grading of papers.

25:04.000 --> 25:16.000
But what you'll really be doing is showing up for every class and co-teaching the class with me.

25:16.000 --> 25:24.000
So, I did that thing.

25:25.000 --> 25:32.000
And in fact, not while the class was going, but after the class had stopped,

25:32.000 --> 25:45.000
I ended up dating one of the girls in the class who was quite a bit younger than me.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
It's true, I did.

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
Willow, she was awesome.

25:53.000 --> 26:06.000
So, we had a class of about, you know, we had three classes of approximately 30 people,

26:06.000 --> 26:13.000
ranging in age from 17 to 27, primarily white.

26:13.000 --> 26:23.000
There was one African American young man in that class.

26:23.000 --> 26:34.000
Primarily B to A, students, high school graduates.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
B to A, grade point average, 90 people, Americans.

26:39.000 --> 26:48.000
Middle class, white folks, you know, in a fairly upper middle class city.

26:48.000 --> 26:55.000
I've said this before, but I'm going back to the meme, right, where we used to teach Latin and Greek

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
in high school, and now we're teaching remedial English in college.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Remedial English.

27:02.000 --> 27:09.000
Think about the difference in cognitive sophistication between somebody who can learn and speak Latin and Greek

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
and someone who cannot speak English, their only language.

27:15.000 --> 27:29.000
So, of the 90 students, approximately five of them were capable of forming a written sentence in English.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
Two of them could compose a paragraph reliably.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
They're in junior college, they have graduated high school somehow.

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
They cannot write the single language that they mostly speak.

27:45.000 --> 27:53.000
That was in approximately 1994-5, right?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Who knows?

27:55.000 --> 28:04.000
I shrivel up inside to imagine what the situation is today.

28:04.000 --> 28:18.000
If it was that bad back then, and I had no idea that anything resembling this was even possible.

28:18.000 --> 28:28.000
You know, having been a reader my whole life and being somewhat hyperlexic,

28:28.000 --> 28:36.000
it never occurred to me that the people around me might be incapable of writing English.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
I was staggered.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
I knew there were problems with American education.

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
I had no idea how catastrophically severe they were.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
It was mind-blowing to me.

28:51.000 --> 28:59.000
We didn't have time to teach them how to write sentences or paragraphs because we were trying to teach them how to write essays.

28:59.000 --> 29:07.000
And they were so catastrophically unprepared that, effectively, as teachers, our goal was impossible.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
We managed to do a little bit of it.

29:11.000 --> 29:24.000
So, again, the women who attacked me on Facebook, with all due respect, which isn't much,

29:24.000 --> 29:36.000
they're attacking someone who's sounding an alarm bell about the future of their children, of their families, of their progeny.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
And they're attacking his character? Really?

29:41.000 --> 29:55.000
Like, what he's saying is so right and so important that there's no possibility of his character entering into the conversation at all.

29:55.000 --> 30:12.000
It's as if something in these people is offended by the possibility that they might have to take facts seriously.

30:12.000 --> 30:25.000
Look, there are all kinds of people who I don't agree with or who propose perspectives that I dislike or don't agree with.

30:25.000 --> 30:41.000
If I were then to dismiss the entire uvra of their creative or intellectual output, the poverty would land in me.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
It would land in me, in my heart, in my mind.

30:46.000 --> 31:07.000
The idea that we should cancel or throw away the knowledge, the intelligence, the insight of people with whom we find some reason to feel uncomfortable.

31:07.000 --> 31:23.000
That's the death knell. That's the ringing of the bell of a kind of apocalypse in consciousness, awareness, intelligence, insight.

31:23.000 --> 31:33.000
If you wanted to ruin an entire generation of humans, just get them doing that.

31:33.000 --> 31:41.000
If you let that monster in the door, I can't wait to see what comes after that.

31:41.000 --> 31:55.000
There are certain mistakes that we have to not ever make if the possibilities of our intelligence are going to survive.

31:55.000 --> 32:07.000
One of the women just said, I fiercely disagree with you when I explained what an ad hominem attack is and means.

32:07.000 --> 32:18.000
Unfortunately, for her opinion, what the quote said was a fact.

32:18.000 --> 32:29.000
We are teaching remedial English in college. We have been doing that in the United States for at least 20 years, probably more like 40.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
Which means we are catastrophically failing to educate our children.

32:34.000 --> 32:46.000
And if that's not interesting enough to get their attention, and if the fact that they have a character problem with someone who's saying that is more important.

32:46.000 --> 32:55.000
If you see the problem, like the wrong thing is getting emphasis here, for sure. Not maybe.

32:55.000 --> 33:04.000
I don't know anything about the guy. I don't care what who the guy is. He was a right-wing asshole, good for him.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
What he was saying was true and important.

33:07.000 --> 33:15.000
As Eric Weinstein often says, there are exactly zero restaurants where I walked in the door and signed up for the entire menu.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
Yes, I'll have everything.

33:19.000 --> 33:36.000
And it's similar with spiritual or intellectual or any kind of thinker at all.

33:36.000 --> 33:46.000
All of the brilliant men and women who have been the mothers and fathers of my mind proposed things that were wrong.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Or things that I completely didn't agree with.

33:50.000 --> 34:00.000
Alfred Korzybski, one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century, largely ignored, was insane.

34:00.000 --> 34:25.000
He said that criminals having ostensibly given up the right to participate in the human project should be the subjects,

34:25.000 --> 34:38.000
should have their bodies taken away from them and be the subjects of scientific experimentation for the cause of bettering humanity.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
That is one of the most insane things I've ever heard in my life.

34:43.000 --> 34:50.000
Does that mean I should disabuse myself of the entire subject of nonaristotelian logic?

34:50.000 --> 34:57.000
One of the most important features or forms of human cognition I've ever encountered? Fuck no.

34:57.000 --> 35:03.000
Korzybski was a genius. He was also partly insane.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
And many geniuses are partly insane.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
Many of the geniuses we revere are partly insane.

35:11.000 --> 35:36.000
That doesn't entitle us to dismiss the incredible insight that they suffered and made sacrifices to bring to the experience of being human.

35:36.000 --> 35:48.000
Thankfully, I'm not particularly interested in ideological jousting on Facebook.

35:48.000 --> 35:58.000
But in this one case, I was willing to pull my dagger and point out the ad hominin problem.

35:58.000 --> 36:06.000
And I was shocked to see one of the women who responded, who's a friend, a Facebook friend.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
Sweetness. I love you.

36:11.000 --> 36:15.000
I think it's the scarf.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
Yeah.

36:25.000 --> 36:32.000
When I have my scarf tied to my purse strap, dogs often look at me weird and want to approach me.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
And I think it's because they've never seen that particular feature.

36:36.000 --> 36:42.000
And it's visually. It stands out visually.

36:46.000 --> 37:04.000
So, yeah, one of the women is a friend of mine on Facebook and very intelligently attempted to explain why she also didn't agree with the ad hominem.

37:08.000 --> 37:14.000
I really have a hard time with people who don't agree with the rhetorical fallacies. Do they even understand them?

37:14.000 --> 37:39.000
I mean, these are the figures of speech that are not merely the catalogue of sophistic methods for manipulating human thought, concern, values.

37:39.000 --> 37:50.000
You know, sophistry is a problem when we don't recognize it because we can be manipulated by language.

37:50.000 --> 38:05.000
But the arts of rhetoric form essentially the foundations of the possibility of articulate linguistic communication.

38:05.000 --> 38:12.000
Not only should we not dismiss them, we should be teaching our children these things.

38:12.000 --> 38:24.000
And in, you know, the privileged classes of Europe, primarily the males, yes, it's true, they were taught something called the Trivium.

38:24.000 --> 38:35.000
And I think this was like rhetoric, geometry, and one other thing that I can't remember.

38:35.000 --> 38:43.000
It meant like the three important things. But one of them was rhetoric, and that's not an accident.

38:43.000 --> 38:56.000
People who are not educated in rhetorical sense and the capacity for complex rhetorical speech.

38:56.000 --> 39:12.000
You know, everyone loves Shakespeare and part of the reason they love him is that Shakespeare, whoever that might have been, was a master of the tropes, the rhetorical tropes.

39:13.000 --> 39:21.000
And that's part of what makes his work so profound, presuming that it was a male who wrote that stuff.

39:21.000 --> 39:31.000
And actually, I think there was another feature of Shakespeare that probably largely goes unnoticed, except among scholars, which is that...

39:31.000 --> 39:47.000
Is this a queen cell? From a beehive? I don't know. No, I don't think so. It looks similar, but it isn't.

39:47.000 --> 39:52.000
Okay, let's see what's going on here.

39:52.000 --> 40:09.000
You know, Shakespeare basically was a hyper-system of consciousness extending over a number of brilliant actors, a specific theatrical milieu or array of milieus,

40:09.000 --> 40:36.000
and the intelligences common in the rhetorical and sophistic network of minds in which the audience and the societies participated or which they forged together.

40:36.000 --> 40:49.000
So that's not like a regular human at all. That's someone who's touching what I call the Cognition.

40:49.000 --> 41:00.000
That mind isn't merely human, and it's blatantly obvious that this is so.

41:00.000 --> 41:22.000
It's not dissimilar with other prodigies. People who rise up above the idea of the individual and the scope of an individual's intelligence into the sort of stratosphere of human cognition and concern in general

41:22.000 --> 41:42.000
achieve a kind of superposition over the possibilities of an individual mind. It's blatantly obvious that many poets, Rilke, Rumi, others,

41:42.000 --> 41:52.000
whether or not they were conscious of this, they certainly practiced it.

41:52.000 --> 42:12.000
I would argue that Joan Didion is another example, as is Eva Braun, a philosopher of incredible intellectual breadth and depth.

42:13.000 --> 42:26.000
You know, I was raised by feminists. I'm almost a feminist. I used to go to a national organization of women meetings, not claiming that gives me any special privilege or cachet or gravitas.

42:26.000 --> 42:42.000
But the intellectuality of the 1970s feminists was some of the first actual intelligence in humans that I ever directly encountered.

42:42.000 --> 43:00.000
You better believe I have respect and reverence for that, until and unless that fundamental intelligence for which I have respect and reverence becomes weaponized.

43:00.000 --> 43:16.000
At that point, I don't merely diverge, I oppose.

43:16.000 --> 43:32.000
There is a kind of respect and reverence that we extend to all beings and to all persons.

43:32.000 --> 43:48.000
When I see people, and there is similarly a kind of respect and reverence, that we extend to skillful people.

43:48.000 --> 44:04.000
And when I see something like the opposite of this, when I see people attack an entire gender, which is what is going on right now with the bear meme, effectively.

44:04.000 --> 44:14.000
And I'd like to decompose that a bit, but I'll hold off on that so that I can stay on topic for a minute.

44:14.000 --> 44:40.000
When I see a group, when I see ideological, the rise of sort of ideological, weaponized ideological invective, character assault, the dehumanization of males.

44:40.000 --> 45:08.000
And there's no justification for that. None. Historically, we have lived under the ages of various modes of patriarchy. Bad humans are bad humans, regardless of their gender, and the fact that there are bad males does not pervade over the entire gender.

45:08.000 --> 45:30.000
The fact that there are bad people doesn't pervade over entire cohorts either. This urge to generalize wrongdoing for the sake of indictment is a disease that leads to catastrophic sequelae that none of us want.

45:31.000 --> 45:59.000
I mean, maybe some of us do want it. I don't know. Maybe there are people who actually want a devastating, unlivable future forged by the appearance of virtue under the flag of virtue above a complex array of weapons that obliterate intelligence, insight, community, family, tradition.

45:59.000 --> 46:25.000
All these things. I guess I'm kind of ranting a little bit, but I find a lot of this upsetting. At the point when I began to become an adolescent, I was no longer allowed to attend the now meetings, and I began to realize that the feminists were anti-male.

46:25.000 --> 46:47.000
Back then, I didn't really understand, though my mother had tried to explain to me that some of the women in the group were lesbians. I didn't really understand what that meant. Some of them didn't seem particularly feminine to me.

46:47.000 --> 47:13.000
And these days, one's not even supposed to say words like that. As if one's not supposed to suppose that there is a relatively intrinsic, not merely scripted aspect to the gender interiority and expression of human beings.

47:13.000 --> 47:32.000
And while I will agree that some degree of that is not wrong, it's not an entirely wrong idea. You can't throw the whole idea out the window just because there's gender scripting.

47:33.000 --> 47:50.000
And this is a very complex topic, which I'm addressing rather cursorily at the moment. And for that, I apologize, but it's not really my goal to get into the politics of gender here.

47:50.000 --> 48:14.000
Rather, I'm trying to talk about a situation where what we might think of as left-wing intellectuals are attacking foundational principles that underlie the possibility of intellectual discourse, perception, perspective, and so forth.

48:14.000 --> 48:32.000
Anyone is welcome to think that the solidity of concrete isn't a fact. It's a patriarchal projection. Well, you know, trip and fall and you're going to find out that there's a fact right underneath you.

48:32.000 --> 48:52.000
So if you think there are no facts or the facts are just a construct, you're wrong. You're just going to be wrong. In fact, if you think there are no facts, let's suppose someone just says something like, well, you know, people just make up facts to manipulate other people.

48:52.000 --> 49:13.000
Okay, that does occasionally occur. That's not not happening. But that doesn't we have the same problem of the generalization of a portion of a curve to the entire curve. If you come and tell me there's really no such thing as facts, well, then what you've just undermined your own statement.

49:14.000 --> 49:33.000
Because what you are saying, in effect, is that it is a fact that there are no facts. You see the problem here? Truth in language and concept is real. It's not real the same way physical reality is real.

49:33.000 --> 49:57.000
It's conceptually real, it's linguistically real, and it's cognitively real. And it can also be relationally real. So there are actual facts. You know, my friend Dr. Kay was talking to me last night and helping me to disambiguate my illness and figure out whether it was time for me to go to the emergency room or not.

49:58.000 --> 50:10.000
And quite frankly, if there was an emergency room for human intelligence, our civil, our culture should go directly there right now. Because this shit is failing.

50:11.000 --> 50:35.000
And part of the problem is that America is, as I've said before, we're a petri dish for every kind of conceptual and linguistic PSYOP imaginable. We're just getting PSYOP injections a thousand times per minute from 5,000 different bad actors.

50:36.000 --> 50:48.000
I can't wait to see how our children are going to fare in a situation like that. We've got to create some kind of immunity for each other against that. And perhaps that's part of what I'm trying to do here.

50:49.000 --> 51:08.000
And maybe even to bolster my own immunity to some degree, because I have to try to understand how to cope with situations where people tell me, you know, ad hominem attacks are things we should do, right? The ad hominem perspective, that's the right one.

51:08.000 --> 51:20.000
You know, enacting rhetorical fallacies is intelligence. That's visionary. That's the way of the future.

51:39.000 --> 52:05.000
It was so strange to see the articulate, the very articulate woman objecting. And her argument was, I wish I could just state it, maybe I could go find it and say it.

52:06.000 --> 52:16.000
What I'll probably try to do is later I'll put it in the comments just so that I don't have to depart right now from the recording.

52:20.000 --> 52:28.000
Also, it would take me a bit, and I don't want to lose my train of thought, even if my train of thought is not particularly coherent at the moment.

52:35.000 --> 52:59.000
So what was my friend Dr. K saying? He was saying that he's reading a book with an argument between a neuroscientist and a mathematician, and the neuroscientist is trying to claim that mathematics has no privileged status among the languages.

53:06.000 --> 53:16.000
One of my Raven friends is here with me. He's like a foot from me giving him peanut, which they really like.

53:16.000 --> 53:36.000
Now, this has been an ongoing conversation between Dr. K and I, although mostly we're on the same page.

53:37.000 --> 53:46.000
So Dr. K is a vicious opponent of Wittgenstein and Heidegger, also of Jung.

53:46.000 --> 53:52.000
Dr. K claims that Jung was a Nazi, and we shouldn't listen to him.

53:52.000 --> 54:04.000
And by the way, Dr. K is committing the ad hominem fallacy there, because Heidegger was a Nazi and Jung was a Nazi.

54:04.000 --> 54:11.000
We should largely dismiss them, which of course I do not agree with.

54:12.000 --> 54:24.000
If Hitler himself had said intelligent things, I would take them up and not reject them simply because they came out of the mouth of a maniacal, methodic tyrant.

54:24.000 --> 54:32.000
I don't care about the character when it comes to intelligence and insight. I don't care.

54:33.000 --> 54:39.000
Consider the source. Well, if it's food, maybe. If it's intelligence, not so much.

54:39.000 --> 54:51.000
I suppose I could invert my perspective and forge an argument where I'd call it like the poisoned pool argument.

54:51.000 --> 54:59.000
You don't want fish from a poisoned pool, so you don't want intelligence from minds that are bad or evil.

54:59.000 --> 55:04.000
Okay, yeah, I could propose and pursue such a line.

55:04.000 --> 55:15.000
I'm disinclined to at the moment, but just be aware that I'm not an ideologue, and I'm happy to entertain perspectives that oppose my own.

55:15.000 --> 55:25.000
And if I weren't, I would be catastrophically incapable of learning.

55:25.000 --> 55:30.000
A friend of mine the other day on Facebook, a very close friend, said,

55:30.000 --> 55:46.000
when was the last time you had a conversation with someone who disagreed with you?

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
When was the last time you entertained the perspective of someone with whom you disagreed, something like this?

55:52.000 --> 56:00.000
And for me, the last time was usually today, maybe yesterday.

56:00.000 --> 56:20.000
I regularly, there's an old euphemism about being able to entertain perspectives alien to your own concern, belief, habit, and so forth.

56:20.000 --> 56:37.000
And how crucial that is to philosophical discovery and understanding and awareness and intelligence, and I agree.

56:37.000 --> 56:45.000
But let's start out with an agreement that we're here to see better together, to help each other see better together.

56:45.000 --> 56:54.000
If we begin with that agreement, and that's our motivation and our goal, we're in pretty good shape, right?

56:54.000 --> 57:03.000
We're unlikely to get trapped or stuck in the weeds of our own bias, habit, et cetera.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
And those weeds are thick and sticky.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I don't want to get stuck in those weeds.

57:08.000 --> 57:14.000
I don't trust my own bias, but that doesn't mean I don't trust anything I think either.

57:14.000 --> 57:35.000
Some of my biases have crucially important foundations that I'm disinclined to dispose of on a whim.

57:35.000 --> 57:50.000
On the other hand, my pet biases often are very blinding, but I need somebody intelligent enough to show me how the structure of my thought is failing me.

57:50.000 --> 57:57.000
And I have a great wingman, Ms. R.

57:57.000 --> 58:14.000
Yeah, that wingman really helps me because Ms. R's mind is very different from mine and tends toward uncollapse, toward specificity,

58:14.000 --> 58:23.000
whereas even though I can do both, I tend to go toward specificity.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
And I'm very nervous about generalizations, right?

58:26.000 --> 58:41.000
Especially sloppy generalizations where malfeasance or malignance is generalized to an entire clade, as is happening with the bare meme.

58:41.000 --> 58:52.000
Which I am interested in dissecting, but probably won't do here.

58:52.000 --> 59:04.000
You know, I recall a not entirely dissimilar meme that I felt was valuable.

59:04.000 --> 59:16.000
It's important that we hear the voices of women and that we hear the concerns of women.

59:16.000 --> 59:31.000
Ms. R was telling me that for portions of her life,

59:31.000 --> 59:39.000
she felt completely unsafe being around people at all.

59:39.000 --> 59:54.000
And this constant sense of vulnerability and danger probably had a variety of anchors,

59:54.000 --> 01:00:13.000
but the primary one is blatantly obvious and has a lot to do with the danger of being a woman in a world dominated by men.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And even us males know something of what that's like because most of us have been subject to the viciousness of a man or a group of males,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:44.000
especially in our childhood, who bullied, beat, raped, denigrated, spat on, kicked us.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Whereas, you know, how many of us were subject to gang violence from females?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Not none, but nearly none.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
In terms of boys anyway.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000
So look, I get it. I remember this meme where somebody asked women what they would do if there were...

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:16.000
How would it affect their life if there were a curfew for males, like a 6pm curfew or something?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.000
They said things like, I'd wear a dress, you know, or I'd go for a walk.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.000
In other words, I'd feel okay doing ordinary human things.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And I'd feel safe doing ordinary human things.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And I think that's real. I absolutely acknowledge that.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:02:06.000
We forget, unless we hear very directly, unless there's a context in which women can speak openly about their experience.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:23.000
And what it feels like, we won't know, and our suppositions won't be sufficient.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
So I absolutely support that.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:35.000
But the generalization...

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:55.000
That happens where the character of my gender is disposed of or denigrated.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
That is...

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000
How the hell is that?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:25.000
That's like hate speech. That's genderist invective.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:32.000
The fact that men are more dangerous than women, probably true generally speaking, depends on the situation.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Not always true.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
There are many men who will lay down their lives for a woman they don't even know.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Right now, right? Instantly.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:52.000
So the idea that, you know, men are just bad...

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I'm not a friend to that idea.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
On the other hand, again, I do support...

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
You know, let me put it this way.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Let's start a conversation where we mutually support each other and create a context where women are safe and free and healthy and happy in all our social contexts and beyond.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Let's do that. Rather than just focusing on what's bad, wrong, and terrible about men, true though that may sometimes be.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:52.000
The wise move is to educate our children and each other and create a social and a relational context in which misbehavior is immediately intervened in.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I'm going to pause here for a minute because there's something going on in the gardens that I do not entirely understand and I'm going to have to walk through it, so...

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I'll be back.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
You know, it's the same.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.000
The money we spend on war doesn't help us.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:34.000
The resources we spend on indictment and combat are far better spent on establishing a relational context and envelope in which we become better humans together.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
We become better beings together. We become better spirits together for each other.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And we need to be really cautious, especially today, about divisive narratives.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:06.000
And I'm very concerned because I can see a kind of storm of little psyopsis of divisive narratives bubbling up in American anti-culture.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I can't speak for how it is elsewhere, but that shit is pathologically hypercontagious and extremely dangerous.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It breeds factionation and it breeds suspicion and once you're suspicious, half your assets are missing.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:55.000
This is the problem with producing dialectics of indictment.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And it hurts people who... it makes victims out of innocence.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:10.000
None of us chose... well, I don't know, that's actually true.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:18.000
It's not clear that we chose our incarnate genders.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:36.000
And, you know, I've spent much of my life very concerned about how I am seen as a man in the world by women.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:49.000
So much so that it's been nearly impossible for me to approach women for whom I had affection.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Because I'm so terrified of being seen as a bad person.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And, you know, one could argue, oh, you know, that's actually a shadow of something that's a lie.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
You actually are a bad person secretly and that's why you're so scared.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Okay, great, I understand the psychological argument.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I don't really think that's most of what's going on if it's any of what's going on.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000
It is profoundly challenging.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.000
And I respect and want to hear from women about these challenges that they experience and face.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:40.000
But it's also profoundly challenging to be a man and it's even more challenging to be a sensitive man.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Much more challenging.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:58.000
So why can't we create a context and a conversation in which we can supportively listen to and understand each other without indicting,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:13.000
without adding to a problem that's already blatantly obvious.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000
And let's be really clear, much of this problem isn't a problem of men versus women.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It's a problem of developmental contexts that are fundamentally toxic, media that is fundamentally toxic,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:40.000
the catastrophic miseducation of our children and each other by media.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
This really comes back to something resembling education.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.000
What is the developmental milieu in which we and our children develop?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
That's where the problem is.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:02.000
It's not men are bad or women are helpless, which of course was never true.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Though granted the disproportionate physical force that men can usually table in comparison to women does create a problem in any civilization

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:42.000
where the personhood, integrity and spirit of the women isn't revered, isn't respected, or women are seen as objects.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
In case it isn't obvious, men are objectified too.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
This is a different kind of objectification.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000
We're objectified as combatants, warriors, things like this.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Now I'm not sure that the terrain over which I've wandered today is all that valuable.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I'm not even sure if I'll publish this recording, though I probably will.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I'm not particularly proud of it because in a way it's a little bit self-conflicted.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I've been speaking against the idea of a mind that indicts.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I can see the irony here in that I am inditing a mind that indicts.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I can jump one level up and see the problem.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I will acknowledge that and we'll see if I decide to publish this or not.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:58.000
It's the first recording I've made in quite a while and I've been very under the weather for a couple days.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I'm not sure how sharp I am, but we'll see what happens.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
If I do publish this, I thank you for those of you who joined me.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I appreciate your support, interest, enthusiasm, and hope that we will continue to learn and grow together.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.000
May your way be beautiful and your life be joyful.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Bye-bye for now.
