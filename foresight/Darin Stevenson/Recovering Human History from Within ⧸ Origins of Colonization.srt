00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello everybody. Welcome.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm very grateful to all of you who pay attention to my posts.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And especially those of you who like or share them.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And particularly my patrons.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Few though they are.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You make a lot of light in my life and

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
help me to have the freedom to keep doing

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
this work. This joyful creativity.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This explorations.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So I'm really grateful.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Particularly to my longtime supporter H.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And my new supporter C.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And you know if you have a little

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
something that you can spare each month.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One, two bucks. It's fine.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Whatever you've got.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That will help me keep producing this content.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Keeping it real.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
On the internet.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Circa 2024.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So for this year is that 2024 isn't

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
a year. The last year we will ever have

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
as human beings around here for the foreseeable future

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
was 2023.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And this dumpster fire of insanity that we are presently

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
experiencing is actually not

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
a year at all. In fact

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you know your mileage may vary.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm pretty sure that things aren't things anymore.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All that stuff we used to think we knew what that was or what was going on

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
or what would happen next or who was

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
who or all of that knowledge thing and knowing stuff.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's all gone.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Mushroom cloud of over the

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
horizon of identity.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And in some ways that's wonderful.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because a lot of the whatness

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and the isness and all that

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
was broken. But in other ways

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
we don't have any kind of

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
ship that we can ride in together because we really never forged a

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
we in the first place except on very small

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
scales.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And we didn't go around building ships

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and you know by that I just mean

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
a trustworthy

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
vehicle

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
of purposeive

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
orientation together.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Almost all of the

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
potentials of our communal

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
relationships and behavior

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
has been

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
thoroughly

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
recursively recolonized

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
by the

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
thrisplike dead inside infinitely

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
hungry processes

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that establish themselves

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
in the human cognisium, the network of human minds.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
If we don't do

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the necessary bonding

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If we don't do the necessary engineering

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
of our relationships

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
with history, the sky, nature, the living places

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the plants, animals and insects, the ancestors

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
are dreaming.

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And what I will loosely refer to is the angels

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the non-human intelligences

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the accessible non-human

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
intelligences above the human cognisium.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That have been lost to us

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
lost to our direct

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
contact and experience for so long

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
even though most of us probably

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
were born

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
with these relationships intact

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and they may have stayed intact briefly during our

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
earliest phases of our human

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
incarnation, childhood, inconsistency and stuff.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But that stuff gets

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
well, what does it get?

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It rarely survives

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the processes of in-languaging and in-culturation

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
which our parents and peers

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
impose on us believing that to be

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
some wonderful

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
inheritance.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And the problem there is that it could be.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If it were rich and veritable

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
and ancient and true

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
the processes of in-languaging and in-culturation would not

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
be so violent

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
so dissociative

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
malignly dissociative

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
so isolating, so terrifying

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
so confusing

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
but unfortunately

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
as moderns

100
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
with very few exceptions I mean the world

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
let's be clear about something when I make very general statements about the

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
humans I'm making a bad mistake

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and it's one that I've pointed out many times. I am

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
making a mistake I would call generalizing

105
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the worst common denominator over the manifold.

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So the manifold is all the different living places and humans

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
presently alive on earth

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and the generalization is that they're all modern.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well a lot of them aren't and

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
each of the cohorts we might

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
explore or contact

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
their actual relationship with rather than just thinking about them

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and this is the problem with abstract thought

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
we can dissociatively pretend to be in relationships we don't have

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and then from there

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
we can evaluate the resulting abstractions

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and this obliterates our intelligence

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it's like a snuff film of the possibilities of

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
or relating with

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the children

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
little children are painting and their paintings are amazing

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
so beautiful and colorful

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and see in those little children

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
all of this worst common denominator stuff is not yet

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
established. They are still

126
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
alive inside

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and there are many exceptions

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
beautiful exceptions

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
to this worst common denominator

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
evaluative behavior

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
misbehavior

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
that I'm concerned about

133
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and we should celebrate

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and recognize the exceptions

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
yes the bell curve, yes the averages

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and yes they're

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
devastating because

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
their defection, the capacity to

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
defect from our humanity

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
to colonize and recolonize

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
to devastate

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
to

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm looking for a neologism here

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
what it means to cause

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
to viciously impose forgetting

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to amnese

147
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
it's funny

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
the terrible weapons

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
of colonization

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and this word gets overused

151
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
these days for all kinds of things

152
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
but what I'm talking about is when

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
the possibility of human

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
of coherent human relation, intelligence

155
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
conservation of ancestral

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
land, places, living places

157
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
intimate symbiosis

158
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
of humans with the earth

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and the waters and the sky

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
which is rarely

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
approaches perfection

162
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and these places

163
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
actually became coherent and beautiful

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and was sustained over time

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and colonization is sort of

166
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I remember

167
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
a bad cartoon

168
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
maybe from the early 80s called Godzilla meets Bambi

169
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and then suddenly boom there's a footprint

170
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and Bambi's smushed in the bottom of that footprint

171
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
and that's

172
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
that's a cartoonish

173
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
image

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
but the forces of

175
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
colonization rose

176
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
in peoples

177
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and cohorts in societies and nations

178
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that were

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
self-colonizing

180
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and this is part of the problem that is overlooked

181
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
when we blame

182
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
history

183
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
on bad people

184
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and particularly when we take the convenient

185
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
exit door and think

186
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
oh yeah it's patriarchy

187
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
it's those males

188
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
who are dominating things

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
slapping them with their generative organ

190
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
crushing them

191
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and while that's not untrue

192
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
the secret

193
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
origins of these problems are

194
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
preserved against our discovery

195
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
of our convenient

196
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
indictments

197
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
because if we want to understand how it might be possible

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
for us in our time and our children's time

199
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
to establish actually coherent

200
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
intelligent human societies worthy of survival

201
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
never mind capable of self-sustainment

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but virtuously beautiful

203
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
in spirit and purpose and behavior

204
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
then we're going to need a much better array of toys

205
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
array of perspectival toys with which to examine

206
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
what led to the problems we face today

207
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and you know the common

208
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
common

209
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
the common figurines

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
that we like to

211
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
that are often selected for

212
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
admonition and

213
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
enlightenment and

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
elevation in our awareness

215
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to the status of culprits

216
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
our

217
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
monotheism

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
patriarchy

219
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
commerce

220
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
commodity commerce

221
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
class

222
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
hierarchical class dichotomies

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
the

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the one percent

225
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
the wealthy

226
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
the kings and queens particularly

227
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
in various phases of the development of Europe

228
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and the Middle East

229
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't know

230
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't know

231
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
you know personally I'm not well educated enough

232
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
historically to understand

233
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
the real birthplaces of

234
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
the colonizing

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
countries

236
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I love the cadences of

237
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
German it's wonderful to hear people enthusiastically speaking German

238
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
as they walk past me

239
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and you know we might think oh what synchronicity

240
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
yeah go ahead think what you like

241
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
but try to understand that what I'm saying is

242
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
we don't have the formula yet

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
that stuff we're exchanging around

244
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
like a new kind of poison

245
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
in the atmosphere of what we have ironically called social

246
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
justice

247
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
is not the elixir

248
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
nor is it the intoxicant that will give us insight

249
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
if you want insight

250
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
we're going to have to authentically go back

251
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
not merely into the history of our species

252
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
but very carefully into the history of our own lives

253
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
your life my life our childhood

254
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
the transitions

255
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
the phases of colonization

256
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
that we ourselves underwent as little children

257
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
that our parents underwent

258
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
that our grandparents underwent because

259
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I

260
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I would like you to

261
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
suspect with me

262
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
that not only

263
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
is the key to the cage hidden

264
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
you know the keys to the cages

265
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
not only is it hidden in our

266
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
in the arc of our developmental experience individually and collectively

267
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
uniquely keys in each one of us

268
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
we've been secreted

269
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
obscured occulted

270
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
but something even stranger

271
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
is real and accessible to us

272
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
which is that through a process

273
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that resembles something we don't have a good word for

274
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and I'm disinclined to forge

275
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
a convenient neologism here

276
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
because I want a really good one

277
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
so I'll describe instead of label

278
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
in the same way that

279
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
geologists look at the

280
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
strata the layers

281
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
in places where they have been laid bare to

282
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
access on the land

283
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
the only really good example

284
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I have at hand easily accessible is the Grand Canyon

285
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
a place where a furrow has been dug

286
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
by a river into

287
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
the physical body of geologic time

288
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and so the strata

289
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
are laid bare and I guess the other

290
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
more destructive and I think

291
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
confusing way to try to get at this information

292
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
or these recordings if you will these memories

293
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
is with core samples

294
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
carefully

295
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
drill a tube

296
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
of earth and stone and ice and stuff

297
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
in a sequence going down

298
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and then you can lay them out in a linear fashion

299
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and examine the record but what I'm trying to say

300
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
what I'm implying here is that

301
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and similarly

302
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
with the origin of life

303
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
in the branch of sciences where

304
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
where we look in the various strata for

305
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'd love to know the etymology

306
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
of this word right now

307
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
we look for evidence of the previously existing

308
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
phases of life and development

309
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
that we imagine took place linearly

310
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
because we are

311
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
addicted to

312
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
one thing mind we are addicted to linear perspectives

313
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
we don't have to be we can break out of that one of the things we need to

314
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
we need the experience of being liberated from

315
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
so there are these strata

316
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
in the stone in the earth

317
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that are like memorial

318
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
dreaming traces in a way

319
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and what I'm suggesting is that in each one of us

320
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
and in our cohorts in our cultures

321
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
in our ethnicities in our ancestors in our progeny

322
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
there's a layered

323
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
richness of interiority that actually contains

324
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
the entire history of our species

325
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
there's a way of doing

326
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
a kind of archaeology

327
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
that isn't

328
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
merely objective

329
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
isn't merely empirical

330
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
that is partly magical

331
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
or partly transcendental

332
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and when you hear stories for example

333
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
of

334
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
either accidental enlightenment

335
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
where you have some young child who at six just starts

336
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
sitting still and won't move and has to be fed

337
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and some good who comes and says

338
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
this one has gone beyond and when you hear stories of intentional enlightenment

339
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
where quote unquote right where someone

340
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
very committed to the meditation path

341
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
mostly you will hear similar stories

342
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
where in fact what I'm speaking about

343
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
surfaces in consciousness

344
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
thus we hear the Buddha saying

345
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
something I don't know what the Buddha actually said

346
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
but we hear stories that the Buddha said

347
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I have been billions of lives

348
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I have been all of the beings in a way

349
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
this might be translated as

350
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
past lives

351
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I strongly suspect that the actual situation

352
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
is much weirder than past lives

353
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
and is not

354
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
linear in the ways we would imagine

355
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
so that for example

356
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
imagine

357
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
just as an example that you are

358
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
alive locally to your consciousness right now

359
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
but

360
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
like a constellation

361
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
in the sky imagine for example

362
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
the big dipper as seen from earth

363
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
those stars

364
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
the shape of the big dipper

365
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
is seen

366
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
from a point in space

367
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
now I would like to know

368
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
the names of those stars

369
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and how distant in space time they are from each other

370
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
because let's be clear if you saw it from another angle outside of it

371
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
it would not form a dipper

372
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
some of the stars might be invisible

373
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
or there might be other stars that were visible

374
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
in the arrangement

375
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
the illusion

376
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
it's not actually an illusion is it

377
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
the figuration of the big dipper

378
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
is we experience it because of

379
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
where we are looking from in time space

380
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and so to us it's a little bit as if

381
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
there's a dot to dot drawing

382
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
there which over time has

383
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
undergone semantic degradation

384
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
so that we think of it as a ladle cup

385
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
because I promise you

386
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
long ago they were not thinking that's a ladle cup

387
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
they probably didn't think that

388
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
what was seen in the sky

389
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
resembled objects

390
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
appliances or tools

391
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
that would be a very unlikely

392
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
derivation I think

393
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
so we should take that seriously the unlikeliness of such a derivation

394
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I mean hilariously a couple nights ago I woke up from

395
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
dreaming to give you a sort of related example

396
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
and I don't really know what was going on

397
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and it was sort of hilarious

398
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
but not merely funny

399
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I got the impression

400
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
of my refrigerator

401
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I hopefully I'll come back to this later because I want to stay on point here but

402
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I got the impression of my refrigerator it's a white refrigerator

403
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
vinyl surfaced

404
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
many refrigerators and it was

405
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
deified it was like this

406
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
angelic choirs and rays of divine light

407
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
coming off the refrigerator

408
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
which is a very ridiculous seeming to my rational mind anyway

409
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
completely ridiculous and even to my

410
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
the Luddite in me that abhors machines

411
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
it doesn't merely abhore machines

412
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I don't merely abhore them I recognize that

413
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
coupled with the insensate

414
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
war and prison hearing

415
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
monsters that have captured and

416
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
colonized and are recolonizing our existing societies

417
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and nations and populations and so forth those things are

418
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
death sign

419
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
those are the flags of a coming apocalypse and not just

420
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
an ever coming apocalypse right an apocalypse is happening now has been happening

421
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
for a good depending on how you want to count it

422
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
thousand years but much more so in the past 500

423
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and much more so in the past one and so forth

424
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
a sort of title a tide a heartbeat of doom

425
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
where the humans just are ripping the foundations

426
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
of their own minds to shreds in terms of

427
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
the origins of the possibility of intelligence and

428
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
consciousness in the anciently conserved ecologies of the

429
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
planet which are the most precious thing around here

430
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
not us our origins the womb this planetary

431
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
womb that ever renews itself

432
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and hopefully doesn't really need to be

433
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
penetrated in order to be fertilized right light

434
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
the divine virginal penetration

435
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
of light sunlight and time spaces

436
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
the water of time space penetrated by sunlight

437
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
coupled with the physical hypostasis of these

438
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
primordial more than merely beings

439
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
generates life here

440
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and it is truly holy but as I was saying those stars in the

441
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
sky they are not

442
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
coherently related to one another

443
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
except by the angle of our perspective they don't

444
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
belong to some family of local

445
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
anatomy

446
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
local stellar anatomy I don't think I suspect they're wildly

447
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
distant from each other and would be seen completely

448
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
differently from another distant angle

449
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
say if we drew a circle around them

450
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
if we circled actually if we made a sphere

451
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
around the big dipper at the same distance

452
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
from which our perspective arises

453
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
we made a sphere then we just traveled to different perspectives on that sphere

454
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
very different things would emerge to our perspective and what I'm trying to say

455
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
is that imagine that although your sort of spirit

456
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
or soul however you want to think about it

457
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
and there's much better ways to think about it than a spirit or soul

458
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
your

459
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
your the localization that you think of as yourself

460
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is probably similar to that big dipper

461
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
imagine that there are many many

462
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
beings we could start with a small number to make it easy

463
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
there's 12 just for kicks

464
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and a couple of those beings are living in the Pleistus

465
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
the earliest time of the humans

466
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and not all those beings are human but we're going to pretend they are for a minute

467
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and they're living in all different times

468
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
and places of the earth

469
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
we're going to keep them on earth for the moment though that's not actually necessary either

470
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
so there's beings all throughout

471
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
the historical phases of the humans

472
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and let's say half of them are before you and half of them are after you

473
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
so six before you and then you in the middle that you're the 13th one so to speak

474
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and then there's six after you in the future

475
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and those beings are all simultaneously existing

476
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
the Eunus, the me, the meanness, Darren, hopefully not the meanness

477
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
but the meanness

478
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
you perceive

479
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
yourself as localized in this

480
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
temporal spatial manifold of relationships

481
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
when actually you're a constellation of beings

482
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
with a nucleus much like

483
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
what we think of as the solar system

484
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
and sometimes you're the sun

485
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
in that family

486
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
sometimes you're

487
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Saturn, it's funny we have this system where we

488
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
establish your relationship between each of the planets and everyone thinks oh that's a bunch of hokey

489
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
well those people who think that are very confused but also the people

490
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
who reify the system

491
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
of astrology are just as confused

492
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
because it's neither false nor fact

493
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
both of those extremes lose

494
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
the fragrance of insight

495
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
that is accessible to us as human beings

496
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
once things become explicit and we start trying to say what is a fact

497
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
and unless we're in a very limited

498
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
sort of cone of purpose of orientation

499
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and behavior there are

500
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
applicable there's an applicable scope

501
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
to what we think of as empiricism but let's be really clear

502
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
what the moderns mostly do with empiricism is kill

503
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I use that to kill stuff now remember my friend

504
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Fernanda

505
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
from Brazil

506
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
she wanted to become a marine biologist until she discovered that what that meant was collecting

507
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
living creatures from the sea and killing them

508
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
taking them apart, studying the bits

509
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
of course there are other ways to do it but the classes that she was taking

510
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
she was magically in love with the sea creatures

511
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
as I am

512
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
until she discovered what empiricism is about

513
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and what we do with it which is really the wrong thing

514
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
and you can see again here the terrifying

515
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
jagged pointy fingerprint of colonization

516
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
this is what I mean by colonization I don't mean

517
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
necessarily bad people mostly men

518
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
are the execution body of colonization because

519
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
historically primarily at least in the large

520
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
cohorts men were the

521
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
disposable soldier class

522
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and there's so much, wow there's so much here

523
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
to look at

524
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
so yeah men were the inaction body

525
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and

526
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
sometimes men, often perhaps men

527
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
were the

528
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
what, the infected

529
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
disassociated

530
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
orienteering

531
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
measureers, rulers

532
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
measures of value

533
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
measures of

534
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
history and futurity

535
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and what will we make

536
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
of this potential of our lives and moment

537
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
of our cooperative potential

538
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
one of my new friends

539
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Roger T. who I'm not sure how to pronounce his last name is why I'm not

540
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
doing it

541
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
who has this brilliant

542
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
sort of matrilineally communicated from his

543
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
wife method of alignment

544
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
producing alignment in human cohorts particularly in business but not

545
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
not necessarily merely in business

546
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
apex cooperators

547
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
it's a brilliant phrase, I'm not sure if he coined that phrase

548
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
or who coined it

549
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
but so yeah it looks like it was men and I'm not denying that there's a problem

550
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
with

551
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I'm gonna make a joke here

552
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
with having the external three part flower downstairs

553
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
historically

554
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
but this measuring and what

555
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
the problem is that the males who perpetrated

556
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
and executed

557
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
iterations of recursive colonization

558
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
were first themselves colonized

559
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
this is the actual, this is the thing we need to see

560
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and we know, we have some

561
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
we, I don't even know who I mean by we, let's just say that

562
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
culturally and sociologically we are, we have become aware as

563
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
moderns that

564
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
many of the people

565
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
who perpetrate violence

566
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and subjugation

567
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and murder and rape

568
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
and violation

569
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
were themselves subjected

570
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
to these

571
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
deprivations and impoverishments and terrors

572
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
in their developmental

573
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
arcs

574
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
and it's not clear

575
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
to me anyway

576
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
that in a coherent

577
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
or small scale

578
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
coherent human family,

579
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
tribe, culture

580
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
it's probably extremely uncommon

581
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
that these behaviors emerge

582
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and some will say things like, well we've seen behavior like this in primates

583
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
okay

584
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
but did you see primates before humans invaded the jungle

585
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and before

586
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
what is the human effect on the context in which the primates are developing

587
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
what is the effect

588
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
of the humans on, of the human behavior in the world

589
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
on the primate population

590
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
these features of that which exists are connected

591
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
they're not merely

592
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
we would ordinarily think rationally

593
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
that if the monkeys are in a jungle

594
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
in Africa where there are no humans, presuming there was such a jungle

595
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
that humans are somewhere else doing things like making war and going insane together

596
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
killing up everything that moves and most of what doesn't

597
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
it wouldn't affect the primates until

598
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and unless the humans showed up in the jungle

599
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
because we presume that there's no way to communicate

600
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
the malignancy

601
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
from the humans to the primates unless they're proximal

602
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
because there's always a dimension

603
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
of the context where everything's proximal

604
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
the planet is a unified

605
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
manifold of historical

606
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
relational, futorial

607
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
what

608
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
transmissions, communication

609
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
so whenever I hear people saying

610
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
oh it's just natural for humans to be, I don't believe it

611
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I don't believe that at all

612
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
it's conceivable

613
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
but what it looks more like to me is an infection most of the time

614
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
and maybe I prefer to see it this way, maybe I'm biased

615
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Graeber and his writing companion in the dawn of everything

616
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
push back against the idea that humans

617
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
have been

618
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
catastrophically misbehaving toward each other

619
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
in life in general for thousands of years and it's the law of the

620
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
land and so forth, that myth needs to come down

621
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I just don't trust it at all

622
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
but what I'm trying to get at is that the origins of the problems we face

623
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
not in the men, it's not merely patriarchy

624
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and what has happened that's terrifying is that

625
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
the features

626
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
of our humanity

627
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
that are vulnerable to colonization

628
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
have been being colonized by something

629
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and we can think of this something in a variety of different ways

630
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
for eons

631
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and these colonizing

632
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
contagions

633
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
these colonizing pathological processes

634
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
oh wow here's the dog man

635
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
with so many dogs and yet he can keep them

636
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
all coherent

637
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
so

638
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
huh

639
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:48,000
an

640
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
huh

641
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:02,360
a chat with him at some point. Because he's really profoundly skillful at managing a large

642
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:18,560
group of unrelated dogs. Nearly certain those dogs don't come from one family, one household.

643
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:26,040
So we have to look carefully into the history, the histories, and not just the written histories,

644
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:37,680
the histories that are submerged within us. It's my direct experience that not just the

645
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,880
history of life on earth and not just the history of the humans, but the history of

646
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:49,840
what we think of as the universe and the history of its origins, the origin places and origin beings

647
00:45:49,840 --> 00:46:02,200
is encoded in the strata of our being. And this is recoverable to us when so ever and to whatever

648
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:13,200
degree we may agree to recover it, to seek it, to quest for it, to inquire as Amen Hillman,

649
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:32,160
the half mad prophet, tells us he in his linguistic neuromorphosis tells us that the ancient language

650
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:47,240
is, are actually doorways into other, into lost potentials of our humanity. And for the moment,

651
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:54,480
at least, I'm not a big fan, what does that even mean? I have a large fan in my hand and I keep

652
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:15,080
waiting it. No, I find his playful and hilarious and terrifying, manic, manistic, prophetic, genius,

653
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:26,040
inspiring and nourishing and propelling. But one of the things he says is that, and I may have this

654
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:35,200
wrong, but he's saying something like the original idea that becomes in our time the word history,

655
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:53,440
actually comes from bringing a question to the probably adolescent symbols at the oracle places

656
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:04,000
in the ancient world. And he's talking specifically about places in Europe and what we think of now

657
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:16,520
maybe as the Middle East and Greece and so forth. Greece primarily, but also it's surrounding like

658
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:24,880
the Empire, I guess. I don't know where all the symbols were. I don't know where we have records

659
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,080
of them being, but what he was saying is that this idea of history, it's not stories about what

660
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:42,960
happened, it's to become pregnant with the urgency of a question and pursue that question beyond

661
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:56,800
our common inclinations to answer it, to declare some, oh, here's what happened. No, no. It's to become

662
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:05,120
the re-happening, the living an amnesis of the question. And this is the kind of potential we

663
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:15,520
are born to experience the exultation of. And there's nearly no one like Amen.

664
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,440
Other biblical scholars or classicists may criticize him and say things like, oh, he's taking a specific

665
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,560
sense of a specific word and he's promoting it to the primordial sense over all instances of this

666
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:45,520
word in such a way as to twist the perspective to produce the truly bizarre narrative that he wants us

667
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:56,960
to swallow about ancient Greece, the origins of Christianity, Christos, the Medusa, Medea,

668
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,240
medicine, all these things.

669
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:11,280
And hilariously, some of those critics, Dan McClellan among them,

670
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,680
might be technically, linguistically,

671
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,760
and perhaps even cognitively quote unquote correct, they're missing the point.

672
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,680
I'm missing the point.

673
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:40,720
Amen's unique and, you know, intoxicated.

674
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:53,840
The elixir that Amen is making is sygenic, generative of mind states, otherwise inaccessible.

675
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:02,320
And they're looking at something, it's just like people who've only seen airplanes or jet aircraft,

676
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:09,200
which are made for war or passenger or cargo, transit, they're looking at,

677
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,280
basically they're looking at a UFO, they're looking at something from outside. It wasn't even made by

678
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,000
humans. And it doesn't do the things that the human made aircraft do at all. It has no concern

679
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,800
about those things. It's concerned with transporting us to insight and re-establishing

680
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:39,600
anciently lost relationships and correcting nonsensical histories that for us have become prisons

681
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,320
of ignorance and blindness.

682
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,760
A time will tell

683
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:05,040
whether the elixir of Amen's performative, and I don't mean that in the derogatory modern

684
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:14,720
critical sense at all, the elixirs of Amen's performances are truly generative

685
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:21,840
of an amnesis and re-membering.

686
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:38,960
However, personally I find them profound and brilliant in an admittedly iconoclastic and provocative way.

687
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:51,280
So let's see if I can recover my threads here.

688
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:08,160
The colonized colonizers, the re-colonization. So now what's going on in modernly, okay,

689
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:16,640
we have the rise of the internet, which starts out looking pretty virtuous. It resembles in

690
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:26,640
potential the Agora of ancient Greece, where Socrates and other philosophers,

691
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:35,120
Rhapsodes and Sophists perhaps, gathered the common people day to day to pursue wisdom and

692
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:48,080
insight, but also to pursue convincing condemnation, indictment, judgment, opinionaring.

693
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:59,280
And the internet began this way, but it was colonized, and it colonized us.

694
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:08,880
And what was it colonized by? It was colonized by forces that advertise themselves as protectors.

695
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:20,560
The NSA, the National Security Administration, the ridiculous enforcement arms of the government

696
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:32,880
that rose in the wake of 9-11, as if 9-11 were produced specifically to generate those recursively

697
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:45,280
colonizing lethal organizations, and to create a future of panopticon-like

698
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:57,120
surveillance that would collapse not merely the possibility of a free society, whatever that

699
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:03,280
might mean, whatever it's possible for that to mean, but it would turn our own homes and

700
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:08,320
relationships into prisons, weapons that we could be threatened with.

701
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:18,080
And then with the rise of social media, which again in the beginning was a way to bring people

702
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:25,360
together and to celebrate our potentials for intelligence and creativity and insight and

703
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:34,240
play, quickly again became colonized by corporate agendas, driven primarily by two forces,

704
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:46,720
advertising the absolute, I mean, one of the most malignant demons of our modern world,

705
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:56,160
and governmental surveillance of citizens, these twin,

706
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:06,960
cyclopean, I mean, that's probably insulting the cyclops, but yeah, these monsters,

707
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:17,360
straight-up monsters that will eat our lives, minds, and children and sell the bones to the highest

708
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:25,440
bidder. So you can see this recursive, iterative, recolonization

709
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:37,680
of our relationships, our interiority, our thought, our dreaming, our bodies, our metabolism,

710
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:49,280
right? And it's as if it's a layered, it's a layered antithesis to an amnesis. It's a layered,

711
00:56:50,720 --> 00:57:00,400
like an acid that just eats the foundations of memory and produces structured skeletal remains

712
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:14,560
that are commoditized and turned into the fuel for future iterations of new forms of recolonization.

713
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,920
You know, it's easy to distract us with indictments

714
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,480
that make little sense.

715
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:46,400
If we're actually concerned about the injustice of the histories of colonization, slavery, misogyny,

716
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,760
misanthropy,

717
00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:04,320
misbiorelation, abiotic, omniside, then we need not so much to indict and prosecute the histories.

718
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:10,160
We need to understand the origins and we must establish coherent vessels

719
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:25,280
for our communal development, education, an amnesis, healing, enrichment,

720
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,600
and something, you know, what does decolonization mean?

721
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,560
But we can imagine, it means something like, well, you know, when the children have lice,

722
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:47,520
you put medicine in their hair. No, we need to do the opposite of, well, both things, maybe.

723
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:56,240
We need a very enlightened idea and direction for any such project, and it must be self,

724
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,480
it must iteratively decolonize itself.

725
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,480
That was really beautiful what that guy was saying, so he was saying like,

726
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,840
this guy's really interesting. He's clearly a not-ordinarily-minded person

727
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,840
because he has an enthusiasm that's far beyond what ordinary people would usually have, right?

728
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:38,400
And he was saying, you know, the last few, few times I told myself as I was out on my walk,

729
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:45,040
I'm going to pick up five pieces of litter. Each time I found like a pair of expensive

730
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:51,120
ray bands, or one I found $100, every time I found something valuable.

731
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,120
This is kind of what I'm, this is a strange sort of synchronicity.

732
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:06,720
We, if our orientation is indictment and prosecution,

733
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:14,000
it's the path is too expensive and will continue to colonize itself.

734
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,440
One of the ways that we'll do this is with nomenclature, actually two of the ways.

735
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,360
No, it's like the Spanish Inquisition. Every time you look, there's more ways, right?

736
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:32,880
But yeah, it's with nomenclature, in other words, jargon, and it's with ideology, ideological fanaticism.

737
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:44,080
So we have to be aware of those, we have to be aware of the way

738
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:53,200
that a purpose of orientation that starts out virtuous and altruistic

739
01:00:54,160 --> 01:01:01,200
in a trustworthy sense is easily captured even by its own,

740
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,920
by the threads of its own origins. And so we have to find a way to preserve

741
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:19,200
the possibilities of virtue, insight, learning, healing, growth, so forth.

742
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:27,120
There's the terrifying machine signal

743
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,480
and then the horrible noise of death. Every animal that ever heard that was soon to die.

744
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:42,880
Our cells know this is the, you know, this is the bell of doom when you hear the engines.

745
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,640
Almost, I mean, there are a few exceptions. There's a few exceptions. I guess

746
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:55,840
the engines of the ships of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, for example,

747
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:05,360
are an unusual inversion of that paradigm. So what I'm trying to get us to remember here is that

748
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:13,440
all of the executors of colonization

749
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:24,000
were almost certainly victims of colonization first. They were infected with the thrisp-like

750
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:31,200
structure of processes that would convert them, their lives, their children, their ancestors,

751
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:39,440
the meaning of their origins and the shape of their future to omniside, dead terrain,

752
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:46,880
the production of commodities, the collection of commodities in the coffers of the powerful

753
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:59,040
and the wealthy who are themselves, sort of the seed bed, the dead inside seed bed of the pathologies

754
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,640
that become

755
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:13,920
the inaction body of the colonizing forces. And we must discover, and I mean, I think I have

756
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:20,480
some keys to this, which I have spoken of in the past, but we must discover and recover

757
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,760
the origins of the problem and clearly

758
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:51,520
Okay, I think we just got a clue here.

759
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:58,400
So these geese are flipping out and the males are getting all spun up and they're getting spun up

760
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,520
because a human gave a couple of them some crackers.

761
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,160
It'd be hilarious to discover that like the one of the origins of the problem of colonization

762
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:21,680
and I think there's probably a lot of evidence quote unquote for this is simply the introduction

763
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:28,640
of carbohydrates. Once you can store up huge amounts of carbohydrates, it's sort of like

764
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:35,600
what happens when you put a nectar bottle, you know, a bottle of dyed sugar water

765
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:41,760
in a population of hummingbirds. They might have been a little bit provocative before,

766
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,960
but once you put all those commodities in one place, now you got two problems. You've got to

767
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:53,440
protect them from people who might want to take them and it's a really attractive prize

768
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:02,080
because it represents what? Convenience. Okay, so we're going to see two things here fuel

769
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:10,560
and convenience and there's a third thing which is essentially

770
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,320
metals

771
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:29,600
particularly what we think of as precious metals and jewels, crystals, diamonds

772
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:41,440
gold, silver, platinum, copper, bronze, iron, diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires.

773
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:53,200
So and I'm not even getting close to what is actually going on. These are the later stage

774
01:05:53,680 --> 01:06:04,640
catalysts of devastation. What did they really want when they sent ships to the new world quote

775
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:12,480
unquote? Well, they wanted gold. What were they after? Gold. They might have been thinking land

776
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:19,280
but mostly they were thinking gold. Did those savages have gold stored up somewhere? Let's get

777
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:26,080
that gold or at least this is the story we tell and that story is probably three quarters wrong but

778
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,080
it maybe resembles our own projections

779
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,160
and projection is a large part of the problem because

780
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:46,880
if you think your opponent is up to something various then you have to get there first. This is

781
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,520
the race to the bottom the perverse incentive incentivization

782
01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:04,320
elucidated by Daniel Schmockdenberger and others of the Game B or new civilization project.

783
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,720
You know what has to happen obviously is that we have to establish some options that are so much

784
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:24,320
more compelling than the zero-sum competitive pathologies we're currently enacting and being

785
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:29,520
conscripted to and punished by and devastated for.

786
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:42,720
We aren't the people of the lie. We are the generation of lying. It's different.

787
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:55,840
The context is so catastrophically multi-layeredly toxic counterfeit

788
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:07,600
projective. Everywhere we see presentations that advertise virtue and underneath are

789
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:17,440
essentially self-purifying disease vectors and this is you know the concept that I use.

790
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:26,560
This is the origin. My quest to understand this resulted in a series of visions one of which

791
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:32,400
introduced the concepts of the Cognition which is the network of human minds, the Mimula which is

792
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,480
all the features of connection in that network and Thryps which compete for dominance of that

793
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:53,760
network under conditions in which the organic and natural orienteering principles that would guide

794
01:08:53,760 --> 01:09:04,880
and nourish and protect our collective insight, memory, intelligence, altruism, virtue when those

795
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:20,720
breakdown boom, drifts everywhere. It's similar to certain biological processes like those that

796
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:27,360
burn down our neural networks with prion proteins for example. One of the things

797
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:38,160
Kurzfeld Jacobs disease or otherwise known as mad cow disease and similar prion protein

798
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:53,680
disorders. As I understand it, the prions are essential to the differentiation

799
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,880
of our nervous systems and neural networks in the brain in early development.

800
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:09,040
Similarly to how something kills off the flesh between our fingers so that you get these differentiated

801
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:20,160
very useful articulate appendages. Something resembling that happens in the brain in our early

802
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:31,520
developmental arcs with neurons. A lot of them have to be burned off and what that means is that's

803
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,840
one of the things that makes us each unique because we all undergo this kind of interior

804
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:44,560
extinction event and usually we think oh extinction is bad and it certainly is if we're burning down

805
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,600
anciently conserved ecologies to make more machines and stuff. That's insane. That's not

806
01:10:50,800 --> 01:11:00,080
there's nothing coherent or biorelationally integral about that. That's just madness and

807
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:08,960
wrongness. And yeah you can take the bigger picture. Sure. You can say things like oh life is resilient

808
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,800
earth is resilient.

809
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,920
But I'd love to see where that perspective is arising from because if it's arising from some kind

810
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:26,960
of empirical or materialistic perspective based on what you think is the historical data and so

811
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:32,000
forth that's dissociative. That's dissociated. You're not connecting with nature at all. You're just

812
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:42,480
you're just being a disembodied grasping rationalist. So you're almost certainly going to be wrong

813
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:51,840
about nearly everything having to do with organisms if that's your that's your anchor in consciousness

814
01:11:52,400 --> 01:12:06,880
and concern. A mother's concerns much more trustworthy. She bears children. She has to fund them

815
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:15,280
fund just to build their bodies from her own biology right the calcium of her bones

816
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,640
the metabolic products of her body her heartbeat

817
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:31,760
is becomes the context in which life emerges and while our planet is only metaphorically

818
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:41,280
feminine in this sense that metaphor goes very deep and is very powerful. It's not merely a figure of speech.

819
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:52,880
So we must recover the origins of the problem that led to our defection

820
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:03,600
from memory humanity insight virtue mutual intelligence mutual concern awareness

821
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:20,640
our real cooperative abilities and we must find ways to establish vehicles to conserve develop

822
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,800
enact

823
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:40,080
and and transmit communicate these potentials into the existing bodies of anti-culture

824
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:51,680
that largely own our species at this time our children and perhaps we may be so lucky as to

825
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:58,800
stumble into ways of being human that please our ancestors by fulfilling their dreams

826
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:06,160
and what they hoped for and worked for in the deepest recesses of their hearts minds and spirits

827
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:17,520
all of us moderns and for you know millions of lifetimes we have been slaves

828
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:25,680
to things that don't even exist we have been slaves to ghosts and shadows in the human cognisium

829
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:36,640
presenting as virtues or progress and delivering omniside amnesia torture despair

830
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:46,800
devastation of our our spirit our commonality the replacement of that with

831
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:57,840
prison-eering panopticon like surveillance systems that aren't killing us off directly at the moment

832
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:10,480
and this is this is actually part of the problem with the weird results of technology

833
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:22,160
there are fates worse than death and some of them involve the slow erosion

834
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:31,520
of our interior assets and potentials and if you can get at the thing with which we tell the

835
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:39,440
difference the thing with which we would otherwise notice what is happening then anything that gets

836
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:50,320
at that anything that gets at the fundamental basis of our capacity to discern change if you can

837
01:15:50,320 --> 01:16:00,560
co-opt that then the entire bank of the history and future of life on earth of human beings of

838
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:07,680
our interiority is now open for rape and you can get away with anything you can imagine

839
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:14,080
you just have to go slowly enough you just have to turn the heat up in the water slowly enough

840
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:25,920
that it doesn't overcome the disabled senses that would alert us to we must oppose this

841
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:32,640
that would cattle that would organize and galvanize us into communal

842
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:38,240
into heroic communal

843
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:46,640
organization intelligence resilience and activity

844
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:56,240
so these are a few of the things that are in my awareness today or have risen in my awareness

845
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:10,000
while I muse with you my listeners in the hope of better ways of seeing in the hope of an amnesis

846
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:16,400
in the hope of pleasing the ancestors and the muses and perhaps the angels

847
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:27,840
I'm so grateful to have this time together and for your kind attention your enthusiasm your wonder

848
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:37,840
your curiosity the spirit within you of heroic questing recovery and rescue

849
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:47,760
that is innate to our human nature may your ways and minds and dreams be beautiful and healing

850
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:59,040
and profound and may you find joyful relation with all the aspects of yourself your histories your

851
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:06,800
futures your ancestors your progeny and all of the beings who are in fact a single family

852
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:21,840
thank you for joining me I look forward to learning together again very soon bye bye for now
