0	7000	Hello everybody. Welcome.
30000	57000	Because we are trained by language and culture to think as if intelligence
57000	85000	is a possession. This is a misuse of the container metaphor. Even though there are examples
85000	110000	of intelligence localized as the body, history, memory and behavior action of what we could
110000	128000	think of as distinct individuals. The ballet dancer, the classical musician, the neurosurgeon,
128000	151000	the elite coder, the mother who expertly cares for four or more children, the orator who is
151000	175000	certainly appearing as an individual performer, the comedian. There are veritable examples
175000	199000	of the existence and an action of individual intelligences and profound skillfulness which is where I'm going to go toward in this walk and talk today.
199000	220000	But I'm pretty sure that none of them, none that I'm aware of, arise or exist in absolute isolation. And the arising part is the important part here.
229000	258000	Not for all of us, but for most of us, our capacity to experience, embody, exemplify and enact the vast library
258000	283000	of our possible intelligences will profoundly depend on the contexts in which we arise, in which we mature.
283000	304000	And our intelligences are composed with and for and against those with whom we imagine ourselves.
304000	328000	And certainly we have actual local relationships, family, peers, culture, media, so forth. But even those must be imagined. We have to imagine participating in them, to participate in them.
328000	355000	There's a powerful necessity for organized coherent consciousness in relation with the world, history, mystery, possibility, potential.
355000	379000	The Stellars Jay recognizes me and I brought him, it's a male, pretty sure, a peanut. And having received peanuts before, it has an imaginal trace in its memory.
385000	411000	This is very strange. What the hell could that even mean? Someone's bag. So it's almost like a trap for humans, right? Put a bag with a bunch of objects in it and just leave it on a bench and then walk away from it and see what happens.
411000	433000	Because the humans are naturally curious about the contents of the bag. No one knows what might be in there. A few weeks ago, in a garden around the corner from my house, the gardener has found $50,000 stacks of $100 bills in a bag.
433000	452000	Apparently the money was filthy, really gross, but still, you know, cash dollars, you can wash them. I didn't feel, you know, I had complex feelings about that and we'll come back to the other topics.
452000	473000	But imagine finding that yourself and then like taking it home and wondering, is this money perhaps cursed? Why is it so disgustingly filthy? Who could have disposed of it in this way and why did they do so?
474000	487000	And is it a trap? Because it's a perfect kind of trap.
487000	508000	When my father used to work in the Weberstown Mall in Stockton at Roger's Jewelers, him and the other salespeople, they would often crazy glue silver dollar to the tile in front of the store for entertainment.
508000	521000	And they would watch as women kicked it and broke their heels and people tried to pry it off the floor and they thought this was hilarious.
522000	542000	But it's not unfunny. The problem is rather that it's a cruel kind of humor that depends on deceiving others and then finding their vulnerability to deception, entertaining.
543000	559000	It's a very mean-spirited mode of the possibilities of humor and much, many of the possibilities of humor have degraded into such meanly spirited modes in our time.
560000	577000	My friend who lives in town here, Johnny Teo, called her own, posted something on Facebook yesterday that I found absolutely hilarious and I still find it hilarious.
577000	592000	But there's nothing mean about it. He wrote, some people have the calm before the storm. I have the panic before the nothing.
592000	611000	And a couple of my friends said that I think that's a generational thing. And I said, yeah, maybe.
612000	627000	He often writes very humorous things, but I thought that was hilarious, mostly because it's so familiar to my own direct experience of having a mind and consciousness.
627000	632000	And part of having a mind and consciousness is imagining futures.
632000	647000	And I want to talk a little bit about what I mean by intelligence because this concept is fundamental for me.
647000	651000	It is orienting, and that's what makes it fundamental.
652000	658000	If I want anything, there's probably a few things I want.
658000	669000	I want to avoid making the most deadly mistakes that can be made during an incarnation.
669000	677000	The ones that really screw futures up and maybe hurt other beings.
677000	682000	I want to see better every time I begin to see.
682000	693000	I want purposes that improve themselves each time I arouse them.
693000	716000	I want more intelligence, which means insight, awareness, seeing from above, and often seeing for purposes and in ways that are extremely uncommon among my species.
716000	742000	Because we are trained to the lowest rungs of the ladders on which we might hopefully together within for each other ascend toward
742000	761000	the finest or most beautiful, most profound, most trustworthy, most holy potentials of our humanity and animality and beingness and origin.
761000	768000	And that ascent is crucially important to me.
768000	795000	The relatively malignant gains that are imported into consciousness as we learn English and childhood and as we become enculturated, particularly courtroom mind, possession mind, war mind, and drag us down the ladder mind.
799000	826000	Meaning let's go for even lower hanging fruit until we get to the rotten, moldy stuff on the ground and maybe we'll be able to find an even more deleterious place from there.
826000	855000	There's no end to the low end of the ladders, much like the high end they're infinite, but they're far more easily accessed than what I'm positing as up on the ladders of memory, insight, intelligence, awareness, human and cultural possibility.
857000	863000	So what do I actually mean by intelligence?
871000	876000	And here's the real problem, or here's a real problem.
877000	891000	Speaking abstractly about virtues is ironically almost the opposite of enacting them much of the time, if not most of the time.
892000	901000	It's very, one has to be profoundly skillful to enact something while speaking of it.
902000	906000	I have occasionally seen recent examples of this.
907000	932000	I saw a few examples in the not modestly insane locutions of Ammon Hillman in his recent interview with Danny Jones.
933000	935000	There were some examples in there.
936000	959000	I've seen other examples in the locutions of John Verveke recently, who I've managed to fascinate my son with, which is a pretty significant accomplishment for me since nearly nothing that I can present to my progeny
960000	970000	actually captivates his attention, mostly he attacks it, which, you know, is a perennial problem.
971000	984000	So this is the problem, right? I can talk about what I mean by intelligence, but if I'm not enacting it while speaking about it, then I'm walking away from it by talking about it.
985000	989000	And this is a very complex and difficult problem to resolve.
990000	1007000	Actual prodigy tends to be able to resolve this problem without much planning in the natural course of not merely locution,
1007000	1029000	but a word I recently came to understand the meaning of, if I understand the meaning of it, elocation, which I'm going to pretend means to accomplish what is being spoken of by speaking about it.
1030000	1042000	Now, I can think of two contrary examples, which will be familiar to some of those who've listened to my recent podcast.
1043000	1053000	One that is the opposite of elocation, which is a statement something like, actually there's a couple of them.
1053000	1063000	One of my favorites is to demonstrate the capacity for incredibly absurd idiocy in language.
1064000	1071000	One of the statements is, this is the most important statement you will ever hear.
1071000	1084000	It's kind of my version of the Rossellian paradox, if I understand which paradox that is correctly.
1084000	1099000	A similar anti-illocutive statement is, I will not be speaking to you today about leverage or succession.
1099000	1116000	And an example, again, if I understand the concept correctly, now I've long understood a similar concept that may not be truly illocution,
1116000	1133000	but it is the capacity to accomplish certain kinds of virtues, mostly perspectival, intellectual, conceptual, to accomplish them by framing them in language.
1134000	1150000	And also to do what is being said by saying it is very, very different from mere description.
1151000	1160000	So if I say that a manifold is a bubble of many bubbles, and there are intersections between these bubbles,
1161000	1169000	and that what we do, what I'm doing right now to form this sentence is collapsing a manifold, right?
1170000	1178000	I'm throwing away bubbles until I get a kind of a complex stick figure from the remaining intersections.
1179000	1189000	And then I select among those for the structure of the sentences I will vocalize.
1190000	1194000	And it is similar in thought or problem solving.
1197000	1200000	So what do I mean by intelligence?
1200000	1219000	Well, one of the best examples is the entire array of non-human, non-representational intelligences embodied in the biorelational hyperstructure that we refer to as nature.
1220000	1235000	And particularly the bubble of life that surrounds and penetrates and enlivens our planet here.
1236000	1241000	Those beings are not referring to things.
1242000	1259000	They are enacting anciently sophisticated biorelational intelligences, moment to moment, instant to instant, together as a unity seemingly comprised of individuals.
1259000	1276000	So, you know, one of my jokes recently was the problem with the idea of non-human intelligences is that it's very likely that that's the only kind there is.
1277000	1296000	Obviously, our species, at the species level, is profoundly adept at certain terrifying modes of technique.
1297000	1319000	And as profoundly bereft of the wisdom necessary to know which of them to not implement and how to not implement examples that are omnicidal.
1320000	1331000	On the other hand, our collective technique is like a demon, very profound.
1331000	1360000	I was talking with my friend Eric the other night and I was recalling when I was a child, it was as if I had lived before in other ages.
1361000	1380000	And could thus recall what in science fiction or the game Traveler or other science-fiction systems could recall the tech level of the civilization in which I previously existed.
1381000	1396000	And compared that to what I discovered in this incarnation with objects like toasters and televisions and watches and, you know, hems.
1396000	1401000	I think about how complex a hem is.
1402000	1417000	And maybe you could figure out how to sew somewhat crudely, perhaps using the viscera of animals as a thread and animal skins as fabric.
1417000	1431000	But your chances of composing an actual fabric, very slim, the simple cotton sheet underneath my bed is a catastrophically sophisticated example of human technique.
1431000	1440000	And zippers are ridiculously, complexly advanced and useful.
1440000	1465000	So there's this whole dimension of technique at the collective level of the humans that really does provide us with what we can imagine as benefits, reasonably imagine as benefits, comfort, convenience, survivability.
1465000	1473000	That second word is one of the most dangerous of the demons.
1473000	1486000	Apparently the humans have no inhibitive intelligence around what not to trade for convenience.
1487000	1504000	Including our ancestors, our souls, our origin, our intelligence, our health, our planet itself, the anciently conserved ecologies, you name it.
1504000	1526000	We will gladly, or, you know, stupidly, hand all that over, our privacy, our relationships, there's nothing safe.
1526000	1535000	But the reason that we will hand it over isn't necessarily that we're just stupid or addicted, it's that we're lonely.
1536000	1540000	We're isolated.
1540000	1559000	And the specter of the anti-cultures that arise in the wake of the human relationship with technique
1559000	1563000	is recursively self-impoverishing.
1563000	1574000	It just creates new and greater depths of impoverishment within us and in the world over time.
1574000	1586000	And the pain of that is what makes us willing to trade away the most precious assets imaginable.
1586000	1594000	It's so precious that their value is impossible to comprehend, which also makes it easy.
1594000	1609000	Something that's infinite, something that appears infinite to consciousness, one cannot understand that it has been traded away.
1609000	1621000	It seems impossible to imagine that it could be taken away or fracked for profit, power.
1621000	1632000	So, it's very challenging to abstractly say what I mean by intelligence.
1632000	1647000	Since I hadn't practiced it, and I'm really just improvising here, I'm not too sure of my footing, so to speak.
1647000	1652000	But I'll try to say some things about it.
1652000	1673000	The capacity to usefully improve previously practiced methods, ideas, perspectives,
1673000	1680000	what we call solutions, which is a very strange thing to call them.
1680000	1687000	The capacity to resolve various conflicts and or problems.
1687000	1697000	And also the capacity, particularly, to detect and attend the repercussions of such solutions,
1697000	1708000	so as to avoid the self-ironizing weaponization that rather naturally occurs
1708000	1734000	if the intelligences we practice and develop are not broadly pro-generative of insight, rather than mere technique.
1734000	1757000	So, it's the capacity to rise above the common, often lethal, meaning causative of forgetting results
1757000	1774000	of poorly conceived purposes, motivations, ideologies, conceptions.
1774000	1789000	Of course, actual insight is not formally above, it's not necessarily up from the other dangerous stuff.
1789000	1793000	This is a metaphor.
1793000	1800000	I think we all understand in a basic way what the metaphor implies.
1800000	1806000	And the simplest way to say that is just improvement.
1806000	1834000	Now, there are many spiritual traditions that naturally and perhaps intelligently warn us about the dangers of conceiving the purpose of improvement.
1834000	1863000	And this is in part because conceiving that purpose is distracting.
1863000	1888000	We are inclined to become un-present, to defect from intimate awareness of the moment or bodies, situations, relationships, histories.
1888000	1902000	And this desire drives much of the problem with human technique.
1902000	1915000	But it is truly astonishing what the humans can accomplish with their super-organism-like technical behavior.
1915000	1928000	Unfortunately, most of that stuff is quite malignant in its inaction results.
1928000	1942000	There's a beehive about 15 feet from me, it's an intentional beehive.
1942000	1950000	Some human put it together and populated it and so forth.
1950000	1967000	I'm going to take a closer look for a moment.
1967000	1974000	I'm a huge fan of the hymenoptra.
1974000	1985000	If I understand correctly, the Greek origins of this word hymen,
1985000	1999000	which we refer in English and maybe other languages to a sheath in the reproductive organs of the female,
1999000	2009000	that must be broken for effective intercourse to occur.
2009000	2017000	I think the word means blood, it just means blood.
2017000	2030000	But this is what I derived from listening to Amon Hillman.
2030000	2043000	However, it's also strongly associated with femininity or the female gender.
2043000	2049000	And so clearly hymenoptra, which is the what, the genus?
2049000	2059000	I can't remember which Linnaean ladder segment is right of the ants, bees, wasps, termites,
2059000	2072000	because they are female dominated, biologically female dominated societies.
2072000	2087000	Or at least that's the impression we take from our own purposeful derivations.
2087000	2092000	So one reasonable definition of intelligence is to just see better,
2092000	2099000	to keep continually to forge a cascade of greater insight,
2099000	2112000	that keeps that with each iteration gets a richer, deeper, broader, and more specific array of capacities
2112000	2124000	to derive useful conceptions and potentials for action, behavior, relation.
2124000	2136000	Surely you can see how different this description is from the inaction of it.
2136000	2141000	And for that, for the moment I must simply apologize.
2141000	2150000	I'm not as sharp as I could be surrounded by intelligence others
2150000	2168000	or with the participation of intelligences far richer and older than my own.
2168000	2172000	But another definition of intelligence that's very valuable
2172000	2188000	is one associated with the oath that we associate with Hippocrates.
2188000	2203000	And I strongly suspect that in the Greek there's a strong distinction between Hippocrates
2203000	2209000	and the root from which we get the concept of hypocrisy,
2209000	2223000	which is the ironic violation of espoused principles, intelligences, or perspectives
2223000	2237000	by one's actions and speeches in action too, even though it's a very specific kind of action.
2237000	2246000	But the Hippocratic oath includes the admonition to first don't make things worse.
2246000	2261000	And this is part of the admonition in Buddhist and other spiritual systems to not try to improve situations or things.
2261000	2273000	Let them be as they are. Attend your own, you know, attention.
2273000	2286000	Attend your own attention, body, perceptions, don't place too much urgency on thoughts.
2286000	2292000	Let them dissolve away just as they arise.
2292000	2302000	Try not to enact them or cause them to become recursively self-generative of long sequences of thoughts,
2302000	2312000	which by the way goes back to that hilarious thing that my friend Johnny said.
2312000	2323000	Because to have the panic before the nothing is the result of too much thinking.
2323000	2340000	And I guess, you know, intelligence can also be understood as concerned with three primary features of human attentional investment,
2340000	2348000	which are ambiguity, vigilance, and prediction.
2348000	2355000	So when something's ambiguous, we're going to tend to pay more attention to it unless it's irresolvable.
2355000	2360000	We're going to try to collapse it toward a graspable derivative.
2360000	2373000	And that's costly in terms of attention and straight-up capitalism, like glucose, whatever feeds a cognitive and nervous system activity.
2373000	2379000	Because you have to stay in a state of readiness, which is expensive.
2379000	2398000	So what the humans like to do, and what they often do, and what many of their ideas of convenience orbit is the reduction in ambiguity over time as an equation.
2398000	2410000	And the attempt to produce something like negative ambiguity, which is something that gravidically pre-resolves possible future ambiguities moment to moment.
2410000	2414000	And that's why we live in boxes that are dead inside.
2414000	2422000	Because when they're dead inside, there's nothing to attend.
2423000	2433000	The degree of unexpected, you know, a rise of ambiguity is extremely low inside a house.
2433000	2439000	There's nothing is moving, unless we have animals or children or something.
2439000	2443000	Or, you know, the other humans may move about.
2443000	2447000	In most homes, there's very little life.
2447000	2458000	And the less life there is, the less ambiguity there is, the less of a prediction burden there is.
2458000	2470000	Now, of course, you know, there's an array of trenchant ironies here.
2470000	2481000	Because no ambiguity means no opportunity, no adventure, no development, essentially a kind of living death.
2481000	2484000	It's very safe, but nothing happens.
2484000	2493000	You know, David Byrne, I think, once said, heaven is a place where nothing ever happens, or rather he sang this.
2493000	2496000	It's very insightful.
2496000	2503000	He was aware, whether conceptually or not, is a question in the same way I am.
2503000	2511000	But he was aware of this interplay of vigilance, ambiguity, and prediction.
2511000	2525000	And so intelligence might then be also a way of balancing these three potentials for maximum opportunity,
2525000	2533000	minimized but not minimal ambiguity, and efficacious prediction.
2533000	2539000	That last thing turns out to be really important, because if you don't see the repercussions,
2539000	2545000	or if you don't care about them, of the development of technique,
2545000	2556000	your children will be tormented, tortured, if there's even a world on which they might exist anymore.
2556000	2566000	So there's a super dangerous array of problems that arise from either the failure to predict intelligently,
2566000	2586000	insightfully, effectively, or we're still the disposition that inclines us to see catastrophes
2586000	2592000	emerge from technique as opportunities for profit or business,
2592000	2602000	which is a common malignant cancerous disease in our present cultures.
2602000	2612000	Those who hold the reins of wealth and power are well protected from almost all of the repercussions
2612000	2625000	of lethally enacted technique and can bubble themselves up inside a broad array of shields
2625000	2633000	that keep them and their families relatively safe as long as the whole damn context doesn't collapse,
2633000	2646000	apocalypse, and any catastrophe that costs life or health is just another way to make money,
2646000	2650000	more money, which is another way to get more power.
2650000	2660000	So this leads to a kind of absolute corruption of principles,
2660000	2666000	and particularly the principle of an intelligent democracy,
2666000	2674000	which is the principle that our country, the United States, counterfeits.
2674000	2679000	Because what we really have here is like, I don't know exactly what the right term is,
2679000	2682000	but one that I use frequently lately is kleptocracy,
2682000	2689000	which is a steal everything you can under the guise of a semi-democratic array of processes
2689000	2694000	that have been thoroughly compromised from within,
2694000	2710000	re-compromised, and continue to invent new modes of the counterfeit expression of.
2710000	2721000	So it's like a recursively self-recounterfeiting opposite of what anything resembling an actual democracy might be,
2721000	2732000	which is also something that Amon Hillman was interested in and concerned about.
2733000	2748000	I don't know why, but I found him to be one of the most entertaining of the intellects,
2748000	2754000	masculine intellects I've ever encountered.
2754000	2764000	Clearly a genius, also partly mad,
2764000	2779000	and in some ways more like a human drug than most of the people that I've ever seen.
2779000	2797000	And one of the things that he was talking very clearly about was the necessity of learning a very complex ancient language.
2797000	2812000	For him, this is Greek, and he has excellent defenses for why.
2812000	2818000	I think that he actually believes, I'm not sure about this, because he says he's not religious,
2818000	2823000	and he says he's too lazy to be religious, which is interesting.
2823000	2833000	But he does seem to believe that there is something that resembles the idea of the logos,
2833000	2849000	which is, at least in my mind, a being, a metaphysical entity, that is the origin of the possibility of rationality.
2849000	2866000	But he used a different word, he didn't say rationality.
2866000	2873000	The word that he used, though, implied the potential of making sense of things,
2873000	2878000	and possibly of representing them and making sense of the representations.
2878000	2888000	What's the word? I can't recall it. It wasn't our word.
2888000	2898000	Now, obviously, Ammon is very brilliant and has a direct relationship with something like the origins of language in humans,
2898000	2902000	whether or not he conceives of it as a being.
2902000	2919000	I conceive of it as an intelligence or an array of intelligences that exist outside of time
2919000	2924000	and don't require a physical substrate for their existence.
2924000	2935000	And their collection of these could be understood as a being.
2935000	2941000	But this is all very derinean.
2941000	2947000	I'm not trying to convince anyone to dot my perspective here.
2947000	2961000	Though, what Ammon is talking about is a transcendental reunion through the careful study of what he conceives of
2961000	2968000	as a sygenic linguistic substrate, which for him is Greek,
2968000	2974000	and which it makes perfect sense to me why he has chosen Greek
2974000	2980000	and why he thinks it is either the ultimate or penultimate language one can study,
2980000	2986000	though his experience of other languages is not particularly broad.
2986000	3000000	Because the study of Greek transformed his mind in such a way that language became his companion and he rose above it
3000000	3010000	so that unlike us, rather than being subject to language,
3010000	3017000	language becomes his laboratory and toolbox.
3017000	3023000	He asked Danny Jones whether or not Danny coins terms.
3023000	3026000	This is a crucial question.
3026000	3038000	On the one hand, the irresponsible profusion of self-coin terms is unhelpful at best and ridiculous at worst.
3038000	3052000	On the other hand, the ongoing failure to coin terms is a sign of linguistic disability, crippling.
3052000	3061000	And he was talking about the propensity of Greek to not merely allow the constant and common coining of terms,
3061000	3073000	but to encourage and reward it, though I'm paraphrasing.
3073000	3081000	It strikes me that the structure of German, about which I know very little,
3081000	3096000	but seems to be oriented toward complex coining of terms,
3096000	3100000	has a similar functionality.
3100000	3108000	There's lots of little parts. You can weave them together in all kinds of new or interesting or useful ways.
3108000	3119000	And English also has this ability. I fairly regularly coin terms.
3119000	3130000	My recent Facebook friend, Savon Gordon, who's a memestress who calls herself the Queen of Dreams on her memes,
3130000	3141000	she recently had a reel with a picture of her hair where she basically looked like a Medusa.
3141000	3155000	Her hair was so possibly intentionally distressed, probably by wind,
3155000	3164000	and I refer to that as a herpocalypse. This is an example of, you know, coining words in English.
3164000	3172000	Or you can see that in this particular coining, Greek is involved.
3172000	3184000	Probably many of the roots that we, what, the phonemes or the fragments of words
3184000	3192000	that are woven together to form English terms are Greek.
3192000	3199000	Some of them are Latin.
3199000	3208000	Probably most of them are Greek and some are borrowed from later languages.
3208000	3212000	Ah, sorry.
3212000	3228000	The last one's injured. This goose is injured.
3228000	3234000	When I began this walk and talk,
3234000	3245000	my initial goal was to talk about the vast library of accessible intelligences that most of us will never taste.
3245000	3250000	We see much more today because of two things, right?
3250000	3265000	The ability to fake, to present the appearance of superhuman activity or skill,
3265000	3273000	and the ability to practice and transmit superhuman ability and skill.
3273000	3279000	Because of YouTube particularly, I guess TikTok now as well.
3279000	3288000	Lots of contagions are mixed in there. It doesn't just transmit intelligence or training or skillfulness.
3288000	3295000	But by constantly exemplifying what looks to us to be superhuman abilities and skills,
3295000	3303000	I'm thinking particularly of parkour, certain martial arts skills, musical skills, dancing skills,
3303000	3315000	skills of acrobatics or physicality, conceptual or perspectival skills which are a bit more rare.
3315000	3324000	There's this vast library of exemplars of this in YouTube and now perhaps TikTok.
3324000	3329000	And this at least potentially makes them contagious.
3329000	3339000	But what I want to actually point out is that these skills are not superhuman.
3339000	3347000	The broad library of intelligences and abilities that we bring to our human birth are mostly inhibited,
3347000	3376000	shut down, punished or commodified like filtered into representations such as sports or war.
3376000	3391000	And so most of the intelligences and abilities that we might naturally embody and enact and experience together within for each other
3391000	3412000	are amputated, inhibited or reframed into forms that can be commoditized and thus controlled, bought and sold for purposes that aren't actually human.
3412000	3414000	But serve what?
3414000	3416000	No, it's not verveki.
3416000	3425000	What Ogie Oglin, I can't remember this guy's actual name, refers to as the replicators which are a branch.
3425000	3453000	This is a concept for the bad human collectives that just keep doing terrifying things and converting vast populations of humans to robots and slaves and things.
3453000	3476000	And most of us don't actually understand that there's a kind of a link-up that can occur between the mundane physicality of our human common experience and expectation
3476000	3484000	and what we might imagine as the transcendent and or the divine.
3485000	3499000	This is a very familiar concept to me and it's not familiar in the basic conceptual way that it might be familiar to academics.
3499000	3512000	It's not familiar to me in the way of the difference between someone who has only ever heard about the existence of vast bodies of water and someone who has jumped into them and swam in them,
3512000	3524000	like the difference between someone who's only heard of a lake and someone who is solo-dived in the ocean. This kind of familiarity.
3524000	3537000	There are forces, intelligences, beings in the universe that correspond to the concept of the muses.
3537000	3546000	The Greeks might appear conceptually insane or hyper-religious to us moderns.
3546000	3555000	The actual problem is the other way around. We are idiots about the transcendental, most modern, generally speaking.
3555000	3571000	We either refuse to acknowledge that it's possible or real, or we form bizarre, insane representations which we then subject ourselves and others to in the form of organized religion.
3571000	3578000	Not that all organized religions are bad, wrong, etc. But the vast majority of them are crippling.
3578000	3596000	Because the feral intensity of our actual human nature and intelligences exceeds the entire payload of all human spiritual traditions by many orders of magnitude.
3596000	3604000	And this is what I am trying to talk about today.
3604000	3615000	That potential that we bring to our human birth and the possibility of recovering our capacity to understand and pursue those intelligences,
3615000	3626000	the development and inaction of those intelligences together, with and for each other, with and for the history of future and future of life on earth,
3626000	3634000	with and for the benefit of all beings in all of time.
3634000	3649000	This is an imperative I trust. And there aren't too many that I trust that way.
3649000	3661000	So, you know, you see examples of humans doing things that look impossible to us.
3661000	3673000	I don't know, playing 47 notes per, you know, more than a note per second on the guitar, for example.
3673000	3682000	Which isn't necessarily genius and can be stupid, because beauty and speed are not the same thing.
3682000	3690000	Hyperfunction isn't the same thing as prodigy, but there's a relationship there that's real.
3690000	3709000	You know, you can see wild examples of people climbing up walls, flipping over in the air, doing all kinds of seemingly impossible monkey-like acrobatics under the rubric of parkour.
3709000	3724000	You can see someone shatter a stack of bricks, not with a punch, but with a movement of their fingertips that's less than an inch.
3724000	3735000	They have no time in which to accelerate. They go from zero to pure acceleration in a span of less than an inch.
3735000	3746000	All kinds of profound, martial examples of martial skill and effectiveness, some of which are phony.
3746000	3753000	For sure, some of that's phony. But a lot of it isn't. Plenty of it isn't.
3753000	3766000	The capacity for not merely superfunction in our bodies and minds, but hyperfunction, is real and natural to humans.
3766000	3795000	It's not superhuman. It's human. Or it's subhuman in the sense that it arises from either our animalian basis, our organismal basis, our basis as organisms, or our basis as beings.
3795000	3806000	And if we imagine those as sort of rings on a cone, that the top of which is the human, then these are subhuman features.
3806000	3820000	And if we imagine them as rings, that the lowest point of the cone, whether the cone goes up or down, is the lowest point as human, then they are more than merely human.
3820000	3842000	Which I would argue they are. The latter rung of our being is more than the latter rung of our organismal nature, which is more than the latter rung of our animalian nature, more than the rung of our human nature.
3842000	3855000	But it's useful to be able to think in either direction about this, and to not be too biased, because are they actually separate rungs? There's lots of important questions here.
3855000	3877000	But the thing that I want you to understand is that you came to human birth, and every person that you ever loved, and that you ever knew, they came to incarnation endowed with an anciently developed library of seemingly impossible faculties and abilities
3877000	3893000	that mostly get amputated, circumcised, lost, lied about, faked. There's lots of people who think, oh you know, psychism is impossible, Darren Brown proved that.
3893000	3907000	Because Darren Brown can fake the feats of mentalists and psychics, his presumption is that because I can fake those, all such things are fake. That's not true, and it's not possible.
3907000	3920000	Telepathy is real. Mind to mind contact is real. Mind to place contact is real. Mind to time contact is real.
3920000	3949000	The ideas that we consider to be our sober defenses against superstition and fakery are just as dangerous as they are protective if they blind us to the veritable existence of anything that can be counter-fitted.
3949000	3969000	And Darren Brown is a professional counter-fitter. So, you know, not surprising. I mean, he has a grudge, right? And his grudge is purposeful and intelligent to a degree. It's just that the degree is not universal.
3970000	3989000	He doesn't want people to be taken advantage of, lied to, shriven of their money, time, belief. So he wants to show them that the entire domain of metaphysical and or even physical skills.
3989000	4009000	You know, he goes to a martial art dojo where the teacher is supposed to be capable of demonstrating what is called the one-inch punch, which I spoke of earlier.
4010000	4032000	And Darren demonstrates something very similar in effect. But what Darren is doing, Darren Brown that is, is not demonstrating martial skill. Darren has very little if any martial skill.
4033000	4051000	Darren's skill is a skill at manipulating consciousness of nearby humans. And he's an expert at that. And so what he's actually doing is more or less hypnotic rather than physical.
4052000	4070000	But let me be very clear about this. If a skilled martial artist who could execute this maneuver struck you in the sternum with such a blow, it probably shatter your rib cage. Shatter it. Don't just break your rib.
4071000	4093000	Humans have abilities. We're living in the lowest possible rung of the ladders that we were born to climb together for each other, for our ancestors, for our progeny, for the future, for life on Earth, for our species.
4093000	4115000	These are noble, heroic imperatives that we come to human birth imbued with, that are stolen, lied about, compromised, sold broken, counterfeited, and sold back to us in every ridiculously addictive form because we're dying of the pain of isolation.
4116000	4129000	We're dying of having no meaningful identity or role. We're dying of loneliness while surrounded by thousands of strangers.
4129000	4158000	And when I say we, I don't just mean we, I mean me. This is true of my own experience. I can sense the terrifying vacuum of meaningful human experience, identity, opportunity, adventure, relation.
4158000	4176000	And so forth. Moment to moment. And it is witheringly in miserating. That's the word I coined, in miserating.
4188000	4217000	This pain is the origin and source of our enslavement.
4218000	4235000	And some of us endeavor to break free, like birds chained to a wall.
4249000	4269000	We want not merely to fly again. We want to free the mothers, the children, the ancestors, the progeny from that faith.
4269000	4289000	Even if we ourselves will not fly again, we ache for the inaction of the principles from which the concept of justice derives.
4289000	4309000	And that concept is not a concept of the punishment of wrongdoers. The concept of justice is the concept of liberation and resolution of harm.
4310000	4327000	Institutionally conserved and reenacted forms of harm that torment beings, and particularly living beings and body beings.
4327000	4340000	No one would punish a murderer, harm them, make them pay. I mean this is the most ridiculous idea in the history of human thought. Make them pay.
4340000	4367000	No one would do that if they could simply use the intelligence gathered from some murder to ensure that future murders didn't happen.
4368000	4376000	To make the murder medicine from the murder that actually took place, we would never punish anyone.
4376000	4388000	And if we, in punishing humans for their quote wrongdoing, if in doing that we guarantee the reenaction of the injustice,
4388000	4402000	that is insane, malignant, wrong, horrifying, stupid, inexcusable, unjustifiably catastrophic.
4402000	4415000	We're just going to reiterate catastrophe and waves going forward in time and generations. And this is what our idea, prison-earing, accomplishes.
4415000	4439000	It's a for-profit slave-naping system run by and for the benefit of the wealthy and the replicators as that Ogie guy is talking about.
4446000	4464000	So part of intelligence is understanding these principles that I've outlined today, but the greater portion is finding ways to implement that understanding
4464000	4479000	that actually accomplish liberation and that grant us the contextual support for recovery operations that we engage in together with and for each other,
4479000	4504000	that reintroduce our more than merely human natures, imperatives and abilities to our direct experience and celebrate them and support them, recognize them, encourage them.
4510000	4529000	You know, my talk today is an attempt, it's an essay in this direction. And I hope you find it inspiring and useful because even just by having a conversation like this one, we have begun the process I described together.
4529000	4549000	It may be imperfect, it may not solve all the problems, but it calls to mind the potentials and opportunities of our humanity and our origin, our nature as living beings and as more than merely human beings.
4550000	4570000	And that call is the call that our incarnation originated with, worthy of pursuit, trustworthy beyond all concepts, beyond all language,
4571000	4587000	beyond all skills, a compass in a darkness that grows more tangled in our modern experience with each passing moment.
4588000	4608000	And, you know, the situation seems hopeless, but it's only hopeless if the scope is too large for us to address. The moment we shrink the scope to me and you and two or three other people,
4609000	4617000	the impossible becomes the accomplished.
4620000	4632000	I'm so grateful for this opportunity to learn and undergo a kind of an amnesis, un-forgetting, together today.
4632000	4640000	I'm so grateful to all of you who listen and participate and share this with others, which is very helpful.
4640000	4652000	You know, if you can and you wish to make a little donation, even a one-time donation on my website organelle.org would be very deeply appreciated.
4652000	4665000	And I look forward to learning together again very soon.
4665000	4668000	Thank you for joining me.
4673000	4675000	Key and lock.
4675000	4693000	May your path and life, relationships, streaming and opportunities be beautiful, rich, fulfilling, and exquisite.
4693000	4696000	Bye-bye for now.
