0	29960	Hello everybody. Welcome. It is Saturday, 1st of June, 2024, the year when
29960	58680	schizogenic insanity was normalized when understanding became its opposite. Where ignorance and the polarity
58680	75260	of abject opinionated ignorance and the light of the origins of intelligence and insight
75260	88500	flipped over so that the former took the throne of the latter in our cultures and consciousness
88500	94540	and thought and language as I've been seeing many examples of today. And yet there are
94540	113720	bastions of insight and awareness, learning, discovery, growth, self-correction, and the mutual
113720	124240	encompassment of inquiry. Amen Hillman recently said something so right. He's like, you're not
124240	130000	going to believe me, bro, but this word history, it comes from a Greek root that means asking a
130000	142600	question of an oracle, an oracle, the living spirit of insight, divine wisdom embodied in a young
142600	157360	woman in ancient Greece, an oracle. History was a question, not a declaration, not a record of the
157360	186080	authorized version of what had been a dream. I was listening this morning to messages
186640	201200	from my friend, Tim Sanderson, brilliantly embodied, soulful, heartful, more than human being. His
201200	211560	voice is so soft. And, you know, he complains that he was never really an intellectual, never truly an
211560	223920	academic, but was lost instead in the reveries of his fervent imaginings. I was like, the whole, you
223920	232680	know, 78% of the amphitheater of my ancestors stood up in their graves, like, yes, wild cheering ensued.
233680	247760	Though, you know, both paths, the intellect is profound when it's funded by its origins, when it
247760	257440	reveres its origins in dreaming and emotion and passion. And part of that passion is the quest
257440	285320	the quest for the superposition above the concept of justice. If the concept of justice means,
285800	297240	or is taken to mean, is clumsily and crudely taken to mean, a kind of accounting where transgressors
297240	308560	must be called to task and made to pay, because apparently wrongdoing is a banking system. This
308680	319680	sort of insanity, this, this branch on the upside down burning tree of ignorance, flagrantly
319680	335560	masquerading as propriety, purity is perennially horrifying. We see the results today in specific
335560	350320	conflicts, I will not hear name. We see this reenacted, devastating, nonsense masquerading as
350320	359080	justification, wherever that may happen. And it happens in me. I'm familiar with the stink of
359080	366000	this, the fingerprint, the poison, yeah, the poisoned fingerprint of my own thumb at the
366000	374280	beginning of some crime scene where I decide vengeance will be mine. Retribution will be the
374280	388520	spirit of the day, you know. And it's not that there's no place for that. Rather, its place should
388520	403480	be rare at best, at most, and funded by brilliant insight, not regimented ignorance, structured
403480	419600	into rules and laws and things. You know, the quest is for understanding exceptionally profuse
419600	430840	throat clearing, apparently. Honking in the interception. And throwing the children off the
430840	442080	bridge into the river to teach them to swim. Just had to get the little ones in there because,
442080	448720	you know, apparently everyone forgets they're alive or pretends that something else is going on.
448720	458800	Not everyone, but the collectives definitely. Just like children who cares, boom, guns, blow it up.
458800	472760	Destroy those mothers for the sake of some declaration. Bliterate them, blood and gore,
472760	483160	fields of broken bones, chaos. Yeah, if that's the mark of sanity or intelligence among the humans,
483520	491800	then get me off this planet, please. Which, you know, for many sensitive and intelligent children is
491800	501200	the slogan they'd wear on their t-shirt. How could I have been born on a planet where the humans
501200	508200	treat each other like a lawn that just needs a good mowing? And yet, at the same time, there's
508240	523960	clearly some truth behind that delusion. The idea of harrowing that we find in certain
523960	534720	misconstrued biblical texts is nonetheless important. We do actually not eat the chaff of the wheat.
535720	544000	We eat the tender seed inside it and are thus nourished and our generations are rejuvenated by the
544000	553080	magic they're in. Meanwhile, the highly sensitive person sees the box of cream of wheat as cream of
553080	562280	wheat. The screaming of the plants as they're sited in the fields, back when we used to actually have
562320	578960	to manually harvest food for grain. Meanwhile, these people are feeding ducks bread, which, you know,
578960	584120	maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Pretty sure that those straight-up carbs are
584160	594280	poisoned to waterfowl, but these are city waterfowl, so who knows? And why should I trust my own biases
594280	602520	and judgments? The world is complicated. It's like a million spiderwebs intersecting and you try to,
602520	612640	what? Determine the value of the intersections via some combination of emotional valence and rational
612680	623040	thought. Okay. Hopefully the emotional valence is actually there and veritable and not just the
623040	628120	result of doubling down on previous biases and resentments and triggerings and so forth.
628120	639440	The dopamine ratchet, right? The neurochemical ratcheting that we undergo via media and spectacle
640400	653200	Facebook, Twitter. I mean, what a more ironic, you know, the collective mangling of intelligence
654160	674800	of many twits. A crowd of twits. Of course, there are brilliant voices in the morass. There are
674800	682160	those of us who, well, I counted myself among them. Did you see, see what I did there? There are those
682240	694200	of us who courageously and steadfastly hold the line in the cataclysm of ignorance and
694200	709680	opinionation we call social media today. I'm actually trying to understand that one of the
709680	719200	things that became clear to me when I listened to the dulcet tones of my friend Tim this morning
720720	725920	was just how that he doesn't stray from his embodiment when he speaks. And when he says I
725920	731120	couldn't, you know, I appreciated and sort of, he doesn't say I'm putting words in his mouth,
731120	738160	but he meant something that resembles I revered beautiful examples of intellectualism and
739120	745520	in academia, but I couldn't, I couldn't, I'm not, I'm not a library of Alexandria. I'm a dreamer.
747440	753920	And what's so beautiful about that is that comes to mind for me that I take from it is a couple
753920	761280	of things right away, a couple of things immediately. And the first is that the origin of the possibility
761360	767040	of memory and intelligence lies in dreaming dreaming.
771840	772480	It is the
775440	784240	the activity of angels in our minds that tend the gardens of memory so that they
785680	789040	flourish and thrive and blossom and fruit.
792240	800720	That imagination he speaks of is primordially fundamental. And there's no such thing as
800720	806640	intellect without it. So what he's really saying is in my view is I revere
810240	819680	the primordial origins from which the possibilities of intellect spring. I remain true to these.
819680	830080	I adore these. I belong to these, to them, to their spirit, to their action, to their bodies.
830080	840640	I am theirs. They are mine. We are one. And that's profound. Beautiful. I agree. I contrasted myself.
840640	850480	I was like, after singing the praises of his failure to dissociate into his intellect,
852000	861680	I talked about my own weaknesses of such a form where
861680	871920	my intellect is like a UFO and I wake up in the morning and it's glowing there in the center
871920	881600	of the room. And I trace the sigils on the unbroken surface of this egg-shaped sphere.
882880	886320	A door appears with blinding light surrounding it.
886320	896080	It becomes a portal. I step in and, fume, I'm out of my body. I'm in wild, transcendental,
896880	909280	dissociative ecstasies far above my mundane soma, my flesh, my nervous system, my bones,
909280	917120	my organs. And they're like, wait, what just happened here? Darren is already dead?
922560	929840	Because that's sort of what's going on. I'm, in a way, untransported.
930160	942400	I'm in the spirit world before my passing. I'm seeing from after my death back into my life.
944800	952000	And it doesn't require drugs. It just requires ideas and language and my passionate fascination
952000	962320	with focus and my adoration of their mystery and horror and splendor and potential.
967760	976880	In a way, I long ago and without really the use of drugs. In fact, in the most sober
977520	989760	epochs of my life as a young adult and in my 30s, I knew the kisses of the muses.
991600	1000240	And I didn't know what to call it, because this is the true state of blissful naivete,
1000960	1012960	where you haven't been separated from it. It hasn't been taken from you. So you have no way
1012960	1020880	to refer to it, because there's no need to refer to it. It's not separate, right?
1021360	1031680	Right? The reference comes after the divorce, after the abstraction, after the loss, after the fall.
1034720	1041760	I mean, any of us who have sought wisdom, oh my god, what an ironic,
1042080	1052080	what an ironic situation we will find ourselves in. Any of us who have sought wisdom
1054880	1063840	and tasted of the nectars of her mouth. Thilo, so kissing, kissing. That saliva,
1064800	1073600	the trophallaxis, which is the transmission of hormones and nutrients among hymenoptera,
1074560	1080880	the ants, the bees, the wasps, often between species, not often, sometimes.
1081520	1088240	Right? Sometimes ants and wasps may exchange trophallactic
1090720	1095680	nectars, and they call them. There's no word in English.
1100080	1107120	They are trans-sigenic. They come before the generation of minds. They're primordial,
1107120	1122880	and there's nectars, elixirs, filters, P-H-I-L, T-R-E-S, I think. They're sometimes spelled, E-R-S.
1124720	1132160	Yeah, I was having congress with the muses before I understood they existed formally,
1133040	1141760	before I knew how to speak of it, and they were reforging my mind and my dreaming,
1143600	1154880	resurrecting them moment to moment in my waking life, in my creative life, in my writing,
1155840	1162240	and my creative play, my music, literally music,
1166640	1167440	my quests.
1172960	1178080	And so, you know, I learned to kind of look down on ceremonial magic,
1178160	1189920	because there's feral enchantments that seem to me to far exceed the possibilities of structured
1189920	1199280	representation, ritual, and so forth. And when you have those, you would never trade them for
1202560	1203920	the bones of the thing.
1208960	1216320	But these days, that magic is much more rare than it was in my youth. And so,
1220160	1231520	I know, intimately, the body and wings of my intellect, and
1231520	1242080	I will gladly depart the graveyard of my waking mind for the skies beyond it.
1245600	1253120	Though I only fairly recently came to understand I was doing this, it was so natural, my trepidation
1253680	1261520	of incarnate existence and somato-emotional
1261920	1266320	hystericity.
1272800	1279520	Yeah, like a layered archaia, a layered archaia of my
1279920	1291680	confusions, losses, injuries, sufferings, subjugations, enslavements,
1294880	1303760	all inflected, inflected with by, with and by the peculiarly weird
1304400	1311840	perspective from outside the personal, the
1314960	1322160	bizarre perspective that generates some of the branches on the trees of psychosis, paranoia,
1323120	1333840	self-criticism, the possibility of social critique, of public critique, of how others
1333840	1345920	might have seen me, of how the others of myself might direct the cruel illuminations of critical
1346000	1356880	judgment. And this is part of why I say that is not now and never shall be justice.
1359840	1372240	Condemnation and justice have nearly nothing in common. For justice, it seems to me, must be
1372240	1383040	the, now I'm going to get in trouble here because I'm going to make structured language about
1383040	1393600	something that has to be fluidly transcendent in its natures and in actions. It must have a body
1394560	1397920	that isn't conceptual, that isn't linguistic.
1403200	1407280	All right, but I'll dare. I mean, it's the first part of my name, right? Dare in.
1410320	1418400	Don't get named this. If you want to get born as a human, don't go here. I was actually named
1418400	1426000	for Bobby Darin, a singer, one of Melodious Voice. And when I was little, I used to sing all the
1426000	1431120	time and my parents would constantly try to make me stop, but I was actually fairly good at it.
1433440	1438640	These days, I'm older and unpracticed, but I would love, I used to sing in a choir, singing is really,
1439600	1446400	that's so funny, a choir. In any case, where I'm going here is that
1448720	1457600	actual justice uses the problems that emerge in what we might think of as criminal behavior
1457600	1467520	that we would hold some individual god to account for. Okay, wow. Now, there's sort of at least
1467520	1475040	two different meanings of account here. One is to explain to us, right? Help us understand
1475840	1483280	your motivations. That's one kind of an account. But the other kind is we will
1486480	1493520	debit to you. We will debit your life. We will, we will subtract from you relationships, time,
1493520	1500240	freedom, as if what we have in our modern societies even slightly resembles freedom.
1501040	1505040	But it does compared to being in a, you know, a stone box.
1510560	1515520	So yeah, this debiting, this accounting, which is
1516160	1527760	the very absence of humanity, intelligence, insight, awareness, justice, truth, the virtues.
1529120	1537920	It is a catastrophic abeyance of virtue and understanding.
1537920	1543120	So as I've said many times before,
1552960	1560160	what we ache for when injustice has taken place is not punishment.
1561120	1575760	We ache for the subtraction from the world of the forces, ideas, and situations, the traps
1576320	1590240	that led what we call the perpetrator to enact the quote crime,
1590240	1598720	unquote. And we've been confused
1602160	1608480	to desire further poison. We've been poisoned. The poison killed our heart.
1609120	1615680	And now we want to make a small poison and poison a million hearts. Poison the future,
1615680	1621680	poison history. Just lay waste
1624560	1632720	to the origins of our humanity, our souls, virtue, understanding, awareness. What we really want
1635360	1644480	is the context to be healed so that such crimes become not nearly unnecessary,
1645200	1653440	but impossible. Right? That's what justice looks like. It looks like using the intelligence we
1653440	1662880	can derive from the perpetrator as the symptom of something wrong in the water of our communal
1663600	1670720	identity or failure to establish it, to sustain it, truly.
1674080	1685200	Wow. These people are making floral reeds. I'm so jealous. It's awesome.
1686160	1695520	Oh my god, what's the, uh, is this a Greek symbol on the blanket? Sure looks like it.
1702960	1708000	It's amazing. They're actually being human together. It's fucking awesome. I love this.
1708320	1718880	By the way, you know, one form of justice is, doesn't concern itself with history at all.
1719520	1726320	It concerns itself with re-beautifying the present in such a way that the, that the integrity
1727120	1735280	and profound beauty of the future becomes repossibilized, right? Resurrected from its,
1735280	1742400	you know, cascade of falling off 19 different cliffs of vengeful stupidity and ignorance.
1747280	1752960	Yeah, that's what they're doing up there. That's celebration. I don't know the etymology
1754000	1760320	of the word justice or the word crime or perpetrator or celebration.
1761280	1768080	Um, I understand alphabetically some things about these words, but I'm not going to, uh,
1768080	1777600	descend into that labyrinth at the moment. Rather, I will stay in the path. But what those humans up
1777600	1786080	there are doing with their laughter, amituality and joyful, communality and floral, you know,
1786080	1792960	breathing each other's, literally their heads, right? They're breathing each other's heads with
1792960	1802080	flowers. Think about what this actually means, all right? It's very astonishing because on the one
1802080	1812400	hand they are breathing their heads with magical substances comprised over trillions and trillions
1812400	1822800	of lifetimes of these plants, without which we would not exist. So these plants are the progenitors.
1822800	1829920	In a sense, the fairies are, the fairies and the elves are the spirits of these plants and their
1829920	1835520	relationships and their histories with the land and the mountains and the skies and the waters. Okay?
1836480	1848480	Um, so they are breathing each other's heads just for a moment in joyful, mutual celebration
1849520	1855840	and promotion, right? They are raising each other up in the light of the sun on the top of the
1855920	1862640	Strawberry Hill in San Francisco, the place, you know, named after Francis of Assisi,
1864480	1873040	who probably actually was amazingly virtuous and brilliant and perhaps even wholly human being,
1873040	1880560	regardless of, you know, the fact, yeah, has nothing to do with the fact of the association,
1880560	1888000	the, the cohort, yeah, what, which cohorts we would associate him with and why, right? I mean,
1888000	1895920	it could have a little to do with it, but yeah, it's just, so yeah, they're up there
1895920	1903280	breathing each other's heads and drinking wine and celebrating and laughing and loving each other
1904240	1910320	and being human together. Wow, what a healing moment and notice that it's not
1910320	1917360	formal, it's not a ritual that they're enacting. It's spontaneous, it's improvised
1919120	1924160	and, you know, it's probably someone's birthday or maybe someone was just married or maybe someone
1924160	1932880	had a child or maybe they were just like, hey, you know, it's Saturday, it's Saturn,
1932880	1946640	it's the day of Saturn, that S, S-T-R, right? Sigma Tau Rho, as Amu would say, yeah, Sigma Tau Rho.
1947360	1957920	Yeah, so beautiful and inspiring and evocative of memory. They are breathing each other's
1957920	1967040	foreheads with flowers and one of them knows how to do this in an expert way. They have probably
1967040	1975680	hemp vines or strings that are being soaked in a liquid to make them especially pliable
1977360	1984080	and they had just baskets of flowers to weave into the vines. So brilliant.
1985760	1992960	So one of the kinds of justice is that we go forward from here in remembrance of mutual beauty
1992960	2004080	and origin. Think about that, right? No historical damnations, indictments, because think about
2004080	2011440	this. If you have to preserve the history of wrongdoing as you walk forward into life and
2011440	2018560	the potentials of your more than merely human life, if you have to preserve all those indictments and
2019600	2027920	you know, equivocate over them and punish them and wow, the problem with that is there are certain
2027920	2036000	kinds of burden that get heavier by a matter of, you know, geometric expansion, right? Like
2037760	2046640	exponential, they get exponentially heavier each moment that you continue to preserve them.
2047600	2055360	And we don't notice this because the urge to preserve them is one of the lethal games that
2055360	2061840	smuggled into our consciousness along with the process, you know, during the processes of
2061840	2067680	in-languaging and in-culturation as children. We think that English comes with no baggage.
2068560	2073360	Nothing like that is even possibly true. The opposite is true. There are, you know,
2077520	2081200	there are vast warehouses of lethal
2085760	2092640	tropes, right? Figures of speech, metaphor, simile.
2099680	2107120	I was trying to think of some, but I'm not, I'm not dwelling in the warehouses at the moment.
2107120	2112400	I'm dwelling above them, so it's hard for me to dip down and grab exemplars.
2116080	2124800	All kinds of courtroom mine tropes,
2127840	2134720	war mine tropes, vengeance tropes, but just think of how
2135280	2141520	metabolically, energetically, and spiritually expensive it is to preserve harms. And some will
2141520	2150160	say, well, you can't just ignore them. Okay, maybe, maybe, sometimes. But actually, you can do this
2150160	2156000	thing that's transcendentally useful, which is not to take offense in the first place.
2156800	2162240	And if you've noticed you've taken offense, you're going to have to carry that. You sure you want
2162240	2167360	that? Do you go to the store ever? Did you ever once go to the mall or the grocery store and find
2167440	2173760	the most disgusting, heaviest thing you could find, right? A box of rotten, dead rat corpses or
2173760	2178640	something, right? Huge box, weighs like three tons, and you carry that thing home and you drag it
2178640	2184960	along with you for the rest of your, not once, ever did you do this, right? So why do we do this
2184960	2191280	psycho-emotionally? Why do we decide to take offense? It's the most expensive thing you could take,
2192000	2195440	and it grows catastrophically more expensive the longer you preserve it.
2197600	2203840	And I hear, you know, in the background, the voices of those of us who have suffered actual
2204720	2210880	indignities and catastrophic harms or rape or, you know, horrifying violence or murder.
2213680	2219440	I hear their voices saying, what shall we just forget it? No. But what are we going to do with it?
2220240	2223120	What will we make of it? The fact that I got,
2224880	2230400	the fact that something that happened to me was horrifyingly bad. I mean, recently something
2230400	2240000	happened that I definitely took offense to. A doctor, specifically a doctor at Ocean Park Health
2240000	2249120	Center, Chan, overtly denied that an episode in my medical history ever took place. This didn't
2249120	2259440	happen. And I was like, first of all, who are you again? It'd be like someone saying, you know,
2262320	2268080	that a mother didn't give birth to her child or, but she never had a child or something. Not that
2268080	2272960	my injury is my child. I'm not trying to make that association. I'm just saying that it actually
2272960	2278400	took place that I was treated for a specific illness by a specific doctor at a specific time.
2279120	2287680	And she's overtly said, nope, never happened. Can't have happened. There's no such diagnosis,
2287680	2293840	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I found it very offensive. I wrote her a letter saying, you know,
2293840	2302160	this is alarming your behavior. I'm not sure that a doctor, I mean, you can see why, you know,
2302160	2312720	why I was offended. But in this moment as I'm remembering this experience, which I conceive
2312720	2321120	of as a violation, right, the whole of my identity begins to collapse into something that can be
2321120	2330560	violated. Is that liberty? Is that virtue? Is that intelligence? Is that insight? Is that truth?
2333280	2340080	Why would I even take the time to take offense? Now, in some cases,
2342400	2347840	it's reasonable for us to assert what we today talk about as boundaries.
2351440	2360160	But if this becomes our fascination, whoa, W-O-E be unto us. If our fascination
2361840	2367600	and our obsession becomes the maintenance of boundaries in a world of real and imagined
2367600	2373360	violations, our humanity will collapse into an uninhabitable skeleton of
2374000	2383120	a doubt, confusion, despair. We must live beyond what happens to us and our possible
2383120	2393280	interpretations. And we also must speak up when a violation is tangibly real and not just imagined
2393280	2403280	or a projection. But again, the obsession with, I'm just a magnet for the violation of, you know,
2403280	2413040	whatever it may be, isn't a livable identity. There's not enough there, inside there, to dwell in it.
2414000	2418000	So I certainly recognize
2422480	2423200	the urge.
2428800	2434800	In some cases, for something resembling redress of wrongdoing,
2435200	2439840	but it's a very, very dangerous
2443280	2451200	balancing game. And most often in modern society, that game becomes malignant quickly.
2452320	2455040	We have the wrong idea. We think there are individuals.
2455520	2463360	There's all kinds of ridiculous, pre-existing
2464080	2471440	conditionality that is nonsensical. And as the result of the terrifying reflections of
2473280	2480400	isolation, which could be literally understood as meaning, I am so late.
2481360	2488160	I am behind time. Time is way ahead of me. Relation is way ahead of me. I am alone.
2489280	2494960	And my cohort is far, it's so far ahead of me that I don't belong to it anymore.
2496480	2505520	I so late, I on. That I on means a self and also a particle and possibly a particle that
2505520	2515840	transmits or preserves something in the sense that I am here highlighting creatively.
2515840	2536480	There's so much for us to learn and recover and celebrate. We should be very careful.
2537440	2542880	Life is short. Existence is brief. We should make it beautiful together,
2542880	2546960	within for each other in the history and future of life and our peoples.
2548720	2556000	Fundamentally, these are one people, one family. It's all there is on this tiny little rock.
2557120	2565520	It's moist rock floating around in time space. This is our home. This is our body. These are
2565520	2576080	our people. There's no other people. And the idea of the individual as we ridiculously are
2576080	2584640	tortured by it today. People are like, oh, he's a fucking communist. No. Like, how many of your
2584640	2591040	cells in your body are individuals? Let me ask you this. Does it matter at all?
2591040	2610000	Does their individuality matter at all if the body dies? What are you going to make of their individuality then?
2621920	2636640	It's funny, the photograph I've just taken will probably become the photo I use
2636640	2650240	for this recording later.
2666960	2678800	This idea of individuals and their rights is exemplary of the loss of communal meat,
2678800	2686000	of the context, of the meaningful context of our humanity over time.
2686160	2697200	As our context became abstract, representational, commercial, domineering, viral,
2698080	2706880	frisbee, falsifications of the possibility of communal, meaningful communal experience,
2706880	2714880	roles, identity, behavior. So one of the things I saw up on top of the mountain
2715920	2720800	or the little hill, Strawberry Hill, was a reenaction of that possibility.
2721600	2727840	However brief and ephemeral, not even more powerful for all of its brevity,
2728560	2737280	even more powerful for its inability to fundamentally change. It's like
2742640	2750000	it's one droplet in an ocean, but that droplet shines so brightly that the entire ocean is
2750000	2761200	transformed in its spirit, if not its physical activity. So those droplets matter. That's
2761200	2771440	what I call real. It's easy to forget this because we look in our modernity and we see
2771440	2784320	a trillion, I'm going to stop saying my pause phrase, we see a trillion violations.
2787200	2794560	I'll just pick one, microplastics. Trillion violations per second. What can we do?
2795120	2804320	Is there even a we to do things? No, there isn't. And if we form a we to do things,
2806000	2810080	it's going to be like attempting to eat the moon or swallow the ocean, won't it?
2812800	2817440	And so it seems that the possibility of enacting change is pre-prohibited.
2818160	2824560	There's no real way. And a number of my friends have spoken to me about this.
2826320	2832480	I'll mention particularly Sean, who is working with PAWS AI
2834880	2841280	and express his despair. What can we do? We can't stop it.
2841840	2850720	And I explained to him the principle that I was orbiting here, which is that
2851840	2859040	when we live beautiful lives and we witness and speak together for each other for the history
2859040	2866640	and future of life on our world and of beings of all beings, when this is done with authenticity
2866640	2880240	and passion and love, that always matters. It's not necessarily that the gods, that the victors
2880240	2884160	in a situation are favored of the gods as we might imagine.
2887680	2894720	And there's something above the gods, above the gods. There's something beyond the gods,
2895680	2901440	that even they must obey. And this is the principle for which they executed Socrates.
2903840	2913200	But he dared, they used him of atheism because he said something resembling
2914720	2920160	that even the gods must obey the spirit of truth. Even the gods are subject to this.
2920800	2930960	And this was the spear point they used for his indictment and prosecution.
2933840	2934960	He was an oracle.
2940560	2948400	He was a male oracle. But instead of declaring wisdom, he fomented it.
2948400	2957200	He fermented it among the people. He would bring them together in the Quora and ferment
2958320	2961600	the nectar of wisdom from within their hearts and spirits.
2965680	2972400	And this made him lethal to the fictions that then ruled Athens.
2972640	2982560	The warmongers, the weapon makers, Plato's parents, Plato's father, his brothers, his family.
2988000	2993280	We should take these matters gravely with grave seriousness and attend them carefully.
2993600	3004480	The possibilities of the spirit of democracy, the spirits from which democracy originated,
3005680	3013120	those possibilities still exist today. Unenacted, overlooked, falsified, counterfeited.
3015920	3022160	And democracy doesn't just mean the voting of idiots. It's not the idea at all.
3023520	3030400	It's, I don't actually know what it is, but I can say how I conceive of it, which is the communal
3031520	3038080	preservation and purification of the context of our relationships, such that it becomes possible
3039920	3046080	to not merely know what is true and good and do that, but also to avoid
3046960	3054240	what is lethal and malignant and destroys history in the future and falsifies it and counterfeits
3054240	3059760	it and sells us the remains of it at ever-increasing prices, destroying the mothers and the children
3059760	3066560	and the fathers and the ancestors and the progeny. That must be avoided.
3066560	3079520	So these are my thoughts for the day. I'm grateful to have this opportunity to speak them
3079520	3086080	and share them with you. I hope you find them inspiring and that you are inspired enough to
3086080	3097040	become historical, perhaps to learn the ancient Greek and other ancient languages,
3097040	3103920	but particularly the Greek, and to ask questions of the oracles, to ask the imperative questions that
3103920	3110480	you brought to your human incarnation and your more than human existence, your more than merely
3110480	3120960	human existence, that is precious and noble in its essence, that is beautiful in its origin
3123520	3131760	and transcendental in its natures. May your paths and relations, questions and dreams be blessed.
3131760	3135040	Alive for now.
