0	2000	Testing.
2000	4000	Yep.
4000	6000	Ah, yes.
6000	8000	So,
8000	10000	do me the favor
10000	12000	of
12000	14000	saying your name
14000	16000	so that I don't mispronounce it.
16000	18000	Yep.
18000	20000	Balapile.
20000	22000	Balapile.
22000	24000	Yes, and I am Darren Stevenson,
24000	26000	so we are here in a conversation together
26000	28000	that I wanted to record.
28000	30000	Because it was becoming,
30000	32000	as I expected,
32000	34000	it too very interesting.
34000	36000	Balah had been discussing
36000	38000	something
38000	40000	in
40000	42000	ideas
42000	44000	from a specific
44000	46000	person
46000	48000	whose name you can say.
48000	50000	Actually, maybe you can just go over
50000	52000	briefly.
52000	54000	Yeah.
54000	56000	Okay, I'll do that.
56000	58000	What I was talking about is
58000	60000	the notion of
60000	62000	network state.
62000	64000	As in any T, W, R, K
64000	66000	second word state, S, T, A,
66000	68000	T, E, network state.
68000	70000	Um,
70000	72000	chat called Balaji Srimivasan,
72000	74000	quite a
74000	76000	personality, known personality online.
76000	78000	Um, used to be CTO
78000	80000	of Coinbase.
80000	82000	But,
82000	84000	you know, it's not just a crypto guy,
84000	86000	it's no crypto, very well read,
86000	88000	you know, history, background,
88000	90000	people.
90000	92000	You could summarize him as a pro-anarchy guy,
92000	94000	right, who doesn't take
94000	96000	limits of, um,
96000	98000	government and all that as limits.
98000	100000	So,
100000	102000	his,
102000	104000	what the network state means is,
104000	106000	right,
106000	108000	you can form
108000	110000	enough of the ethos,
110000	112000	and the common
112000	114000	wealth
114000	116000	of a group of people
116000	118000	online,
118000	120000	and then later,
120000	122000	right, enough of the cohorts
122000	124000	can, you know,
124000	126000	could have agreed
126000	128000	to where they want to stay,
128000	130000	and live in a place where they,
130000	132000	uh,
132000	134000	where they get along.
134000	136000	Where they're physically approximate
136000	138000	so that they can collaborate
138000	140000	in each other's
140000	142000	life development.
142000	144000	Yep.
144000	146000	Right, so that,
146000	148000	um, this is much more,
148000	150000	it's not impossible to do at a distance.
150000	152000	Yep.
152000	154000	But it's much more difficult.
154000	156000	Absolutely.
156000	158000	Well, there are more challenges.
158000	160000	Um, yeah, it's just,
160000	162000	it's a different space of
162000	164000	challenge for
164000	166000	those who are not proximal.
166000	168000	Um,
168000	170000	but you said something
170000	172000	that I thought was hilarious.
172000	174000	You were like,
174000	176000	I'm brilliant.
176000	178000	Go ahead, you were talking about somebody
178000	180000	buying a house.
180000	182000	Okay, the background word is this, right?
182000	184000	I've gone through all those states.
184000	186000	What do I mean by all those states?
186000	188000	You know,
188000	190000	living,
190000	192000	grew up in a semi-rural village,
192000	194000	you know, where everybody
194000	196000	knew everybody and,
196000	198000	you know, it's a tropical place
198000	200000	so that you're never worried about
200000	202000	money because it seemed like,
202000	204000	why do you, you know,
204000	206000	food was available all over the place
206000	208000	and you could go and sleep in anybody's house.
208000	210000	So what's your problem?
210000	212000	You know, right?
212000	214000	That was, um, and then,
214000	216000	but my parents
216000	218000	have moved from India
218000	220000	to Malaysia,
220000	222000	right?
222000	224000	My father had gone through the struggles
224000	226000	in India and in some,
226000	228000	in Malaysia, he was continuing
228000	230000	in Malaysia
230000	232000	and he was driven
232000	234000	to have,
234000	236000	to have lots more money under the pillow,
236000	238000	right?
238000	240000	And on that, later,
240000	242000	he was just full on into like,
242000	244000	being a stingy guy
244000	246000	who saves and saves and saves
246000	248000	and for good reason because of his
248000	250000	background, right?
250000	252000	Right, his history, yeah.
252000	254000	After that, and the British rule
254000	256000	in India, right?
256000	258000	His tough times, right?
258000	260000	Uh, there were tough times. So in Malaysia
260000	262000	it's easier but he didn't realize it
262000	264000	that easier. So he,
264000	266000	he went on a spree of, um,
266000	268000	ah, so what he would do
268000	270000	is buy one property upon property
270000	272000	upon property and including
272000	274000	our house itself,
274000	276000	what we call,
276000	278000	the house, the family house,
278000	280000	his only concern was
280000	282000	to replace, you know, if you buy this house,
282000	284000	ah, what's the replacement value?
284000	286000	If I were to sell it, how much money would I get,
286000	288000	you know? Um,
288000	290000	he didn't care about much
290000	292000	anything else and then
292000	294000	me, right,
294000	296000	ah, has to pay for that
296000	298000	because it has completely broken up
298000	300000	the family.
300000	302000	As compared to,
302000	304000	you know, now my adopted village,
304000	306000	Darren, is a village
306000	308000	in Indonesia, in Java.
308000	310000	It's a zero crime village
310000	312000	similar to the kind of village
312000	314000	my father was born in, right?
314000	316000	Uh, they didn't live there
316000	318000	on age 18
318000	320000	and there,
320000	322000	the values
322000	324000	fit with the village, the people
324000	326000	despite the rest of the world not
326000	328000	wanting to have anything to do with zero crime
328000	330000	villagers because it's got
330000	332000	consequences, right?
332000	334000	It's got consequences.
334000	336000	For example, people won't
336000	338000	be fronting wealth because they won't
338000	340000	be much wealth, it'll be culturally
340000	342000	communist, right?
342000	344000	Yes, yes.
344000	346000	But you will not worry about old age
346000	348000	and children being taken care of because
348000	350000	the people love to take care
350000	352000	of other people.
352000	354000	Yes, they are living in a
354000	356000	traditional
356000	358000	a traditional context
358000	360000	where
360000	362000	everyone takes care, not
362000	364000	not every single person,
364000	366000	most of the people take care
366000	368000	of each other
368000	370000	and they understand
370000	372000	so this changes their role
372000	374000	as a human being,
374000	376000	right? Transforms
376000	378000	their role as a human being
378000	380000	from I am here for me
380000	382000	and mine
382000	384000	or just I am here for me
386000	388000	to we are here together
388000	390000	for each other.
390000	392000	Yeah.
392000	394000	If you don't have that,
394000	396000	I will argue, if you don't have
396000	398000	we are here together for each other
398000	400000	you don't have humans yet.
400000	402000	You have something
402000	404000	weird. It's not human.
404000	406000	That's it.
406000	408000	And I want to
408000	410000	stamp it even further.
410000	412000	Yeah, by all means.
414000	416000	I mean
416000	418000	I've grown up in like
418000	420000	fighting a lot of people,
420000	422000	probably
422000	424000	post
424000	426000	you know, post university
426000	428000	even in university it didn't
428000	430000	occur to me.
430000	432000	Maybe particularly from the 90s onwards
432000	434000	okay, basically
434000	436000	I'm into unconditional love
436000	438000	that
438000	440000	I'm with again and again.
440000	442000	Bala, why are you being...
442000	444000	The thing that I find hilarious about what you said
444000	446000	is that
446000	448000	linguistically it's backwards.
448000	450000	It's not that you're into unconditional love,
450000	452000	it's that you didn't
452000	454000	defect from it.
456000	458000	Right?
458000	460000	That's the natural position
460000	462000	for human beings.
462000	464000	You simply didn't defect
466000	468000	in my view, but please continue.
468000	470000	I'm with you.
470000	472000	Yeah, so exactly
472000	474000	because my mother
474000	476000	grew up
476000	478000	in such a place.
478000	480000	So she didn't know anything
480000	482000	else and she went to great lengths.
482000	484000	Oh my god.
484000	486000	Consequences.
486000	488000	But leave all of those
488000	490000	cause, you know,
490000	492000	talking to you, one of the greatest things about
492000	494000	talking to you Darren is, you can talk
494000	496000	about things that are, you might
496000	498000	have a long life
498000	500000	taught its age, unconventional, so kind of like
500000	502000	censor that a bit, you know.
502000	504000	No, you can do whatever you want
504000	506000	so I love it, you know, okay.
506000	508000	So I
508000	510000	loved, you know,
510000	512000	my mother was the epitome of unconditional
512000	514000	love and I love that.
514000	516000	Beautiful.
516000	518000	You know, it didn't occur
518000	520000	full on to me at that time, right?
520000	522000	It occurred enough, but because
522000	524000	occurred enough as in, you know,
524000	526000	when the world became
526000	528000	difficult, there's one person
528000	530000	that you could go to who has got time, patients
530000	532000	for you. She listened
532000	534000	and she won't, you know, abruptly
534000	536000	stop you halfway or say that
536000	538000	that's a silly idea.
538000	540000	She will take it that it's possible
540000	542000	that her child may know something that she doesn't,
542000	544000	you know, right?
544000	546000	And that was
546000	548000	special, right, in this
548000	550000	kind of like cruel world, right?
550000	552000	Extremely beautiful, yes.
554000	556000	So I want
556000	558000	to continue that and I was not going to
558000	560000	stop, agree
560000	562000	with anybody who said it's impossible.
562000	564000	You know, you can't.
564000	566000	And later in life,
566000	568000	of late, I realized, no,
568000	570000	they,
570000	572000	many who say it's impossible
572000	574000	are only saying it because
574000	576000	our narrative has so much
576000	578000	become zero or
578000	580000	100 binary.
580000	582000	It's like, if something is not
582000	584000	exact, you know, it's like, can you guarantee
584000	586000	me that 100%
586000	588000	you know, that person who is
588000	590000	in your village, you can have unconditional love?
590000	592000	Well, the real answer is
592000	594000	why do you even, why can't it be
594000	596000	fuzzy at the edges?
596000	598000	Say again.
598000	600000	Even when we do math
600000	602000	or graphs, you know, we cut off the
602000	604000	extremes and that's good enough
604000	606000	if you can manage it 90% but, you know,
606000	608000	there are outliers but you don't need
608000	610000	to like spend your whole lifetime
610000	612000	passing the last 2%
612000	614000	you know.
614000	616000	Okay, you've touched on something, wait,
616000	618000	you've touched on something I want to highlight.
618000	620000	Please
620000	622000	nurture your
622000	624000	line of thought and where you are going
624000	626000	so that you can hold on to it for a second.
626000	628000	But I
628000	630000	want to say something, the zero 100
630000	632000	thing. So
632000	634000	as children
634000	636000	eventually
636000	638000	we attempt things
638000	640000	that are at least
640000	642000	initially, they are
642000	644000	impossible. Okay?
644000	646000	It is initially
646000	648000	impossible for you to
648000	650000	stand up.
650000	652000	It is initially impossible for you to take
652000	654000	a step.
654000	656000	It is initially impossible
656000	658000	for you to jump
658000	660000	or run
660000	662000	or walk or speak
662000	664000	or swim
664000	666000	or hold your breath underwater
666000	668000	or ride a bicycle
668000	670000	or write language.
670000	672000	All of these things start out
672000	674000	initially impossible
674000	676000	and if we
676000	678000	evaluate them on the basis
678000	680000	that is usually used in our cultures
682000	684000	pretty much nothing is possible
684000	686000	because you can't, the only things that are
686000	688000	possible are things where you go from
688000	690000	zero to 100 in one move.
690000	692000	Right?
692000	694000	In a single move.
694000	696000	Never happened.
696000	698000	Right?
698000	700000	So we do have this mindset
700000	702000	and I was reading
702000	704000	I just want to share something from
704000	706000	a book called the dawn of everything that I was
706000	708000	reading last night.
708000	710000	We're talking about
712000	714000	our views of history being wrong
714000	716000	and we basically have two views. It was
716000	718000	wonderful. We all took care of
718000	720000	each other and then we fell from that
720000	722000	now it's every man for himself
724000	726000	and there's no way to change it.
726000	728000	The best you can hope for
728000	730000	is slight adjustments
730000	732000	to the tyrannical nonsense
732000	734000	of human society.
734000	736000	And I say this
742000	744000	as long ago as 1936
744000	746000	the prehistorian V. Gordon Child
746000	748000	wrote a book called man makes himself
748000	750000	apart from the sexist language
750000	752000	this is the spirit we wish to invoke.
752000	754000	We are projects
754000	756000	of collective self-creation.
756000	758000	We approach human history that way.
758000	760000	What if we treat people
760000	762000	from the beginning
762000	764000	as imaginative intelligent playful
764000	766000	creatures who deserve to be understood
766000	768000	as such? What if
768000	770000	instead of telling a story about how
770000	772000	our species fell from some idyllic
772000	774000	state of equality
774000	776000	we ask
776000	778000	how we came to be trapped
778000	780000	in such tight conceptual
780000	782000	shackles
782000	784000	that we no longer even imagine
784000	786000	the ability of reinventing our societies.
786000	788000	They say ourselves
788000	790000	but what they mean is
790000	792000	our societies.
794000	796000	We can't imagine it because it seems
796000	798000	like it's like a task like eating
798000	800000	the moon
800000	802000	or drinking the ocean.
802000	804000	So no one imagines
806000	808000	that it's only possible
810000	812000	it's necessary
812000	814000	to be intelligent.
814000	816000	The entire history
816000	818000	and future of life on this planet
818000	820000	may depend on the single
820000	822000	on this single pivot
822000	824000	can humans form
824000	826000	intelligent
826000	828000	aware collectives
828000	830000	with and for each other
830000	832000	and with and for the history
832000	834000	and future of life on this planet.
834000	836000	Now of course we can
836000	838000	on the small scale.
838000	840000	We can do it immediately
840000	842000	we can do it. You and I are not going to
842000	844000	have any problem doing that
844000	846000	right here, right now. We'll be doing that
846000	848000	together, right?
848000	850000	So it's immediately
850000	852000	if you just shrink the scale from
852000	854000	everything to something
854000	856000	you can do it right now
856000	858000	with any few people
858000	860000	who are motivated and sincere
860000	862000	you know, yeah.
864000	866000	Please continue.
866000	868000	Right on, right on. Excellent.
868000	870000	So, so good to hear.
870000	872000	So good to hear.
872000	874000	And you know
876000	878000	much of it is
882000	884000	self
884000	886000	it's like self fulfilling prophecy
886000	888000	or self created meaning
890000	892000	one of my biggest answer backs
892000	894000	has worked right against this notion is
894000	896000	against this notion of
896000	898000	it can't be done you know it's impossible
898000	900000	it's
900000	902000	this whole
902000	904000	hopelessness is
904000	906000	you know guys
906000	908000	if we were living
908000	910000	you know
910000	912000	before the first village
912000	914000	right and
914000	916000	the first village would never have happened
918000	920000	you know like
920000	922000	often I'll see in
922000	924000	online forums
924000	926000	like
926000	928000	the ones that you quite a lot
928000	930000	in this one the p2p foundation
930000	932000	right quite a lot of people from
932000	934000	around the world
934000	936000	and often
936000	938000	the people are so good at
938000	940000	nitpicking right
940000	942000	right and I'm like by the way these are
942000	944000	people who probably never accomplish anything
944000	946000	other than nitpicking
946000	948000	but go ahead.
948000	950000	Yeah.
950000	952000	They're professional nitpickers
952000	954000	right what do you do for a living I sit around
954000	956000	on a computer screen and pick
956000	958000	nits
958000	960000	so
960000	962000	I'm like saying hey look
962000	964000	right
964000	966000	you
966000	968000	just imagine you know
968000	970000	if our ancestors
970000	972000	very little they made the first village
972000	974000	happen if they could not get along
974000	976000	right
976000	978000	if they were egotistical
978000	980000	the first village would not have happened
980000	982000	in all likelihood it would have taken many attempts
982000	984000	for the first village to
984000	986000	to happen
986000	988000	you know to stay and be
988000	990000	maintained continue as first village
990000	992000	but we know that it
992000	994000	happened and then it went on to become
994000	996000	a small town and
996000	998000	those language and
998000	1000000	so if those people
1000000	1002000	can kind of hold their negativity
1002000	1004000	their pessimism down a bit
1004000	1006000	right to let
1006000	1008000	the blossoming as the blossoming
1008000	1010000	see in nature right despite
1010000	1012000	all the earthquakes and whatever
1012000	1014000	negative you know there may be
1014000	1016000	there still is you know
1016000	1018000	flowering and blooming and you know
1018000	1020000	joy and aesthetics
1022000	1024000	in nature
1024000	1026000	right
1026000	1028000	why can't we
1028000	1030000	look at the good
1030000	1032000	and ignore the bad
1032000	1034000	right unless the bad totally
1034000	1036000	you know cannot be
1036000	1038000	right if the house
1038000	1040000	catches on fire we'll get some water
1040000	1042000	yeah
1042000	1044000	right yeah
1044000	1046000	you know
1046000	1048000	but it's not
1048000	1050000	a matter of okay it's not a matter
1050000	1052000	of this it's a matter
1052000	1054000	I think and by all
1054000	1056000	means correct me if you see it differently
1056000	1058000	yeah it's a matter of
1058000	1060000	the
1060000	1062000	the
1062000	1064000	the
1064000	1066000	okay look
1066000	1068000	we got two different
1068000	1070000	kinds of options right
1070000	1072000	you can put humans together
1072000	1074000	you can get them to agree
1074000	1076000	to come together as a group let's say
1076000	1078000	a small group seven people
1078000	1080000	okay
1080000	1082000	and you can
1082000	1084000	say again
1084000	1086000	I said entirely
1086000	1088000	I mean nobody would argue
1088000	1090000	same person can argue against that
1090000	1092000	if you said seven people you know like
1092000	1094000	okay
1094000	1096000	right you can get seven people together
1096000	1098000	and
1098000	1100000	tell them either one of two things
1100000	1102000	okay
1102000	1104000	you're just going to learn how to
1104000	1106000	get along and help each other
1106000	1108000	yeah
1108000	1110000	and be for each other
1110000	1112000	and be together as one unit as well
1112000	1114000	as being individuals
1114000	1116000	you're either going to learn how to do that
1116000	1118000	or we're going to give you some principles
1118000	1120000	but the fundamental problem is that
1120000	1122000	there has to be a catalyst
1122000	1124000	right
1124000	1126000	there has to be a profound catalyst
1126000	1128000	that makes the people want
1128000	1130000	to be together
1130000	1132000	and to grow together
1132000	1134000	and to learn together so either
1134000	1136000	the catalyst
1136000	1138000	for most people
1138000	1140000	the catalyst is either the fear
1140000	1142000	of really bad experiences
1142000	1144000	of being human
1144000	1146000	or
1146000	1148000	it's the
1148000	1150000	it's FOMO
1150000	1152000	it's a version of FOMO
1152000	1154000	I know that being human can mean
1154000	1156000	so much more than living in this box
1156000	1158000	and watching television but I don't know
1158000	1160000	how to get to that
1160000	1162000	the fear of missing out
1162000	1164000	right those are two highly
1164000	1166000	motivated highly motivating
1166000	1168000	things but the third highly
1168000	1170000	motivating thing is a fire
1172000	1174000	right like the village is on fire
1174000	1176000	get up let's go
1176000	1178000	right or
1178000	1180000	or you know
1180000	1182000	in a city
1182000	1184000	you will see humans
1184000	1186000	form highly effective
1186000	1188000	cooperative pods
1188000	1190000	little groups right pods
1190000	1192000	spontaneously
1194000	1196000	if there is a car accident
1196000	1198000	if there is an earthquake
1198000	1200000	right
1200000	1202000	what will happen if there is an earthquake
1202000	1204000	is you will see three things
1204000	1206000	people who are sort of neutral
1206000	1208000	they don't know what the fuck to do
1208000	1210000	so they're kind of milling about
1210000	1212000	the people who are
1212000	1214000	acquisitive
1214000	1216000	these people are looking for opportunities
1216000	1218000	to profit off the situation
1218000	1220000	and then people who are
1220000	1222000	you know they convert to altruists
1222000	1224000	right we're going to help each other
1224000	1226000	get through this right now
1228000	1230000	Hey, follow up to you
1230000	1232000	you remind me of something
1232000	1234000	critical I want to ask
1234000	1236000	I wanted to ask you
1236000	1238000	let me ask you
1238000	1240000	of course
1240000	1242000	keep your thought along but I want to ask you this
1242000	1244000	you know
1244000	1246000	I've gone through a tough life
1246000	1248000	situation the last few years
1248000	1250000	and one thing you say
1250000	1252000	for me
1252000	1254000	has been a dog named Benji
1254000	1256000	right
1256000	1258000	this is not surprising even slightly
1258000	1260000	I'm listening
1260000	1262000	yeah no surprise there
1262000	1264000	I want to ask you
1264000	1266000	this one thing
1266000	1268000	it goes into the granular
1268000	1270000	of
1270000	1272000	unity
1272000	1274000	is diversity
1274000	1276000	it's not
1276000	1278000	once people don't have to riddle themselves with
1278000	1280000	finding
1280000	1282000	we can find unity within diversity
1282000	1284000	or allow for diversity
1284000	1286000	within unity
1286000	1288000	what you will find
1288000	1290000	is something like your hand
1290000	1292000	right
1292000	1294000	where you have a bunch of unique
1294000	1296000	members
1296000	1298000	and there's
1298000	1300000	no problem with the index finger
1300000	1302000	being its own finger
1302000	1304000	no problem
1304000	1306000	but they always
1306000	1308000	work together for each other
1308000	1310000	and the synergy that the palm
1310000	1312000	right where they come together
1312000	1314000	the synergy where the palm of the hand is
1314000	1316000	that stuff is powerful
1316000	1318000	in fact that's the stuff that makes most
1318000	1320000	of the trouble
1320000	1322000	for humans
1322000	1324000	is we're making the bad form of synergy
1324000	1326000	right
1326000	1328000	we're like oh with synergy
1328000	1330000	you can go faster you can get more
1330000	1332000	you can
1332000	1334000	you can mutate
1334000	1336000	and propagate wildly if you have synergy
1336000	1338000	but I'm listening
1338000	1340000	I didn't hear
1340000	1342000	your question
1342000	1344000	you were talking about diversity and unity
1344000	1346000	good good good
1346000	1348000	the small subset
1348000	1350000	within that
1350000	1352000	with my dog
1352000	1354000	the dog loves
1354000	1356000	to come
1356000	1358000	and lick
1358000	1360000	the inside of my mouth
1360000	1362000	right
1362000	1364000	and
1364000	1366000	you know
1366000	1368000	it's a mix between
1368000	1370000	a golden retriever and a food dog
1370000	1372000	right
1372000	1374000	very
1374000	1376000	humanly
1376000	1378000	very into humans
1378000	1380000	I have no idea what people listening to
1380000	1382000	our conversation will think when you say that
1382000	1384000	but keep going because I'm going to go somewhere
1384000	1386000	that I think you're actually going to go to
1386000	1388000	but let's see
1388000	1390000	anyway
1390000	1392000	I have this overall view that
1392000	1394000	all creatures and plants have been
1394000	1396000	made
1396000	1398000	maybe we don't know like a bed bug
1398000	1400000	we don't know why
1400000	1402000	but it's got a logical reason
1402000	1404000	but it's got a reason
1404000	1406000	so when my dog
1406000	1408000	when this dog comes and licks me
1408000	1410000	wants to you know out of his instinct
1410000	1412000	and he's so determined to like what to do
1412000	1414000	I let him
1414000	1416000	so as time goes on
1416000	1418000	it's fine
1418000	1420000	because
1420000	1422000	but now let me go to the
1422000	1424000	the gist I want to get to you
1424000	1426000	he
1426000	1428000	you know we have I think
1428000	1430000	adopted a practice of giving
1430000	1432000	it's different
1432000	1434000	from
1434000	1436000	gating
1436000	1438000	and giving can never be as good
1438000	1440000	as
1440000	1442000	satisfying as
1442000	1444000	gating
1444000	1446000	oh that is
1446000	1448000	such bullshit but I understand
1448000	1450000	that that's the tradition
1450000	1452000	yes go ahead
1452000	1454000	okay but you know
1454000	1456000	for the dog
1456000	1458000	I'll cut to them
1458000	1460000	yeah you're right
1460000	1462000	it's very happy
1462000	1464000	number one
1464000	1466000	and it's happy more time
1466000	1468000	much of its happiness comes from
1468000	1470000	giving
1470000	1472000	it's like instinctively
1472000	1474000	I mean I would argue that the dog
1474000	1476000	doesn't even make that distinction
1476000	1478000	yeah
1478000	1480000	that's it
1480000	1482000	it never makes that distinction
1482000	1484000	it understands receiving
1484000	1486000	so to speak
1486000	1488000	perhaps it differentiates that
1488000	1490000	I'm not sure
1490000	1492000	but its body understands the difference between
1492000	1494000	he's holding a chunk of meat
1494000	1496000	and he isn't
1496000	1498000	body understands that
1498000	1500000	but the thing about the dog
1500000	1502000	okay look it's doing something crazy
1502000	1504000	and you know
1504000	1506000	this isn't to suggest that everyone should
1506000	1508000	French kiss their dogs
1508000	1510000	for those of you for whom it's natural
1510000	1512000	by all means
1512000	1514000	let them you know let them lick your mouth
1514000	1516000	I think many in the west
1516000	1518000	would consider that disgusting
1518000	1520000	or dangerous or unhealthy
1520000	1522000	because the dog has a lot of germs
1522000	1524000	so to speak
1524000	1526000	but here's the actual thing that's crazy
1526000	1528000	I will argue
1528000	1530000	something really bizarre here
1530000	1532000	and I'll take responsibility for my argument
1532000	1534000	I will argue that your dog
1534000	1536000	is already
1538000	1540000	your dog has senses
1540000	1542000	that sense your mind
1542000	1544000	yeah
1544000	1546000	the same way you can smell the dog
1546000	1548000	the dog can smell your mind
1548000	1550000	right yeah
1550000	1552000	senses that can sense your mind
1552000	1554000	it has senses that can participate
1554000	1556000	with your mind
1556000	1558000	it has senses that are telepathic
1558000	1560000	it has senses with which it can
1560000	1562000	bond its intelligence to yours
1562000	1564000	and give something
1564000	1566000	truly astonishingly miraculous
1566000	1568000	to you
1568000	1570000	humans all the time and the humans don't recognize
1570000	1572000	it at all they don't even notice it
1572000	1574000	they just feel better when the dog's around
1574000	1576000	they can't see what the dog's actually doing
1576000	1578000	and I'm going to argue
1578000	1580000	that what most of the dogs are actually doing
1580000	1582000	is they're trying to
1582000	1584000	they're trying to do something like
1584000	1586000	the Vulcan mind meld
1586000	1588000	in Star Trek
1588000	1590000	where Spock becomes
1590000	1592000	the two minds become one mind
1592000	1594000	it's trying to do something like that
1594000	1596000	and it's trying to do that for
1596000	1598000	a way of heroic purposes
1598000	1600000	one of the best things it could possibly
1600000	1602000	do if that were its goal
1602000	1604000	would be to get its microbiota
1604000	1606000	into your gut microbiome
1606000	1608000	and your microbiota
1608000	1610000	into its
1610000	1612000	once you start sharing
1612000	1614000	the digestive
1614000	1616000	microbiota especially
1616000	1618000	the first
1618000	1620000	sort of landing zone
1620000	1622000	for microbiota and humans one of them
1622000	1624000	anyways the mouth
1624000	1626000	so
1626000	1628000	when dogs are sniffing poop
1628000	1630000	and doing whatever they're doing
1630000	1632000	presuming they do such things
1632000	1634000	they're
1634000	1636000	connoisseurs of bacteria
1636000	1638000	it's obvious to me from observing them
1638000	1640000	so I would argue that
1640000	1642000	the dog is actually trying to become
1642000	1644000	one fit more
1644000	1646000	one organism
1646000	1648000	with you
1648000	1650000	so that its microbiota get into your mouth
1650000	1652000	and your microbiota get into
1652000	1654000	its mouth and some on both sides
1654000	1656000	survive
1656000	1658000	and they reproduce and they become families
1658000	1660000	of trillions of organisms
1660000	1662000	trillions
1662000	1664000	there's 43 trillion
1664000	1666000	bacteria inside a human body
1670000	1672000	and once again right you have the same thing
1672000	1674000	you have unity and diversity
1674000	1676000	the diversity supports
1676000	1678000	the health of the unity
1678000	1680000	yep
1680000	1682000	and especially
1682000	1684000	on this part right
1684000	1686000	especially if you say look
1686000	1688000	what is the reality when people talk about unity
1688000	1690000	and
1690000	1692000	diversity
1692000	1694000	in today's governance world
1694000	1696000	when they talk about unity
1696000	1698000	they're talking about conformity
1698000	1700000	isn't it
1700000	1702000	conformity does absolutely
1702000	1704000	cannot be that the basis for unity
1704000	1706000	no
1706000	1708000	this is why
1708000	1710000	if you're putting a cohort together
1710000	1712000	you don't
1712000	1714000	want to have to give them rules
1714000	1716000	you want them
1716000	1718000	to discover the process together
1718000	1720000	so that it's organic
1720000	1722000	I think
1722000	1724000	but in a dire situation
1724000	1726000	where there's something interfering with them
1726000	1728000	discovering it together
1728000	1730000	the catalyst should
1730000	1732000	should declare the
1732000	1734000	principles
1734000	1736000	yes
1736000	1738000	the catalyst should
1738000	1740000	communicate the principles to us
1740000	1742000	and what I was going to say is that
1742000	1744000	a long time ago
1744000	1746000	let me just say something really simple and stupid
1746000	1748000	by the time a human collective
1748000	1750000	needs rules
1750000	1752000	70%
1752000	1754000	of that collective has gone missing
1754000	1756000	in action for one reason or another
1756000	1758000	and it's offline
1758000	1760000	yep yep
1760000	1762000	by the time you have to tell people what to do
1762000	1764000	the intimacy is
1764000	1766000	not there
1766000	1768000	there's no intimacy between them
1768000	1770000	they can't sense each other
1770000	1772000	they're not sensing each other
1772000	1774000	and doing predictive analysis for each other's needs
1774000	1776000	and vulnerabilities
1776000	1778000	and things like that
1778000	1780000	which humans in a tightly knit group do that
1780000	1782000	all day long every day
1782000	1784000	they just naturally do that
1784000	1786000	they're vigilant
1786000	1788000	in a way
1788000	1790000	they're vigilant of everything
1790000	1792000	as if they were the unity
1796000	1798000	as if the concerns of the unity
1798000	1800000	I don't know it's really hard to say it in language
1800000	1802000	because it sounds like a rule and it's a game
1802000	1804000	it's not a rule
1804000	1806000	hmm
1806000	1808000	but once you make it a rule
1808000	1810000	you're going to have a tough time
1810000	1812000	like by the time God had to write stuff in stone
1812000	1814000	on top of some mountain
1814000	1816000	and send Moses down to his people
1816000	1818000	with what
1818000	1820000	10 rules
1820000	1822000	you gotta imagine like
1822000	1824000	things must have been really bad
1824000	1826000	for something that
1826000	1828000	severe to have to happen
1828000	1830000	you gotta tell people
1830000	1832000	don't kill each other
1832000	1834000	you gotta tell them
1834000	1836000	not to steal
1836000	1838000	right
1838000	1840000	you gotta tell them to wear a loincloth
1840000	1842000	all right
1842000	1844000	or you know what don't rub your butt on your food
1844000	1846000	and
1846000	1848000	time you have to
1848000	1850000	tell them these things
1850000	1852000	something's gone horribly
1852000	1854000	haywire like not
1854000	1856000	in a little way
1856000	1858000	in like an apocalyptically
1858000	1860000	bad way
1860000	1862000	it can only go from here to disaster
1862000	1864000	kind of way
1864000	1866000	and
1866000	1868000	text
1868000	1870000	I mean writing it down
1870000	1872000	overall
1872000	1874000	I mean in a large
1874000	1876000	in a large way
1876000	1878000	it's taking us backwards
1878000	1880000	especially
1880000	1882000	I mean
1882000	1884000	as with any technology
1884000	1886000	good and bad
1886000	1888000	and also
1890000	1892000	unfortunately for humans
1892000	1894000	pretty much unavoidable
1894000	1896000	given the situations
1896000	1898000	unavoidable
1898000	1900000	okay look
1900000	1902000	the problem with text is you have
1902000	1904000	okay if I am speaking with you
1904000	1906000	or you are speaking with me
1906000	1908000	right yep
1908000	1910000	we both have an idea of to whom we are speaking
1910000	1912000	and also to whom we are
1912000	1914000	listening
1914000	1916000	once you have text
1916000	1918000	you have the possibility which is
1918000	1920000	very dangerous for human cognition
1920000	1922000	the way human cognition
1922000	1924000	psychologically
1924000	1926000	it's anatomy very very dangerous
1926000	1928000	if you have a thing which is this
1930000	1932000	speech without someone speaking
1932000	1934000	it to you
1934000	1936000	now you can't
1936000	1938000	tell whether that's an actual
1938000	1940000	person
1940000	1942000	whether it's a machine
1942000	1944000	whether it's God
1944000	1946000	or
1946000	1948000	whether it's a problem in your consciousness
1948000	1950000	and since you can't tell
1950000	1952000	which one of these it is
1952000	1954000	things go badly
1954000	1956000	once you have
1956000	1958000	disembodied speakers
1958000	1960000	things go badly
1960000	1962000	for humans
1962000	1964000	generally it's also a sign
1964000	1966000	that things have already gotten
1966000	1968000	weird
1970000	1972000	I mean when I think about getting
1972000	1974000	humans together for each other
1974000	1976000	and this is perhaps the most exciting thought I am capable of having
1976000	1978000	I have to admit
1980000	1982000	it seems
1982000	1984000	almost impossible or wildly
1984000	1986000	unlikely to my
1986000	1988000	pragmatic
1988000	1990000	mind
1990000	1992000	my pragmatic thoughts
1992000	1994000	how do you tell them
1994000	1996000	what do you want them to do
1996000	1998000	what's so exciting that
1998000	2000000	we are going to get together
2000000	2002000	and actually go on a mission
2004000	2006000	I have various answers to those
2006000	2008000	questions but it sure seems
2008000	2010000	just as we were talking
2010000	2012000	as we were speaking about earlier
2012000	2014000	in the conversation it seems to be
2014000	2016000	a 0-100 problem
2016000	2018000	it isn't
2018000	2020000	it isn't a 0-100 problem
2020000	2022000	but it seems that way
2022000	2024000	until
2024000	2026000	you get a few experiences of
2026000	2028000	making it work
2028000	2030000	and you can make it work
2030000	2032000	for an hour
2032000	2034000	you don't have to make it work for the future
2034000	2036000	or the world
2036000	2038000	you can make it work for two hours for five people
2038000	2040000	now
2040000	2042000	they will get a taste
2042000	2044000	oh shit we can do this
2044000	2046000	we can actually do this together
2046000	2048000	because
2048000	2050000	I would argue
2050000	2052000	and I know this is a very dangerous thing to say
2052000	2054000	but I am quite certain of the truth of it
2054000	2056000	I would argue that a team of
2056000	2058000	five people could transform
2058000	2060000	a nation
2060000	2062000	in 90 days
2062000	2064000	any nation
2064000	2066000	probably almost any five people
2066000	2068000	and if this was ever true in human history
2068000	2070000	it's more true now than it's ever been
2070000	2072000	because
2072000	2074000	the history and future of life on earth
2074000	2076000	depends on
2076000	2078000	the humans becoming intelligent
2078000	2080000	yeah
2080000	2082000	the humans must become intelligent
2082000	2084000	or either that
2084000	2086000	or you have to kill off 97% of them
2086000	2088000	or something
2088000	2090000	right
2090000	2092000	if you want to keep the world alive
2092000	2094000	because they will just keep making machines
2096000	2098000	not arguing to kill anybody
2098000	2100000	to be clear
2100000	2102000	I am saying if you want to preserve life on earth
2102000	2104000	we either have to
2104000	2106000	the entire history
2106000	2108000	the meaning of the history of life on this world
2108000	2110000	and the future
2110000	2112000	of those histories
2112000	2114000	we have got to get the humans playing a game
2114000	2116000	that isn't lethal
2116000	2118000	together
2118000	2120000	right
2120000	2122000	it's the fundamental priority
2122000	2124000	it's more important than any other thing I can think of
2124000	2126000	if we care about
2126000	2128000	will there be a world for our grandchildren
2128000	2130000	if we don't care about that
2130000	2132000	it's still really important
2132000	2134000	but
2134000	2136000	so
2136000	2138000	so then you have the problem of
2138000	2140000	in this case
2140000	2142000	in the little toy
2142000	2144000	universe that I'm creating here during our discussion
2144000	2146000	in this case what you do
2146000	2148000	is you get five people together
2148000	2150000	and you teach them how to solve an intractable problem
2150000	2152000	locally to where they live
2152000	2154000	right
2154000	2156000	so that they have the experience of
2156000	2158000	taking on a problem that just can't be fucking solved
2158000	2160000	synergizing
2160000	2162000	you know
2162000	2164000	solving the problem
2164000	2166000	now they have experience
2166000	2168000	this was
2168000	2170000	this topic was related to
2170000	2172000	our agreement
2172000	2174000	to come to listen to talk together
2174000	2176000	today
2176000	2178000	because we were talking about teams
2178000	2180000	I was talking about teams and that's when you sent me
2182000	2184000	a message on Facebook right
2184000	2186000	yep
2186000	2188000	yes correct
2188000	2190000	so there's something about collaboration
2190000	2192000	collaboration
2192000	2194000	how can we
2194000	2196000	make what you are
2196000	2198000	trusting and which is what I'm trusting to
2198000	2200000	in your messages
2200000	2202000	I love that word
2202000	2204000	saying
2204000	2206000	okay
2206000	2208000	that's an alternative
2208000	2210000	and you put it in such a way that
2210000	2212000	again
2212000	2214000	a lot of the usual suspects
2214000	2216000	cannot even object to it
2216000	2218000	because it's beyond
2218000	2220000	also look
2220000	2222000	I don't care
2222000	2224000	I want to be really clear
2224000	2226000	yes I don't care about the usual suspects
2226000	2228000	objecting because here's what's going to happen
2230000	2232000	once you get humans being
2232000	2234000	actually human together
2234000	2236000	and
2236000	2238000	the public
2238000	2240000	is able to observe that happening
2240000	2242000	and
2242000	2244000	see the results
2244000	2246000	and see what it's like to be
2246000	2248000	to have the scope of our humanity
2248000	2250000	some portion of that return to us
2250000	2252000	relationally
2252000	2254000	behaviorally
2254000	2256000	in terms of our role and our felt sense of
2256000	2258000	role if you can give him some of that back
2258000	2260000	those objectors
2260000	2262000	are going to last about six days
2262000	2264000	and then they're going to be on
2264000	2266000	forming their own teams
2266000	2268000	and be left out
2268000	2270000	no idiot is dumb enough
2270000	2272000	that when they see the humans making that
2272000	2274000	nectar of being human together
2274000	2276000	they're going to be like yeah I don't want to be part of that
2276000	2278000	that's the original
2278000	2280000	that's the original
2280000	2282000	money
2282000	2284000	that's what money is a representation
2284000	2286000	of is that nectar
2286000	2288000	yeah
2288000	2290000	that's right that's right
2290000	2292000	it's the synergistic nectar
2292000	2294000	yeah
2294000	2296000	and then the humans can learn things like this
2296000	2298000	you can teach children this and you're like
2298000	2300000	look your parents are doing this thing
2300000	2302000	with money
2302000	2304000	and what they're really trying to get
2304000	2306000	is this other stuff that you and your friends
2306000	2308000	make naturally when you play together
2308000	2310000	they're not getting any of that
2310000	2312000	so they're trying really hard to get money
2312000	2314000	you don't have to do that
2314000	2316000	the thing that you and your friends are doing
2316000	2318000	can develop
2318000	2320000	can grow
2320000	2322000	and can be maintained
2322000	2324000	like you can get five people together
2324000	2326000	and then five of them split apart
2326000	2328000	two of those form
2328000	2330000	new ones
2330000	2332000	the other three
2332000	2334000	join existing ones
2334000	2336000	so that there's sort of cross-pollination
2336000	2338000	between
2338000	2340000	team and pod groups
2340000	2342000	and this is something that works really really well
2342000	2344000	the game that I'm talking about is the game that every organism
2344000	2346000	in nature is playing
2346000	2348000	and the humans are
2348000	2350000	made to play this game but they're playing
2350000	2352000	sort of the opposite of it
2352000	2354000	which is kill the unity
2354000	2356000	and make representations of the dead things
2356000	2358000	and then sell them
2358000	2360000	to each other
2362000	2364000	so
2364000	2366000	if you give them a game that's authentic to play
2366000	2368000	and they like it
2368000	2370000	it's going to become really
2370000	2372000	contagious
2372000	2374000	if you give actual humans something
2374000	2376000	to do that's amazing and the other people see
2376000	2378000	you'll have
2378000	2380000	objectors at first
2380000	2382000	but it's not going to last long
2386000	2388000	don't say that again
2388000	2390000	I want to process that
2390000	2392000	say the last two sentences again
2392000	2394000	the goal is to do something
2394000	2396000	so momentous and beautiful
2396000	2398000	that nobody can stand
2398000	2400000	to be left out
2400000	2402000	nobody
2402000	2404000	everybody wants in
2404000	2406000	that's full on I can
2406000	2408000	sense that because
2408000	2410000	and that's an achievable thing
2410000	2412000	in a way
2412000	2414000	just you and I speaking
2414000	2416000	of such matters is the beginning
2416000	2418000	of that
2420000	2422000	can you see why I say that
2422000	2424000	Bala?
2424000	2426000	and I know 100%
2428000	2430000	and I have happened in my background
2430000	2432000	these people who are labeled
2432000	2434000	poor and whatever in the zero crime villages
2434000	2436000	but these kids are so rich
2436000	2438000	I mean
2438000	2440000	they are alive
2440000	2442000	to be human
2444000	2446000	if you get excited
2446000	2448000	with the cockroach being upside down
2448000	2450000	I mean whatever
2450000	2452000	toys can come from
2452000	2454000	what the rest of the world
2454000	2456000	might call nothing but
2456000	2458000	they're excited
2458000	2460000	because like you were saying
2460000	2462000	walking is impossible
2462000	2464000	running is impossible
2464000	2466000	jumping is impossible
2466000	2468000	but
2468000	2470000	they're not overwhelmed
2470000	2472000	by all of the
2472000	2474000	text around the world
2474000	2476000	I suppose
2476000	2478000	yes and also
2478000	2480000	I'm guessing
2480000	2482000	do the children have phones?
2482000	2484000	no
2484000	2486000	they don't
2486000	2488000	by the way
2488000	2490000	this is like an alien
2490000	2492000	comes to earth
2492000	2494000	and finds your village
2494000	2496000	and looks and says this is a very unusual village
2496000	2498000	here
2498000	2500000	where are your children's phones
2500000	2502000	and you say
2502000	2504000	they don't have any and the alien says
2504000	2506000	oh I'd like to raise my children here
2506000	2508000	do you think it would be okay?
2512000	2514000	can I
2514000	2516000	can we do this together?
2516000	2518000	wow
2518000	2520000	it's almost like asking
2522000	2524000	do your children
2524000	2526000	wear a mechanical parasite
2526000	2528000	that destroys their attention
2528000	2530000	motivation
2530000	2532000	awareness
2532000	2534000	it's not the only thing the phones do
2534000	2536000	but
2536000	2538000	it's a lot of what they do
2538000	2540000	Darren you remind me
2540000	2542000	I'll be going back
2542000	2544000	again in a couple of months
2544000	2546000	back to the village
2546000	2548000	and
2548000	2550000	the permanently based there
2550000	2552000	very soon I'm just
2552000	2554000	organizing to do that
2554000	2556000	tying some of those
2556000	2558000	with the
2558000	2560000	urban world
2560000	2562000	what was beautiful
2562000	2564000	every time I'm there
2564000	2566000	the kids
2566000	2568000	automatically want to help the mother
2572000	2574000	I mean
2574000	2576000	it was very common
2576000	2578000	it was very common me growing up
2578000	2580000	my sisters would help the mother
2580000	2582000	and I would help the father
2582000	2584000	and stuff like that
2584000	2586000	I mean they didn't have to do too much
2586000	2588000	but
2588000	2590000	now I've played
2590000	2592000	my kids
2592000	2594000	to some extent but just generally
2594000	2596000	I noticed
2596000	2598000	people are finding it very hard
2598000	2600000	to get their kids to do chores
2600000	2602000	yeah
2602000	2604000	but when I go to the village
2604000	2606000	the kids
2606000	2608000	seem to like wow
2608000	2610000	I'm given a chance to be an adult
2610000	2612000	yes
2612000	2614000	amusement
2614000	2616000	and like wow they're treating me like an adult now
2616000	2618000	they're not completely saying
2618000	2620000	I can't do this and I can't do that
2620000	2622000	and so
2622000	2624000	because
2624000	2626000	my brother-in-law
2626000	2628000	my
2628000	2630000	my
2630000	2632000	sorry my
2632000	2634000	my brother-in-law's children
2634000	2636000	essentially
2636000	2638000	my nephews like
2638000	2640000	Anises
2640000	2642000	bring breakfast I'm upstairs and they're downstairs
2642000	2644000	and they're bringing coffee and this
2644000	2646000	and this is like 8 years old
2646000	2648000	she does a good job
2648000	2650000	I'm so happy
2650000	2652000	with that
2652000	2654000	and a mother or my wife
2654000	2656000	doesn't have to
2656000	2658000	push up she looks forward to
2658000	2660000	doing this
2660000	2662000	it's like
2662000	2664000	what you'll find is like
2664000	2666000	in our culture
2666000	2668000	the children are competing
2668000	2670000	to get things
2670000	2672000	they want to get things
2672000	2674000	in the village culture
2674000	2676000	the children are competing to
2676000	2678000	it's not merely
2678000	2680000	give
2680000	2682000	they are competing
2682000	2684000	to participate
2684000	2686000	meaningfully
2686000	2688000	with the family
2688000	2690000	the village the planet
2690000	2692000	and the adults
2692000	2694000	and the children
2694000	2696000	participate meaningfully
2696000	2698000	and so the chance to bring coffee
2698000	2700000	is better than just sitting there looking at my thumb
2700000	2702000	and
2702000	2704000	they don't have a smart phone to defect into
2704000	2706000	so they're not going to defect
2706000	2708000	that way so you know
2708000	2710000	they wouldn't be doing any other thing
2710000	2712000	but the chance to bring coffee is meaningful
2712000	2714000	I'm serving my ancestors
2714000	2716000	they are still alive today with me
2716000	2718000	in the same room
2718000	2720000	this is magic
2720000	2722000	we are still alive together
2722000	2724000	and then maybe
2724000	2726000	if it's just this
2726000	2728000	a rite of passage as in
2728000	2730000	one of the things all want to be
2730000	2732000	they don't want to be
2732000	2734000	treated like kids
2734000	2736000	like we know nothing
2736000	2738000	too often
2740000	2742000	some of that works in their favor
2742000	2744000	because some of the children
2744000	2746000	respond to that by becoming
2746000	2748000	monumentally
2748000	2750000	intelligent
2750000	2752000	because they're like
2752000	2754000	that dumb kid
2754000	2756000	my dad called me dumb
2756000	2758000	so I learned quantum physics
2758000	2760000	I'm just giving
2760000	2762000	a ridiculous example
2762000	2764000	some of it does sort of help
2764000	2766000	the children
2766000	2768000	but that shouldn't be
2768000	2770000	the cultural
2770000	2772000	you know
2772000	2774000	that shouldn't be the cultural tradition
2776000	2778000	I'm listening
2778000	2780000	so wait Darren
2780000	2782000	I want to imprint this into my head
2782000	2784000	which is
2784000	2786000	number one there's an issue
2786000	2788000	there's a big problem of getting kids
2788000	2790000	to like do the
2790000	2792000	sensible things
2792000	2794000	and one of the reasons why
2794000	2796000	they don't want to do this
2796000	2798000	they want to get things
2802000	2804000	they want to either get things
2804000	2806000	or they want to defect
2806000	2808000	and they're addicted to electronic stimuli
2808000	2810000	and things like that
2810000	2812000	so they're used to
2812000	2814000	constantly referring to an object
2814000	2816000	with their attention
2816000	2818000	the children there don't have to do that
2818000	2820000	if they have a phone
2820000	2822000	even if they have a computer
2822000	2824000	if they have a phone
2824000	2826000	if they have a video game
2826000	2828000	if they have a television
2828000	2830000	if they have even a radio
2830000	2832000	it starts to be
2832000	2834000	the same kind of thing
2834000	2836000	and also because
2836000	2838000	we've totally
2838000	2840000	you know
2840000	2842000	okay I have to say
2842000	2844000	I'm sorry
2844000	2846000	I have to say
2846000	2848000	the thing all those things are replacing
2848000	2850000	is meaningful relation
2850000	2852000	in the village with the others
2852000	2854000	all those things
2854000	2856000	they are replacing that
2856000	2858000	they are the money version
2858000	2860000	of the nectar that's produced naturally
2860000	2862000	when the people are there
2862000	2864000	for each other
2864000	2866000	this great sweetness
2870000	2872000	combination of silence
2872000	2874000	laying hopscotch
2874000	2876000	in front of the hall
2876000	2878000	seeing the kids
2878000	2880000	from the neighbor's house coming
2880000	2882000	not wearing something different
2882000	2884000	all of that
2884000	2886000	is little sparkles
2886000	2888000	you know
2888000	2890000	talking
2890000	2892000	learning how to speak a bit better
2892000	2894000	it is because you and the children are there together
2894000	2896000	for each other
2896000	2898000	even the children who aren't yours
2898000	2900000	and you know
2900000	2902000	the children
2902000	2904000	they like
2904000	2906000	I don't know how to put it
2906000	2908000	the children are carrying
2908000	2910000	assets
2910000	2912000	that the adults don't
2912000	2914000	recognize
2914000	2916000	and dispose of
2916000	2918000	and punish the children for carrying
2918000	2920000	everywhere around here
2920000	2922000	mostly a little bit of you know
2922000	2924000	there are a few intelligent parents that know better
2924000	2926000	but
2926000	2928000	the children are bringing something
2928000	2930000	to the table
2930000	2932000	and the adults pretend
2932000	2934000	to be rude
2934000	2936000	you are dependent on us
2936000	2938000	and since we have to protect you
2938000	2940000	you are dependent on us
2940000	2942000	and this creates a kind of slavery
2944000	2946000	children in the west
2946000	2948000	are sort of conceived of as slaves
2950000	2952000	this is why we send them to school
2952000	2954000	which is basically a slave making process
2956000	2958000	this is why they go to university
2958000	2960000	get degrees and so forth
2960000	2962000	in the representational layer
2962000	2964000	of human culture and society
2964000	2966000	which is
2966000	2968000	mostly pretty bad
2970000	2972000	mostly different kinds of slavery
2972000	2974000	children are meant for something else
2974000	2976000	and they can tell the adults are suffering
2976000	2978000	and they have assets
2978000	2980000	that will ease the suffering of the adults
2980000	2982000	if they don't eradicate it
2982000	2984000	the children are carrying
2984000	2986000	something like medicine
2986000	2988000	children are living medicine
2988000	2990000	the adults are living medicine
2990000	2992000	especially when they are together
2992000	2994000	for each other
2994000	2996000	then they naturally make the medicine
2996000	2998000	together
2998000	3000000	does that make sense
3000000	3002000	yes yes
3002000	3004000	in this case medicine isn't like a pharmaceutical
3004000	3006000	medicine is
3006000	3008000	medicine is
3008000	3010000	the food and drink of our soul
3010000	3012000	or our heart
3012000	3014000	medicine is what
3014000	3016000	we open
3016000	3018000	we open
3018000	3020000	we learn
3020000	3022000	being ready to learn
3022000	3024000	as opposed to taking for granted
3024000	3026000	that
3026000	3028000	the
3028000	3030000	representationally
3030000	3032000	sends
3032000	3034000	the wrong signals
3034000	3036000	it does
3036000	3038000	it completely messes up our thought
3038000	3040000	don't want to make a mistake
3040000	3042000	go on sorry Darren
3042000	3044000	no please I'm sorry
3044000	3046000	please continue
3048000	3050000	often I'm not able to
3050000	3052000	it's kind of like
3052000	3054000	often I'm not able to articulate it
3054000	3056000	but I understand
3058000	3060000	the moderns are captured
3060000	3062000	by a layer of
3062000	3064000	processes that they enact
3064000	3066000	as behaviors like drive the car
3066000	3068000	to the grocery store
3068000	3070000	get the groceries
3070000	3072000	get the job get the pay
3072000	3074000	take the kid to the doctor
3074000	3076000	pay the attorney do the taxes
3076000	3078000	watch the television show
3078000	3080000	mind the smart phone
3082000	3084000	clean the house
3084000	3086000	chores
3086000	3088000	what we would call chores
3088000	3090000	but really those are like
3090000	3092000	those are all
3092000	3094000	all those processes are mostly vampiric
3094000	3096000	they are extractive
3096000	3098000	they take something from us
3098000	3100000	and they give us a representation
3102000	3104000	now we can
3104000	3106000	negotiate that layer very carefully
3106000	3108000	if we're smart so that we get
3108000	3110000	actually nourishing food
3110000	3112000	when we go to the grocery store
3112000	3114000	and we don't get poison for example
3114000	3116000	candy bars and whatever
3116000	3118000	yep
3118000	3120000	but the representational layer is powerful
3120000	3122000	it's well established
3122000	3124000	it affects everything on earth
3124000	3126000	it's lethal
3126000	3128000	it steals life
3130000	3132000	it's
3132000	3134000	an actual vampire would be
3134000	3136000	terrified if it saw the representational
3136000	3138000	layers
3138000	3140000	relationship with humans because
3140000	3142000	it would realize that that must be
3142000	3144000	it's god
3144000	3146000	that must be the god of the vamp
3146000	3148000	that's what spawns vampires
3148000	3150000	vampires come from that
3150000	3152000	if there are such things
3152000	3154000	right
3154000	3156000	but yes the medicine
3156000	3158000	the village makes together
3158000	3160000	this medicine
3160000	3162000	is very powerful and it has
3162000	3164000	a unique protective effect
3164000	3166000	vampires bounce off of it
3168000	3170000	it makes like a shield
3170000	3172000	right
3172000	3174000	and so vampirism doesn't get established
3174000	3176000	in the children or the adults
3178000	3180000	and they're busy playing every other beautiful
3180000	3182000	game
3182000	3184000	everybody will be happy even when
3184000	3186000	things are difficult they're still
3186000	3188000	going to be way happier
3188000	3190000	yeah
3190000	3192000	everyone will be taking care of
3192000	3194000	each other
3194000	3196000	I'm listening
3196000	3198000	they're in one way of like maybe
3198000	3200000	peeling away
3200000	3202000	the representational layer
3202000	3204000	just expose it to people
3204000	3206000	I've tried that and it works
3206000	3208000	because I
3208000	3210000	I'll tell you this right
3210000	3212000	even the people there in the village
3212000	3214000	and stuff
3214000	3216000	in Central Java
3216000	3218000	it was very famous you know
3218000	3220000	spice trade Asia, immersion
3220000	3222000	people were discovering things
3222000	3224000	and all that stuff
3224000	3226000	from nothing
3226000	3228000	the village just became better
3228000	3230000	and better as humanity went on
3230000	3232000	but all of that is kind of like
3232000	3234000	blocked off by modern writing
3234000	3236000	and books and even anthropology
3236000	3238000	because
3238000	3240000	but okay this thing I want to tell you
3240000	3242000	once I'm in the village
3242000	3244000	I realize you know what
3244000	3246000	these people are the richest
3246000	3248000	people on planet earth
3248000	3250000	even though they are very little
3250000	3252000	currency
3252000	3254000	sorry there's a lot of currency
3254000	3256000	but very little money
3256000	3258000	yeah
3258000	3260000	why
3260000	3262000	yeah because money
3262000	3264000	money eats
3264000	3266000	the spirit of relation between humans
3266000	3268000	it does
3268000	3270000	it destroys that shit
3270000	3272000	it's like pouring acid there
3272000	3274000	to get rid of it
3274000	3276000	because now there's a single standard
3276000	3278000	to rule all things
3278000	3280000	like
3280000	3282000	the terror in the fantasy
3282000	3284000	story of the lord of the rings
3284000	3286000	one ring to rule them all is that
3286000	3288000	the ring that rules
3288000	3290000	the seven elvish magic rings
3290000	3292000	that keep the world alive
3292000	3294000	rules them is malignant
3294000	3296000	and that's money
3296000	3298000	the one ring that rules
3298000	3300000	them all in Tolkien's language
3300000	3302000	cash is the
3302000	3304000	best metaphor for it around here
3306000	3308000	it's hard to say
3308000	3310000	it's hard to say that it isn't
3310000	3312000	objectively
3312000	3314000	evil
3316000	3318000	because it's effect on the humans
3318000	3320000	okay look I could show you so many
3320000	3322000	features of this
3322000	3324000	god alright
3326000	3328000	I used to feed some blue jays
3330000	3332000	I met these blue jays
3332000	3334000	I'd bring them peanuts
3334000	3336000	I took great joy in feeding them
3336000	3338000	yeah
3338000	3340000	and the male would come to my hand
3340000	3342000	he'd land on my hand
3342000	3344000	take a peanut female wouldn't
3344000	3346000	okay
3346000	3348000	for important reasons
3348000	3350000	one day
3350000	3352000	the female got angry with me
3352000	3354000	and I didn't really understand why
3356000	3358000	what I had noticed was this
3360000	3362000	the blue jay couple
3362000	3364000	forms a vigilance pair
3364000	3366000	the girl stays up high
3366000	3368000	the boy can go down an adventure
3368000	3370000	only when the boy is up high
3370000	3372000	does the girl come down
3372000	3374000	oh shit I just realized that
3374000	3376000	fuck
3376000	3378000	so
3378000	3380000	I was interfering in that
3380000	3382000	and it would have been okay if I interfered
3382000	3384000	in it once or twice
3384000	3386000	a day
3386000	3388000	but it's not okay if I interfere
3388000	3390000	with it for two hours
3390000	3392000	and the reason it's not okay
3392000	3394000	is that they live in the terrain of a pair of
3394000	3396000	cooper's hawks and those hawks hunt blue jays
3398000	3400000	oh
3400000	3402000	alright so here's what I'm doing
3402000	3404000	I'm giving them the effect
3404000	3406000	I'm telling the story
3406000	3408000	yeah
3408000	3410000	if you put something in front of people
3410000	3412000	or animals
3412000	3414000	hmm
3414000	3416000	that's so compelling
3416000	3418000	that it not only changes their behavior
3418000	3420000	it changes what they
3420000	3422000	can be
3422000	3424000	right it drags what they
3424000	3426000	can be down
3426000	3428000	to fewer
3428000	3430000	much more explicit things
3430000	3432000	hmm
3432000	3434000	so
3434000	3436000	identity becomes binary
3436000	3438000	when I was throwing those peanuts on the ground
3438000	3440000	for the girl bird
3440000	3442000	because she wouldn't come to my hand
3442000	3444000	she was having
3444000	3446000	to go to the ground
3446000	3448000	without
3448000	3450000	radar above her
3450000	3452000	because the male
3452000	3454000	was off stashing the peanut I'd just given him
3454000	3456000	I wasn't
3456000	3458000	paying attention to their
3458000	3460000	vigilance necessities and I was providing them
3460000	3462000	the stimulus that was so compelling
3462000	3464000	that they would break
3464000	3466000	their culture
3466000	3468000	of mutual support
3468000	3470000	right it would break
3470000	3472000	that culture
3472000	3474000	yeah
3474000	3476000	it's so compelling that their bodies
3476000	3478000	it's like putting meat in front of a dog
3478000	3480000	right the body
3480000	3482000	is going to respond
3482000	3484000	you know if you
3484000	3486000	if you watch you know just put like a stack
3486000	3488000	$100 bills tie it up
3488000	3490000	with a rubber band
3490000	3492000	and put it on a street
3492000	3494000	and watch the humans
3494000	3496000	like it will drag their behavior down to
3496000	3498000	you know
3498000	3500000	the most likely
3500000	3502000	yeah
3502000	3504000	yeah
3504000	3506000	it captures the nervous system
3506000	3508000	can you see that it's
3508000	3510000	a representation
3510000	3512000	that's powerful enough to completely capture
3512000	3514000	the nervous system of an animal
3514000	3516000	and for the blue jays that's peanuts
3516000	3518000	and for the humans that's cash
3518000	3520000	or these days crypto
3524000	3526000	and overall
3526000	3528000	it's because I mean
3528000	3530000	if they were enough
3530000	3532000	of what I'm saying like zero crime
3532000	3534000	villages right
3536000	3538000	meaning there's
3538000	3540000	okay I have to ask you
3540000	3542000	sorry go ahead if there were enough of the zero crime villages
3542000	3544000	okay if there was enough
3544000	3546000	of that
3546000	3548000	and people go and live inside there
3548000	3550000	like say my wife comes from Indonesia
3550000	3552000	despite all the amount
3552000	3554000	of money
3554000	3556000	quite a lot of immigrants who come here
3556000	3558000	work here want to stay in Malaysia
3558000	3560000	you know they come from around the region
3560000	3562000	with much poorer places maybe like
3562000	3564000	Nepal or
3564000	3566000	used to be Thailand
3566000	3568000	Sri Lanka
3568000	3570000	countries that have got constant
3570000	3572000	political problems and stuff
3572000	3574000	so
3574000	3576000	people
3576000	3578000	really have a tough time finding a job
3578000	3580000	and stuff like that
3580000	3582000	when they come here many of them they want to stay here
3582000	3584000	because life is better
3584000	3586000	for them here right
3586000	3588000	but this Indonesia
3588000	3590000	Java when they come here they want
3590000	3592000	to go back
3592000	3594000	why do they want to go back
3594000	3596000	they see their village
3596000	3598000	as the safety
3598000	3600000	the security of the village
3600000	3602000	the nest
3602000	3604000	is too cozy for them
3604000	3606000	want to trust
3606000	3608000	anything else they want to go back
3608000	3610000	go to the nest
3610000	3612000	so
3612000	3614000	what I'm saying is
3614000	3616000	oh I see wait
3616000	3618000	their way of life is so familiar
3618000	3620000	that the new way of life
3620000	3622000	even though it's amazing
3622000	3624000	they go back to the old one anyways
3624000	3626000	is this what you mean
3626000	3628000	yes or do you mean
3628000	3630000	not just old
3630000	3632000	it's not just old at least one thing
3632000	3634000	is add to the old
3634000	3636000	all plus I won't be sent into an old folks home
3636000	3638000	oh
3638000	3640000	right
3640000	3642000	they just
3642000	3644000	whatever comfort you may give
3644000	3646000	to them in an old folks home
3646000	3648000	they don't want it
3648000	3650000	they want to be
3650000	3652000	poor with their kids
3652000	3654000	their grandkids
3654000	3656000	they want to care
3656000	3658000	and be cared for
3658000	3660000	by family members
3660000	3662000	who know their idiosyncrasies
3662000	3664000	not some institution
3664000	3666000	okay that was brilliant
3666000	3668000	yes that's very very true
3668000	3670000	I would almost go so far
3670000	3672000	as to say that for most of us
3672000	3674000	that is
3674000	3676000	a implicit
3676000	3678000	feature of our human
3678000	3680000	experience is that
3680000	3682000	as we get older
3682000	3684000	most of us soften
3684000	3686000	and we become vulnerable
3686000	3688000	and
3688000	3690000	it's
3690000	3692000	loneliness is much more difficult to bear
3692000	3694000	than it was
3694000	3696000	when we were younger
3696000	3698000	and we may be infirm and have illnesses
3698000	3700000	and we may need help with certain things
3700000	3702000	so that
3702000	3704000	if I'm in a house where there's children around
3704000	3706000	I feel relatively safe
3706000	3708000	if there's something I can't handle
3708000	3710000	they can take care of it
3710000	3712000	you know
3712000	3714000	or my
3714000	3716000	brothers and sisters
3716000	3718000	there's family
3718000	3720000	and if there's not family there's the neighbors
3720000	3722000	and they are family
3722000	3724000	humans naturally
3724000	3726000	do this they family up
3726000	3728000	unless
3728000	3730000	something gets in between them first
3730000	3732000	and one of the main things that gets in between them
3732000	3734000	at least where I live
3734000	3736000	is money
3736000	3738000	the fact that you guys don't have that
3738000	3740000	see
3740000	3742000	in the village
3742000	3744000	the lack of the importance of money
3744000	3746000	is almost like saying
3746000	3748000	we get water that isn't
3748000	3750000	we get relational water
3750000	3752000	that hasn't been pre-poisoned
3754000	3756000	you see
3756000	3758000	it's the same thing you said earlier
3758000	3760000	you said I
3760000	3762000	what did you say
3762000	3764000	I'm in
3764000	3766000	I'm inclined to
3766000	3768000	unconditional love
3768000	3770000	or something like this
3770000	3772000	and I said no you just never defected
3774000	3776000	the villagers don't defect
3776000	3778000	there's nothing that would motivate them to defect
3778000	3780000	a big stack of money
3780000	3782000	they might just laugh at it
3782000	3784000	and say like no
3784000	3786000	hmm
3786000	3788000	you know
3788000	3790000	I mean
3790000	3792000	to add to what you're saying
3792000	3794000	the helicopter
3794000	3796000	they kind of bail out
3796000	3798000	of their village for a while
3798000	3800000	to get some money
3800000	3802000	to build a house
3802000	3804000	once they get that
3804000	3806000	minimum amount they're back
3806000	3808000	and they don't want to be
3808000	3810000	in the town anymore
3810000	3812000	they want to be back in the village
3812000	3814000	familiar people
3814000	3816000	that's hilarious
3816000	3818000	do you see how much more intelligent that is
3818000	3820000	than what we do
3820000	3822000	in a situation like that
3822000	3824000	where everybody has a shot at surviving
3824000	3826000	and so do the relationships
3826000	3828000	that most matter
3828000	3830000	in your heart
3830000	3832000	in the other place
3832000	3834000	where they just go to the village
3834000	3836000	and they stay there
3836000	3838000	I mean they go to the town
3838000	3840000	to get the money
3840000	3842000	and then they just stay there
3842000	3844000	they continue to stay there
3844000	3846000	because they bought extra houses
3846000	3848000	they're dying inside
3848000	3850000	they're dying
3850000	3852000	they're going to live
3852000	3854000	after they die
3854000	3856000	I mean they're not going to die
3856000	3858000	they must
3858000	3860000	leave so much wealth to the next generation
3860000	3862000	things will be better
3862000	3864000	no they create
3864000	3866000	everybody is doing it
3866000	3868000	crime culture
3868000	3870000	you know despite
3870000	3872000	disparity what we have
3872000	3874000	yeah it's funny because
3874000	3876000	I think it's really important when I hear you speak
3876000	3878000	you say
3878000	3880000	and
3880000	3882000	I'm not sure
3882000	3884000	that a lot of people even know
3884000	3886000	that such things exist
3886000	3888000	at all
3888000	3890000	in the world
3890000	3892000	obviously
3892000	3894000	yeah no most people would be like
3894000	3896000	what does that even mean
3896000	3898000	although the statement
3898000	3900000	makes it real you know the language makes it
3900000	3902000	relatively clear what it means there's no crime in here
3904000	3906000	but
3906000	3908000	and by the way if there's no crime
3908000	3910000	like you probably don't
3910000	3912000	you don't really need cops
3912000	3914000	you might need a fire department
3914000	3916000	but you don't need cops
3916000	3918000	and you don't need weapons
3918000	3920000	you don't need lawyers
3920000	3922000	you don't need guns
3922000	3924000	yeah you don't need an anti-corruption body
3924000	3926000	yeah
3926000	3928000	right right right
3928000	3930000	you don't need courts
3930000	3932000	you don't need prisons
3932000	3934000	all of the people correctness
3934000	3936000	the most ugliest things
3936000	3938000	is like
3938000	3940000	cosmeticized dirt
3940000	3942000	it's really dirty
3942000	3944000	but you put lots of makeup
3944000	3946000	and you stop anybody saying the truth about it
3946000	3948000	yes
3948000	3950000	yes all these things are
3950000	3952000	I mean
3954000	3956000	I usually don't think in religious
3956000	3958000	terms but when I see
3958000	3960000	the festering malignance
3960000	3962000	of the prisons and the courts
3962000	3964000	and the cops and the armies
3964000	3966000	and the military and so forth
3966000	3968000	it's hard for me not to think
3968000	3970000	that they're demons
3970000	3972000	they do
3972000	3974000	what actual demons would actually do
3976000	3978000	so it doesn't really matter
3978000	3980000	whether their origin is metaphysical
3980000	3982000	or not they're the same damn thing
3982000	3984000	now look
3984000	3986000	here where we live
3986000	3988000	in the west in America
3988000	3990000	the institutions
3990000	3992000	that
3992000	3994000	that underlie
3994000	3996000	our
3996000	3998000	social agreements
3998000	4000000	our governments
4000000	4002000	which is
4002000	4004000	a big mess of a million little
4004000	4006000	branches
4006000	4008000	our police
4008000	4010000	the military
4010000	4012000	the fire department
4012000	4014000	the hospitals
4014000	4016000	the schools
4016000	4018000	those things
4018000	4020000	yeah
4020000	4022000	some of them are decent
4022000	4024000	we couldn't get along
4024000	4026000	without cops because shit would just turn
4026000	4028000	into the wild wild west we think
4028000	4030000	so we have to have
4030000	4032000	cops
4032000	4034000	and sometimes the cops are
4034000	4036000	an absolute nightmare
4036000	4038000	and sometimes they save your life
4038000	4040000	they sort of have both
4040000	4042000	both valences
4042000	4044000	the fire department almost always
4044000	4046000	just does good
4046000	4048000	you know is put out fires
4048000	4050000	okay
4050000	4052000	of all the single jobs
4052000	4054000	you could pick that one seems pretty
4054000	4056000	virtuous the hospitals kind of similar
4056000	4058000	the schools
4058000	4060000	the schools start to get sketchy because
4060000	4062000	it's about slave making and stuff
4062000	4064000	but
4064000	4066000	do you think universities are worse than the schools?
4070000	4072000	the intensity
4072000	4074000	of the
4074000	4076000	light
4076000	4078000	the intensity of the disease
4078000	4080000	in the university is
4080000	4082000	similar
4082000	4084000	to grade schools
4084000	4086000	in high school
4086000	4088000	it's just more sophisticated
4088000	4090000	and highly complex
4092000	4094000	let's just call this
4094000	4096000	the malware in the education
4096000	4098000	system
4098000	4100000	it's in every
4100000	4102000	step
4102000	4104000	it's in every step of the system
4104000	4106000	so the malware is in the whole
4106000	4108000	staircase but the way
4108000	4110000	the malware works up near the top of the staircase
4110000	4112000	and the universities is different
4112000	4114000	and there's you know 15 new kinds
4114000	4116000	as of last year
4116000	4118000	that stuff is mutating
4118000	4120000	right as fast
4120000	4122000	as you could try to eradicate it
4122000	4124000	it's
4124000	4126000	it's
4126000	4128000	emerging in new forms as you
4128000	4130000	watch it
4130000	4132000	it's very
4134000	4136000	it's highly
4136000	4138000	resistant to
4138000	4140000	technical intervention
4142000	4144000	it's primary vulnerability
4144000	4146000	is relational
4146000	4148000	intervention change the relationships
4148000	4150000	the malware can't
4150000	4152000	function
4152000	4154000	hey Darren
4154000	4156000	would the US
4156000	4158000	have less of a problem
4158000	4160000	less of a
4160000	4162000	problem
4162000	4164000	if it wasn't
4164000	4166000	if it was
4166000	4168000	five separate countries
4168000	4170000	not messy
4170000	4172000	it's interesting
4172000	4174000	okay the honest answer is of course
4174000	4176000	we don't know
4176000	4178000	the simple
4178000	4180000	wait let me finish
4180000	4182000	the simple correct answer is
4182000	4184000	any attempt
4184000	4186000	at responding would obviously just be my opinion
4186000	4188000	whereas some of the things
4188000	4190000	that I'm talking about are not merely
4190000	4192000	my opinion these are
4192000	4194000	in a sense
4194000	4196000	obvious features of our situation
4196000	4198000	but
4204000	4206000	I think
4208000	4210000	that solution
4210000	4212000	or that transformation
4212000	4214000	would change a lot of things
4214000	4216000	we've never really experienced anything
4216000	4218000	much resembling it
4218000	4220000	I don't have any data
4220000	4222000	and it's not like we're just asking
4222000	4224000	in a vacuum we're asking
4224000	4226000	in the time and context in which we live
4226000	4228000	so we're asking like
4228000	4230000	if the US split into five bodies in 2024
4230000	4232000	you know
4232000	4234000	what effect do you think
4234000	4236000	that would have on malware and education
4238000	4240000	one
4240000	4242000	feature of the setup that I like
4242000	4244000	is
4244000	4246000	if you've got five petri dishes
4246000	4248000	in which to attempt to
4248000	4250000	spawn
4250000	4252000	something
4252000	4254000	more intelligent than our educational system
4256000	4258000	you'd have five shots at it
4258000	4260000	instead of one
4260000	4262000	but you can actually have
4262000	4264000	as many shots as you want
4264000	4266000	because the fact that
4266000	4268000	you know
4268000	4270000	I mean anybody who wants to is free
4270000	4272000	to start some kind of new educational system
4272000	4274000	most people aren't that bold
4276000	4278000	and there have been attempts
4278000	4280000	in the states we have Waldorf schools
4280000	4282000	for example
4282000	4284000	which are wildly different
4284000	4286000	from standard educational system
4290000	4292000	you don't hear much
4292000	4294000	talked about
4294000	4296000	what happens to Waldorf students
4296000	4298000	for example as
4298000	4300000	they go hard
4300000	4302000	are they
4302000	4304000	better citizens than the others
4304000	4306000	because
4306000	4308000	I don't know what the data is on that
4308000	4310000	what is that Rudolf Steiner's game
4310000	4312000	I think it was
4312000	4314000	yeah Rudolf Steiner as well
4314000	4316000	one of my girlfriends
4316000	4318000	had been raised in a Waldorf school
4318000	4320000	and I'd known a couple of other people
4320000	4322000	who were
4322000	4324000	and even when I was young
4324000	4326000	some of the same
4326000	4328000	ideas were used to
4328000	4330000	build
4330000	4332000	a school that had one classroom
4332000	4334000	for all the ages
4334000	4336000	so like a central eye
4336000	4338000	like you know unity
4338000	4340000	we'll keep all the ages together
4340000	4342000	they can learn together
4342000	4344000	help each other
4344000	4346000	instead of segmenting them
4346000	4348000	didn't go very well
4348000	4350000	for who knows 10 reasons to Sunday
4350000	4352000	but
4352000	4354000	but yeah I don't know
4354000	4356000	it will go well because
4356000	4358000	the malignancy
4358000	4360000	spread across so many aspects
4360000	4362000	yes look
4362000	4364000	look
4366000	4368000	you know I can imagine
4368000	4370000	a science fiction story where we go
4370000	4372000	to
4376000	4378000	we pick
4380000	4382000	70 billionaires
4382000	4384000	and we go to them
4384000	4386000	and we tell them
4386000	4388000	we will educate your children
4390000	4392000	we will give your children an educational
4392000	4394000	experience that they will
4394000	4396000	always be excited about
4396000	4398000	and they will outperform anything you can buy
4398000	4400000	from anyone else
4402000	4404000	and so you build the system
4404000	4406000	experimentally that way
4406000	4408000	you learn how to do that
4408000	4410000	right that way
4410000	4412000	and then you just attack
4412000	4414000	the whole fucking school system from there
4414000	4416000	with the same
4416000	4418000	with whatever you can produce from that breeder reactor
4418000	4420000	right
4420000	4422000	how do we actually get children
4422000	4424000	meaningful
4424000	4426000	human experience
4426000	4428000	and at the same time deep
4428000	4430000	representational intelligence
4432000	4434000	and one of the best ways to do that is just to
4434000	4436000	teach them the
4436000	4438000	structure of representational cognition
4438000	4440000	once they see that
4440000	4442000	they will never bow to it
4442000	4444000	they will manipulate it from above
4444000	4446000	just like humans should always do
4446000	4448000	it's okay if we have representations
4448000	4450000	we have to manipulate them from above
4450000	4452000	we have to not be manipulated
4452000	4454000	we have to not be puppeted by our own
4454000	4456000	representations does that make sense
4456000	4458000	yep
4458000	4460000	yep
4460000	4462000	and you can teach this
4462000	4464000	this is teachable stuff
4464000	4466000	right this is stuff we could discover
4466000	4468000	those features of language
4468000	4470000	and modern thought
4470000	4472000	those features simple
4472000	4474000	semantic and linguistic and philosophic features
4474000	4476000	that you could teach to children and adults
4476000	4478000	that would mostly
4478000	4480000	free them
4480000	4482000	at least in their minds
4484000	4486000	from I don't know
4486000	4488000	68% of the traps
4488000	4490000	they're going to face in consciousness throughout
4490000	4492000	their lifetime
4492000	4494000	like
4494000	4496000	we're walking around wearing like
4496000	4498000	iron cages in our minds
4498000	4500000	us humans
4500000	4502000	so far most of us
4502000	4504000	I am myself included to the degree
4504000	4506000	that I live in a city I'm
4506000	4508000	subject to the same
4508000	4510000	problem
4510000	4512000	I'm a prisoner dreaming of a jailbreak
4516000	4518000	where it sounds like for you
4518000	4520000	you know where outside the jail is
4520000	4522000	and you intend to get there right quick
4524000	4526000	yep
4526000	4528000	yeah
4528000	4530000	is Benji with you
4530000	4532000	wow
4532000	4534000	say that again
4534000	4536000	is Benji with you where you are
4536000	4538000	yeah I mean
4538000	4540000	I thought I heard him
4540000	4542000	barking oh not right now
4542000	4544000	no not right now
4544000	4546000	earlier he was
4546000	4548000	he was just staying here
4548000	4550000	before I started talking to him
4550000	4552000	yeah cause I heard him
4552000	4554000	okay okay
4554000	4556000	yeah
4556000	4558000	it's quite a character once
4558000	4560000	but
4560000	4562000	it's saved my sanity
4562000	4564000	now so
4564000	4566000	it has me
4566000	4568000	to really much better understand
4570000	4572000	the village scene
4572000	4574000	cause you get lost one of the things
4574000	4576000	is
4576000	4578000	me too
4578000	4580000	I wanted to achieve
4580000	4582000	you know you've got this right
4582000	4584000	so
4584000	4586000	all kinds of people like not just
4586000	4588000	everybody like 10 out of 10
4588000	4590000	100 out of 100
4590000	4592000	1000 out of 1000 people
4592000	4594000	only know achievement by hey
4594000	4596000	how much wealth do you have
4596000	4598000	that's what I said
4598000	4600000	yeah it's a sick standard
4600000	4602000	that
4602000	4604000	turns everything to one thing
4606000	4608000	so when you ask them you know
4608000	4610000	determine your value
4610000	4612000	as a person
4612000	4614000	they want to know what property you own
4614000	4616000	who you're married to
4616000	4618000	you know are you
4618000	4620000	are you well bred
4620000	4622000	do you come from power
4622000	4624000	do you come from money
4624000	4626000	like for example
4626000	4628000	you know I got suspended by
4628000	4630000	LinkedIn you know
4630000	4632000	of being forthright
4632000	4634000	because fellas were
4634000	4636000	doing con job in Singapore
4636000	4638000	so I was like stop
4638000	4640000	I mean just generally it pisses me off
4640000	4642000	like nobody
4642000	4644000	speaks up against a
4644000	4646000	blatant con
4646000	4648000	yeah okay I agree
4648000	4650000	but let's agree
4650000	4652000	together that we will try to
4652000	4654000	discover how to do things that are effective
4654000	4656000	yep
4656000	4658000	right so that even
4658000	4660000	if we take on some kind of small
4660000	4662000	mission together even the mission of this
4662000	4664000	conversation cause this you know this works
4664000	4666000	then let's just have
4666000	4668000	the some simple agreements
4668000	4670000	I'm not trying to write these in stone
4670000	4672000	but we will try to help each other see better
4672000	4674000	and if action is required
4674000	4676000	we will try to find very effective ways
4676000	4678000	to act
4678000	4680000	because LinkedIn
4680000	4682000	is like putting a
4682000	4684000	firecracker in the fire department
4686000	4688000	like they're just waiting
4688000	4690000	for someone to go sideways
4690000	4692000	it's the same with Facebook
4692000	4694000	those are battlegrounds
4694000	4696000	that's enemy
4696000	4698000	own terrain
4700000	4702000	this is part of why I am
4702000	4704000	careful
4704000	4706000	mostly careful on Facebook
4706000	4708000	it's funny you know
4708000	4710000	a few days ago I did something I
4710000	4712000	never ever do
4712000	4714000	I posted
4714000	4716000	some comments from a news
4716000	4718000	source on a political
4718000	4720000	issue
4720000	4722000	and it wasn't any
4722000	4724000	rowdy it wasn't any specifically radical
4724000	4726000	statement
4726000	4728000	over the next two weeks
4728000	4730000	that post got zero views
4732000	4734000	none
4734000	4736000	no one saw it
4736000	4738000	wow shadow ban
4738000	4740000	yeah not an accident
4744000	4746000	so devious isn't it
4746000	4748000	such a devious thing to do
4748000	4750000	well I'll tell you
4750000	4752000	Valala
4752000	4754000	there's we could
4754000	4756000	we could take that model
4756000	4758000	and flip it over
4758000	4760000	that model
4760000	4762000	okay
4762000	4764000	that thing gives us a model of what not
4764000	4766000	to do
4766000	4768000	if you have a really good model of what not
4768000	4770000	to do
4770000	4772000	you can flip it over
4772000	4774000	and no one will not want to be there
4774000	4776000	like
4776000	4778000	I have a model of how to build a system
4778000	4780000	on the internet
4780000	4782000	that
4782000	4784000	puts this back together
4784000	4786000	keeps all our data and communications
4786000	4788000	private
4788000	4790000	okay helps us get smarter
4790000	4792000	every time we make a move
4792000	4794000	with a machine of any kind
4794000	4796000	okay yep
4796000	4798000	and produces a social
4798000	4800000	adventuring system
4800000	4802000	so that people form teams to
4802000	4804000	accomplish you know
4804000	4806000	instead of putting a ball through a hoop
4806000	4808000	right
4808000	4810000	we accomplish something in the actual world
4810000	4812000	of humans
4816000	4818000	you've been developing it
4818000	4820000	I have a model
4820000	4822000	I can show you a model of how we could do it
4822000	4824000	and also
4824000	4826000	here's the thing that's actually
4826000	4828000	a little more compelling
4828000	4830000	okay the way
4830000	4832000	that system works is a model of how we can play
4832000	4834000	together
4834000	4836000	without machines
4836000	4838000	we don't need machines to do it
4838000	4840000	we naturally do it together
4840000	4842000	hmm
4842000	4844000	if most of the malware isn't running
4844000	4846000	we naturally do this together
4846000	4848000	I'm just trying to
4848000	4850000	demonstrate that there's a way that we can take
4850000	4852000	the electronic infrastructure of the internet
4852000	4854000	and do something completely
4854000	4856000	the opposite of what we're doing with it
4858000	4860000	and it would be
4860000	4862000	everything that currently exists
4862000	4864000	and it would I mean
4864000	4866000	there's so many abilities you could have
4866000	4868000	with it
4868000	4870000	that we don't have
4870000	4872000	and look I'm not a big fan
4872000	4874000	of link the humans to machines
4876000	4878000	that's not
4878000	4880000	my favorite game plan by a long shot
4880000	4882000	the problem I have
4882000	4884000	is that the humans are linked to
4884000	4886000	machines
4886000	4888000	hmm
4888000	4890000	we might want to capture some humans
4890000	4892000	and give them a shot at liberty
4892000	4894000	or at least discovering
4894000	4896000	what that might mean
4896000	4898000	we might need to capture their machines
4898000	4900000	yes
4900000	4902000	we might need those
4902000	4904000	machines doing something different
4904000	4906000	then what they're doing
4906000	4908000	like something non vampiric with the humans
4908000	4910000	yep
4910000	4912000	these are just thoughts but
4912000	4914000	I do
4914000	4916000	I think very deeply about these matters
4916000	4918000	because I want
4918000	4920000	I want the experience
4920000	4922000	of being with other humans
4922000	4924000	doing meaningful things
4924000	4926000	that's what I actually want
4926000	4928000	yep
4928000	4930000	really
4930000	4932000	say that much
4932000	4934000	because
4934000	4936000	I
4936000	4938000	like
4938000	4940000	I just
4940000	4942000	I kind of like
4942000	4944000	when I said enough of these machines
4944000	4946000	I just run away
4946000	4948000	yes
4948000	4950000	both go
4950000	4952000	I don't want to explain
4952000	4954000	and be politically correct
4954000	4956000	and use the language to
4956000	4958000	just go
4958000	4960000	hey
4960000	4962000	but I hear you
4962000	4964000	100% on
4964000	4966000	I tend to do things
4966000	4968000	more effectively than I
4968000	4970000	have
4970000	4972000	meaning
4972000	4974000	in the transition
4974000	4976000	you have to get into the machines
4976000	4978000	that they are attached to
4978000	4980000	to get them off the machines
4980000	4982000	for example
4982000	4984000	if all the kids are going to have phones
4984000	4986000	we have to give those kids
4986000	4988000	something on their phones
4988000	4990000	that it doesn't eat them alive
4990000	4992000	and
4992000	4994000	to even
4994000	4996000	get them to instruct them
4996000	4998000	to get them to work together
4998000	5000000	on an offline activity
5000000	5002000	and
5002000	5004000	what I have in mind
5004000	5006000	as I talk to you here
5006000	5008000	is confederating and intense
5008000	5010000	making a bit more intense
5010000	5012000	village life
5012000	5014000	in a village and small town life
5014000	5016000	in Indonesia
5016000	5018000	a country of 20 million people
5018000	5020000	one of the
5020000	5022000	last bastions of reality
5022000	5024000	you know
5024000	5026000	the funny thing is
5026000	5028000	it's ironic
5028000	5030000	if you
5030000	5032000	one of the questions that I had
5032000	5034000	in our conversation
5034000	5036000	for you that I haven't asked you yet
5036000	5038000	is do you want your village to have a voice
5038000	5040000	yes
5040000	5042000	with which it speaks to the world
5042000	5044000	yes
5044000	5046000	okay so I thought
5046000	5048000	perhaps this might be so
5048000	5050000	and what I'm trying to tell you is
5050000	5052000	that's not
5052000	5054000	impossible
5054000	5056000	but to protect the village
5056000	5058000	that voice might have to be anonymous
5060000	5062000	sure all of that's good
5062000	5064000	if okay but if something
5064000	5066000	if the world realizes
5066000	5068000	there's a zero crime village
5070000	5072000	that's not gonna go well dude
5072000	5074000	that will not go well
5076000	5078000	because they'll come over
5078000	5080000	then they'll think
5080000	5082000	they'll get past it is it
5082000	5084000	there's 15 things
5084000	5086000	that can go wrong with that
5086000	5088000	but I did have the same idea
5088000	5090000	early in our conversation I thought to myself
5090000	5092000	wait
5092000	5094000	there's a zero crime village
5094000	5096000	holy cow like we need to get these people on the radio
5096000	5098000	to the other villages
5098000	5100000	we need to link the zero crime villages
5100000	5102000	around the world
5102000	5104000	these people need to have a voice
5104000	5106000	and then I thought wait a minute
5106000	5108000	that sounds like
5108000	5110000	setting up a
5110000	5112000	sky beacon to 15
5112000	5114000	different kinds of vampires
5116000	5118000	just like I can't wait
5118000	5120000	to extract whatever nectar they're managing
5120000	5122000	to produce over there
5122000	5124000	and commodify that and bank the
5124000	5126000	bank the profit
5126000	5128000	you know
5128000	5130000	I've said that you know what it is
5130000	5132000	a whole bunch of things
5132000	5134000	has it like it's not that easy
5136000	5138000	I'll give you a few examples
5138000	5140000	if you go to India
5140000	5142000	if you go to even Malaysia
5142000	5144000	pretty much
5144000	5146000	all good sources of natural water
5146000	5148000	from the mountains
5148000	5150000	has been taken over by a Nestle
5150000	5152000	or a company like that
5152000	5154000	this is what I mean by vampires
5154000	5156000	they're straight up vampires
5156000	5158000	they go after the water
5158000	5160000	I'm with you
5160000	5162000	they know how to do the TV
5162000	5164000	advertising and the search engine
5164000	5166000	all that stuff
5166000	5168000	we'll give you candy bars
5168000	5170000	you know
5170000	5172000	but
5172000	5174000	in Indonesia
5174000	5176000	the politics
5176000	5178000	is such
5178000	5180000	that it's very hard to
5180000	5182000	it seems like
5182000	5184000	many layers
5184000	5186000	and it's not
5186000	5188000	it's not mainstream
5188000	5190000	it's not organized so that you can say
5190000	5192000	this is one layer
5192000	5194000	this is exactly
5194000	5196000	it's just kind of like a bit all over the place
5196000	5198000	so it's like
5200000	5202000	meaning for example to get the mountain water
5202000	5204000	right by a Nestle
5204000	5206000	they have to get 18 different approvals
5206000	5208000	and those
5208000	5210000	they're not in 4 or 5 camps
5210000	5212000	they're like all over the place
5212000	5214000	so you can't
5214000	5216000	people don't try
5216000	5218000	seems like they try and give up
5218000	5220000	and it doesn't go anywhere
5220000	5222000	so they go after a few things
5222000	5224000	like national telephone
5224000	5226000	they can get somewhere
5226000	5228000	but not anything that has got
5228000	5230000	too much of a regional
5230000	5232000	local footing
5232000	5234000	like water from a river from a mountain
5234000	5236000	whoever
5236000	5238000	the people
5238000	5240000	in the villages nearby
5240000	5242000	the people affected by that river
5242000	5244000	have enough of a sea
5244000	5246000	and sometimes have enough of a
5246000	5248000	stop it
5248000	5250000	doesn't get there
5250000	5252000	so yeah
5252000	5254000	I can't
5254000	5256000	explain exactly all why
5256000	5258000	but one big difference
5258000	5260000	between Indonesia
5260000	5262000	and quite a lot of
5262000	5264000	the rest of the world
5264000	5266000	I mean this just makes me think
5266000	5268000	I'm sorry to say this but it just makes me think
5268000	5270000	Nestle is right now talking
5270000	5272000	to Bard about how to break that trap
5274000	5276000	right Nestle is going to
5276000	5278000	straight up use AI and go like
5278000	5280000	okay this trap has 19 parts
5280000	5282000	for this
5282000	5284000	here's three solutions with a 70% chance
5284000	5286000	of success and here's 19
5286000	5288000	with a 58
5290000	5292000	that will not last
5292000	5294000	that safety won't last
5296000	5298000	I mean who knows what's going to happen
5298000	5300000	the world is wildly unpredictable
5300000	5302000	we could be living in a
5302000	5304000	from now on it might just be like a storm
5304000	5306000	of black swans
5306000	5308000	events that we never predicted
5308000	5310000	but
5310000	5312000	there's certainly much
5312000	5314000	more of those now than there
5314000	5316000	ever were
5316000	5318000	in our lives
5318000	5320000	but go ahead
5320000	5322000	somehow
5322000	5324000	you know
5324000	5326000	the alternative
5326000	5328000	to me like life in Malaysia
5328000	5330000	has gone downhill and when I sense
5330000	5332000	the US has gone downhill
5332000	5334000	at a very fundamental
5334000	5336000	give the individual
5336000	5338000	in a
5338000	5340000	soul
5340000	5342000	you know
5342000	5344000	I mean
5344000	5346000	like
5346000	5348000	why must there be like
5348000	5350000	virtually no choice except to be
5350000	5352000	to go into an old folks home
5352000	5354000	why can't the family unit be together
5354000	5356000	I mean what's
5356000	5358000	yes because
5358000	5360000	it's the difference between a modern culture
5360000	5362000	and a traditional culture
5362000	5364000	and look
5364000	5366000	some
5366000	5368000	in some nations
5368000	5370000	there is still
5370000	5372000	traditional culture there's even some of it
5372000	5374000	here in the United States where the children
5374000	5376000	just naturally care for their parents and grandparents
5376000	5378000	and so forth
5378000	5380000	but mostly it comes from other countries
5380000	5382000	because
5382000	5384000	for some reason
5384000	5386000	during the origin of this nation
5388000	5390000	that value
5390000	5392000	was not
5392000	5394000	emphasized
5396000	5398000	it was much more about
5398000	5400000	the privilege entitlement
5400000	5402000	defection
5402000	5404000	and addiction of the individual
5408000	5410000	you know like I said is basically
5410000	5412000	just malware
5412000	5414000	it's relational malware
5418000	5420000	or you know perhaps that's one useful way
5420000	5422000	to think about it it's not the only way
5422000	5424000	but yeah that tradition wasn't preserved
5424000	5426000	if you go to Japan it's there
5428000	5430000	I don't know how much in
5430000	5432000	various places in China it is
5432000	5434000	Russia is a bit more like
5434000	5436000	the United States
5436000	5438000	France and England
5438000	5440000	more like
5440000	5442000	the United States but some other countries
5442000	5444000	the tradition is alive
5444000	5446000	and in most
5446000	5448000	countries that didn't suffer
5450000	5452000	eradicative colonization
5452000	5454000	that tradition
5454000	5456000	you know
5456000	5458000	lives
5458000	5460000	it's naturally I think it's naturally
5460000	5462000	human it's not the only game
5462000	5464000	in town but I think it's naturally
5464000	5466000	human
5468000	5470000	I mean the problem
5470000	5472000	in modern countries is we want convenience
5472000	5474000	and grandma and grandpa are wildly
5474000	5476000	inconvenient
5476000	5478000	I'd rather defect by watching some
5478000	5480000	comedy channel on TV
5480000	5482000	than deal with you know
5482000	5484000	whatever's going on with my ancestors
5486000	5488000	it's a defection based culture
5490000	5492000	sorry go ahead
5492000	5494000	there is other ramifications too
5494000	5496000	like all folks right
5496000	5498000	yeah
5498000	5500000	no the all folks who like the children
5500000	5502000	sorry go ahead
5502000	5504000	no like the whole
5504000	5506000	90%
5506000	5508000	for example 90% of
5508000	5510000	medical expenses
5510000	5512000	of that sort right
5512000	5514000	it's incurred in the last year
5514000	5516000	of a proper person's life and stuff
5516000	5518000	and like that's not why not die
5518000	5520000	a year earlier
5520000	5522000	yeah
5522000	5524000	well the main reason
5524000	5526000	you don't want to die a year earlier
5526000	5528000	is because there's nothing has been fulfilling
5528000	5530000	in your life you've been living a life
5530000	5532000	of just defecting from
5532000	5534000	whatever you might have otherwise
5534000	5536000	participated in
5536000	5538000	it's very safe
5538000	5540000	but it's extremely lonely and boring
5544000	5546000	I mean like
5546000	5548000	you die in your village
5548000	5550000	together with the other people
5550000	5552000	and so you're not drug
5552000	5554000	onto
5554000	5556000	onto a really hopeless
5556000	5558000	medical system
5560000	5562000	and you know
5562000	5564000	supposedly wants to
5564000	5566000	keep you alive but
5566000	5568000	it is actually vampiric
5568000	5570000	yeah
5570000	5572000	literally it just sucks
5572000	5574000	the life out of you and then it sucks the money
5574000	5576000	out of your family for sucking the life out of you
5576000	5578000	it's like a double vampire
5578000	5580000	I mean if someone said hey would you want
5580000	5582000	it on this game we're gonna suck the life out of this person
5582000	5584000	you're gonna get that life and we're gonna suck the money out of their family
5584000	5586000	you're gonna get the money you want some
5588000	5590000	a lot of people would sure say yes
5592000	5594000	so
5594000	5596000	and come on
5596000	5598000	with all the challenges
5598000	5600000	and don't you think
5600000	5602000	don't you think
5602000	5604000	AI would be used to like
5604000	5606000	make this explicit and
5606000	5608000	this is not really
5610000	5612000	this is a forced in bargain
5612000	5614000	that's not a bargain
5614000	5616000	yeah I mean
5616000	5618000	although the problem is that the AIs
5618000	5620000	are curated and it would be
5620000	5622000	just as much of a problem if they weren't
5624000	5626000	like the humans have really invented
5626000	5628000	something very
5628000	5630000	very dangerous here
5630000	5632000	and it's not without
5632000	5634000	promise
5634000	5636000	but as we know
5636000	5638000	from looking historically at humans and
5638000	5640000	technology
5640000	5642000	that shit goes
5642000	5644000	sideways right
5644000	5646000	after the idealism
5646000	5648000	is overcome
5648000	5650000	by piracy
5658000	5660000	today
5660000	5662000	despite all
5662000	5664000	the negatives
5664000	5666000	of the US
5666000	5668000	medical insurance system
5668000	5670000	and how it's based
5670000	5672000	and all that stuff
5672000	5674000	enough
5674000	5676000	let's say at the
5676000	5678000	public intellectual level
5678000	5680000	enough of us know that
5680000	5682000	also in Canada
5682000	5684000	seems to be doing it a bit better
5684000	5686000	in other European countries
5686000	5688000	Australia seems to be doing it better
5688000	5690000	than the US
5690000	5692000	exactly there are examples of countries
5692000	5694000	that do it pretty well we might imagine
5696000	5698000	okay but
5698000	5700000	that doesn't seem to be portable
5700000	5702000	into the US
5702000	5704000	we can't look at a guy who gives an excuse
5704000	5706000	oh we are the US
5706000	5708000	okay look
5708000	5710000	what you don't okay look the problem
5710000	5712000	here is that
5714000	5716000	and this is an
5716000	5718000	ironic problem
5718000	5720000	we actually call this country
5720000	5722000	the US
5722000	5724000	that is the word us
5726000	5728000	and that
5728000	5730000	along with many
5730000	5732000	unfortunate features
5732000	5734000	of our history
5734000	5736000	incline
5736000	5738000	the citizens of the United States
5740000	5742000	to think
5742000	5744000	in a way that is fundamentally
5744000	5746000	black and white
5746000	5748000	fundamentalistic
5748000	5750000	you know it's fundamental in its
5750000	5752000	fundamentalist
5752000	5754000	in its understanding of us
5754000	5756000	and them
5756000	5758000	who are we and who are they
5758000	5760000	and most of the us's
5760000	5762000	are fake
5762000	5764000	right the same way most of them
5764000	5766000	are
5766000	5768000	but if you identify with one of those fake us's
5768000	5770000	you inherit a bunch of them
5770000	5772000	and this is a kind of an us and them
5772000	5774000	economy
5774000	5776000	that the US is amazing
5776000	5778000	at
5778000	5780000	it's like being amazing at
5780000	5782000	filling your own organs with cancer
5782000	5784000	or something relationally
5784000	5786000	it will never work intelligently
5786000	5788000	but this is
5788000	5790000	a fundamental problem with us
5792000	5794000	yeah it's bad
5794000	5796000	despite the fact that
5796000	5798000	I mean your states
5798000	5800000	and municipalities have enough
5800000	5802000	independence for example
5802000	5804000	I do
5804000	5806000	but Miami goes up
5806000	5808000	yep
5808000	5810000	they can
5810000	5812000	but they generally don't because
5812000	5814000	the malware
5814000	5816000	the influence
5816000	5818000	of the malware is powerful
5818000	5820000	right
5820000	5822000	politics in the United States
5822000	5824000	is a lot about
5826000	5828000	what
5828000	5830000	various kinds of theft
5830000	5832000	counterfeiting value
5832000	5834000	counterfeiting value
5834000	5836000	more effectively than your opponent
5838000	5840000	get the money
5840000	5842000	and then
5842000	5844000	a sort of
5844000	5846000	complex back room favor
5846000	5848000	exchange among politicians
5850000	5852000	so
5852000	5854000	it's like
5854000	5856000	the structure of the system might be
5856000	5858000	sound we've never implemented
5858000	5860000	that system does that make sense
5862000	5864000	it's just a layer of
5864000	5866000	it's like a multi-layer
5866000	5868000	cake of seven kinds of piracy
5868000	5870000	floating on top of the structure
5870000	5872000	as it stands as a legal
5872000	5874000	or
5874000	5876000	you know sociological
5876000	5878000	agreement system
5878000	5880000	mostly the structure
5880000	5882000	doesn't get implemented
5882000	5884000	what gets implemented is piracy
5884000	5886000	and vampirism
5890000	5892000	Ramaswamy
5892000	5894000	was running
5894000	5896000	for a while and
5896000	5898000	articulates that you can sense that
5898000	5900000	for example
5900000	5902000	he talks about
5902000	5904000	getting rid of the
5904000	5906000	FBI
5906000	5908000	Trump
5908000	5910000	because Trump was
5910000	5912000	caught by the civil servants
5912000	5914000	that you can't
5914000	5916000	there are too many laws
5916000	5918000	that stop you from firing
5918000	5920000	civil servants
5920000	5922000	but
5922000	5924000	Ramaswamy was saying that
5924000	5926000	that is the case when you're
5926000	5928000	firing individual civil servants
5928000	5930000	but if you're having a mass
5930000	5932000	restructuring
5932000	5934000	the law allows you to do that
5934000	5936000	and with
5936000	5938000	the Supreme Court as it's stated
5938000	5940000	as it's constituted
5940000	5942000	because it's got
5942000	5944000	enough of a majority of Trump appointing
5944000	5946000	a conservative
5946000	5948000	who are ready for
5948000	5950000	who see the sense
5950000	5952000	of
5952000	5954000	the president has the right
5954000	5956000	to restructure the FBI
5956000	5958000	by executive order
5958000	5960000	I mean this guy is
5960000	5962000	possibly even the constitution
5962000	5964000	I mean
5964000	5966000	Trump is basically
5966000	5968000	okay
5968000	5970000	Trump
5970000	5972000	is really dangerous
5972000	5974000	in my view for two reasons
5974000	5976000	the first is that he is
5976000	5978000	successfully circumvented
5978000	5980000	regulation in the past
5980000	5982000	and
5982000	5984000	the second is that
5984000	5986000	he has not only
5986000	5988000	he has no respect for regulation
5988000	5990000	he's a scoff law
5990000	5992000	right and a scoff law
5992000	5994000	will
5994000	5996000	earn the vote of
5996000	5998000	every male scoff law
5998000	6000000	in the United States just for that one
6000000	6002000	reason
6004000	6006000	and okay the third thing that's dangerous
6006000	6008000	about him is he has shown
6008000	6010000	much smarter people
6010000	6012000	what is possible
6012000	6014000	and what he has shown is possible
6014000	6016000	is as follows
6016000	6018000	the United States as a nation
6018000	6020000	can be captured
6020000	6022000	by a single male human being
6022000	6024000	he's shown them that
6024000	6026000	he's basically shined a flashlight
6026000	6028000	on a part of the game
6028000	6030000	that nobody really believed
6030000	6032000	was possible he's doing the impossible
6032000	6034000	he's going from
6034000	6036000	he's gonna go from 0 to 100
6036000	6038000	he's gonna have a go at the impossible
6038000	6040000	and he's old enough that he probably doesn't
6040000	6042000	give much of a shit if he fails
6042000	6044000	he's got nothing to lose
6044000	6046000	right it's all
6046000	6048000	anything he gets done is gravy
6048000	6050000	right
6050000	6052000	like he can do anything
6052000	6054000	that works
6054000	6056000	so yeah this is
6056000	6058000	this is dangerous shit
6058000	6060000	he's shown others
6060000	6062000	who are much more intelligent than him
6062000	6064000	that the prize can be had
6064000	6066000	you can take the virgin home with you
6066000	6068000	for sure
6068000	6070000	you can have a whole family
6070000	6072000	you know
6072000	6074000	that whole thing you can just grab that whole
6074000	6076000	damn thing in one fell swoop
6076000	6078000	right and here's how you do it
6078000	6080000	you start with these moves over
6080000	6082000	here you place some judges on the Supreme Court
6082000	6084000	Bing bang boom
6084000	6086000	casino payoff
6086000	6088000	right that's really
6088000	6090000	dangerous he's shown others that it
6090000	6092000	can be done
6092000	6094000	he's relatively stupid in my view
6094000	6096000	or at least he plays that face really well
6096000	6098000	but
6098000	6100000	damn what a fucking dangerous
6100000	6102000	idiot oh my god
6102000	6104000	but
6104000	6106000	hey Darren
6106000	6108000	when you had Hillary
6108000	6110000	you know running against
6110000	6112000	Hillary Clinton running against
6114000	6116000	didn't it occur to you
6116000	6118000	that my god the US has failed
6118000	6120000	if these people
6120000	6122000	are running for president
6122000	6124000	that's brilliantly said but yeah
6124000	6126000	no that occurred to me
6126000	6128000	some
6128000	6130000	okay I'm pretty sure
6130000	6132000	that occurred to me when I was six
6132000	6134000	and I watched
6134000	6136000	John F. Kennedy being executed
6136000	6138000	in Texas over and over again on TV
6138000	6140000	and you know
6140000	6142000	juxtaposed with some of his speeches
6144000	6146000	no that dream died
6146000	6148000	in me a long
6148000	6150000	time ago my friend
6150000	6152000	I mean I was born
6152000	6154000	the month after Kennedy
6154000	6156000	was executed and I've seen
6156000	6158000	that guy speak
6158000	6160000	I've never seen anything
6160000	6162000	in politics resembling
6162000	6164000	the appearance
6164000	6166000	of true human
6166000	6168000	virtue
6168000	6170000	that I saw in him
6170000	6172000	I note that it's the appearance
6174000	6176000	I'm not saying the guy was a saint
6176000	6178000	I'm saying
6178000	6180000	in a room full of demons
6180000	6182000	he stood out brightly
6184000	6186000	and that happened only a couple
6186000	6188000	times during my lifetime
6188000	6190000	you know
6190000	6192000	Carter might not have been a great president
6192000	6194000	but he wasn't evil
6200000	6202000	so to me like
6202000	6204000	if you can allow
6204000	6206000	a contest like that
6208000	6210000	you fail and what else
6210000	6212000	can you expect of a failed
6212000	6214000	system apparently
6216000	6218000	I think most Americans expect
6218000	6220000	that the failure of the United States
6220000	6222000	has to end
6222000	6224000	with a bunch of bloodshed and violence
6224000	6226000	preferably as much as possible
6226000	6228000	maybe even apocalypse level
6228000	6230000	right if we're going to go out
6230000	6232000	we're not going to switch
6232000	6234000	to a new system
6234000	6236000	we're going to take the planet with us
6236000	6238000	just like any insane psychopath
6242000	6244000	we're not going to try a new way
6244000	6246000	of doing this
6246000	6248000	we're going to blow shit up
6248000	6250000	because
6250000	6252000	there's a feature
6252000	6254000	in private cognition
6254000	6256000	that can be inflamed enough
6256000	6258000	and the human societies resemble
6258000	6260000	the shadow
6260000	6262000	of this problem
6262000	6264000	so
6264000	6266000	the kid who
6266000	6268000	alright
6268000	6270000	I could probably tell you
6270000	6272000	a lot about what happens
6272000	6274000	when some
6274000	6276000	kid picks up an automatic weapon
6276000	6278000	and goes to a public place
6278000	6280000	and just opens up on the people there
6280000	6282000	because what's happening in that kid's mind
6282000	6284000	is
6286000	6288000	a reflection
6288000	6290000	of a feature
6290000	6292000	of our society
6292000	6294000	and that feature is
6296000	6298000	I will win
6298000	6300000	whether I
6300000	6302000	deserve to or not
6302000	6304000	and if I don't win
6304000	6306000	everybody dies
6308000	6310000	there's a feature of private cognition
6310000	6312000	in that way
6312000	6314000	there's a feature of our own minds
6314000	6316000	that works that way and it gets reflected
6316000	6318000	in the social cognition
6318000	6320000	of modern humans
6320000	6322000	and that's the thing that produces
6322000	6324000	stuff like
6324000	6326000	I don't know
6326000	6328000	Hitler, Putin invading Ukraine
6328000	6330000	maybe there's stuff
6330000	6332000	I don't know about that move
6332000	6334000	but that looks insane to me
6334000	6336000	from outside
6336000	6338000	Israel pounding Gaza into dust
6340000	6342000	not dissimilar except in that case
6342000	6344000	somebody punched them first
6344000	6346000	so it seems
6346000	6348000	yep
6348000	6350000	yep
6352000	6354000	I think the people there
6354000	6356000	I remember when 9-11 happened in the United States
6356000	6358000	I had two thoughts
6358000	6360000	the first was
6360000	6362000	15 people just changed the course
6362000	6364000	of the nation in 12 hours
6364000	6366000	wow I thought it could be done
6366000	6368000	and then the second was
6368000	6370000	oh my god are we in trouble now
6370000	6372000	we're gonna go chasing the wrong
6374000	6376000	we're gonna go killing
6376000	6378000	the wrong
6378000	6380000	scapegoat
6380000	6382000	for
6382000	6384000	yeah we're gonna kill the wrong scapegoat
6384000	6386000	and that's gonna create
6386000	6388000	a future
6388000	6390000	of enmity and hatred
6392000	6394000	and blood oaths of vengeance
6394000	6396000	and things like this
6398000	6400000	both thoughts
6400000	6402000	now I'm not an advocate
6402000	6404000	of changing the course of nations with violence
6404000	6406000	I want to be very clear about that
6406000	6408000	but I did notice that a very small
6408000	6410000	group of humans in this
6410000	6412000	was like the course of I don't know 48 hours
6412000	6414000	they
6414000	6416000	radically altered the course of an entire
6416000	6418000	nation that made me realize
6418000	6420000	that the principle was real
6420000	6422000	small number of people
6422000	6424000	I just imagine the
6424000	6426000	I'm trying to figure out what's the opposite
6426000	6428000	of a bomb and how do we make one
6432000	6434000	what's the opposite of a bomb
6434000	6436000	yeah what's the human relational
6436000	6438000	opposite of a bomb
6438000	6440000	and how do we make one
6440000	6442000	I want to make the opposite of a bomb
6442000	6444000	I want something that
6444000	6446000	heals things back together
6446000	6448000	explosively and contagiously
6448000	6450000	it just starts crystallizing
6450000	6452000	the whole network toward
6452000	6454000	intelligent unity
6454000	6456000	I can imagine it
6456000	6458000	I can see it in my mind
6458000	6460000	it's possible
6462000	6464000	yes yes yes
6464000	6466000	it's positive
6466000	6468000	it doesn't occur to me right now
6468000	6470000	but what occurs
6470000	6472000	to me is I come across
6472000	6474000	such
6474000	6476000	what appears to be
6476000	6478000	opposites but they may just be complementary
6480000	6482000	at a level that
6482000	6484000	I'm not
6484000	6486000	familiar with because
6486000	6488000	it's not discussed enough
6488000	6490000	you and me
6490000	6492000	what you're writing is so rare
6492000	6494000	but it's so appealing
6496000	6498000	and it would be even better
6498000	6500000	if there were a few more people
6500000	6502000	who could engage at your level
6502000	6504000	so that there can be interaction on it
6504000	6506000	not just pedantic
6506000	6508000	interaction as to what do you mean
6508000	6510000	and what do you mean
6510000	6512000	people doing their own
6512000	6514000	homework right
6514000	6516000	and then reflecting and then
6516000	6518000	passing
6518000	6520000	and weaving
6520000	6522000	or actually
6522000	6524000	initiating projects
6526000	6528000	even better
6528000	6530000	doing stuff together
6530000	6532000	that's what I want to do
6532000	6534000	I'm good at
6534000	6536000	cuddling people together
6536000	6538000	you know
6538000	6540000	a lot of people
6540000	6542000	because of low confidence
6542000	6544000	I like to say
6544000	6546000	oh I don't understand
6546000	6548000	come come come
6548000	6550000	look we can take them
6550000	6552000	to nursery school
6552000	6554000	if that's the case
6554000	6556000	we can do very simple
6558000	6560000	exploratory
6560000	6562000	stuff together
6562000	6564000	so that they get a taste for the water
6564000	6566000	they don't have them in the water
6566000	6568000	they don't have to become
6568000	6570000	mercenaries or something
6570000	6572000	right
6572000	6574000	we just introduce them to the water
6574000	6576000	a little bit at a time and say
6576000	6578000	hey are you comfortable here
6578000	6580000	okay let's go to the next step
6580000	6582000	beautiful
6582000	6584000	we can learn
6584000	6586000	together how to do this
6586000	6588000	in the same way your mother
6588000	6590000	attended
6590000	6592000	the mind of your childhood
6594000	6596000	we can start out
6596000	6598000	with the presumption that we're all
6598000	6600000	intelligent, playful, creative
6600000	6602000	human beings together
6602000	6604000	and then we can just make simple
6604000	6606000	moves
6606000	6608000	like a kid learning how to stand up
6608000	6610000	we can do it
6610000	6612000	it's not hard to do
6612000	6614000	humans naturally are good at this
6614000	6616000	you can get them doing this kind of thing
6616000	6618000	I think
6620000	6622000	I do have a small group
6622000	6624000	I experiment with
6626000	6628000	we try some actual stuff
6628000	6630000	I'm not just talking
6632000	6634000	and I'm not
6634000	6636000	I guess I'm afraid
6636000	6638000	of being pedantic
6638000	6640000	I want to be active
6640000	6642000	not pedantic
6642000	6644000	okay
6644000	6646000	you want to be substantial
6646000	6648000	I mean you want to
6648000	6650000	do
6650000	6652000	yeah let's fail
6652000	6654000	as long as we're doing something no problem
6654000	6656000	yep
6656000	6658000	that's it
6658000	6660000	and as you were mentioning
6660000	6662000	I was thinking of the school
6662000	6664000	in my village and the kids
6664000	6666000	I wonder about that
6666000	6668000	that must be amazing
6668000	6670000	what's that like have you been in there
6670000	6672000	have you been in a classroom do you know
6672000	6674000	how they relate with the children
6676000	6678000	the
6678000	6680000	the school is not good
6680000	6682000	the school is not great
6684000	6686000	it doesn't open them
6686000	6688000	but they're not bad compared to
6688000	6690000	other schools as well
6690000	6692000	they're not too kind of like a nannish
6692000	6694000	or monitor
6694000	6696000	they're not that either
6696000	6698000	on the other hand they don't
6698000	6700000	they don't allow for any creativity
6700000	6702000	they want them to follow the rules
6704000	6706000	yeah it sounds typically western
6708000	6710000	or worse
6710000	6712000	yeah regimented
6712000	6714000	regimented so
6714000	6716000	but
6716000	6718000	when the kids come out of school
6718000	6720000	back to their villages
6720000	6722000	back and all that
6722000	6724000	to me they're learning a lot
6724000	6726000	when they're playing
6726000	6728000	with their families
6728000	6730000	they're imitating their dance
6730000	6732000	they're preparing
6732000	6734000	because parents are preparing
6734000	6736000	for somebody's wedding or feast
6736000	6738000	they're helping out and they're watching
6738000	6740000	watching over people
6740000	6742000	and parents are also going to
6742000	6744000	to the plot of land
6744000	6746000	and planting rice
6746000	6748000	they're helping the parents
6748000	6750000	with planting the rice
6750000	6752000	and tending to the garden and stuff like that
6754000	6756000	overall
6756000	6758000	they're apprenticing
6758000	6760000	the bigger role for them is not
6760000	6762000	what I go to school and then after school
6762000	6764000	I was going to get a job no
6764000	6766000	in the case of the girls
6766000	6768000	I'll be
6768000	6770000	my mother
6772000	6774000	they become good mothers
6774000	6776000	and they become good healers
6776000	6778000	taking care of people
6778000	6780000	they seem to learn
6782000	6784000	because it is traditional
6784000	6786000	to take care of each other
6786000	6788000	yeah
6790000	6792000	so we just need to expand
6792000	6794000	that to because
6794000	6796000	expand that to hey
6796000	6798000	whether you choose to do it at home
6798000	6800000	or you choose to do a bigger thing
6800000	6802000	between villages
6802000	6804000	medical things or even computers
6804000	6806000	all the other things
6806000	6808000	that you need to do in today's world
6808000	6810000	it's not you'll get bullied
6810000	6812000	by countries that do
6812000	6814000	with weapons
6814000	6816000	you've got to act together
6816000	6818000	to a level that
6818000	6820000	you're able to defend yourself too
6820000	6822000	you're productive enough
6822000	6824000	making enough returns
6824000	6826000	so that's enough of your people can be soldiers
6826000	6828000	like they were like societies were
6828000	6830000	I know but now
6830000	6832000	will come the malware
6832000	6834000	I'm afraid
6834000	6836000	once
6836000	6838000	it's like it comes with
6838000	6840000	the police and the soldiers to have soldiers
6840000	6842000	you have money problems
6842000	6844000	you need money
6844000	6846000	now what will happen to the village
6846000	6848000	I am afraid I hear you though
6848000	6850000	will you continue with your thought
6850000	6852000	I see so good
6852000	6854000	I like your candidness
6854000	6856000	because you know what
6856000	6858000	when you mention that
6858000	6860000	one thing I agree
6860000	6862000	pay attention to that
6862000	6864000	what do we do about it
6864000	6866000	how do we anticipate it
6866000	6868000	the other thing that comes to me is
6868000	6870000	when the
6870000	6872000	societies were very strong
6872000	6874000	the villagers
6874000	6876000	didn't have police
6876000	6878000	they didn't need
6878000	6880000	any arms
6880000	6882000	to have the strongest villages
6882000	6884000	because
6884000	6886000	they were able to anticipate
6886000	6888000	somewhat like in nature
6888000	6890000	how is it that
6890000	6892000	there is quite a lot of law and order
6892000	6894000	in a tropical forest
6894000	6896000	I mean we think of
6896000	6898000	actually there's
6898000	6900000	not law and order
6900000	6902000	I'm not sure that there's a lot of
6902000	6904000	well maybe I'm not understanding you
6904000	6906000	properly yet
6906000	6908000	I'm not sure there's a lot of law and order
6910000	6912000	there's a lot of non
6912000	6914000	not defecting
6914000	6916000	but go ahead
6916000	6918000	do you mean law and order between
6918000	6920000	the insects and the plants and the animals
6920000	6922000	do you mean that kind of law
6922000	6924000	or between tribes
6924000	6926000	no I mean
6926000	6928000	between the 10,000 species
6928000	6930000	okay yeah
6930000	6932000	I mean there's something there
6932000	6934000	I don't think it's law and order
6934000	6936000	it's intimacy
6938000	6940000	right it's one animal
6940000	6942000	in a billion bodies
6944000	6946000	so they don't defect from intimacy
6946000	6948000	therefore no laws
6948000	6950000	are required and there are no orders
6952000	6954000	so you see like
6954000	6956000	they can share the same I mean like
6956000	6958000	you have birds and you have insects
6958000	6960000	and lizards and ants
6960000	6962000	and they can have
6962000	6964000	like
6964000	6966000	kind of like unawaresly share the space
6966000	6968000	yes
6968000	6970000	yep
6970000	6972000	but if the lizard get hungry
6972000	6974000	the insect better move
6974000	6976000	if the bird gets hungry
6976000	6978000	yeah
6978000	6980000	all of that but you know like
6980000	6982000	when you're walking through a forest
6982000	6984000	whatever that seems like a minority
6984000	6986000	the exception is
6986000	6988000	share the food
6988000	6990000	but that is not the
6990000	6992000	versus
6992000	6994000	in the case of human beings
6994000	6996000	we've made it like the capital issue
6996000	6998000	and it's not just
6998000	7000000	we've made it it really is
7000000	7002000	a big deal that
7002000	7004000	we
7004000	7006000	we've gone downhill
7006000	7008000	yes
7008000	7010000	no we're collapsing toward
7010000	7012000	the worst potentials
7012000	7014000	of our species
7014000	7016000	rapidly
7016000	7018000	we're
7018000	7020000	we're all contributing to this collapse
7020000	7022000	actively
7022000	7024000	instead of doing any other thing
7024000	7026000	and mostly I think it's because
7026000	7028000	A we don't know what to do
7028000	7030000	and B it doesn't pay as well
7030000	7032000	thankfully
7032000	7034000	now I'm old enough I don't care
7036000	7038000	I want to do something
7038000	7040000	meaningful
7040000	7042000	if I have to pay to do something meaningful
7042000	7044000	fine
7044000	7046000	let's go
7050000	7052000	okay
7052000	7054000	yeah I want to
7054000	7056000	I want to run the experiments
7058000	7060000	Darren this model that you
7060000	7062000	have right
7062000	7064000	would you
7064000	7066000	do you think it has to be done in the US
7066000	7068000	or it can be done in another country
7068000	7070000	or it can be done it would be very
7070000	7072000	be very radical
7072000	7074000	it could be done somewhere else
7074000	7076000	but yeah it could be done anywhere
7076000	7078000	okay in fact
7078000	7080000	I argue I would argue that it's
7080000	7082000	basically what nature usually
7082000	7084000	is up to
7084000	7086000	she's just observe nature
7086000	7088000	she's doing
7088000	7090000	this set of things that
7090000	7092000	humans could do really well together
7092000	7094000	and they naturally do it really well
7094000	7096000	together wherever that isn't captured
7096000	7098000	or interfered with
7098000	7100000	okay
7100000	7102000	but yeah the system
7102000	7104000	as a system it could be done
7104000	7106000	anywhere
7106000	7108000	it can be done with existing technology
7108000	7110000	it would change
7110000	7112000	I honestly I don't believe
7112000	7114000	if we could actually produce what I have in mind
7114000	7116000	I don't think governments
7116000	7118000	would last another four years
7120000	7122000	we can do something so much better
7122000	7124000	than governments that I'm really shocked
7124000	7126000	nobody's had the idea
7126000	7128000	to do that
7128000	7130000	okay great great
7130000	7132000	so
7134000	7136000	what
7136000	7138000	basically you can envisage
7138000	7140000	the model that you have in mind
7140000	7142000	and I can imagine
7142000	7144000	the model you have in mind
7144000	7146000	and within it
7146000	7148000	teams of five for example
7148000	7150000	doing problem solving
7150000	7152000	and add it together
7154000	7156000	yeah they can
7156000	7158000	synergize with other teams easily
7160000	7162000	in fact they're highly motivated to synergize
7162000	7164000	with other teams
7164000	7166000	okay
7166000	7168000	essentially there's a kind of money
7168000	7170000	which is something more like fulfillment
7170000	7172000	that we can pay the humans
7174000	7176000	and they can also make money
7176000	7178000	with the analytics they produce
7178000	7180000	without those analytics being traced
7180000	7182000	to them personally
7182000	7184000	so that they can have privacy
7184000	7186000	fantastic
7186000	7188000	because that's what I mean
7188000	7190000	in like in Indonesia
7190000	7192000	they like that
7192000	7194000	they pretty much want that
7194000	7196000	because they're not
7196000	7198000	totally free from their
7200000	7202000	military phobia
7202000	7204000	yes for good reason
7204000	7206000	eventually the soldiers will come
7206000	7208000	they may not be here today
7208000	7210000	but someday they are coming
7210000	7212000	you know
7212000	7214000	right everyone knows this
7214000	7216000	all the old people know it
7216000	7218000	yes yes yes yes
7222000	7224000	so they I mean like on Facebook and stuff
7224000	7226000	all of them don't use their own names
7228000	7230000	right why would you use your own name
7230000	7232000	it doesn't make any sense
7232000	7234000	for most purposes it's dangerous
7234000	7236000	please
7236000	7238000	Darren were you
7238000	7240000	were you in the internet
7240000	7242000	when there wasn't any
7242000	7244000	any web and stuff
7244000	7246000	that was just mailing lists
7246000	7248000	I'm a computer technician
7248000	7250000	I've been working with computers
7250000	7252000	since 1981
7254000	7256000	I've done
7256000	7258000	some programming I watched
7258000	7260000	the birth of the internet
7260000	7262000	long ago
7262000	7264000	in the beginning we used to have
7264000	7266000	what were called bulletin board systems
7266000	7268000	yeah
7268000	7270000	you know you would dial
7270000	7272000	yeah bbs is you'd dial up with it
7272000	7274000	you'd have a 1200 or 2400
7274000	7276000	modem
7276000	7278000	you'd dial up with a modem
7278000	7280000	you'd have some sort of a
7280000	7282000	validation
7282000	7284000	exchange with the server
7284000	7286000	and then
7286000	7288000	you were a user on a bbs
7288000	7290000	most of those were used for
7292000	7294000	sharing cultural
7294000	7296000	objects
7296000	7298000	art
7298000	7300000	porn
7300000	7302000	computer programs
7302000	7304000	games
7304000	7306000	particularly
7306000	7308000	media
7308000	7310000	yeah
7310000	7312000	why I asked Darren
7314000	7316000	the early days of the internet
7318000	7320000	pretty much there wasn't any
7320000	7322000	pseudonyms
7322000	7324000	the mailing lists
7324000	7326000	maybe the
7326000	7328000	soft culture
7328000	7330000	wait are you sure
7330000	7332000	in what
7332000	7334000	bbs was it not
7334000	7336000	pseudonymous
7336000	7338000	because you had user names
7338000	7340000	yeah bbs
7340000	7342000	in the beginning of the internet
7342000	7344000	yeah
7344000	7346000	oh yes
7346000	7348000	mostly true
7348000	7350000	campus background
7350000	7352000	maybe because of the
7352000	7354000	economic background
7354000	7356000	because I worked
7356000	7358000	at that time I was working
7358000	7360000	for a complete ip shop
7360000	7362000	in Toronto
7362000	7364000	oh yeah
7364000	7366000	and I saw
7366000	7368000	the value of us being able to
7368000	7370000	recognize this guy
7370000	7372000	and see
7372000	7374000	you know
7374000	7376000	in a trustworthy situation
7378000	7380000	well you'd still probably want
7380000	7382000	the option of pseudonyms
7382000	7384000	but in a trustworthy situation
7384000	7386000	you'd use your
7386000	7388000	your primary name
7388000	7390000	yep
7390000	7392000	I imagine
7392000	7394000	although you know with indigenous
7394000	7396000	cultures
7396000	7398000	they didn't have names like
7398000	7400000	Bob or Tony
7400000	7402000	I mean
7402000	7404000	and their names would change
7404000	7406000	under certain conditions
7408000	7410000	it seems
7410000	7412000	to me
7412000	7414000	yep
7414000	7416000	like if you marry into a new
7416000	7418000	yeah there's lots of conditions
7418000	7420000	that would change your name
7420000	7422000	why do you mention it
7422000	7424000	so okay let me make sure I'm hearing you
7424000	7426000	so you're saying something like
7426000	7428000	I remember conditions
7428000	7430000	under which it was very useful to know
7430000	7432000	precisely who I'm speaking to
7432000	7434000	no
7434000	7436000	masquerading
7436000	7438000	were you saying
7438000	7440000	something like that
7440000	7442000	going
7442000	7444000	going to the heart of the matter
7444000	7446000	just like you said
7446000	7448000	don't
7448000	7450000	the speaker should not be
7450000	7452000	should not be split
7452000	7454000	from the speech
7454000	7456000	the stage value
7456000	7458000	right yeah
7458000	7460000	yeah I mean on the other hand
7460000	7462000	there's 10 different people inside
7462000	7464000	me and it's not because I'm schizophrenic
7464000	7466000	I'm human
7466000	7468000	ah yes yes yes
7468000	7470000	so now what
7470000	7472000	must all of them bear the responsibility
7472000	7474000	for the voice of any of them
7474000	7476000	yes yes
7476000	7478000	no no no
7478000	7480000	well I don't know I'm not saying yes or no
7480000	7482000	I'm just saying
7482000	7484000	I hear you
7484000	7486000	it's a complicated question right
7486000	7488000	like I want to actually entertain the question
7488000	7490000	hmm
7490000	7492000	yeah yeah I think
7492000	7494000	what is this for enough for some
7494000	7496000	for enough things
7496000	7498000	maybe all you know
7498000	7500000	maybe the ethical things
7500000	7502000	we want to
7502000	7504000	the issue is
7504000	7506000	where do we want accountability
7506000	7508000	and where do we want this
7508000	7510000	and I would say that
7510000	7512000	um
7516000	7518000	most of the time when we want
7518000	7520000	accountability
7520000	7522000	something has gone
7522000	7524000	really badly wrong already
7528000	7530000	right like
7530000	7532000	yeah by the time
7532000	7534000	we need accountability
7534000	7536000	relational intimacy is broken down
7536000	7538000	dramatically
7538000	7540000	why don't you want the exploratory
7540000	7542000	and why do you want them to wait till they
7542000	7544000	are sure before they open their mouth
7544000	7546000	why don't you want them to come in
7546000	7548000	with the explanations
7548000	7550000	why don't you have language
7550000	7552000	that explicitly allows
7552000	7554000	enables that
7554000	7556000	the worst thing
7556000	7558000	it's not the only truth
7558000	7560000	but a fundamental principle is like
7560000	7562000	once
7562000	7564000	human cognition becomes oriented
7564000	7566000	toward indicting someone
7566000	7568000	or something
7568000	7570000	it breaks down
7570000	7572000	it's no longer very intelligent
7572000	7574000	it's making a mess
7574000	7576000	the
7576000	7578000	vulnerability of the space
7578000	7580000	the spacemen allow for lots of vulnerability
7580000	7582000	yes
7582000	7584000	yes yes I mean
7584000	7586000	that's more brilliant than what I would say
7586000	7588000	um that's really brilliant
7588000	7590000	what you're saying there
7590000	7592000	you're saying um
7592000	7594000	it's crucial that we allow
7594000	7596000	um
7596000	7598000	the play
7598000	7600000	the natural play
7600000	7602000	of explorative learning
7602000	7604000	and discovery and making mistakes
7604000	7606000	and getting it wrong
7606000	7608000	you know
7608000	7610000	um and all kinds of other things
7610000	7612000	that disappear once
7614000	7616000	go ahead
7616000	7618000	it should be children ready you know
7618000	7620000	yeah
7620000	7622000	I mean
7622000	7624000	what a brilliant thing
7624000	7626000	you with your expansion
7626000	7628000	made it for me
7628000	7630000	yeah but you
7630000	7632000	you were the one who said this first
7632000	7634000	I only tried to see
7634000	7636000	what you were saying I was like no he's saying something
7636000	7638000	even more radical than what you're saying Darren
7638000	7640000	what I was saying was
7640000	7642000	what I was saying was
7642000	7644000	um
7644000	7646000	by the time you're interested in indictment
7646000	7648000	you've lost most of your intelligence
7648000	7650000	and I find this to be true of myself
7650000	7652000	but you said something crazier
7652000	7654000	you were like
7654000	7656000	uh in an actually trusted
7656000	7658000	relational
7658000	7660000	in context
7660000	7662000	the free play
7662000	7664000	of mistake
7664000	7666000	doesn't lead and you know
7666000	7668000	experiment and discovery and learning
7668000	7670000	doesn't lead to judgment it leads to mutual
7670000	7672000	benefit or something like this
7672000	7674000	yeah yeah yeah
7674000	7676000	yeah that's crazy
7676000	7678000	all of this
7678000	7680000	you can't say that
7680000	7682000	who told you you could say things like that
7682000	7684000	you
7684000	7686000	mustn't go around saying things like that
7686000	7688000	the humans will get ideas
7694000	7696000	so that's it
7696000	7698000	you know like
7698000	7700000	what are you doing
7700000	7702000	basically
7702000	7704000	hey there
7704000	7706000	essentially allow the kids to teach you
7706000	7708000	yes
7708000	7710000	hey this is how we do it
7710000	7712000	this is how we dig a hole
7712000	7714000	or how we catch a tadpole
7714000	7716000	come you know
7716000	7718000	teachers have been stopping us
7718000	7720000	and we go inside
7720000	7722000	and say you can't
7722000	7724000	laugh or whatever the teacher
7724000	7726000	can you give us a break
7726000	7728000	you make the club something
7728000	7730000	distract her
7730000	7732000	when you go back to learning from the kids
7732000	7734000	and then
7734000	7736000	what do you think some outcomes
7736000	7738000	make the old school teacher happy too
7738000	7740000	yes
7740000	7742000	exactly right
7742000	7744000	you can please the old guard
7744000	7746000	and innovate at the same time
7746000	7748000	right
7748000	7750000	doesn't have to be pure rebellion
7750000	7752000	you can please
7752000	7754000	you can please tradition and still innovate
7754000	7756000	yeah
7756000	7758000	so long as you're becoming patient
7758000	7760000	you're persistent
7760000	7762000	it should yield a better
7762000	7764000	the better result
7764000	7766000	the better outcome for everybody
7766000	7768000	absolutely many yes
7768000	7770000	patience
7770000	7772000	this doesn't have to be done in the next 10 seconds
7776000	7778000	that would work
7778000	7780000	right because the kids are smart too
7780000	7782000	you know
7782000	7784000	and
7784000	7786000	they're kind of like forced
7786000	7788000	to
7788000	7790000	accept the status quo
7790000	7792000	and the teachers too
7792000	7794000	finding maybe too difficult
7794000	7796000	because they're all busy
7796000	7798000	too much of an accent to it
7798000	7800000	how they have to do this
7800000	7802000	kind of a modern world
7802000	7804000	with too many details
7804000	7806000	too many chores
7806000	7808000	in a way
7808000	7810000	do you sense that
7810000	7812000	that is part of the reason why
7812000	7814000	the change is slow
7814000	7816000	and all doesn't happen
7816000	7818000	no the problem is worse
7818000	7820000	is that
7822000	7824000	the new teachers
7826000	7828000	should be free
7830000	7832000	to grow along
7832000	7834000	with the children
7834000	7836000	instead of to dictate
7836000	7838000	the direction of growth
7838000	7840000	to the children
7842000	7844000	and they know nothing but to dictate
7844000	7846000	that's it you know
7846000	7848000	to dictate
7848000	7850000	in english
7850000	7852000	I make a joke about this
7852000	7854000	it's like a person holding a hard penis
7854000	7856000	and they keep pointing it at you
7856000	7858000	they're dictating
7858000	7860000	I know it's a very crude joke
7860000	7862000	but
7862000	7864000	in english
7864000	7866000	that's a reasonable pun
7866000	7868000	and it makes sense
7868000	7870000	it's like they're hitting you over the head
7870000	7872000	with the hardened
7872000	7874000	member of authority
7874000	7876000	it's a shitty job
7876000	7878000	like no teacher would want
7878000	7880000	no teacher
7880000	7882000	would ever act that way
7882000	7884000	or want that if they were having the experience
7884000	7886000	of learning and growing with the children
7886000	7888000	and nobody's
7888000	7890000	going to tell me that we can't produce that
7890000	7892000	we got the teacher on site
7892000	7894000	we got the kids on site
7894000	7896000	you got them together
7896000	7898000	you should be able to pull off miracles
7898000	7900000	it might take you a little while to figure out
7900000	7902000	how but don't tell me you can't
7904000	7906000	I've seen it done
7906000	7908000	I've participated
7908000	7910000	in it in schools
7910000	7912000	where I had a teacher who was like
7912000	7914000	we're going to take the one kid
7914000	7916000	in this class who can't write
7916000	7918000	at all
7918000	7920000	and we're going to get that kid writing essays
7920000	7922000	that are powerful
7922000	7924000	and blow people away
7926000	7928000	I mean here's a secret
7928000	7930000	that will blow your mind
7930000	7932000	in 1990
7934000	7936000	or something
7936000	7938000	no way to
7938000	7940000	probably
7940000	7942000	I took an English class
7942000	7944000	I hadn't been in school since I was 12
7944000	7946000	I never went to high school
7946000	7948000	I'm a self educated person
7948000	7950000	I took an English class
7950000	7952000	because I'm a writer
7954000	7956000	and the teacher asked me to teach the class
7956000	7958000	for the next semester so I did
7960000	7962000	and what I discovered was pretty
7962000	7964000	amazing
7964000	7966000	so there were about 90 kids
7966000	7968000	they ranged in age from
7968000	7970000	16 to 26
7970000	7972000	we had three classes
7972000	7974000	of about 30 kids a piece
7974000	7976000	they were mostly upper middle class
7976000	7978000	white kids
7978000	7980000	most of them were like
7980000	7982000	B, B plus
7982000	7984000	average
7984000	7986000	coming into junior college from high school
7988000	7990000	of those 90 American kids
7990000	7992000	in a wealthy
7992000	7994000	suburb
7994000	7996000	suburban town
8000000	8002000	four of them could reasonably
8002000	8004000	produce a written sentence
8004000	8006000	in their only language
8006000	8008000	and two of them could
8008000	8010000	compose a paragraph
8010000	8012000	wow
8012000	8014000	those kids
8014000	8016000	sucked at understanding
8016000	8018000	or speaking or writing
8018000	8020000	the only language they
8020000	8022000	speak
8022000	8024000	they were abysmal at it
8026000	8028000	and I was blown away
8028000	8030000	because I'm hyperlexic
8030000	8032000	I have a natural
8032000	8034000	affine relationship
8034000	8036000	with language and particularly
8036000	8038000	English
8038000	8040000	I've been that way since I was very little
8040000	8042000	so for me
8042000	8044000	this was staggering and shocking
8044000	8046000	I was like
8046000	8048000	I wanted them to have more education than I had
8048000	8050000	and they had
8050000	8052000	catastrophically less education
8052000	8054000	than I had
8058000	8060000	though they had been
8060000	8062000	in school an additional
8062000	8064000	six years compared to me
8064000	8066000	and
8066000	8068000	kind of like
8068000	8070000	somewhat role model parents too
8070000	8072000	I suppose
8072000	8074000	I don't know
8074000	8076000	but
8076000	8078000	my parents weren't
8078000	8080000	particularly intelligent
8080000	8082000	but they did read
8082000	8084000	books
8084000	8086000	and they did read books to me
8086000	8088000	and I think my parents were frightened
8088000	8090000	a little bit I know my mom was
8090000	8092000	I don't think my dad was but my mom was scared
8092000	8094000	because
8094000	8096000	I remember
8096000	8098000	I was reading science fiction novels
8098000	8100000	when I was five
8100000	8102000	maybe earlier
8102000	8104000	who brought them
8104000	8106000	to you?
8106000	8108000	my parents I told them what I wanted
8108000	8110000	oh how did you know what
8110000	8112000	so like I had seen
8112000	8114000	advertisements for
8114000	8116000	2001 Space Odyssey
8116000	8118000	when I was watching Star Trek
8118000	8120000	and I knew what the book was about
8120000	8122000	and I read science fiction stories
8122000	8124000	already
8124000	8126000	myself I could read them by myself
8126000	8128000	so I asked my mom to get me that
8128000	8130000	book and she's like that's a grown up
8130000	8132000	book and I was like I want that book
8132000	8134000	that's the book I want to read
8136000	8138000	so then I got it and I read it
8138000	8140000	and my parents ended up reading it
8140000	8142000	and in a way
8142000	8144000	I was kind of educating them
8144000	8146000	because I had a lot of books
8148000	8150000	eventually I became a book thief
8154000	8156000	that's a story for another time
8156000	8158000	I only
8158000	8160000	stole books to read them
8160000	8162000	though I didn't steal like valuable books
8162000	8164000	and sell them
8164000	8166000	I stole books to read them
8166000	8168000	when I was a runaway
8168000	8170000	so I didn't have any access
8170000	8172000	yeah when I was a runaway
8172000	8174000	I used to steal books to read them
8174000	8176000	you said earlier that
8176000	8178000	you know
8178000	8180000	you thought yourself from 12 years old
8180000	8182000	like um
8182000	8184000	that would have been like
8184000	8186000	almost unheard of isn't it
8186000	8188000	no there are
8188000	8190000	there are um
8190000	8192000	okay especially these days
8192000	8194000	it's different now
8194000	8196000	there are a lot of children
8196000	8198000	who are
8198000	8200000	there's a cohort of young people
8200000	8202000	who naturally become self-educating
8202000	8204000	to varying degrees
8204000	8206000	some of them become prodigies
8206000	8208000	some of them become
8208000	8210000	nobody's right some of them just disappear
8210000	8212000	some of them go mad
8212000	8214000	because they're lonely
8216000	8218000	but yeah there's like
8218000	8220000	I know a couple other
8220000	8222000	every once in a while someone will sniff me out
8222000	8224000	and they'll approach me
8224000	8226000	and they'll go like
8226000	8228000	when did you
8228000	8230000	you know what were you reading when you were a child
8232000	8234000	and I'll say science fiction
8234000	8236000	and they're like how about when you were little
8236000	8238000	and I'll say science fiction and they'll go like
8238000	8240000	yeah that's what I thought
8240000	8242000	you know
8242000	8244000	um
8244000	8246000	because
8246000	8248000	recently somebody sniffed me out
8248000	8250000	and they were like you're one of you're just like me
8250000	8252000	you're a feral
8252000	8254000	you're a feral kid who lived
8254000	8256000	in the wilderness
8256000	8258000	and you're someone who's read
8258000	8260000	a few thousand books and not two
8260000	8262000	right
8262000	8264000	um
8264000	8266000	and they recognize the fingerprint
8266000	8268000	of my mind right and I recognize
8268000	8270000	there is when we have conversations
8270000	8272000	like I'm talking to my twin or something
8272000	8274000	it's ridiculous
8276000	8278000	yeah there are kids that are like that
8280000	8282000	I imagine all over the world
8282000	8284000	but like say if you were
8284000	8286000	like if you were
8286000	8288000	not going to school
8288000	8290000	were you still at home
8290000	8292000	I ran away from home
8292000	8294000	wow
8294000	8296000	I lived in the forest
8298000	8300000	in the Russian river
8300000	8302000	yeah
8302000	8304000	in California
8304000	8306000	wow
8306000	8308000	I mean
8308000	8310000	you just
8310000	8312000	find it hard to believe that people would do that
8312000	8314000	in a first world country
8314000	8316000	because
8316000	8318000	that's what
8318000	8320000	number two
8320000	8322000	I would have thought that the comfort
8322000	8324000	you want to mix of the two
8324000	8326000	not just be in the process
8326000	8328000	home that bad that you had
8328000	8330000	that you didn't miss it
8330000	8332000	I would have been killed if I stayed in that town
8334000	8336000	wow
8336000	8338000	I became
8338000	8340000	by most like the home
8340000	8342000	other young troublemakers
8342000	8344000	like myself
8344000	8346000	hoodlums
8346000	8348000	I went from being like a straight
8348000	8350000	A student
8350000	8352000	to being a little bit of a hoodlum
8352000	8354000	and where I was living
8354000	8356000	in Stockton
8356000	8358000	things were pretty bad there
8358000	8360000	even though we lived in the good part of town
8360000	8362000	and I eventually
8362000	8364000	ended up
8364000	8366000	in various kinds of trouble with
8366000	8368000	young criminals
8368000	8370000	now it's not as serious as like gang life
8370000	8372000	is that shit's really serious
8372000	8374000	this is pretty very minor
8374000	8376000	compared to that
8376000	8378000	but yeah I basically
8378000	8380000	I realized that
8380000	8382000	if I stay there
8382000	8384000	I realized if I stay here
8384000	8386000	I will either end up in prison
8386000	8388000	or dead
8388000	8390000	so
8390000	8392000	given that belief
8392000	8394000	anything's better
8394000	8396000	than either of those outcomes
8396000	8398000	pretty much anything
8398000	8400000	so even just like
8400000	8402000	like living outside
8402000	8404000	is better
8404000	8406000	so eventually I made it out
8406000	8408000	it took a few attempts
8408000	8410000	wow
8410000	8412000	and then you were able to
8412000	8414000	be out for years
8414000	8416000	on stretch
8416000	8418000	yeah I came home in like the last
8418000	8420000	half of 17 so I was
8420000	8422000	out for three and a half
8422000	8424000	something like that
8424000	8426000	okay
8426000	8428000	okay wow
8428000	8430000	your parents
8430000	8432000	your parents would have been
8432000	8434000	like
8434000	8436000	I mean both
8436000	8438000	so sad and mad no?
8442000	8444000	especially I don't know
8444000	8446000	this is very personal but
8448000	8450000	but my mom
8450000	8452000	was relatively indifferent
8452000	8454000	and I ran away to near where she was
8454000	8456000	living
8456000	8458000	because it was by visiting her
8458000	8460000	that I realized that there was this
8460000	8462000	enclave in the forest
8462000	8464000	where
8464000	8466000	it was a bunch of
8466000	8468000	basically old hippies
8468000	8470000	wow
8470000	8472000	so there was like this enclave
8472000	8474000	and it was very
8474000	8476000	richly cultural
8476000	8478000	unlike where I was living
8478000	8480000	which was like
8480000	8482000	zero culture like dead culture
8484000	8486000	so yeah I wanted
8486000	8488000	the culture I couldn't access
8488000	8490000	the culture because I wasn't an adult
8490000	8492000	but I didn't want to be
8492000	8494000	in Stockton anymore
8494000	8496000	trying to figure out how to steal cars
8496000	8498000	with my buddy so we could get some weed
8498000	8500000	or whatever the fucking
8500000	8502000	agenda was
8502000	8504000	yeah I just
8504000	8506000	I didn't want to be
8506000	8508000	in that place
8508000	8510000	anymore and I did not get along with my dad
8510000	8512000	who I was living with so
8512000	8514000	I went to the forest and
8514000	8516000	some adults helped me
8516000	8518000	I made it through okay nothing horrible
8518000	8520000	happened to me while I was on the street
8520000	8522000	I hitchhiked around
8522000	8524000	you know
8524000	8526000	didn't eat much food
8526000	8528000	a lot of fasting
8528000	8530000	oh
8530000	8532000	yeah
8532000	8534000	but
8534000	8536000	I hitchhiked through the US
8536000	8538000	really
8538000	8540000	hmm
8540000	8542000	wow that's crazy
8542000	8544000	yeah it was fun
8544000	8546000	yeah that's
8546000	8548000	really intense
8548000	8550000	in what year were you hitchhiking
8550000	8552000	I mean I'm hitchhiking in like
8552000	8554000	the late 70s early 80s

8568000	8570000	but you know it's quite
8570000	8572000	I mean it was a different experience
8572000	8574000	I mean it was a rich experience
8574000	8576000	I stood out
8576000	8578000	like a sore thumb
8578000	8580000	yeah well
8580000	8582000	in the south

8630000	8632000	pertinent time because Mardi Gras

8642000	8644000	so I want to go to New Orleans
8644000	8646000	you know
8646000	8648000	so
8648000	8650000	with my buddy I'd reached up to Atlanta
8650000	8652000	right from college
8652000	8654000	hitchhiking with him to Atlanta
8654000	8656000	so I went to Atlanta
8656000	8658000	to New Orleans
8658000	8660000	three days day in day out
8660000	8662000	when I go to the exit you know which is a bit of a
8662000	8664000	it's not that easy to go
8664000	8666000	from downtown Atlanta
8666000	8668000	like Salvation Army or something like that
8668000	8670000	sure
8670000	8672000	to the exit
8672000	8674000	so anyway three days
8674000	8676000	and I couldn't get it right nobody was stopping
8676000	8678000	I knew it okay
8678000	8680000	so I said okay I'll take a greyhound
8680000	8682000	to New Orleans
8682000	8684000	I go to New Orleans and that was
8684000	8686000	heaven for me there was like
8686000	8688000	the hobos and the hippies from everywhere
8688000	8690000	for Mardi Gras
8690000	8692000	and that guy
8692000	8694000	looked like Jesus Christ in the hair
8694000	8696000	yeah
8696000	8698000	the oldest and self-blown hair
8698000	8700000	brilliant yeah
8700000	8702000	he didn't guru for him
8702000	8704000	so
8704000	8706000	because we got along
8706000	8708000	really quite well like
8708000	8710000	house and fire
8710000	8712000	so
8712000	8714000	yeah he had been
8714000	8716000	hitchhiking for like 10 years
8716000	8718000	so with him
8718000	8720000	the world was a different world
8720000	8722000	you know because
8722000	8724000	people would stop for him
8724000	8726000	I would be like back
8726000	8728000	back a bit in the back and when the class
8728000	8730000	stopped I would run
8730000	8732000	and people would see
8732000	8734000	they're safe enough so it's good
8734000	8736000	right
8736000	8738000	I went all around quite a bit of time
8738000	8740000	in Boulder, Colorado
8740000	8742000	and Kansas City where it's home was
8742000	8744000	and then
8744000	8746000	I wanted to
8746000	8748000	following the Grateful Dead
8748000	8750000	I was wanting to follow
8750000	8752000	to Mount McKinley
8752000	8754000	in Canada
8754000	8756000	but got stopped at the border
8756000	8758000	the Canadians wouldn't let me in
8758000	8760000	so I spent some time in Seattle
8760000	8762000	yeah no
8762000	8764000	I had a passport
8764000	8766000	it was best in all that
8766000	8768000	so it was always good
8768000	8770000	I went to University of Virginia
8770000	8772000	Charlottesville
8772000	8774000	but the student visa
8774000	8776000	runs out
8776000	8778000	after you are a student
8778000	8780000	you know the visa
8780000	8782000	has got a termination date
8782000	8784000	so when I
8784000	8786000	my plan was
8786000	8788000	to go to
8788000	8790000	to the concert
8790000	8792000	the last
8792000	8794000	Grateful Dead concert
8794000	8796000	happens in like
8796000	8798000	the equinox or something of that sort
8798000	8800000	you know
8800000	8802000	one of those dates
8802000	8804000	the day when there's
8804000	8806000	the largest amount of flight
8806000	8808000	in Alaska anyway
8808000	8810000	and I would come back because
8810000	8812000	the flight was out of Seattle
8812000	8814000	but the Canadians said no
8814000	8816000	your visa
8816000	8818000	your American visa
8818000	8820000	is
8820000	8822000	over
8822000	8824000	so they won't let you back into America
8824000	8826000	so since they won't let you back into America
8826000	8828000	we can't let you into Canada
8828000	8830000	I see
8830000	8832000	I did not need a visa to Canada
8832000	8834000	Canada being in the Commonwealth
8834000	8836000	Malaysia is in the
8836000	8838000	there was no need for a Malaysian
8838000	8840000	to have a visa to enter Canada
8840000	8842000	I see yeah
8842000	8844000	you know
8844000	8846000	but it was on the grounds that
8846000	8848000	I wouldn't be allowed to
8848000	8850000	leave
8850000	8852000	if my basis was
8852000	8854000	I was flying out of Seattle
8854000	8856000	I wouldn't be allowed to enter
8856000	8858000	I would not have enough money
8858000	8860000	and whatever
8860000	8862000	Canada can stop me from entering Canada
8862000	8864000	not on the grounds that
8864000	8866000	I don't have a visa
8866000	8868000	but on the grounds that do you have enough money
8868000	8870000	to sustain yourself when you're in Canada
8870000	8872000	yeah
8872000	8874000	that's reasonable in pretty much all the world
8874000	8876000	countries all over the world
8876000	8878000	have environment
8878000	8880000	exactly
8880000	8882000	I didn't prepare for that
8882000	8884000	because on the thing that
8884000	8886000	I'm just going to come
8886000	8888000	for the concert come back
8888000	8890000	get on my plane now I'm home
8890000	8892000	I don't want to be here
8892000	8894000	I mean
8894000	8896000	you have a short term goal
8896000	8898000	you know
8898000	8900000	you have a short term goal
8900000	8902000	I'm sorry go ahead
8902000	8904000	yeah me not
8904000	8906000	realizing immigration
8906000	8908000	things in a black and white
8908000	8910000	very strict way
8910000	8912000	that's pretty much the half tool
8912000	8914000	but
8914000	8916000	it didn't
8916000	8918000	fully occur to me
8918000	8920000	because in my head
8920000	8922000	I'm still in America because I'm going to Alaska
8922000	8924000	man
8924000	8926000	but
8926000	8928000	it didn't
8928000	8930000	register in my head
8930000	8932000	that hey
8932000	8934000	doesn't matter what you think
8934000	8936000	it's so funny you say that
8936000	8938000	it's really funny that you say that
8938000	8940000	because I was just thinking about
8940000	8942000	when I was a runaway and when I was hitchhiking
8944000	8946000	I was so naive
8948000	8950000	that it literally didn't
8950000	8952000	occur to me even
8952000	8954000	slightly
8954000	8956000	that I might
8956000	8958000	want to be careful
8960000	8962000	because what sort of an adult
8962000	8964000	picks up a 13 year old boy
8964000	8966000	on the side of the road
8966000	8968000	yes
8968000	8970000	never even occurred
8970000	8972000	to me
8972000	8974000	that I was filtering the adults
8974000	8976000	right
8976000	8978000	and I'm filtering them
8978000	8980000	in a specific direction
8982000	8984000	right which is has
8984000	8986000	some interest
8986000	8988000	in a 13 year old kid
8990000	8992000	now thankfully
8992000	8994000	only
8994000	8996000	I don't know how many times I was near
8996000	8998000	trouble
8998000	9000000	but only twice did I
9000000	9002000	actually get close to trouble
9004000	9006000	and both times
9006000	9008000	I was able to
9010000	9012000	to kind of like avoid them
9012000	9014000	yes both times I was able
9014000	9016000	to resolve the situation by
9016000	9018000	acting tough
9020000	9022000	yeah yeah
9022000	9024000	it drives past my stop
9024000	9026000	and I'm like hey my sauce
9026000	9028000	back there and he's
9028000	9030000	not speaking to me
9030000	9032000	and it's late at night
9032000	9034000	and we're out in the middle of nowhere
9034000	9036000	and I just basically said
9036000	9038000	I will
9038000	9040000	cut your fucking head
9040000	9042000	off with my pocket knife
9042000	9044000	I will stab you right now in the neck
9044000	9046000	if you don't pull this car over
9046000	9048000	and he was like boop
9048000	9050000	I got out
9050000	9052000	oh wow
9052000	9054000	oh so
9054000	9056000	did you actually have a knife then
9056000	9058000	yes I did
9058000	9060000	oh good
9060000	9062000	I used to carry a dagger
9062000	9064000	little dagger
9064000	9066000	you're not that naive then
9068000	9070000	I was
9070000	9072000	it's just that in this case
9072000	9074000	I realized
9074000	9076000	like
9076000	9078000	yeah
9079000	9081000	I can still be
9081000	9083000	I can still be very naive
9084000	9086000	I'm not cunning
9086000	9088000	the way some people are cunning
9090000	9092000	and I honestly
9092000	9094000	it never once
9094000	9096000	occurred to me
9096000	9098000	that most of the people that would like
9100000	9102000	that most of the people that would stop for a kid
9102000	9104000	that looked like me
9104000	9106000	would probably
9106000	9108000	have ulterior motives
9108000	9110000	or at least
9110000	9112000	a goodly you know some
9112000	9114000	portion of the people
9114000	9116000	never occurred to me one time
9116000	9118000	not once
9118000	9120000	is it
9120000	9122000	because okay
9122000	9124000	Darren
9124000	9126000	when I was in the US too
9126000	9128000	like
9128000	9130000	I mean
9130000	9132000	the country was a different country
9132000	9134000	in the sense that
9134000	9136000	I would have thought
9138000	9140000	it's
9140000	9142000	nowhere as dangerous as it is now maybe
9142000	9144000	me I would agree
9144000	9146000	yeah
9146000	9148000	also I was in a strange
9148000	9150000	I was
9150000	9152000	in a strange sub context
9152000	9154000	right I was in the Russian
9154000	9156000	river
9156000	9158000	so there's a lot of basically the three primary
9158000	9160000	okay this is going to be really bad
9160000	9162000	say here but
9162000	9164000	the three primary populations
9164000	9166000	there were rednecks, homosexuals
9166000	9168000	and hippies
9168000	9170000	and the hippies and the homosexuals
9170000	9172000	got along fine
9172000	9174000	the rednecks hated
9174000	9176000	both the other camps pretty much though
9176000	9178000	got along better with the hippies than
9178000	9180000	the gay people
9180000	9182000	so
9182000	9184000	that was the context there
9184000	9186000	and obviously
9186000	9188000	you know
9188000	9190000	yeah I could have gotten a lot of trouble
9190000	9192000	but I never did
9192000	9194000	I never did
9194000	9196000	no one ever hurt me
9196000	9198000	so growing up after the age of
9198000	9200000	leaving home
9200000	9202000	you hadn't been exposed to
9202000	9204000	the dangers of
9204000	9206000	such dangers as much
9206000	9208000	I was
9208000	9210000	you have no idea how naive I was
9212000	9214000	in your wildest estimations
9214000	9216000	you will underestimate my naivety
9218000	9220000	I was
9220000	9222000	yeah I was
9222000	9224000	I was very intelligent
9224000	9226000	and skillful
9226000	9228000	in certain ways
9228000	9230000	but my god was I naive
9230000	9232000	it's just one of the
9232000	9234000	feelings I've always had yeah
9234000	9236000	it never even
9236000	9238000	okay look let me be really clear
9238000	9240000	about this so you can understand the depth
9240000	9242000	not only did it never occur
9242000	9244000	to me that I was attracting the people
9244000	9246000	who would have some interest
9246000	9248000	in a 13 year old boy ever
9248000	9250000	it never occurred to me
9250000	9252000	not only that
9252000	9254000	it never occurred to me
9254000	9256000	that it didn't occur to me
9256000	9258000	until just now
9258000	9260000	40 something years later
9260000	9262000	50 years later
9262000	9264000	it never occurred to me
9264000	9266000	that it didn't occur to me until this conversation
9266000	9268000	today
9268000	9270000	that's how naive I am
9270000	9272000	wow
9272000	9274000	I never realized
9274000	9276000	that I didn't realize
9276000	9278000	until just now
9278000	9280000	yeah
9280000	9282000	it's that bad
9282000	9284000	you know
9284000	9286000	to me in my
9286000	9288000	when I got rights there
9288000	9290000	when I started getting rights and stuff
9290000	9292000	the people who were picking us up were so generous
9292000	9294000	that made a big difference
9294000	9296000	and innocent
9296000	9298000	usually it would be like a small town
9298000	9300000	you know the tour in some way
9300000	9302000	and then
9302000	9304000	at the back
9304000	9306000	yeah some of that too
9306000	9308000	and
9308000	9310000	all beautiful it was
9310000	9312000	right beautiful it was
9312000	9314000	I mean nowhere else in the world
9314000	9316000	I think I mean
9316000	9318000	would you get that
9318000	9320000	yeah it's true because the
9320000	9322000	counterculture in the United States
9322000	9324000	at that time was still
9324000	9326000	kind of blossoming
9326000	9328000	a little bit
9328000	9330000	and how old were you
9330000	9332000	were you like 18
9332000	9334000	20 or something
9334000	9336000	yeah I would have been
9336000	9338000	21
9338000	9340000	perfect
9340000	9342000	so
9342000	9344000	you know you present
9344000	9346000	to
9346000	9348000	the drivers
9348000	9350000	obviously
9352000	9354000	something they might
9354000	9356000	find fascinating
9356000	9358000	and
9358000	9360000	adventurous
9362000	9364000	to some of them
9364000	9366000	yep
9368000	9370000	so that works in your
9370000	9372000	favor but yeah it was pretty good like
9372000	9374000	most people were very kind
9374000	9376000	some people gave me
9376000	9378000	money or brought me food
9380000	9382000	some people asked me
9382000	9384000	you know like how do you survive
9384000	9386000	they were curious
9386000	9388000	occasionally
9388000	9390000	like if it was raining
9390000	9392000	or something somebody would be like hey
9392000	9394000	you can just crash at our place if you want
9394000	9396000	you know
9396000	9398000	and obviously that could be very dangerous
9398000	9400000	but never turned out to be
9400000	9402000	not once
9402000	9404000	because I mean I was 22
9404000	9406000	so it didn't occur to me
9406000	9408000	you know
9408000	9410000	anything would happen to me
9410000	9412000	I was least
9412000	9414000	concerned about it
9414000	9416000	to me it's like how do I get it right
9416000	9418000	I don't know the money
9418000	9420000	yeah that's all I was concerned with
9420000	9422000	too I was just like how do I get
9422000	9424000	to where I'm going I wasn't thinking about
9426000	9428000	why someone would
9428000	9430000	or wouldn't stop to pick me up
9430000	9432000	in other words
9432000	9434000	there was no
9434000	9436000	there was no meta reflection
9436000	9438000	right
9438000	9440000	there was no
9440000	9442000	there was no meta cognition
9442000	9444000	yeah
9444000	9446000	no meta cognition about my circumstance
9448000	9450000	whereas you
9450000	9452000	must have had some by your age
9452000	9454000	yeah
9454000	9456000	I mean
9456000	9458000	more
9458000	9460000	I mean
9460000	9462000	but you know violence wasn't
9462000	9464000	like you didn't have the school shootings
9464000	9466000	you didn't
9466000	9468000	yeah
9468000	9470000	the malware wasn't
9470000	9472000	concentrated yet
9472000	9474000	yeah
9474000	9476000	and
9476000	9478000	say for example
9478000	9480000	people may say okay
9480000	9482000	blacks are dangerous
9482000	9484000	but
9484000	9486000	right
9486000	9488000	I'm almost black
9488000	9490000	right exactly
9490000	9492000	so
9492000	9494000	you know
9494000	9496000	I'm more likely to see you as an ally
9496000	9498000	than as
9498000	9500000	an enemy or prey
9500000	9502000	yeah
9502000	9504000	and I wanted to try it
9504000	9506000	I had to
9506000	9508000	because part of
9508000	9510000	that was the American equivalent
9510000	9512000	of you being a sadu
9512000	9514000	of you being like
9514000	9516000	you know
9516000	9518000	that's funny yeah I got you
9518000	9520000	right yeah
9520000	9522000	that's a hilarious way of saying it
9524000	9526000	like you're
9526000	9528000	yeah it's the American version of you're a holy man
9528000	9530000	or something
9530000	9532000	oh no you have faith in nature
9532000	9534000	oh you have faith I see
9534000	9536000	I see that
9536000	9538000	come on don't be
9538000	9540000	yeah that's what I had actually
9540000	9542000	that is what I had back then
9542000	9544000	in a way
9544000	9546000	I had faith
9546000	9548000	that it was
9548000	9550000	possible to be myself
9550000	9552000	without a house
9552000	9554000	without a roof
9554000	9556000	without money
9556000	9558000	without food
9558000	9560000	with nothing
9560000	9562000	I
9562000	9564000	knew that
9564000	9566000	money would be an issue so I had to
9566000	9568000	watch out and you know
9568000	9570000	in our places we stopped
9570000	9572000	anyway we made it
9572000	9574000	because we could get jobs in some
9574000	9576000	places and
9576000	9578000	little short term jobs
9578000	9580000	especially
9580000	9582000	in Boulder Colorado
9582000	9584000	I remember
9584000	9586000	in 4th of July
9586000	9588000	around about 4th of July
9588000	9590000	I was there and it was snowing
9590000	9592000	right
9592000	9594000	in Boulder California then
9594000	9596000	it was a bit of a surprise but
9596000	9598000	that was good climate I mean they had
9598000	9600000	you know like a
9600000	9602000	job placement
9602000	9604000	for tramps and hobos
9604000	9606000	you know
9606000	9608000	but because I was with this guy called
9608000	9610000	Bernie
9610000	9612000	Bernie McGraw
9612000	9614000	Bernie McGraw
9614000	9616000	yeah
9616000	9618000	he knew the ins and outs
9618000	9620000	where you go and get food stamps
9620000	9622000	and where you get
9624000	9626000	day jobs
9626000	9628000	and stuff like that so
9628000	9630000	rather quickly
9630000	9632000	after 4 days I got a job as a
9632000	9634000	dishwasher
9634000	9636000	in
9636000	9638000	Boulder
9638000	9640000	right and
9640000	9642000	you know that was fun and
9642000	9644000	the pay you get
9644000	9646000	compared to what you need is like
9646000	9648000	great because it was staying in like
9648000	9650000	in Boulder
9650000	9652000	after a while was staying in like
9652000	9654000	an abandoned
9654000	9656000	house in the edge of a river kind of
9656000	9658000	like in a forest right
9658000	9660000	so
9660000	9662000	we had sleeping bags and stuff like
9662000	9664000	rather
9664000	9666000	winter proof sleeping bags so
9666000	9668000	managed that was good you know
9668000	9670000	there were other people later
9670000	9672000	we met some people
9672000	9674000	and we lived in the house for a while
9674000	9676000	very liberal
9676000	9678000	I mean very truly liberal place
9678000	9680000	Boulder was when I was there you know
9680000	9682000	very
9682000	9684000	very generous
9684000	9686000	you know
9686000	9688000	the first day I remember too
9688000	9690000	I remember too
9690000	9692000	I tell you this
9692000	9694000	I
9694000	9696000	already I had rather little money
9696000	9698000	like 25 dollars or something
9698000	9700000	like that and I had a camera and stuff
9700000	9702000	and my buddy was hitchhiking with me
9702000	9704000	he said let me borrow your camera
9704000	9706000	and then he goes and fawns in
9706000	9708000	fucking
9708000	9710000	and so
9710000	9712000	because of that
9712000	9714000	I remember that day I had no more money
9714000	9716000	I had no more money and I didn't
9716000	9718000	have a camera and I was like
9718000	9720000	how am I going to solve this well
9720000	9722000	this is this I've got to
9722000	9724000	learn this and I've got to learn how to
9724000	9726000	be without any money so
9726000	9728000	I walk along
9728000	9730000	the street pearl street in
9730000	9732000	Boulder you know so downtown
9732000	9734000	one street
9734000	9736000	that is
9736000	9738000	walk only no cars
9738000	9740000	right so I think I walk
9740000	9742000	and I signboard right
9742000	9744000	on the side of a building and he said
9744000	9746000	Naropa
9746000	9748000	this is this
9748000	9750000	institute
9750000	9752000	me
9752000	9754000	wow this is like
9754000	9756000	next to bumfuck
9756000	9758000	U.S.
9758000	9760000	I mean
9760000	9762000	I'm not even Kansas City
9762000	9764000	Salina, Kansas by the highway
9764000	9766000	this is like
9766000	9768000	for me it's like nowhere
9768000	9770000	and how come it's got a Buddhist institute
9770000	9772000	this is my thing
9772000	9774000	this is my
9774000	9776000	culture yeah
9776000	9778000	in the middle of America
9778000	9780000	so I said I have to go upstairs
9780000	9782000	so I go up and I see you know there's
9782000	9784000	two guys and stuff and it's like a
9784000	9786000	conversation and they're so wonderful
9786000	9788000	they offered you know one of the guys
9788000	9790000	offered his place for me to stay in
9790000	9792000	because his buddy was
9792000	9794000	had gone off somewhere so there was
9794000	9796000	they can see
9796000	9798000	so come and stay with me and stay at my
9798000	9800000	place and it was great
9800000	9802000	you know beautiful
9802000	9804000	always the whole thing was beautiful
9804000	9806000	and Seattle
9806000	9808000	my last stop was fantastic
9808000	9810000	you know after by the time I reached
9810000	9812000	to like Seattle and stuff I'm on my own
9812000	9814000	but
9814000	9816000	I was walking you know I get
9816000	9818000	I was walking and this guy in a pickup
9818000	9820000	truck you know comes past me
9820000	9822000	stops
9822000	9824000	winds his window down looks at me and says
9824000	9826000	are you going somewhere
9826000	9828000	can I take you I was like wow
9828000	9830000	because
9830000	9832000	you know they were
9832000	9834000	they could see me
9834000	9836000	and I'm like wow it was
9836000	9838000	great it was because
9838000	9840000	I
9840000	9842000	to me
9842000	9844000	the folks then in Seattle
9844000	9846000	were like a great above the rest of the world
9846000	9848000	they were like really
9848000	9850000	friendly to
9850000	9852000	it is actually okay there is
9852000	9854000	something weird about
9854000	9856000	it
9858000	9860000	how to put this
9860000	9862000	so I have
9862000	9864000	not traveled much
9864000	9866000	I've mostly only been
9866000	9868000	in central and northern California
9868000	9870000	throughout my entire life I've been
9870000	9872000	basically nowhere
9872000	9874000	but a couple times I traveled
9874000	9876000	a couple times I traveled a little bit
9876000	9878000	and I went
9878000	9880000	for example to Oregon
9880000	9882000	or Washington State
9882000	9884000	and
9884000	9886000	I don't know
9886000	9888000	I think
9890000	9892000	I think
9892000	9894000	that because I'm not well traveled
9894000	9896000	I probably have a
9900000	9902000	a distorted sense
9902000	9904000	but the people in
9904000	9906000	Oregon were very different
9906000	9908000	the people in Washington were
9908000	9910000	very different it may be that
9910000	9912000	it does actually seem
9912000	9914000	to me that places
9914000	9916000	have
9916000	9918000	something that
9918000	9920000	resembles a personality
9920000	9922000	and that the humans in those
9922000	9924000	places
9924000	9926000	reflect that does that make any
9926000	9928000	sense?
9928000	9930000	yeah yeah yeah
9930000	9932000	something like that
9932000	9934000	that's a yep
9934000	9936000	I'm an echo yeah
9936000	9938000	because the man made me think much
9938000	9940000	and I always say this
9940000	9942000	I know this quite well
9942000	9944000	because I go to India often
9944000	9946000	I've gone to India quite a lot
9946000	9948000	and they're forever complaining about
9948000	9950000	the outside and places dirty
9950000	9952000	and this and this
9952000	9954000	it's a manifestation of
9954000	9956000	the sum of the minds
9956000	9958000	in
9958000	9960000	in Hindu culture there are
9960000	9962000	words for these things
9962000	9964000	in English there are not
9964000	9966000	in Sanskrit there are words for
9966000	9968000	words
9968000	9970000	you have a culture that's like
9970000	9972000	8,000 years older than ours
9972000	9974000	and the white people
9974000	9976000	think they're intelligent
9976000	9978000	what?
9978000	9980000	you guys are playing with Play-Doh
9980000	9982000	or something works
9982000	9984000	you know
9984000	9986000	my son
9986000	9988000	he studies Advaita Vedanta
9990000	9992000	I know there are words
9992000	9994000	for all of these in Sanskrit
9994000	9996000	and in
9996000	9998000	Indian philosophy
9998000	10000000	there's very complex
10000000	10002000	sophisticated language about
10002000	10004000	all the different features
10004000	10006000	of anything
10006000	10008000	you might want to
10008000	10010000	refer to in consciousness at all
10012000	10014000	it's very interesting
10014000	10016000	compared to
10016000	10018000	how it is in English
10018000	10020000	it's so much richer
10020000	10022000	and more intelligent in some ways
10022000	10024000	you remind me of one thing
10024000	10026000	I was talking to another
10026000	10028000	buddy who might join us
10028000	10030000	who's a good candidate
10030000	10032000	to join our team
10032000	10034000	I must ask you to hold
10034000	10036000	I'm getting an important call
10036000	10038000	okay
10038000	10040000	oh it's too late
10040000	10042000	I missed it
10042000	10044000	it's alright, I'm here
10044000	10046000	oh I see
10046000	10048000	okay
10048000	10050000	maybe I'll talk about that
10050000	10052000	and we'll
10052000	10054000	we can continue another day
10054000	10056000	of course
10058000	10060000	there's a word
10062000	10064000	Darren
10064000	10066000	the word we are looking for is like
10066000	10068000	sensibility
10068000	10070000	meaning
10070000	10072000	what is it that we are looking
10072000	10074000	what is it that we are trying to get
10074000	10076000	artificial intelligence to do?
10076000	10078000	what is intelligence?
10078000	10080000	acumen
10080000	10082000	but they seem
10082000	10084000	the western world seems
10084000	10086000	to not want to talk about
10086000	10088000	the word
10088000	10090000	which is even more clear
10090000	10092000	in the Indian language in Tamil
10092000	10094000	and some of our local languages
10094000	10096000	it's called Bhutti
10098000	10100000	Buddha's name comes from that
10100000	10102000	Buddha is not his name
10102000	10104000	no
10104000	10106000	but they call it
10106000	10108000	like miss the sensible
10110000	10112000	what I
10112000	10114000	see I want to talk to you
10114000	10116000	I mean one word in English is equanimity
10118000	10120000	equanimity is it?
10120000	10122000	yeah it means not biased
10122000	10124000	you don't
10124000	10126000	you don't collapse into extremity
10126000	10128000	you're balanced
10128000	10130000	hmm
10130000	10132000	ah yes
10132000	10134000	that says that
10134000	10136000	your balance
10136000	10138000	what
10138000	10140000	I guess what to me
10140000	10142000	why the western world my trip over
10142000	10144000	it is when we talk about
10144000	10146000	sensibility
10146000	10148000	in the context
10148000	10150000	they are thinking of cognition
10150000	10152000	the western world
10152000	10154000	when it talks about AI
10154000	10156000	it's like forever going into cognition
10156000	10158000	and we are saying no the body
10158000	10160000	and the mind
10160000	10162000	must be both taken into account
10162000	10164000	in realizing what is the right
10164000	10166000	sensible thing to see sensible
10166000	10168000	or the right thing to do which is
10168000	10170000	which we will say is a sensible thing
10170000	10172000	to do the sensible thing to do
10172000	10174000	includes what your body
10174000	10176000	which means instinct
10176000	10178000	what your instinctive reactions are
10178000	10180000	because you're dealing with for example
10180000	10182000	indigenous people
10182000	10184000	and pretty much they're running on instinct
10184000	10186000	you know we don't know about
10186000	10188000	what cognition they have or they don't have
10188000	10190000	it doesn't matter
10190000	10192000	they're functional people on instinct
10192000	10194000	so sensibility
10194000	10196000	the word sense immediately implies
10196000	10198000	you know the five senses
10198000	10200000	for example right
10200000	10202000	more cognition
10202000	10204000	why had it occurred to you
10204000	10206000	or does it occur to you why does the western world
10206000	10208000	not talk about sensibility
10208000	10210000	the question is very
10210000	10212000	broad
10212000	10214000	meaning
10214000	10216000	like say when
10216000	10218000	in the AI circles and stuff
10218000	10220000	right when you're talking about
10220000	10222000	ethics and whatever
10222000	10224000	why not say
10224000	10226000	hey
10226000	10228000	which of these LLMs
10228000	10230000	is more sensible
10230000	10232000	takes into account
10232000	10234000	sensibility
10234000	10236000	which is different from intelligence
10236000	10238000	and I think enough people would know
10238000	10240000	that yeah
10240000	10242000	because intelligence immediately in a big way
10242000	10244000	kind of like
10244000	10246000	in the slides
10246000	10248000	or the leans towards
10248000	10250000	academia
10250000	10252000	leans towards
10252000	10254000	it does
10254000	10256000	but the common humans have no
10256000	10258000	all
10258000	10260000	they're missing
10260000	10262000	what you have
10262000	10264000	they're missing the experience
10264000	10266000	of
10266000	10268000	coherent
10268000	10270000	daily life
10272000	10274000	that
10276000	10278000	most of whose
10278000	10280000	rules don't need
10280000	10282000	to be written or declared
10284000	10286000	so what they have is something really
10286000	10288000	weird they have a thing where
10288000	10290000	all the rules are written
10290000	10292000	and declared
10292000	10294000	and you have to either obey
10294000	10296000	the ignorant of
10296000	10298000	or reject them
10298000	10300000	and one of the reasons why
10300000	10302000	Trump is about to get elected in this country
10302000	10304000	is because the rejection crowd
10304000	10306000	is really pissy at this point
10306000	10308000	in history
10310000	10312000	everybody all the males
10312000	10314000	all the ignorant poorly educated males
10314000	10316000	who have no fucking
10316000	10318000	no clue about
10318000	10320000	what it means to be human and yet are
10320000	10322000	anyway
10322000	10324000	they want somebody who gets away with breaking the rules
10324000	10326000	and they will elect that guy
10326000	10328000	if we don't you know
10328000	10330000	if something doesn't stop them
10330000	10332000	and
10336000	10338000	the guy
10338000	10340000	so he's the opposite of sensibility
10340000	10342000	but he masquerades as sensible
10342000	10344000	right
10344000	10346000	I saw some advertising with him
10346000	10348000	between masquerading
10348000	10350000	as sensible
10350000	10352000	and having to be sensible
10352000	10354000	to get elected and stay there
10354000	10356000	in a way from the other
10356000	10358000	prejudice
10358000	10360000	you're not going to get elected if you're sensible
10360000	10362000	there's no chance
10362000	10364000	of that happening
10364000	10366000	yeah that's
10366000	10368000	no
10368000	10370000	that's not going to happen
10372000	10374000	you get elected not okay
10374000	10376000	in America you get elected not because you're sensible
10376000	10378000	you get elected because you're sensational
10380000	10382000	it's a society of spectacles
10382000	10384000	right
10384000	10386000	the better your spectacle the better the brand
10386000	10388000	of spectacle that you produce
10388000	10390000	the more likely you are to be elected
10390000	10392000	that's sick
10392000	10394000	that's sad I mean
10394000	10396000	it's screwed that up so bad
10396000	10398000	I mean like
10398000	10400000	here let me ask you this
10400000	10402000	Kamala Harris should not be there
10402000	10404000	should not be up there
10404000	10406000	should she
10406000	10408000	I don't know
10408000	10410000	how would I tell
10410000	10412000	I mean supposing I really cared
10412000	10414000	right
10414000	10416000	how would I make the determination
10416000	10418000	do I want
10418000	10420000	a pissed off para-feminist
10420000	10422000	having a voice in the government
10422000	10424000	yeah I probably do
10424000	10426000	her particularly I'm not sure
10428000	10430000	I mean like
10430000	10432000	like a fly on the wall
10432000	10434000	you know
10436000	10438000	I don't know Kamala Harris's
10438000	10440000	talk very much
10440000	10442000	maybe I'm actually thinking of AOC
10442000	10444000	when you said her name
10444000	10446000	at least AOC is
10446000	10448000	I mean like she's
10448000	10450000	she's smart
10450000	10452000	yeah I mean
10452000	10454000	yeah smart
10456000	10458000	she
10458000	10460000	I mean she knows how to get attention
10460000	10462000	and it's not just
10464000	10466000	she used to be good
10466000	10468000	but I think she's going downhill
10468000	10470000	by the way
10470000	10472000	I've spent about 27 minutes
10472000	10474000	of my life listening to politicians
10474000	10476000	in 2020
10476000	10478000	acts
10478000	10480000	that's something I mostly
10480000	10482000	just ignore to be clear
10482000	10484000	and also to be clear for posterity
10484000	10486000	if anyone listens to this
10486000	10488000	I'm not well educated
10488000	10490000	okay
10490000	10492000	so and you're able to
10492000	10494000	I guess
10494000	10496000	for whatever you do
10496000	10498000	it doesn't affect you too much
10498000	10500000	or you find spots where
10500000	10502000	you're not affected by
10502000	10504000	you operate
10504000	10506000	I have a simple principle
10506000	10508000	at this accelerated age
10508000	10510000	that I'm at almost 60
10510000	10512000	not a kid anymore
10512000	10514000	the simple principle is
10514000	10516000	try not to actively import suffering
10516000	10518000	outside
10520000	10522000	so
10522000	10524000	the news is basically all about
10524000	10526000	importing suffering
10528000	10530000	so I mostly buffer that off
10530000	10532000	I may glance at it but I don't take it seriously
10532000	10534000	and I rarely reflect on it
10536000	10538000	it's mostly just me taking
10538000	10540000	the temperature of modernity
10540000	10542000	is the apocalypse likely to happen today
10542000	10544000	or next week
10546000	10548000	yeah
10548000	10550000	it's mostly that
10550000	10552000	do you pay much attention to news
10552000	10554000	what's your relationship with it like
10554000	10556000	not much
10556000	10558000	I mean I pay attention
10558000	10560000	to the news
10560000	10562000	in the last 5-10 years
10562000	10564000	some areas I'm a bit interested
10564000	10566000	more like world issues
10566000	10568000	well I mean like say India
10568000	10570000	Russia
10570000	10572000	is hitting
10572000	10574000	China to some extent
10574000	10576000	of course
10576000	10578000	I want to get
10578000	10580000	for orientation
10580000	10582000	then
10582000	10584000	being a bit more attentive
10584000	10586000	I'm still more
10586000	10588000	I would read news
10588000	10590000	that touches on our area
10590000	10592000	like what I'm talking to you about
10592000	10594000	getting funding
10594000	10596000	or if it's not funding
10596000	10598000	how do I go to the next step
10598000	10600000	from where I am
10600000	10602000	and the next step in
10602000	10604000	your village
10604000	10606000	becoming a voice
10606000	10608000	and making connections
10608000	10610000	and me
10610000	10612000	finding a way to
10612000	10614000	self sustain it
10614000	10616000	to fund it
10616000	10618000	when I sent you
10618000	10620000	the link
10620000	10622000	to
10622000	10624000	we move
10624000	10626000	we found this or whatever
10626000	10628000	basically
10628000	10630000	align with people
10630000	10632000	who would
10632000	10634000	invest in us or finances
10634000	10636000	or help us out
10636000	10638000	because we've got
10638000	10640000	enough
10640000	10642000	if we have a team
10642000	10644000	enough of us have to be paid
10644000	10646000	right
10646000	10648000	such as the world
10648000	10650000	so
10650000	10652000	where can you get funding and who funds them
10652000	10654000	and what are the requirements
10654000	10656000	and who has been successful
10656000	10658000	that kind of news
10658000	10660000	that I keep up
10660000	10662000	and then over and above that
10662000	10664000	when you see me
10664000	10666000	writing
10666000	10668000	most of my writing is under
10668000	10670000	the under
10670000	10672000	the substrate of it is
10672000	10674000	how do we
10674000	10676000	why can't we be
10676000	10678000	the same state
10678000	10680000	develop
10680000	10682000	why can't we be the same state
10682000	10684000	high state we were
10684000	10686000	500 or 600 years ago
10686000	10688000	right in my neck of the woods
10688000	10690000	and in particular
10690000	10692000	like
10692000	10694000	saying the villages
10694000	10696000	why
10696000	10698000	all of the things
10698000	10700000	zero crime
10700000	10702000	embodied currency
10702000	10704000	embodied learning
10704000	10706000	why can't we have that
10706000	10708000	it's like
10708000	10710000	why can't we have what I had from
10710000	10712000	zero to seven with an unconditional love
10712000	10714000	mother
10714000	10716000	I can go and sleep
10716000	10718000	and I want kids
10718000	10720000	and I want my
10720000	10722000	I want the work
10722000	10724000	of hundreds of generations of
10724000	10726000	my forefathers to continue
10726000	10728000	instead of it going
10728000	10730000	so downhill in one generation
10730000	10732000	it has gone downhill too
10732000	10734000	everybody
10734000	10736000	is doing it meaning
10736000	10738000	you go around with solicit doing crime
10738000	10740000	and whatever just casually
10740000	10742000	and you ask me what the hell are you doing
10742000	10744000	and they say hey everybody you can't
10744000	10746000	you don't do it everybody is doing it
10746000	10748000	and I said no
10748000	10750000	not everybody is doing it
10750000	10752000	I'm not doing it come on
10752000	10754000	for example a lawyer who is
10754000	10756000	stealing and cheating and screwing his customer
10756000	10758000	hey don't have faith in your intellect
10758000	10760000	that you can do something else
10760000	10762000	for example we stopped
10762000	10764000	you know emerging we stopped creating
10764000	10766000	anything new for 600 years
10766000	10768000	why didn't we do part of that
10768000	10770000	that needs law too
10770000	10772000	I mean the young kids
10772000	10774000	the younger people are a bit ready to
10774000	10776000	listen to that the folks
10776000	10778000	who are the lawyers and stuff
10778000	10780000	big names no they're not interested
10780000	10782000	in that they want to screw the system
10782000	10784000	bloody hell I'm so
10784000	10786000	but I guess they're not born in the
10786000	10788000	kind of village and conditional love
10788000	10790000	environment that I was
10790000	10792000	look whenever you take
10792000	10794000	a cohort like lawyers
10794000	10796000	or doctors or dentists or
10796000	10798000	teachers
10798000	10800000	you're gonna find a large prevalence
10800000	10802000	of what I'll call the worst common
10802000	10804000	denominator
10804000	10806000	which is the people who
10806000	10808000	you know
10808000	10810000	but what you're actually looking at
10810000	10812000	is a topology
10812000	10814000	and as you come to understand
10814000	10816000	the structure of the topology
10816000	10818000	you'll be able to find the people in
10818000	10820000	the cohort who aren't defecting
10822000	10824000	and those people will be excited to discover
10824000	10826000	you as well
10826000	10828000	this is a moment of mutual
10828000	10830000	appreciation
10830000	10832000	that's long been coming
10832000	10834000	many of us would like the dreams of our
10834000	10836000	ancestors
10836000	10838000	not to be flushed down the toilet
10838000	10840000	in a single generation
10842000	10844000	and some of us would like those dreams
10844000	10846000	to be actually fulfilled
10850000	10852000	so that's
10852000	10854000	those purposes live
10854000	10856000	in the hearts of humans
10856000	10858000	and if we can
10858000	10860000	awaken them it will be very
10860000	10862000	powerful
10862000	10864000	and it doesn't have to be a cult
10866000	10868000	it doesn't even have to be
10868000	10870000	political it can just be human
10872000	10874000	and you often you know in your writing
10874000	10876000	you know you say
10876000	10878000	this is an everyday
10878000	10880000	thing
10880000	10882000	this is normal
10882000	10884000	yes
10884000	10886000	I think that's what those guys in the
10886000	10888000	book I quoted from earlier were saying
10888000	10890000	too they're like we have this narrative
10890000	10892000	that it's impossible to change this
10892000	10894000	and that humans are fundamentally broken
10894000	10896000	it's not true
10896000	10898000	they're just trapped in why are they
10898000	10900000	trapped in thinking they're broken
10904000	10906000	so yeah these are things that I
10906000	10908000	want to keep
10908000	10910000	exploring and understanding better and get
10910000	10912000	people doing something around
10912000	10914000	right experimenting
10914000	10916000	play grow learn discover
10916000	10918000	remember
