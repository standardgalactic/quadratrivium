WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Testing.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Yep.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Ah, yes.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
So,

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
do me the favor

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
of

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
saying your name

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
so that I don't mispronounce it.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Yep.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Balapile.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Balapile.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Yes, and I am Darren Stevenson,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
so we are here in a conversation together

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
that I wanted to record.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Because it was becoming,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
as I expected,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
it too very interesting.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Balah had been discussing

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
something

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
in

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
ideas

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
from a specific

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
person

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
whose name you can say.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Actually, maybe you can just go over

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
briefly.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Okay, I'll do that.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
What I was talking about is

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
the notion of

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
network state.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
As in any T, W, R, K

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
second word state, S, T, A,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
T, E, network state.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Um,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
chat called Balaji Srimivasan,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
quite a

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
personality, known personality online.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Um, used to be CTO

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
of Coinbase.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
But,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
you know, it's not just a crypto guy,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
it's no crypto, very well read,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
you know, history, background,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
people.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You could summarize him as a pro-anarchy guy,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
right, who doesn't take

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
limits of, um,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
government and all that as limits.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
So,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
his,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
what the network state means is,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
right,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
you can form

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
enough of the ethos,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
and the common

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
wealth

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
of a group of people

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
online,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
and then later,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
right, enough of the cohorts

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
can, you know,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
could have agreed

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
to where they want to stay,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
and live in a place where they,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
uh,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
where they get along.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Where they're physically approximate

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
so that they can collaborate

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
in each other's

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
life development.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Yep.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Right, so that,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
um, this is much more,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
it's not impossible to do at a distance.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Yep.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
But it's much more difficult.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Absolutely.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Well, there are more challenges.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Um, yeah, it's just,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
it's a different space of

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
challenge for

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
those who are not proximal.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Um,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
but you said something

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
that I thought was hilarious.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
You were like,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm brilliant.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Go ahead, you were talking about somebody

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
buying a house.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Okay, the background word is this, right?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I've gone through all those states.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
What do I mean by all those states?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
You know,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
living,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
grew up in a semi-rural village,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
you know, where everybody

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
knew everybody and,

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
you know, it's a tropical place

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
so that you're never worried about

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
money because it seemed like,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
why do you, you know,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
food was available all over the place

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
and you could go and sleep in anybody's house.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
So what's your problem?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
You know, right?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
That was, um, and then,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
but my parents

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
have moved from India

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
to Malaysia,

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
right?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
My father had gone through the struggles

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
in India and in some,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
in Malaysia, he was continuing

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
in Malaysia

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
and he was driven

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
to have,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
to have lots more money under the pillow,

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
right?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
And on that, later,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
he was just full on into like,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
being a stingy guy

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
who saves and saves and saves

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
and for good reason because of his

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
background, right?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Right, his history, yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
After that, and the British rule

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
in India, right?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
His tough times, right?

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Uh, there were tough times. So in Malaysia

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
it's easier but he didn't realize it

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
that easier. So he,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
he went on a spree of, um,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
ah, so what he would do

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
is buy one property upon property

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
upon property and including

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
our house itself,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
what we call,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
the house, the family house,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
his only concern was

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
to replace, you know, if you buy this house,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
ah, what's the replacement value?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
If I were to sell it, how much money would I get,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
you know? Um,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
he didn't care about much

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
anything else and then

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
me, right,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
ah, has to pay for that

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
because it has completely broken up

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
the family.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
As compared to,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
you know, now my adopted village,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Darren, is a village

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
in Indonesia, in Java.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
It's a zero crime village

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
similar to the kind of village

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
my father was born in, right?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Uh, they didn't live there

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
on age 18

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
and there,

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
the values

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
fit with the village, the people

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
despite the rest of the world not

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
wanting to have anything to do with zero crime

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
villagers because it's got

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
consequences, right?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
It's got consequences.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
For example, people won't

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
be fronting wealth because they won't

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
be much wealth, it'll be culturally

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
communist, right?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Yes, yes.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
But you will not worry about old age

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
and children being taken care of because

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
the people love to take care

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
of other people.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Yes, they are living in a

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
traditional

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
a traditional context

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
where

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
everyone takes care, not

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
not every single person,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
most of the people take care

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
of each other

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
and they understand

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
so this changes their role

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
as a human being,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
right? Transforms

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
their role as a human being

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
from I am here for me

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
and mine

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
or just I am here for me

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
to we are here together

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
for each other.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
If you don't have that,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I will argue, if you don't have

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
we are here together for each other

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
you don't have humans yet.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
You have something

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
weird. It's not human.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
That's it.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
And I want to

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
stamp it even further.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Yeah, by all means.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I mean

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I've grown up in like

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
fighting a lot of people,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
probably

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
post

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
you know, post university

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
even in university it didn't

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
occur to me.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Maybe particularly from the 90s onwards

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
okay, basically

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm into unconditional love

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
that

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm with again and again.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Bala, why are you being...

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
The thing that I find hilarious about what you said

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
is that

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
linguistically it's backwards.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
It's not that you're into unconditional love,

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
it's that you didn't

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
defect from it.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Right?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
That's the natural position

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
for human beings.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
You simply didn't defect

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
in my view, but please continue.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I'm with you.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Yeah, so exactly

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
because my mother

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
grew up

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
in such a place.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
So she didn't know anything

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
else and she went to great lengths.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Oh my god.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Consequences.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
But leave all of those

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
cause, you know,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
talking to you, one of the greatest things about

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
talking to you Darren is, you can talk

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
about things that are, you might

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
have a long life

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
taught its age, unconventional, so kind of like

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
censor that a bit, you know.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
No, you can do whatever you want

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
so I love it, you know, okay.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
So I

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
loved, you know,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
my mother was the epitome of unconditional

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
love and I love that.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Beautiful.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
You know, it didn't occur

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
full on to me at that time, right?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
It occurred enough, but because

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
occurred enough as in, you know,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
when the world became

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
difficult, there's one person

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
that you could go to who has got time, patients

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
for you. She listened

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
and she won't, you know, abruptly

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
stop you halfway or say that

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
that's a silly idea.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
She will take it that it's possible

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
that her child may know something that she doesn't,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
you know, right?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And that was

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
special, right, in this

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
kind of like cruel world, right?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Extremely beautiful, yes.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So I want

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
to continue that and I was not going to

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
stop, agree

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
with anybody who said it's impossible.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
You know, you can't.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
And later in life,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
of late, I realized, no,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
they,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
many who say it's impossible

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
are only saying it because

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
our narrative has so much

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
become zero or

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
100 binary.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It's like, if something is not

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
exact, you know, it's like, can you guarantee

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
me that 100%

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
you know, that person who is

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
in your village, you can have unconditional love?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Well, the real answer is

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
why do you even, why can't it be

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
fuzzy at the edges?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Say again.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Even when we do math

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
or graphs, you know, we cut off the

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
extremes and that's good enough

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
if you can manage it 90% but, you know,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
there are outliers but you don't need

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
to like spend your whole lifetime

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
passing the last 2%

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
you know.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Okay, you've touched on something, wait,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
you've touched on something I want to highlight.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Please

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
nurture your

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
line of thought and where you are going

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
so that you can hold on to it for a second.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
But I

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
want to say something, the zero 100

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
thing. So

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
as children

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
eventually

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
we attempt things

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
that are at least

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
initially, they are

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
impossible. Okay?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
It is initially

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
impossible for you to

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
stand up.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
It is initially impossible for you to take

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
a step.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
It is initially impossible

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
for you to jump

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
or run

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
or walk or speak

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
or swim

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
or hold your breath underwater

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
or ride a bicycle

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
or write language.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
All of these things start out

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
initially impossible

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
and if we

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
evaluate them on the basis

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
that is usually used in our cultures

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
pretty much nothing is possible

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
because you can't, the only things that are

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
possible are things where you go from

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
zero to 100 in one move.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Right?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
In a single move.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Never happened.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Right?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
So we do have this mindset

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
and I was reading

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I just want to share something from

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
a book called the dawn of everything that I was

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
reading last night.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
We're talking about

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
our views of history being wrong

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
and we basically have two views. It was

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
wonderful. We all took care of

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
each other and then we fell from that

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
now it's every man for himself

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
and there's no way to change it.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
The best you can hope for

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
is slight adjustments

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
to the tyrannical nonsense

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
of human society.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And I say this

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
as long ago as 1936

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
the prehistorian V. Gordon Child

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
wrote a book called man makes himself

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
apart from the sexist language

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
this is the spirit we wish to invoke.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
We are projects

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
of collective self-creation.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
We approach human history that way.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
What if we treat people

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
from the beginning

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
as imaginative intelligent playful

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
creatures who deserve to be understood

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
as such? What if

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
instead of telling a story about how

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
our species fell from some idyllic

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
state of equality

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
we ask

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
how we came to be trapped

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
in such tight conceptual

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
shackles

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
that we no longer even imagine

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
the ability of reinventing our societies.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
They say ourselves

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
but what they mean is

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
our societies.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
We can't imagine it because it seems

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
like it's like a task like eating

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
the moon

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
or drinking the ocean.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
So no one imagines

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
that it's only possible

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
it's necessary

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
to be intelligent.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
The entire history

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
and future of life on this planet

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
may depend on the single

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
on this single pivot

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
can humans form

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
intelligent

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
aware collectives

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
with and for each other

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
and with and for the history

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
and future of life on this planet.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Now of course we can

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
on the small scale.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
We can do it immediately

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
we can do it. You and I are not going to

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
have any problem doing that

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
right here, right now. We'll be doing that

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
together, right?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
So it's immediately

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
if you just shrink the scale from

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
everything to something

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
you can do it right now

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
with any few people

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
who are motivated and sincere

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
you know, yeah.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Please continue.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Right on, right on. Excellent.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
So, so good to hear.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
So good to hear.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And you know

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
much of it is

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
self

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
it's like self fulfilling prophecy

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
or self created meaning

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
one of my biggest answer backs

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
has worked right against this notion is

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
against this notion of

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
it can't be done you know it's impossible

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
it's

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
this whole

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
hopelessness is

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
you know guys

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
if we were living

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
you know

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
before the first village

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
right and

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
the first village would never have happened

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
you know like

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
often I'll see in

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
online forums

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
like

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
the ones that you quite a lot

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
in this one the p2p foundation

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
right quite a lot of people from

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
around the world

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
and often

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
the people are so good at

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
nitpicking right

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
right and I'm like by the way these are

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
people who probably never accomplish anything

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
other than nitpicking

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
but go ahead.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Yeah.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
They're professional nitpickers

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
right what do you do for a living I sit around

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
on a computer screen and pick

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
nits

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
so

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I'm like saying hey look

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
right

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
you

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
just imagine you know

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
if our ancestors

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
very little they made the first village

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
happen if they could not get along

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
right

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
if they were egotistical

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
the first village would not have happened

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
in all likelihood it would have taken many attempts

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
for the first village to

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
to happen

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
you know to stay and be

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
maintained continue as first village

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
but we know that it

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
happened and then it went on to become

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
a small town and

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
those language and

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
so if those people

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
can kind of hold their negativity

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
their pessimism down a bit

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
right to let

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
the blossoming as the blossoming

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
see in nature right despite

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
all the earthquakes and whatever

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
negative you know there may be

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
there still is you know

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
flowering and blooming and you know

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
joy and aesthetics

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
in nature

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
right

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
why can't we

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
look at the good

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
and ignore the bad

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
right unless the bad totally

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
you know cannot be

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
right if the house

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
catches on fire we'll get some water

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
yeah

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
right yeah

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
you know

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
but it's not

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
a matter of okay it's not a matter

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
of this it's a matter

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I think and by all

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
means correct me if you see it differently

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
yeah it's a matter of

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
the

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
the

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
the

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
okay look

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
we got two different

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
kinds of options right

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
you can put humans together

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
you can get them to agree

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
to come together as a group let's say

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
a small group seven people

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
okay

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
and you can

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
say again

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
I said entirely

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I mean nobody would argue

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
same person can argue against that

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
if you said seven people you know like

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
okay

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
right you can get seven people together

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
and

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
tell them either one of two things

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
okay

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
you're just going to learn how to

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
get along and help each other

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
yeah

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
and be for each other

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
and be together as one unit as well

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
as being individuals

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
you're either going to learn how to do that

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
or we're going to give you some principles

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
but the fundamental problem is that

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
there has to be a catalyst

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
right

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
there has to be a profound catalyst

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
that makes the people want

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
to be together

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
and to grow together

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
and to learn together so either

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
the catalyst

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
for most people

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
the catalyst is either the fear

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
of really bad experiences

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
of being human

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
or

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
it's the

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
it's FOMO

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
it's a version of FOMO

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I know that being human can mean

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
so much more than living in this box

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
and watching television but I don't know

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
how to get to that

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
the fear of missing out

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
right those are two highly

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
motivated highly motivating

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
things but the third highly

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
motivating thing is a fire

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
right like the village is on fire

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
get up let's go

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
right or

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
or you know

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
in a city

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
you will see humans

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
form highly effective

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
cooperative pods

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
little groups right pods

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
spontaneously

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
if there is a car accident

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
if there is an earthquake

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
right

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
what will happen if there is an earthquake

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
is you will see three things

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
people who are sort of neutral

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
they don't know what the fuck to do

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
so they're kind of milling about

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
the people who are

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
acquisitive

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
these people are looking for opportunities

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
to profit off the situation

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
and then people who are

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
you know they convert to altruists

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
right we're going to help each other

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
get through this right now

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Hey, follow up to you

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
you remind me of something

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
critical I want to ask

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I wanted to ask you

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
let me ask you

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
of course

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
keep your thought along but I want to ask you this

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
you know

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I've gone through a tough life

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
situation the last few years

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
and one thing you say

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
for me

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
has been a dog named Benji

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
right

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
this is not surprising even slightly

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I'm listening

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
yeah no surprise there

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
I want to ask you

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
this one thing

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
it goes into the granular

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
of

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
unity

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
is diversity

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
it's not

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
once people don't have to riddle themselves with

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
finding

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
we can find unity within diversity

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
or allow for diversity

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
within unity

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
what you will find

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
is something like your hand

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
right

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
where you have a bunch of unique

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
members

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
and there's

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
no problem with the index finger

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
being its own finger

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
no problem

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
but they always

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
work together for each other

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
and the synergy that the palm

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
right where they come together

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
the synergy where the palm of the hand is

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
that stuff is powerful

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
in fact that's the stuff that makes most

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
of the trouble

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
for humans

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
is we're making the bad form of synergy

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
right

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
we're like oh with synergy

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
you can go faster you can get more

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
you can

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
you can mutate

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
and propagate wildly if you have synergy

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
but I'm listening

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I didn't hear

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
your question

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
you were talking about diversity and unity

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
good good good

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
the small subset

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
within that

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
with my dog

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
the dog loves

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
to come

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
and lick

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
the inside of my mouth

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
right

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
and

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
you know

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
it's a mix between

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
a golden retriever and a food dog

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
right

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
very

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
humanly

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
very into humans

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I have no idea what people listening to

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
our conversation will think when you say that

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
but keep going because I'm going to go somewhere

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
that I think you're actually going to go to

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
but let's see

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
anyway

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I have this overall view that

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
all creatures and plants have been

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
made

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
maybe we don't know like a bed bug

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
we don't know why

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
but it's got a logical reason

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
but it's got a reason

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
so when my dog

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
when this dog comes and licks me

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
wants to you know out of his instinct

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
and he's so determined to like what to do

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I let him

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
so as time goes on

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
it's fine

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
because

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
but now let me go to the

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
the gist I want to get to you

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
he

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
you know we have I think

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
adopted a practice of giving

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
it's different

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
from

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
gating

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
and giving can never be as good

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
as

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
satisfying as

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
gating

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
oh that is

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
such bullshit but I understand

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
that that's the tradition

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
yes go ahead

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
okay but you know

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
for the dog

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I'll cut to them

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
yeah you're right

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
it's very happy

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
number one

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
and it's happy more time

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
much of its happiness comes from

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
giving

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
it's like instinctively

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I mean I would argue that the dog

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
doesn't even make that distinction

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
yeah

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
that's it

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
it never makes that distinction

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
it understands receiving

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
so to speak

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
perhaps it differentiates that

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
I'm not sure

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
but its body understands the difference between

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
he's holding a chunk of meat

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
and he isn't

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
body understands that

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
but the thing about the dog

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
okay look it's doing something crazy

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
and you know

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
this isn't to suggest that everyone should

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
French kiss their dogs

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
for those of you for whom it's natural

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
by all means

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
let them you know let them lick your mouth

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I think many in the west

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
would consider that disgusting

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
or dangerous or unhealthy

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
because the dog has a lot of germs

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
so to speak

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
but here's the actual thing that's crazy

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
I will argue

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
something really bizarre here

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
and I'll take responsibility for my argument

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I will argue that your dog

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
is already

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
your dog has senses

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
that sense your mind

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
yeah

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
the same way you can smell the dog

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
the dog can smell your mind

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
right yeah

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
senses that can sense your mind

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
it has senses that can participate

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
with your mind

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
it has senses that are telepathic

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
it has senses with which it can

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
bond its intelligence to yours

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
and give something

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
truly astonishingly miraculous

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
to you

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
humans all the time and the humans don't recognize

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
it at all they don't even notice it

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
they just feel better when the dog's around

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
they can't see what the dog's actually doing

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
and I'm going to argue

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
that what most of the dogs are actually doing

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
is they're trying to

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
they're trying to do something like

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
the Vulcan mind meld

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
in Star Trek

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
where Spock becomes

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
the two minds become one mind

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
it's trying to do something like that

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
and it's trying to do that for

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
a way of heroic purposes

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
one of the best things it could possibly

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
do if that were its goal

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
would be to get its microbiota

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
into your gut microbiome

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
and your microbiota

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
into its

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
once you start sharing

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
the digestive

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
microbiota especially

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
the first

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
sort of landing zone

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
for microbiota and humans one of them

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
anyways the mouth

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
so

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
when dogs are sniffing poop

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
and doing whatever they're doing

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
presuming they do such things

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
they're

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
connoisseurs of bacteria

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
it's obvious to me from observing them

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
so I would argue that

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
the dog is actually trying to become

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
one fit more

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
one organism

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
with you

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
so that its microbiota get into your mouth

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
and your microbiota get into

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
its mouth and some on both sides

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
survive

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
and they reproduce and they become families

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
of trillions of organisms

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
trillions

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
there's 43 trillion

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
bacteria inside a human body

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
and once again right you have the same thing

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
you have unity and diversity

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
the diversity supports

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
the health of the unity

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
yep

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
and especially

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
on this part right

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
especially if you say look

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
what is the reality when people talk about unity

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
and

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
diversity

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
in today's governance world

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
when they talk about unity

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
they're talking about conformity

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
isn't it

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
conformity does absolutely

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
cannot be that the basis for unity

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
no

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
this is why

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
if you're putting a cohort together

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
you don't

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
want to have to give them rules

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
you want them

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
to discover the process together

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
so that it's organic

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
I think

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
but in a dire situation

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
where there's something interfering with them

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
discovering it together

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
the catalyst should

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
should declare the

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
principles

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
yes

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
the catalyst should

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
communicate the principles to us

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
and what I was going to say is that

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
a long time ago

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
let me just say something really simple and stupid

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
by the time a human collective

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
needs rules

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
70%

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
of that collective has gone missing

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
in action for one reason or another

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
and it's offline

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
yep yep

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
by the time you have to tell people what to do

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
the intimacy is

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
not there

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
there's no intimacy between them

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
they can't sense each other

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
they're not sensing each other

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
and doing predictive analysis for each other's needs

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
and vulnerabilities

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
and things like that

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
which humans in a tightly knit group do that

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
all day long every day

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
they just naturally do that

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
they're vigilant

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
in a way

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
they're vigilant of everything

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
as if they were the unity

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
as if the concerns of the unity

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I don't know it's really hard to say it in language

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
because it sounds like a rule and it's a game

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
it's not a rule

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
hmm

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
but once you make it a rule

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
you're going to have a tough time

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
like by the time God had to write stuff in stone

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
on top of some mountain

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
and send Moses down to his people

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
with what

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
10 rules

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
you gotta imagine like

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
things must have been really bad

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
for something that

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
severe to have to happen

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
you gotta tell people

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
don't kill each other

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
you gotta tell them

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
not to steal

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
right

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
you gotta tell them to wear a loincloth

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
all right

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
or you know what don't rub your butt on your food

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
and

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
time you have to

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
tell them these things

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
something's gone horribly

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
haywire like not

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
in a little way

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
in like an apocalyptically

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
bad way

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
it can only go from here to disaster

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
kind of way

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
and

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
text

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I mean writing it down

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
overall

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I mean in a large

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
in a large way

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
it's taking us backwards

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
especially

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I mean

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
as with any technology

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
good and bad

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
and also

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
unfortunately for humans

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
pretty much unavoidable

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
given the situations

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
unavoidable

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
okay look

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
the problem with text is you have

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
okay if I am speaking with you

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
or you are speaking with me

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
right yep

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
we both have an idea of to whom we are speaking

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
and also to whom we are

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
listening

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
once you have text

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
you have the possibility which is

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
very dangerous for human cognition

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
the way human cognition

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
psychologically

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
it's anatomy very very dangerous

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
if you have a thing which is this

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
speech without someone speaking

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
it to you

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
now you can't

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
tell whether that's an actual

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
person

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
whether it's a machine

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
whether it's God

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
or

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
whether it's a problem in your consciousness

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
and since you can't tell

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
which one of these it is

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
things go badly

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
once you have

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
disembodied speakers

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
things go badly

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
for humans

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
generally it's also a sign

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
that things have already gotten

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
weird

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I mean when I think about getting

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
humans together for each other

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
and this is perhaps the most exciting thought I am capable of having

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I have to admit

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
it seems

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
almost impossible or wildly

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
unlikely to my

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
pragmatic

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
mind

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
my pragmatic thoughts

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
how do you tell them

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
what do you want them to do

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
what's so exciting that

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
we are going to get together

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
and actually go on a mission

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I have various answers to those

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
questions but it sure seems

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
just as we were talking

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
as we were speaking about earlier

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
in the conversation it seems to be

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
a 0-100 problem

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
it isn't

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
it isn't a 0-100 problem

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
but it seems that way

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
until

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
you get a few experiences of

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
making it work

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
and you can make it work

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
for an hour

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
you don't have to make it work for the future

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
or the world

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
you can make it work for two hours for five people

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
now

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
they will get a taste

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
oh shit we can do this

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
we can actually do this together

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
because

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I would argue

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
and I know this is a very dangerous thing to say

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
but I am quite certain of the truth of it

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I would argue that a team of

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
five people could transform

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
a nation

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
in 90 days

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
any nation

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
probably almost any five people

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
and if this was ever true in human history

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
it's more true now than it's ever been

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
because

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
the history and future of life on earth

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
depends on

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
the humans becoming intelligent

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
yeah

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
the humans must become intelligent

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
or either that

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
or you have to kill off 97% of them

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
or something

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
right

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
if you want to keep the world alive

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
because they will just keep making machines

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
not arguing to kill anybody

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
to be clear

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
I am saying if you want to preserve life on earth

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
we either have to

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
the entire history

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
the meaning of the history of life on this world

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
and the future

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
of those histories

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
we have got to get the humans playing a game

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
that isn't lethal

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
together

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
right

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
it's the fundamental priority

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
it's more important than any other thing I can think of

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
if we care about

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
will there be a world for our grandchildren

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
if we don't care about that

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
it's still really important

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
but

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
so

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
so then you have the problem of

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
in this case

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
in the little toy

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
universe that I'm creating here during our discussion

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
in this case what you do

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
is you get five people together

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
and you teach them how to solve an intractable problem

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
locally to where they live

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
right

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
so that they have the experience of

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
taking on a problem that just can't be fucking solved

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
synergizing

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
you know

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
solving the problem

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
now they have experience

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
this was

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
this topic was related to

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
our agreement

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
to come to listen to talk together

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
today

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
because we were talking about teams

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I was talking about teams and that's when you sent me

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
a message on Facebook right

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
yep

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
yes correct

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
so there's something about collaboration

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
collaboration

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
how can we

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
make what you are

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
trusting and which is what I'm trusting to

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
in your messages

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I love that word

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
saying

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
okay

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
that's an alternative

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
and you put it in such a way that

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
again

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
a lot of the usual suspects

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
cannot even object to it

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
because it's beyond

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
also look

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I don't care

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
I want to be really clear

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
yes I don't care about the usual suspects

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
objecting because here's what's going to happen

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
once you get humans being

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
actually human together

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
and

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
the public

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
is able to observe that happening

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
and

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
see the results

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
and see what it's like to be

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
to have the scope of our humanity

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
some portion of that return to us

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
relationally

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
behaviorally

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
in terms of our role and our felt sense of

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
role if you can give him some of that back

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
those objectors

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
are going to last about six days

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
and then they're going to be on

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
forming their own teams

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
and be left out

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
no idiot is dumb enough

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
that when they see the humans making that

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
nectar of being human together

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
they're going to be like yeah I don't want to be part of that

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
that's the original

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
that's the original

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
money

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
that's what money is a representation

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
of is that nectar

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
yeah

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
that's right that's right

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
it's the synergistic nectar

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
yeah

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
and then the humans can learn things like this

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
you can teach children this and you're like

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
look your parents are doing this thing

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
with money

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
and what they're really trying to get

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
is this other stuff that you and your friends

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
make naturally when you play together

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
they're not getting any of that

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
so they're trying really hard to get money

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
you don't have to do that

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
the thing that you and your friends are doing

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
can develop

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
can grow

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
and can be maintained

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
like you can get five people together

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
and then five of them split apart

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
two of those form

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
new ones

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
the other three

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
join existing ones

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
so that there's sort of cross-pollination

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
between

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
team and pod groups

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
and this is something that works really really well

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
the game that I'm talking about is the game that every organism

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
in nature is playing

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
and the humans are

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
made to play this game but they're playing

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
sort of the opposite of it

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
which is kill the unity

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
and make representations of the dead things

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
and then sell them

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
to each other

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
so

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
if you give them a game that's authentic to play

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
and they like it

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
it's going to become really

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
contagious

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
if you give actual humans something

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
to do that's amazing and the other people see

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
you'll have

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
objectors at first

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
but it's not going to last long

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
don't say that again

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
I want to process that

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
say the last two sentences again

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
the goal is to do something

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
so momentous and beautiful

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
that nobody can stand

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
to be left out

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
nobody

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
everybody wants in

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
that's full on I can

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
sense that because

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
and that's an achievable thing

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
in a way

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
just you and I speaking

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
of such matters is the beginning

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
of that

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
can you see why I say that

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Bala?

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
and I know 100%

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
and I have happened in my background

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
these people who are labeled

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
poor and whatever in the zero crime villages

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
but these kids are so rich

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
I mean

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
they are alive

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
to be human

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
if you get excited

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
with the cockroach being upside down

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I mean whatever

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
toys can come from

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
what the rest of the world

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
might call nothing but

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
they're excited

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
because like you were saying

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
walking is impossible

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
running is impossible

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
jumping is impossible

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
but

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
they're not overwhelmed

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
by all of the

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
text around the world

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
I suppose

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
yes and also

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I'm guessing

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
do the children have phones?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
no

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
they don't

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
by the way

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
this is like an alien

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
comes to earth

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
and finds your village

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
and looks and says this is a very unusual village

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
here

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
where are your children's phones

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
and you say

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
they don't have any and the alien says

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
oh I'd like to raise my children here

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
do you think it would be okay?

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
can I

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
can we do this together?

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
wow

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
it's almost like asking

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
do your children

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
wear a mechanical parasite

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
that destroys their attention

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
motivation

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
awareness

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
it's not the only thing the phones do

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
but

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
it's a lot of what they do

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Darren you remind me

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
I'll be going back

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
again in a couple of months

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
back to the village

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
and

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
the permanently based there

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
very soon I'm just

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
organizing to do that

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
tying some of those

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
with the

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
urban world

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
what was beautiful

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
every time I'm there

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
the kids

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
automatically want to help the mother

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I mean

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
it was very common

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
it was very common me growing up

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
my sisters would help the mother

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
and I would help the father

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
and stuff like that

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
I mean they didn't have to do too much

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
but

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
now I've played

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
my kids

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
to some extent but just generally

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I noticed

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
people are finding it very hard

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
to get their kids to do chores

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
yeah

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
but when I go to the village

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
the kids

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
seem to like wow

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
I'm given a chance to be an adult

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
yes

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
amusement

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and like wow they're treating me like an adult now

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
they're not completely saying

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I can't do this and I can't do that

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
and so

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
because

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
my brother-in-law

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
my

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
my

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
sorry my

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
my brother-in-law's children

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
essentially

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
my nephews like

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Anises

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
bring breakfast I'm upstairs and they're downstairs

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
and they're bringing coffee and this

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
and this is like 8 years old

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
she does a good job

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
I'm so happy

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
with that

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
and a mother or my wife

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
doesn't have to

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
push up she looks forward to

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
doing this

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
it's like

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
what you'll find is like

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
in our culture

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
the children are competing

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
to get things

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
they want to get things

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
in the village culture

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
the children are competing to

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
it's not merely

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
give

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
they are competing

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
to participate

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
meaningfully

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
with the family

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
the village the planet

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
and the adults

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
and the children

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
participate meaningfully

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
and so the chance to bring coffee

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
is better than just sitting there looking at my thumb

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
and

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
they don't have a smart phone to defect into

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
so they're not going to defect

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
that way so you know

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
they wouldn't be doing any other thing

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
but the chance to bring coffee is meaningful

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I'm serving my ancestors

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
they are still alive today with me

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
in the same room

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
this is magic

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
we are still alive together

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
and then maybe

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
if it's just this

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
a rite of passage as in

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
one of the things all want to be

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
they don't want to be

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
treated like kids

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
like we know nothing

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
too often

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
some of that works in their favor

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
because some of the children

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
respond to that by becoming

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
monumentally

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
intelligent

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
because they're like

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
that dumb kid

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
my dad called me dumb

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
so I learned quantum physics

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I'm just giving

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
a ridiculous example

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
some of it does sort of help

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
the children

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
but that shouldn't be

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
the cultural

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
you know

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
that shouldn't be the cultural tradition

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I'm listening

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
so wait Darren

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I want to imprint this into my head

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
which is

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
number one there's an issue

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
there's a big problem of getting kids

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
to like do the

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
sensible things

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
and one of the reasons why

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
they don't want to do this

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
they want to get things

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
they want to either get things

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
or they want to defect

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
and they're addicted to electronic stimuli

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
and things like that

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
so they're used to

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
constantly referring to an object

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
with their attention

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
the children there don't have to do that

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
if they have a phone

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
even if they have a computer

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
if they have a phone

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
if they have a video game

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
if they have a television

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
if they have even a radio

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
it starts to be

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
the same kind of thing

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
and also because

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
we've totally

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
you know

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
okay I have to say

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
I'm sorry

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
I have to say

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
the thing all those things are replacing

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
is meaningful relation

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
in the village with the others

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
all those things

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
they are replacing that

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
they are the money version

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
of the nectar that's produced naturally

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
when the people are there

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
for each other

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
this great sweetness

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
combination of silence

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
laying hopscotch

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
in front of the hall

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
seeing the kids

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
from the neighbor's house coming

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
not wearing something different

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
all of that

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
is little sparkles

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
you know

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
talking

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
learning how to speak a bit better

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
it is because you and the children are there together

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
for each other

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
even the children who aren't yours

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
and you know

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
the children

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
they like

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I don't know how to put it

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
the children are carrying

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
assets

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
that the adults don't

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
recognize

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
and dispose of

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
and punish the children for carrying

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
everywhere around here

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
mostly a little bit of you know

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
there are a few intelligent parents that know better

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
but

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
the children are bringing something

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
to the table

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
and the adults pretend

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
to be rude

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
you are dependent on us

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
and since we have to protect you

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
you are dependent on us

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
and this creates a kind of slavery

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
children in the west

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
are sort of conceived of as slaves

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
this is why we send them to school

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
which is basically a slave making process

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
this is why they go to university

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
get degrees and so forth

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
in the representational layer

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
of human culture and society

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
which is

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
mostly pretty bad

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
mostly different kinds of slavery

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
children are meant for something else

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
and they can tell the adults are suffering

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
and they have assets

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
that will ease the suffering of the adults

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
if they don't eradicate it

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
the children are carrying

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
something like medicine

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
children are living medicine

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
the adults are living medicine

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
especially when they are together

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
for each other

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
then they naturally make the medicine

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
together

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
does that make sense

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
yes yes

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
in this case medicine isn't like a pharmaceutical

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
medicine is

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
medicine is

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
the food and drink of our soul

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
or our heart

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
medicine is what

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
we open

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
we open

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
we learn

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
being ready to learn

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
as opposed to taking for granted

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
that

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
the

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
representationally

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
sends

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
the wrong signals

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
it does

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
it completely messes up our thought

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
don't want to make a mistake

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
go on sorry Darren

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
no please I'm sorry

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
please continue

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
often I'm not able to

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
it's kind of like

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
often I'm not able to articulate it

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
but I understand

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
the moderns are captured

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
by a layer of

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
processes that they enact

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
as behaviors like drive the car

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
to the grocery store

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
get the groceries

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
get the job get the pay

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
take the kid to the doctor

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
pay the attorney do the taxes

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
watch the television show

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
mind the smart phone

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
clean the house

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
chores

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
what we would call chores

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
but really those are like

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
those are all

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
all those processes are mostly vampiric

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
they are extractive

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
they take something from us

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
and they give us a representation

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
now we can

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
negotiate that layer very carefully

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
if we're smart so that we get

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
actually nourishing food

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
when we go to the grocery store

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
and we don't get poison for example

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
candy bars and whatever

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
yep

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
but the representational layer is powerful

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
it's well established

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
it affects everything on earth

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
it's lethal

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
it steals life

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
it's

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
an actual vampire would be

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
terrified if it saw the representational

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
layers

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
relationship with humans because

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
it would realize that that must be

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
it's god

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
that must be the god of the vamp

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
that's what spawns vampires

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
vampires come from that

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
if there are such things

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
right

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
but yes the medicine

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
the village makes together

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
this medicine

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
is very powerful and it has

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
a unique protective effect

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
vampires bounce off of it

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
it makes like a shield

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
right

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
and so vampirism doesn't get established

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
in the children or the adults

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
and they're busy playing every other beautiful

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
game

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
everybody will be happy even when

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
things are difficult they're still

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
going to be way happier

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
yeah

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
everyone will be taking care of

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
each other

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
I'm listening

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
they're in one way of like maybe

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
peeling away

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
the representational layer

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
just expose it to people

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
I've tried that and it works

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
because I

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I'll tell you this right

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
even the people there in the village

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
and stuff

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
in Central Java

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
it was very famous you know

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
spice trade Asia, immersion

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
people were discovering things

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
and all that stuff

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
from nothing

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
the village just became better

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
and better as humanity went on

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
but all of that is kind of like

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
blocked off by modern writing

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
and books and even anthropology

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
because

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
but okay this thing I want to tell you

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
once I'm in the village

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
I realize you know what

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
these people are the richest

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
people on planet earth

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
even though they are very little

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
currency

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
sorry there's a lot of currency

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
but very little money

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
yeah

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
why

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
yeah because money

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
money eats

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
the spirit of relation between humans

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
it does

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
it destroys that shit

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
it's like pouring acid there

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
to get rid of it

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
because now there's a single standard

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
to rule all things

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
like

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
the terror in the fantasy

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
story of the lord of the rings

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
one ring to rule them all is that

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
the ring that rules

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
the seven elvish magic rings

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
that keep the world alive

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
rules them is malignant

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
and that's money

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
the one ring that rules

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
them all in Tolkien's language

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
cash is the

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
best metaphor for it around here

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
it's hard to say

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
it's hard to say that it isn't

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
objectively

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
evil

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
because it's effect on the humans

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
okay look I could show you so many

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
features of this

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
god alright

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
I used to feed some blue jays

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I met these blue jays

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I'd bring them peanuts

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I took great joy in feeding them

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
yeah

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
and the male would come to my hand

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
he'd land on my hand

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
take a peanut female wouldn't

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
okay

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
for important reasons

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
one day

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
the female got angry with me

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
and I didn't really understand why

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
what I had noticed was this

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
the blue jay couple

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
forms a vigilance pair

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
the girl stays up high

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
the boy can go down an adventure

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
only when the boy is up high

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
does the girl come down

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
oh shit I just realized that

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
fuck

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
so

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I was interfering in that

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
and it would have been okay if I interfered

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
in it once or twice

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
a day

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
but it's not okay if I interfere

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
with it for two hours

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
and the reason it's not okay

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
is that they live in the terrain of a pair of

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
cooper's hawks and those hawks hunt blue jays

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
oh

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
alright so here's what I'm doing

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I'm giving them the effect

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
I'm telling the story

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
yeah

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
if you put something in front of people

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
or animals

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
hmm

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
that's so compelling

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
that it not only changes their behavior

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
it changes what they

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
can be

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
right it drags what they

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
can be down

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
to fewer

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
much more explicit things

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
hmm

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
so

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
identity becomes binary

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
when I was throwing those peanuts on the ground

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
for the girl bird

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
because she wouldn't come to my hand

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
she was having

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
to go to the ground

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
without

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
radar above her

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
because the male

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
was off stashing the peanut I'd just given him

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I wasn't

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
paying attention to their

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
vigilance necessities and I was providing them

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
the stimulus that was so compelling

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
that they would break

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
their culture

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
of mutual support

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
right it would break

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
that culture

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
yeah

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
it's so compelling that their bodies

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
it's like putting meat in front of a dog

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
right the body

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
is going to respond

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
you know if you

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
if you watch you know just put like a stack

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
$100 bills tie it up

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
with a rubber band

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
and put it on a street

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
and watch the humans

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
like it will drag their behavior down to

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
you know

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
the most likely

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
yeah

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
yeah

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
it captures the nervous system

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
can you see that it's

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
a representation

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
that's powerful enough to completely capture

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
the nervous system of an animal

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
and for the blue jays that's peanuts

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
and for the humans that's cash

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
or these days crypto

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
and overall

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
it's because I mean

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
if they were enough

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
of what I'm saying like zero crime

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
villages right

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
meaning there's

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
okay I have to ask you

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
sorry go ahead if there were enough of the zero crime villages

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
okay if there was enough

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
of that

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
and people go and live inside there

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
like say my wife comes from Indonesia

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
despite all the amount

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
of money

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
quite a lot of immigrants who come here

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
work here want to stay in Malaysia

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
you know they come from around the region

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
with much poorer places maybe like

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Nepal or

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
used to be Thailand

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Sri Lanka

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
countries that have got constant

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
political problems and stuff

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
so

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
people

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
really have a tough time finding a job

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
and stuff like that

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
when they come here many of them they want to stay here

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
because life is better

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
for them here right

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
but this Indonesia

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Java when they come here they want

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
to go back

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
why do they want to go back

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
they see their village

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
as the safety

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
the security of the village

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
the nest

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
is too cozy for them

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
want to trust

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
anything else they want to go back

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
go to the nest

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
so

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
what I'm saying is

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
oh I see wait

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
their way of life is so familiar

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
that the new way of life

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
even though it's amazing

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
they go back to the old one anyways

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
is this what you mean

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
yes or do you mean

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
not just old

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
it's not just old at least one thing

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
is add to the old

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
all plus I won't be sent into an old folks home

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
oh

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
right

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
they just

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
whatever comfort you may give

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
to them in an old folks home

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
they don't want it

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
they want to be

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
poor with their kids

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
their grandkids

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
they want to care

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
and be cared for

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
by family members

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
who know their idiosyncrasies

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
not some institution

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
okay that was brilliant

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
yes that's very very true

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I would almost go so far

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
as to say that for most of us

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
that is

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
a implicit

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
feature of our human

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
experience is that

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
as we get older

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
most of us soften

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
and we become vulnerable

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
and

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
it's

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
loneliness is much more difficult to bear

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
than it was

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
when we were younger

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
and we may be infirm and have illnesses

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
and we may need help with certain things

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
so that

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
if I'm in a house where there's children around

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I feel relatively safe

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
if there's something I can't handle

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
they can take care of it

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
you know

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
or my

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
brothers and sisters

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
there's family

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
and if there's not family there's the neighbors

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
and they are family

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
humans naturally

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
do this they family up

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
unless

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
something gets in between them first

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
and one of the main things that gets in between them

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
at least where I live

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
is money

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
the fact that you guys don't have that

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
see

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
in the village

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
the lack of the importance of money

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
is almost like saying

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
we get water that isn't

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
we get relational water

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
that hasn't been pre-poisoned

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
you see

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
it's the same thing you said earlier

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
you said I

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
what did you say

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I'm in

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I'm inclined to

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
unconditional love

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
or something like this

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and I said no you just never defected

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
the villagers don't defect

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
there's nothing that would motivate them to defect

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
a big stack of money

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
they might just laugh at it

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
and say like no

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
hmm

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
you know

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I mean

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
to add to what you're saying

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
the helicopter

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
they kind of bail out

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
of their village for a while

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
to get some money

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
to build a house

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
once they get that

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
minimum amount they're back

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
and they don't want to be

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
in the town anymore

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
they want to be back in the village

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
familiar people

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
that's hilarious

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
do you see how much more intelligent that is

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
than what we do

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
in a situation like that

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
where everybody has a shot at surviving

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
and so do the relationships

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
that most matter

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
in your heart

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
in the other place

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
where they just go to the village

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
and they stay there

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I mean they go to the town

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
to get the money

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and then they just stay there

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
they continue to stay there

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
because they bought extra houses

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
they're dying inside

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
they're dying

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
they're going to live

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
after they die

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I mean they're not going to die

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
they must

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
leave so much wealth to the next generation

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
things will be better

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
no they create

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
everybody is doing it

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
crime culture

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
you know despite

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
disparity what we have

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
yeah it's funny because

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I think it's really important when I hear you speak

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
you say

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I'm not sure

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
that a lot of people even know

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
that such things exist

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
at all

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
in the world

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
obviously

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
yeah no most people would be like

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
what does that even mean

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
although the statement

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
makes it real you know the language makes it

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
relatively clear what it means there's no crime in here

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
but

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
and by the way if there's no crime

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
like you probably don't

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
you don't really need cops

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
you might need a fire department

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
but you don't need cops

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
and you don't need weapons

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
you don't need lawyers

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
you don't need guns

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
yeah you don't need an anti-corruption body

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
yeah

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
right right right

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
you don't need courts

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
you don't need prisons

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
all of the people correctness

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
the most ugliest things

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
is like

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
cosmeticized dirt

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
it's really dirty

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
but you put lots of makeup

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
and you stop anybody saying the truth about it

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
yes

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
yes all these things are

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
I mean

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I usually don't think in religious

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
terms but when I see

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
the festering malignance

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
of the prisons and the courts

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
and the cops and the armies

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
and the military and so forth

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
it's hard for me not to think

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
that they're demons

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
they do

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
what actual demons would actually do

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
so it doesn't really matter

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
whether their origin is metaphysical

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
or not they're the same damn thing

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
now look

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
here where we live

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
in the west in America

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
the institutions

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
that

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
that underlie

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
our

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
social agreements

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
our governments

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
which is

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
a big mess of a million little

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
branches

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
our police

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
the military

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
the fire department

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
the hospitals

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
the schools

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
those things

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
yeah

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
some of them are decent

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
we couldn't get along

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
without cops because shit would just turn

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
into the wild wild west we think

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
so we have to have

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
cops

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
and sometimes the cops are

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
an absolute nightmare

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
and sometimes they save your life

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
they sort of have both

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
both valences

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
the fire department almost always

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
just does good

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
you know is put out fires

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
okay

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
of all the single jobs

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
you could pick that one seems pretty

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
virtuous the hospitals kind of similar

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
the schools

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
the schools start to get sketchy because

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
it's about slave making and stuff

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
but

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
do you think universities are worse than the schools?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
the intensity

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
of the

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
light

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
the intensity of the disease

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
in the university is

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
similar

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
to grade schools

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
in high school

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
it's just more sophisticated

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
and highly complex

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
let's just call this

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
the malware in the education

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
system

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
it's in every

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
step

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
it's in every step of the system

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
so the malware is in the whole

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
staircase but the way

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
the malware works up near the top of the staircase

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
and the universities is different

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
and there's you know 15 new kinds

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
as of last year

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
that stuff is mutating

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
right as fast

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
as you could try to eradicate it

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
it's

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
it's

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
emerging in new forms as you

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
watch it

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
it's very

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
it's highly

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
resistant to

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
technical intervention

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
it's primary vulnerability

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
is relational

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
intervention change the relationships

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
the malware can't

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
function

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
hey Darren

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
would the US

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
have less of a problem

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
less of a

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
problem

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
if it wasn't

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
if it was

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
five separate countries

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
not messy

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
it's interesting

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
okay the honest answer is of course

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
we don't know

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
the simple

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
wait let me finish

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
the simple correct answer is

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
any attempt

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
at responding would obviously just be my opinion

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
whereas some of the things

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
that I'm talking about are not merely

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
my opinion these are

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
in a sense

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
obvious features of our situation

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
but

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I think

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
that solution

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
or that transformation

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
would change a lot of things

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
we've never really experienced anything

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
much resembling it

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I don't have any data

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
and it's not like we're just asking

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
in a vacuum we're asking

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
in the time and context in which we live

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
so we're asking like

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
if the US split into five bodies in 2024

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
you know

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
what effect do you think

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
that would have on malware and education

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
one

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
feature of the setup that I like

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
is

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
if you've got five petri dishes

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
in which to attempt to

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
spawn

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
something

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
more intelligent than our educational system

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
you'd have five shots at it

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
instead of one

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
but you can actually have

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
as many shots as you want

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
because the fact that

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
you know

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I mean anybody who wants to is free

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
to start some kind of new educational system

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
most people aren't that bold

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
and there have been attempts

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
in the states we have Waldorf schools

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
for example

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
which are wildly different

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
from standard educational system

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
you don't hear much

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
talked about

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
what happens to Waldorf students

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
for example as

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
they go hard

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
are they

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
better citizens than the others

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
because

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I don't know what the data is on that

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
what is that Rudolf Steiner's game

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I think it was

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
yeah Rudolf Steiner as well

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
one of my girlfriends

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
had been raised in a Waldorf school

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
and I'd known a couple of other people

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
who were

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
and even when I was young

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
some of the same

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
ideas were used to

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
build

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
a school that had one classroom

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
for all the ages

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
so like a central eye

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
like you know unity

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
we'll keep all the ages together

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
they can learn together

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
help each other

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
instead of segmenting them

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
didn't go very well

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
for who knows 10 reasons to Sunday

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
but

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
but yeah I don't know

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
it will go well because

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
the malignancy

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
spread across so many aspects

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
yes look

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
look

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
you know I can imagine

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
a science fiction story where we go

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
to

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
we pick

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
70 billionaires

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
and we go to them

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
and we tell them

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
we will educate your children

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
we will give your children an educational

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
experience that they will

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
always be excited about

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
and they will outperform anything you can buy

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
from anyone else

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
and so you build the system

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
experimentally that way

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
you learn how to do that

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
right that way

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
and then you just attack

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
the whole fucking school system from there

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
with the same

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
with whatever you can produce from that breeder reactor

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
right

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
how do we actually get children

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
meaningful

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
human experience

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
and at the same time deep

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
representational intelligence

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
and one of the best ways to do that is just to

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
teach them the

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
structure of representational cognition

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
once they see that

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
they will never bow to it

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
they will manipulate it from above

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
just like humans should always do

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
it's okay if we have representations

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
we have to manipulate them from above

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
we have to not be manipulated

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
we have to not be puppeted by our own

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
representations does that make sense

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
yep

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
yep

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
and you can teach this

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
this is teachable stuff

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
right this is stuff we could discover

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
those features of language

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
and modern thought

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
those features simple

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
semantic and linguistic and philosophic features

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
that you could teach to children and adults

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
that would mostly

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
free them

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
at least in their minds

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
from I don't know

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
68% of the traps

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
they're going to face in consciousness throughout

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
their lifetime

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
like

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
we're walking around wearing like

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
iron cages in our minds

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
us humans

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
so far most of us

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I am myself included to the degree

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
that I live in a city I'm

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
subject to the same

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
problem

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
I'm a prisoner dreaming of a jailbreak

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
where it sounds like for you

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
you know where outside the jail is

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
and you intend to get there right quick

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
yep

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
yeah

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
is Benji with you

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
wow

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
say that again

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
is Benji with you where you are

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
yeah I mean

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I thought I heard him

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
barking oh not right now

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
no not right now

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
earlier he was

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
he was just staying here

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
before I started talking to him

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
yeah cause I heard him

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
okay okay

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
yeah

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
it's quite a character once

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
but

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
it's saved my sanity

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
now so

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
it has me

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
to really much better understand

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
the village scene

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
cause you get lost one of the things

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
is

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
me too

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I wanted to achieve

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
you know you've got this right

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
so

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
all kinds of people like not just

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
everybody like 10 out of 10

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
100 out of 100

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
1000 out of 1000 people

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
only know achievement by hey

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
how much wealth do you have

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
that's what I said

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
yeah it's a sick standard

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
that

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
turns everything to one thing

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
so when you ask them you know

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
determine your value

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
as a person

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
they want to know what property you own

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
who you're married to

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
you know are you

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
are you well bred

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
do you come from power

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
do you come from money

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
like for example

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
you know I got suspended by

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
LinkedIn you know

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
of being forthright

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
because fellas were

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
doing con job in Singapore

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
so I was like stop

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I mean just generally it pisses me off

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
like nobody

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
speaks up against a

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
blatant con

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
yeah okay I agree

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
but let's agree

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
together that we will try to

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
discover how to do things that are effective

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
yep

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
right so that even

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
if we take on some kind of small

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
mission together even the mission of this

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
conversation cause this you know this works

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
then let's just have

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
the some simple agreements

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I'm not trying to write these in stone

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
but we will try to help each other see better

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
and if action is required

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
we will try to find very effective ways

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
to act

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
because LinkedIn

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
is like putting a

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
firecracker in the fire department

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
like they're just waiting

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
for someone to go sideways

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
it's the same with Facebook

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
those are battlegrounds

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
that's enemy

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
own terrain

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
this is part of why I am

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
careful

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
mostly careful on Facebook

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
it's funny you know

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
a few days ago I did something I

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
never ever do

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I posted

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
some comments from a news

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
source on a political

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
issue

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
and it wasn't any

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
rowdy it wasn't any specifically radical

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
statement

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
over the next two weeks

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
that post got zero views

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
none

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
no one saw it

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
wow shadow ban

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
yeah not an accident

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
so devious isn't it

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
such a devious thing to do

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
well I'll tell you

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Valala

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
there's we could

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
we could take that model

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and flip it over

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
that model

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
okay

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
that thing gives us a model of what not

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
to do

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
if you have a really good model of what not

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
to do

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
you can flip it over

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
and no one will not want to be there

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
like

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I have a model of how to build a system

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
on the internet

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
that

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
puts this back together

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
keeps all our data and communications

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
private

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
okay helps us get smarter

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
every time we make a move

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
with a machine of any kind

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
okay yep

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
and produces a social

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
adventuring system

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
so that people form teams to

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
accomplish you know

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
instead of putting a ball through a hoop

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
right

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
we accomplish something in the actual world

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
of humans

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
you've been developing it

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
I have a model

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
I can show you a model of how we could do it

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
and also

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
here's the thing that's actually

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
a little more compelling

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
okay the way

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
that system works is a model of how we can play

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
together

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
without machines

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
we don't need machines to do it

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
we naturally do it together

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
hmm

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
if most of the malware isn't running

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
we naturally do this together

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I'm just trying to

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
demonstrate that there's a way that we can take

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
the electronic infrastructure of the internet

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
and do something completely

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
the opposite of what we're doing with it

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
and it would be

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
everything that currently exists

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
and it would I mean

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
there's so many abilities you could have

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
with it

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
that we don't have

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
and look I'm not a big fan

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
of link the humans to machines

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
that's not

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
my favorite game plan by a long shot

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
the problem I have

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
is that the humans are linked to

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
machines

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
hmm

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
we might want to capture some humans

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
and give them a shot at liberty

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
or at least discovering

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
what that might mean

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
we might need to capture their machines

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
yes

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
we might need those

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
machines doing something different

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
then what they're doing

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
like something non vampiric with the humans

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
yep

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
these are just thoughts but

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I do

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I think very deeply about these matters

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
because I want

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I want the experience

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
of being with other humans

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
doing meaningful things

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
that's what I actually want

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
yep

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
really

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
say that much

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
because

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
like

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I just

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I kind of like

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
when I said enough of these machines

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I just run away

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
yes

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
both go

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I don't want to explain

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and be politically correct

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
and use the language to

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
just go

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
hey

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
but I hear you

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
100% on

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I tend to do things

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
more effectively than I

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
have

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
meaning

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
in the transition

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
you have to get into the machines

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
that they are attached to

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
to get them off the machines

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
for example

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
if all the kids are going to have phones

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
we have to give those kids

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
something on their phones

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
that it doesn't eat them alive

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
and

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
to even

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
get them to instruct them

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
to get them to work together

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
on an offline activity

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
and

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
what I have in mind

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
as I talk to you here

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
is confederating and intense

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
making a bit more intense

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
village life

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
in a village and small town life

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
in Indonesia

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
a country of 20 million people

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
one of the

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
last bastions of reality

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
you know

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
the funny thing is

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
it's ironic

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
if you

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
one of the questions that I had

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
in our conversation

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
for you that I haven't asked you yet

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
is do you want your village to have a voice

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
yes

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
with which it speaks to the world

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
yes

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
okay so I thought

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
perhaps this might be so

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
and what I'm trying to tell you is

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
that's not

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
impossible

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
but to protect the village

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
that voice might have to be anonymous

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
sure all of that's good

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
if okay but if something

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
if the world realizes

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
there's a zero crime village

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
that's not gonna go well dude

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
that will not go well

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
because they'll come over

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
then they'll think

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
they'll get past it is it

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
there's 15 things

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
that can go wrong with that

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
but I did have the same idea

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
early in our conversation I thought to myself

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
wait

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
there's a zero crime village

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
holy cow like we need to get these people on the radio

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
to the other villages

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
we need to link the zero crime villages

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
around the world

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
these people need to have a voice

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
and then I thought wait a minute

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
that sounds like

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
setting up a

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
sky beacon to 15

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
different kinds of vampires

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
just like I can't wait

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
to extract whatever nectar they're managing

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
to produce over there

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
and commodify that and bank the

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
bank the profit

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
you know

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I've said that you know what it is

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
a whole bunch of things

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
has it like it's not that easy

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I'll give you a few examples

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
if you go to India

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
if you go to even Malaysia

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
pretty much

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
all good sources of natural water

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
from the mountains

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
has been taken over by a Nestle

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
or a company like that

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
this is what I mean by vampires

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
they're straight up vampires

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
they go after the water

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
I'm with you

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
they know how to do the TV

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
advertising and the search engine

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
all that stuff

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
we'll give you candy bars

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
you know

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
but

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
in Indonesia

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
the politics

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
is such

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
that it's very hard to

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
it seems like

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
many layers

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
and it's not

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
it's not mainstream

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
it's not organized so that you can say

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
this is one layer

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
this is exactly

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
it's just kind of like a bit all over the place

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
so it's like

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
meaning for example to get the mountain water

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
right by a Nestle

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
they have to get 18 different approvals

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
and those

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
they're not in 4 or 5 camps

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
they're like all over the place

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
so you can't

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
people don't try

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
seems like they try and give up

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
and it doesn't go anywhere

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
so they go after a few things

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
like national telephone

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
they can get somewhere

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
but not anything that has got

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
too much of a regional

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
local footing

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
like water from a river from a mountain

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
whoever

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
the people

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
in the villages nearby

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
the people affected by that river

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
have enough of a sea

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
and sometimes have enough of a

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
stop it

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
doesn't get there

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
so yeah

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I can't

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
explain exactly all why

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
but one big difference

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
between Indonesia

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
and quite a lot of

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
the rest of the world

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
I mean this just makes me think

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I'm sorry to say this but it just makes me think

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Nestle is right now talking

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
to Bard about how to break that trap

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
right Nestle is going to

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
straight up use AI and go like

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
okay this trap has 19 parts

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
for this

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
here's three solutions with a 70% chance

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
of success and here's 19

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
with a 58

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
that will not last

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
that safety won't last

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I mean who knows what's going to happen

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
the world is wildly unpredictable

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
we could be living in a

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
from now on it might just be like a storm

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
of black swans

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
events that we never predicted

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
but

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
there's certainly much

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
more of those now than there

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
ever were

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
in our lives

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
but go ahead

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
somehow

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
you know

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
the alternative

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
to me like life in Malaysia

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
has gone downhill and when I sense

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
the US has gone downhill

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
at a very fundamental

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
give the individual

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
in a

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
soul

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
you know

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I mean

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
like

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
why must there be like

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
virtually no choice except to be

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
to go into an old folks home

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
why can't the family unit be together

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
I mean what's

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
yes because

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
it's the difference between a modern culture

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
and a traditional culture

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
and look

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
some

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
in some nations

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
there is still

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
traditional culture there's even some of it

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
here in the United States where the children

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
just naturally care for their parents and grandparents

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
and so forth

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
but mostly it comes from other countries

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
because

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
for some reason

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
during the origin of this nation

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
that value

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
was not

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
emphasized

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
it was much more about

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
the privilege entitlement

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
defection

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
and addiction of the individual

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
you know like I said is basically

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
just malware

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
it's relational malware

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
or you know perhaps that's one useful way

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
to think about it it's not the only way

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
but yeah that tradition wasn't preserved

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
if you go to Japan it's there

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I don't know how much in

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
various places in China it is

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Russia is a bit more like

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
the United States

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
France and England

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
more like

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
the United States but some other countries

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
the tradition is alive

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
and in most

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
countries that didn't suffer

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
eradicative colonization

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
that tradition

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
you know

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
lives

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
it's naturally I think it's naturally

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
human it's not the only game

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
in town but I think it's naturally

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
human

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I mean the problem

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
in modern countries is we want convenience

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
and grandma and grandpa are wildly

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
inconvenient

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
I'd rather defect by watching some

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
comedy channel on TV

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
than deal with you know

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
whatever's going on with my ancestors

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
it's a defection based culture

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
sorry go ahead

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
there is other ramifications too

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
like all folks right

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
yeah

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
no the all folks who like the children

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
sorry go ahead

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
no like the whole

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
90%

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
for example 90% of

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
medical expenses

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
of that sort right

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
it's incurred in the last year

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
of a proper person's life and stuff

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
and like that's not why not die

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
a year earlier

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
yeah

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
well the main reason

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
you don't want to die a year earlier

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
is because there's nothing has been fulfilling

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
in your life you've been living a life

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
of just defecting from

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
whatever you might have otherwise

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
participated in

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
it's very safe

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
but it's extremely lonely and boring

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
I mean like

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
you die in your village

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
together with the other people

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
and so you're not drug

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
onto

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
onto a really hopeless

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
medical system

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
and you know

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
supposedly wants to

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
keep you alive but

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
it is actually vampiric

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
yeah

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
literally it just sucks

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
the life out of you and then it sucks the money

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
out of your family for sucking the life out of you

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
it's like a double vampire

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I mean if someone said hey would you want

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
it on this game we're gonna suck the life out of this person

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
you're gonna get that life and we're gonna suck the money out of their family

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
you're gonna get the money you want some

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
a lot of people would sure say yes

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
so

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
and come on

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
with all the challenges

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
and don't you think

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
don't you think

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
AI would be used to like

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
make this explicit and

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
this is not really

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
this is a forced in bargain

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
that's not a bargain

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
yeah I mean

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
although the problem is that the AIs

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
are curated and it would be

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
just as much of a problem if they weren't

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
like the humans have really invented

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
something very

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
very dangerous here

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
and it's not without

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
promise

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
but as we know

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
from looking historically at humans and

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
technology

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
that shit goes

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
sideways right

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
after the idealism

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
is overcome

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
by piracy

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
today

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
despite all

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
the negatives

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
of the US

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
medical insurance system

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
and how it's based

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
and all that stuff

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
enough

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
let's say at the

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
public intellectual level

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
enough of us know that

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
also in Canada

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
seems to be doing it a bit better

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
in other European countries

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Australia seems to be doing it better

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
than the US

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
exactly there are examples of countries

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
that do it pretty well we might imagine

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
okay but

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
that doesn't seem to be portable

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
into the US

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
we can't look at a guy who gives an excuse

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
oh we are the US

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
okay look

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
what you don't okay look the problem

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
here is that

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
and this is an

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
ironic problem

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
we actually call this country

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
the US

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
that is the word us

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
and that

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
along with many

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
unfortunate features

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
of our history

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
incline

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
the citizens of the United States

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
to think

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
in a way that is fundamentally

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
black and white

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
fundamentalistic

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
you know it's fundamental in its

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
fundamentalist

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
in its understanding of us

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
and them

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
who are we and who are they

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
and most of the us's

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
are fake

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
right the same way most of them

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
are

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
but if you identify with one of those fake us's

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
you inherit a bunch of them

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
and this is a kind of an us and them

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
economy

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
that the US is amazing

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
at

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
it's like being amazing at

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
filling your own organs with cancer

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
or something relationally

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
it will never work intelligently

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
but this is

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
a fundamental problem with us

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
yeah it's bad

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
despite the fact that

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I mean your states

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
and municipalities have enough

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
independence for example

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I do

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
but Miami goes up

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
yep

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
they can

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
but they generally don't because

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
the malware

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
the influence

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
of the malware is powerful

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
right

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
politics in the United States

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
is a lot about

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
what

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
various kinds of theft

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
counterfeiting value

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
counterfeiting value

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
more effectively than your opponent

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
get the money

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
and then

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
a sort of

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
complex back room favor

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
exchange among politicians

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
so

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
it's like

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
the structure of the system might be

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
sound we've never implemented

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
that system does that make sense

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
it's just a layer of

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
it's like a multi-layer

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
cake of seven kinds of piracy

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
floating on top of the structure

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
as it stands as a legal

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
or

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
you know sociological

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
agreement system

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
mostly the structure

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
doesn't get implemented

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
what gets implemented is piracy

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
and vampirism

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Ramaswamy

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
was running

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
for a while and

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
articulates that you can sense that

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
for example

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
he talks about

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
getting rid of the

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
FBI

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Trump

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
because Trump was

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
caught by the civil servants

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
that you can't

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
there are too many laws

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
that stop you from firing

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
civil servants

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
but

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Ramaswamy was saying that

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
that is the case when you're

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
firing individual civil servants

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
but if you're having a mass

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
restructuring

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
the law allows you to do that

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
and with

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
the Supreme Court as it's stated

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
as it's constituted

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
because it's got

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
enough of a majority of Trump appointing

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
a conservative

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
who are ready for

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
who see the sense

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
of

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
the president has the right

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
to restructure the FBI

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
by executive order

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I mean this guy is

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
possibly even the constitution

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
I mean

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Trump is basically

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
okay

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Trump

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
is really dangerous

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
in my view for two reasons

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
the first is that he is

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
successfully circumvented

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
regulation in the past

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
and

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
the second is that

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
he has not only

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
he has no respect for regulation

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
he's a scoff law

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
right and a scoff law

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
will

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
earn the vote of

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
every male scoff law

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
in the United States just for that one

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
reason

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
and okay the third thing that's dangerous

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
about him is he has shown

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
much smarter people

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
what is possible

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
and what he has shown is possible

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
is as follows

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
the United States as a nation

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
can be captured

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
by a single male human being

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
he's shown them that

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
he's basically shined a flashlight

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
on a part of the game

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
that nobody really believed

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
was possible he's doing the impossible

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
he's going from

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
he's gonna go from 0 to 100

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
he's gonna have a go at the impossible

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
and he's old enough that he probably doesn't

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
give much of a shit if he fails

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
he's got nothing to lose

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
right it's all

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
anything he gets done is gravy

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
right

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
like he can do anything

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
that works

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
so yeah this is

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
this is dangerous shit

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
he's shown others

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
who are much more intelligent than him

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
that the prize can be had

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
you can take the virgin home with you

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
for sure

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
you can have a whole family

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
you know

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
that whole thing you can just grab that whole

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
damn thing in one fell swoop

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
right and here's how you do it

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
you start with these moves over

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
here you place some judges on the Supreme Court

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Bing bang boom

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
casino payoff

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
right that's really

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
dangerous he's shown others that it

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
can be done

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
he's relatively stupid in my view

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
or at least he plays that face really well

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
but

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
damn what a fucking dangerous

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
idiot oh my god

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
but

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
hey Darren

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
when you had Hillary

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
you know running against

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Hillary Clinton running against

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
didn't it occur to you

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
that my god the US has failed

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
if these people

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
are running for president

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
that's brilliantly said but yeah

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
no that occurred to me

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
some

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
okay I'm pretty sure

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
that occurred to me when I was six

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
and I watched

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
John F. Kennedy being executed

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
in Texas over and over again on TV

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
and you know

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
juxtaposed with some of his speeches

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
no that dream died

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
in me a long

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
time ago my friend

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I mean I was born

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
the month after Kennedy

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
was executed and I've seen

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
that guy speak

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I've never seen anything

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
in politics resembling

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
the appearance

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
of true human

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
virtue

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
that I saw in him

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I note that it's the appearance

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I'm not saying the guy was a saint

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I'm saying

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
in a room full of demons

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
he stood out brightly

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
and that happened only a couple

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
times during my lifetime

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
you know

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Carter might not have been a great president

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
but he wasn't evil

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
so to me like

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
if you can allow

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
a contest like that

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
you fail and what else

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
can you expect of a failed

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
system apparently

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I think most Americans expect

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
that the failure of the United States

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
has to end

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
with a bunch of bloodshed and violence

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
preferably as much as possible

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
maybe even apocalypse level

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
right if we're going to go out

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
we're not going to switch

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
to a new system

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
we're going to take the planet with us

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
just like any insane psychopath

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
we're not going to try a new way

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
of doing this

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
we're going to blow shit up

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
because

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
there's a feature

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
in private cognition

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
that can be inflamed enough

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
and the human societies resemble

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
the shadow

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
of this problem

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
so

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
the kid who

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
alright

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I could probably tell you

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
a lot about what happens

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
when some

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
kid picks up an automatic weapon

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
and goes to a public place

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
and just opens up on the people there

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
because what's happening in that kid's mind

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
is

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
a reflection

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
of a feature

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
of our society

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
and that feature is

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
I will win

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
whether I

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
deserve to or not

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
and if I don't win

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
everybody dies

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
there's a feature of private cognition

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
in that way

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
there's a feature of our own minds

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
that works that way and it gets reflected

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
in the social cognition

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
of modern humans

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
and that's the thing that produces

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
stuff like

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I don't know

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Hitler, Putin invading Ukraine

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
maybe there's stuff

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
I don't know about that move

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
but that looks insane to me

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
from outside

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Israel pounding Gaza into dust

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
not dissimilar except in that case

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
somebody punched them first

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
so it seems

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
yep

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
yep

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I think the people there

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
I remember when 9-11 happened in the United States

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
I had two thoughts

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
the first was

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
15 people just changed the course

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
of the nation in 12 hours

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
wow I thought it could be done

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
and then the second was

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
oh my god are we in trouble now

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
we're gonna go chasing the wrong

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
we're gonna go killing

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
the wrong

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
scapegoat

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
for

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
yeah we're gonna kill the wrong scapegoat

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
and that's gonna create

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
a future

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
of enmity and hatred

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
and blood oaths of vengeance

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
and things like this

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
both thoughts

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
now I'm not an advocate

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
of changing the course of nations with violence

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I want to be very clear about that

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
but I did notice that a very small

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
group of humans in this

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
was like the course of I don't know 48 hours

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
they

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
radically altered the course of an entire

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
nation that made me realize

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
that the principle was real

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
small number of people

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I just imagine the

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
I'm trying to figure out what's the opposite

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
of a bomb and how do we make one

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
what's the opposite of a bomb

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
yeah what's the human relational

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
opposite of a bomb

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
and how do we make one

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I want to make the opposite of a bomb

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
I want something that

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
heals things back together

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
explosively and contagiously

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
it just starts crystallizing

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
the whole network toward

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
intelligent unity

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
I can imagine it

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I can see it in my mind

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
it's possible

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
yes yes yes

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
it's positive

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
it doesn't occur to me right now

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
but what occurs

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
to me is I come across

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
such

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
what appears to be

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
opposites but they may just be complementary

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
at a level that

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I'm not

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
familiar with because

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
it's not discussed enough

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
you and me

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
what you're writing is so rare

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
but it's so appealing

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
and it would be even better

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
if there were a few more people

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
who could engage at your level

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
so that there can be interaction on it

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
not just pedantic

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
interaction as to what do you mean

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
and what do you mean

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
people doing their own

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
homework right

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
and then reflecting and then

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
passing

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
and weaving

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
or actually

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
initiating projects

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
even better

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
doing stuff together

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
that's what I want to do

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I'm good at

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
cuddling people together

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
you know

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
a lot of people

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
because of low confidence

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I like to say

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
oh I don't understand

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
come come come

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
look we can take them

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
to nursery school

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
if that's the case

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
we can do very simple

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
exploratory

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
stuff together

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
so that they get a taste for the water

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
they don't have them in the water

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
they don't have to become

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
mercenaries or something

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
right

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
we just introduce them to the water

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
a little bit at a time and say

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
hey are you comfortable here

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
okay let's go to the next step

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
beautiful

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
we can learn

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
together how to do this

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
in the same way your mother

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
attended

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
the mind of your childhood

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
we can start out

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
with the presumption that we're all

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
intelligent, playful, creative

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
human beings together

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
and then we can just make simple

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
moves

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
like a kid learning how to stand up

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
we can do it

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
it's not hard to do

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
humans naturally are good at this

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
you can get them doing this kind of thing

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
I think

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
I do have a small group

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I experiment with

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
we try some actual stuff

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I'm not just talking

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
and I'm not

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
I guess I'm afraid

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
of being pedantic

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I want to be active

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
not pedantic

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
okay

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
you want to be substantial

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I mean you want to

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
do

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
yeah let's fail

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
as long as we're doing something no problem

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
yep

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
that's it

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
and as you were mentioning

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I was thinking of the school

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
in my village and the kids

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I wonder about that

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
that must be amazing

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
what's that like have you been in there

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
have you been in a classroom do you know

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
how they relate with the children

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
the

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
the school is not good

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
the school is not great

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
it doesn't open them

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
but they're not bad compared to

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
other schools as well

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
they're not too kind of like a nannish

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
or monitor

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
they're not that either

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
on the other hand they don't

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
they don't allow for any creativity

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
they want them to follow the rules

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
yeah it sounds typically western

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
or worse

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
yeah regimented

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
regimented so

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
but

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
when the kids come out of school

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
back to their villages

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
back and all that

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
to me they're learning a lot

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
when they're playing

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
with their families

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
they're imitating their dance

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
they're preparing

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
because parents are preparing

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
for somebody's wedding or feast

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
they're helping out and they're watching

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
watching over people

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
and parents are also going to

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
to the plot of land

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
and planting rice

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
they're helping the parents

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
with planting the rice

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
and tending to the garden and stuff like that

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
overall

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
they're apprenticing

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
the bigger role for them is not

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
what I go to school and then after school

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
I was going to get a job no

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
in the case of the girls

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I'll be

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
my mother

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
they become good mothers

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
and they become good healers

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
taking care of people

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
they seem to learn

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
because it is traditional

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
to take care of each other

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
yeah

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
so we just need to expand

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
that to because

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
expand that to hey

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
whether you choose to do it at home

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
or you choose to do a bigger thing

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
between villages

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
medical things or even computers

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
all the other things

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
that you need to do in today's world

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
it's not you'll get bullied

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
by countries that do

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
with weapons

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
you've got to act together

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
to a level that

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
you're able to defend yourself too

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
you're productive enough

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
making enough returns

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
so that's enough of your people can be soldiers

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
like they were like societies were

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
I know but now

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
will come the malware

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I'm afraid

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
once

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
it's like it comes with

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
the police and the soldiers to have soldiers

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
you have money problems

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
you need money

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
now what will happen to the village

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
I am afraid I hear you though

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
will you continue with your thought

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
I see so good

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I like your candidness

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
because you know what

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
when you mention that

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
one thing I agree

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
pay attention to that

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
what do we do about it

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
how do we anticipate it

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
the other thing that comes to me is

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
when the

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
societies were very strong

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
the villagers

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
didn't have police

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
they didn't need

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
any arms

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
to have the strongest villages

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
because

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
they were able to anticipate

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
somewhat like in nature

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
how is it that

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
there is quite a lot of law and order

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
in a tropical forest

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I mean we think of

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
actually there's

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
not law and order

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I'm not sure that there's a lot of

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
well maybe I'm not understanding you

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
properly yet

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I'm not sure there's a lot of law and order

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
there's a lot of non

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
not defecting

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
but go ahead

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
do you mean law and order between

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
the insects and the plants and the animals

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
do you mean that kind of law

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
or between tribes

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
no I mean

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
between the 10,000 species

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
okay yeah

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
I mean there's something there

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
I don't think it's law and order

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
it's intimacy

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
right it's one animal

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
in a billion bodies

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
so they don't defect from intimacy

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
therefore no laws

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
are required and there are no orders

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
so you see like

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
they can share the same I mean like

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
you have birds and you have insects

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
and lizards and ants

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
and they can have

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
like

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
kind of like unawaresly share the space

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
yes

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
yep

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
but if the lizard get hungry

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
the insect better move

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
if the bird gets hungry

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
yeah

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
all of that but you know like

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
when you're walking through a forest

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
whatever that seems like a minority

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
the exception is

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
share the food

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
but that is not the

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
versus

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
in the case of human beings

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
we've made it like the capital issue

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
and it's not just

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
we've made it it really is

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
a big deal that

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
we

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
we've gone downhill

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
yes

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
no we're collapsing toward

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
the worst potentials

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
of our species

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
rapidly

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
we're

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
we're all contributing to this collapse

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
actively

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
instead of doing any other thing

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
and mostly I think it's because

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
A we don't know what to do

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
and B it doesn't pay as well

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
thankfully

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
now I'm old enough I don't care

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I want to do something

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
meaningful

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
if I have to pay to do something meaningful

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
fine

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
let's go

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
okay

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
yeah I want to

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I want to run the experiments

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Darren this model that you

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
have right

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
would you

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
do you think it has to be done in the US

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
or it can be done in another country

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
or it can be done it would be very

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
be very radical

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
it could be done somewhere else

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
but yeah it could be done anywhere

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
okay in fact

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
I argue I would argue that it's

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
basically what nature usually

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
is up to

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
she's just observe nature

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
she's doing

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
this set of things that

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
humans could do really well together

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
and they naturally do it really well

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
together wherever that isn't captured

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
or interfered with

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
okay

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
but yeah the system

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
as a system it could be done

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
anywhere

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
it can be done with existing technology

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
it would change

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I honestly I don't believe

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
if we could actually produce what I have in mind

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I don't think governments

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
would last another four years

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
we can do something so much better

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
than governments that I'm really shocked

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
nobody's had the idea

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
to do that

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
okay great great

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
so

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
what

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
basically you can envisage

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
the model that you have in mind

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
and I can imagine

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
the model you have in mind

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
and within it

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
teams of five for example

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
doing problem solving

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
and add it together

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
yeah they can

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
synergize with other teams easily

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
in fact they're highly motivated to synergize

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
with other teams

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
okay

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
essentially there's a kind of money

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
which is something more like fulfillment

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
that we can pay the humans

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
and they can also make money

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
with the analytics they produce

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
without those analytics being traced

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
to them personally

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
so that they can have privacy

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
fantastic

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
because that's what I mean

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
in like in Indonesia

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
they like that

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
they pretty much want that

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
because they're not

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
totally free from their

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
military phobia

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
yes for good reason

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
eventually the soldiers will come

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
they may not be here today

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
but someday they are coming

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
you know

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
right everyone knows this

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
all the old people know it

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
yes yes yes yes

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
so they I mean like on Facebook and stuff

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
all of them don't use their own names

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
right why would you use your own name

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
it doesn't make any sense

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
for most purposes it's dangerous

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
please

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Darren were you

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
were you in the internet

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
when there wasn't any

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
any web and stuff

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
that was just mailing lists

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
I'm a computer technician

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
I've been working with computers

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
since 1981

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
I've done

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
some programming I watched

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
the birth of the internet

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
long ago

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
in the beginning we used to have

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
what were called bulletin board systems

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
yeah

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
you know you would dial

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
yeah bbs is you'd dial up with it

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
you'd have a 1200 or 2400

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
modem

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
you'd dial up with a modem

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
you'd have some sort of a

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
validation

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
exchange with the server

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
and then

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
you were a user on a bbs

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
most of those were used for

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
sharing cultural

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
objects

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
art

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
porn

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
computer programs

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
games

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
particularly

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
media

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
yeah

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
why I asked Darren

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
the early days of the internet

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
pretty much there wasn't any

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
pseudonyms

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
the mailing lists

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
maybe the

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
soft culture

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
wait are you sure

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
in what

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
bbs was it not

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
pseudonymous

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
because you had user names

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
yeah bbs

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
in the beginning of the internet

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
yeah

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
oh yes

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
mostly true

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
campus background

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
maybe because of the

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
economic background

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
because I worked

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
at that time I was working

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
for a complete ip shop

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
in Toronto

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
oh yeah

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
and I saw

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
the value of us being able to

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
recognize this guy

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
and see

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
you know

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
in a trustworthy situation

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
well you'd still probably want

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
the option of pseudonyms

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
but in a trustworthy situation

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
you'd use your

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
your primary name

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
yep

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I imagine

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
although you know with indigenous

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
cultures

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
they didn't have names like

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Bob or Tony

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I mean

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
and their names would change

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
under certain conditions

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
it seems

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
to me

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
yep

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
like if you marry into a new

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
yeah there's lots of conditions

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
that would change your name

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
why do you mention it

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
so okay let me make sure I'm hearing you

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
so you're saying something like

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
I remember conditions

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
under which it was very useful to know

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
precisely who I'm speaking to

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
no

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
masquerading

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
were you saying

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
something like that

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
going

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
going to the heart of the matter

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
just like you said

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
don't

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
the speaker should not be

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
should not be split

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
from the speech

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
the stage value

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
right yeah

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
yeah I mean on the other hand

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
there's 10 different people inside

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
me and it's not because I'm schizophrenic

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I'm human

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
ah yes yes yes

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
so now what

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
must all of them bear the responsibility

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
for the voice of any of them

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
yes yes

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
no no no

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
well I don't know I'm not saying yes or no

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
I'm just saying

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
I hear you

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
it's a complicated question right

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
like I want to actually entertain the question

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
hmm

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
yeah yeah I think

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
what is this for enough for some

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
for enough things

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
maybe all you know

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
maybe the ethical things

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
we want to

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
the issue is

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
where do we want accountability

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
and where do we want this

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
and I would say that

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
um

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
most of the time when we want

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
accountability

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
something has gone

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
really badly wrong already

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
right like

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
yeah by the time

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
we need accountability

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
relational intimacy is broken down

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
dramatically

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
why don't you want the exploratory

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
and why do you want them to wait till they

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
are sure before they open their mouth

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
why don't you want them to come in

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
with the explanations

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
why don't you have language

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
that explicitly allows

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
enables that

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
the worst thing

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
it's not the only truth

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
but a fundamental principle is like

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
once

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
human cognition becomes oriented

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
toward indicting someone

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
or something

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
it breaks down

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
it's no longer very intelligent

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
it's making a mess

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
the

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
vulnerability of the space

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
the spacemen allow for lots of vulnerability

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
yes

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
yes yes I mean

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
that's more brilliant than what I would say

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
um that's really brilliant

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
what you're saying there

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
you're saying um

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
it's crucial that we allow

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
um

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
the play

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
the natural play

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
of explorative learning

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
and discovery and making mistakes

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
and getting it wrong

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
you know

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
um and all kinds of other things

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
that disappear once

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
go ahead

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
it should be children ready you know

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
yeah

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
I mean

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
what a brilliant thing

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
you with your expansion

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
made it for me

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
yeah but you

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
you were the one who said this first

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
I only tried to see

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
what you were saying I was like no he's saying something

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
even more radical than what you're saying Darren

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
what I was saying was

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
what I was saying was

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
um

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
by the time you're interested in indictment

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
you've lost most of your intelligence

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
and I find this to be true of myself

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
but you said something crazier

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
you were like

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
uh in an actually trusted

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
relational

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
in context

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
the free play

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
of mistake

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
doesn't lead and you know

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
experiment and discovery and learning

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
doesn't lead to judgment it leads to mutual

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
benefit or something like this

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
yeah yeah yeah

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
yeah that's crazy

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
all of this

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
you can't say that

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
who told you you could say things like that

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
you

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
mustn't go around saying things like that

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
the humans will get ideas

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
so that's it

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
you know like

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
what are you doing

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
basically

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
hey there

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
essentially allow the kids to teach you

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
yes

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
hey this is how we do it

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
this is how we dig a hole

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
or how we catch a tadpole

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
come you know

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
teachers have been stopping us

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
and we go inside

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
and say you can't

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
laugh or whatever the teacher

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
can you give us a break

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
you make the club something

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
distract her

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
when you go back to learning from the kids

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
and then

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
what do you think some outcomes

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
make the old school teacher happy too

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
yes

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
exactly right

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
you can please the old guard

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
and innovate at the same time

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
right

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
doesn't have to be pure rebellion

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
you can please

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
you can please tradition and still innovate

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
yeah

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
so long as you're becoming patient

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
you're persistent

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
it should yield a better

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
the better result

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
the better outcome for everybody

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
absolutely many yes

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
patience

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
this doesn't have to be done in the next 10 seconds

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
that would work

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
right because the kids are smart too

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
you know

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
and

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
they're kind of like forced

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
to

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
accept the status quo

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
and the teachers too

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
finding maybe too difficult

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
because they're all busy

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
too much of an accent to it

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
how they have to do this

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
kind of a modern world

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
with too many details

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
too many chores

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
in a way

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
do you sense that

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
that is part of the reason why

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
the change is slow

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
and all doesn't happen

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
no the problem is worse

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
is that

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
the new teachers

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
should be free

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
to grow along

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
with the children

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
instead of to dictate

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
the direction of growth

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
to the children

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
and they know nothing but to dictate

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
that's it you know

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
to dictate

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
in english

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
I make a joke about this

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
it's like a person holding a hard penis

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
and they keep pointing it at you

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
they're dictating

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
I know it's a very crude joke

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
but

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
in english

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
that's a reasonable pun

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
and it makes sense

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
it's like they're hitting you over the head

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
with the hardened

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
member of authority

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
it's a shitty job

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
like no teacher would want

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
no teacher

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
would ever act that way

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
or want that if they were having the experience

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
of learning and growing with the children

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
and nobody's

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
going to tell me that we can't produce that

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
we got the teacher on site

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
we got the kids on site

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
you got them together

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
you should be able to pull off miracles

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
it might take you a little while to figure out

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
how but don't tell me you can't

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
I've seen it done

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
I've participated

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
in it in schools

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
where I had a teacher who was like

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
we're going to take the one kid

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
in this class who can't write

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
at all

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
and we're going to get that kid writing essays

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
that are powerful

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
and blow people away

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I mean here's a secret

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
that will blow your mind

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
in 1990

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
or something

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
no way to

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
probably

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I took an English class

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
I hadn't been in school since I was 12

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I never went to high school

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
I'm a self educated person

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I took an English class

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
because I'm a writer

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
and the teacher asked me to teach the class

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
for the next semester so I did

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
and what I discovered was pretty

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
amazing

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
so there were about 90 kids

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
they ranged in age from

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
16 to 26

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
we had three classes

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
of about 30 kids a piece

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
they were mostly upper middle class

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
white kids

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
most of them were like

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
B, B plus

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
average

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
coming into junior college from high school

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
of those 90 American kids

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
in a wealthy

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
suburb

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
suburban town

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
four of them could reasonably

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
produce a written sentence

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
in their only language

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
and two of them could

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
compose a paragraph

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
wow

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
those kids

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
sucked at understanding

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
or speaking or writing

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
the only language they

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
speak

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
they were abysmal at it

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
and I was blown away

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
because I'm hyperlexic

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
I have a natural

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
affine relationship

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
with language and particularly

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
English

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
I've been that way since I was very little

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
so for me

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
this was staggering and shocking

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
I was like

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
I wanted them to have more education than I had

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
and they had

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
catastrophically less education

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
than I had

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
though they had been

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
in school an additional

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
six years compared to me

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
and

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
kind of like

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
somewhat role model parents too

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
I suppose

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
I don't know

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
but

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
my parents weren't

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
particularly intelligent

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
but they did read

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
books

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
and they did read books to me

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
and I think my parents were frightened

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
a little bit I know my mom was

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
I don't think my dad was but my mom was scared

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
because

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I remember

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
I was reading science fiction novels

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
when I was five

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
maybe earlier

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
who brought them

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
to you?

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
my parents I told them what I wanted

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
oh how did you know what

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
so like I had seen

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
advertisements for

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
2001 Space Odyssey

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
when I was watching Star Trek

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
and I knew what the book was about

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
and I read science fiction stories

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
already

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
myself I could read them by myself

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
so I asked my mom to get me that

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
book and she's like that's a grown up

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
book and I was like I want that book

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
that's the book I want to read

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
so then I got it and I read it

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
and my parents ended up reading it

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
and in a way

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I was kind of educating them

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
because I had a lot of books

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
eventually I became a book thief

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
that's a story for another time

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
I only

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
stole books to read them

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
though I didn't steal like valuable books

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
and sell them

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
I stole books to read them

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
when I was a runaway

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
so I didn't have any access

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
yeah when I was a runaway

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
I used to steal books to read them

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
you said earlier that

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
you know

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
you thought yourself from 12 years old

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
like um

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
that would have been like

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
almost unheard of isn't it

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
no there are

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
there are um

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
okay especially these days

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
it's different now

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
there are a lot of children

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
who are

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
there's a cohort of young people

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
who naturally become self-educating

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
to varying degrees

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
some of them become prodigies

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
some of them become

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
nobody's right some of them just disappear

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
some of them go mad

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
because they're lonely

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
but yeah there's like

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
I know a couple other

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
every once in a while someone will sniff me out

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
and they'll approach me

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
and they'll go like

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
when did you

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
you know what were you reading when you were a child

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
and I'll say science fiction

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
and they're like how about when you were little

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
and I'll say science fiction and they'll go like

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
yeah that's what I thought

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
you know

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
um

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
because

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
recently somebody sniffed me out

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
and they were like you're one of you're just like me

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
you're a feral

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
you're a feral kid who lived

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
in the wilderness

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
and you're someone who's read

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
a few thousand books and not two

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
right

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
um

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
and they recognize the fingerprint

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
of my mind right and I recognize

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
there is when we have conversations

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
like I'm talking to my twin or something

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
it's ridiculous

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
yeah there are kids that are like that

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
I imagine all over the world

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
but like say if you were

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
like if you were

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
not going to school

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
were you still at home

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
I ran away from home

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
wow

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
I lived in the forest

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
in the Russian river

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
yeah

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
in California

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
wow

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
I mean

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
you just

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
find it hard to believe that people would do that

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
in a first world country

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
because

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
that's what

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
number two

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
I would have thought that the comfort

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
you want to mix of the two

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
not just be in the process

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
home that bad that you had

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
that you didn't miss it

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
I would have been killed if I stayed in that town

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
wow

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I became

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
by most like the home

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
other young troublemakers

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
like myself

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
hoodlums

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
I went from being like a straight

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
A student

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
to being a little bit of a hoodlum

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
and where I was living

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
in Stockton

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
things were pretty bad there

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
even though we lived in the good part of town

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
and I eventually

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
ended up

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
in various kinds of trouble with

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
young criminals

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
now it's not as serious as like gang life

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
is that shit's really serious

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
this is pretty very minor

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
compared to that

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
but yeah I basically

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
I realized that

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
if I stay there

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
I realized if I stay here

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
I will either end up in prison

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
or dead

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
so

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
given that belief

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
anything's better

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
than either of those outcomes

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
pretty much anything

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
so even just like

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
like living outside

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
is better

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
so eventually I made it out

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
it took a few attempts

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
wow

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
and then you were able to

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
be out for years

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
on stretch

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
yeah I came home in like the last

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
half of 17 so I was

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
out for three and a half

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
something like that

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
okay

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
okay wow

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
your parents

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
your parents would have been

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
like

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I mean both

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
so sad and mad no?

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
especially I don't know

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
this is very personal but

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
but my mom

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
was relatively indifferent

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
and I ran away to near where she was

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
living

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
because it was by visiting her

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
that I realized that there was this

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
enclave in the forest

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
where

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
it was a bunch of

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
basically old hippies

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
wow

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
so there was like this enclave

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
and it was very

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
richly cultural

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
unlike where I was living

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
which was like

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
zero culture like dead culture

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
so yeah I wanted

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
the culture I couldn't access

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
the culture because I wasn't an adult

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
but I didn't want to be

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
in Stockton anymore

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
trying to figure out how to steal cars

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
with my buddy so we could get some weed

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
or whatever the fucking

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
agenda was

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
yeah I just

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
I didn't want to be

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
in that place

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
anymore and I did not get along with my dad

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
who I was living with so

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
I went to the forest and

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
some adults helped me

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
I made it through okay nothing horrible

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
happened to me while I was on the street

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
I hitchhiked around

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
you know

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
didn't eat much food

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
a lot of fasting

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
oh

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
yeah

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
but

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
I hitchhiked through the US

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
really

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
hmm

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
wow that's crazy

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
yeah it was fun

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
yeah that's

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
really intense

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
in what year were you hitchhiking

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
I mean I'm hitchhiking in like

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
the late 70s early 80s

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
mine

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
was 1980

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
from

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
January say

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
oh wow yeah not at a similar time

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
let's see how old was I in 80s

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
hmm

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
but you know it's quite

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
I mean it was a different experience

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I mean it was a rich experience

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I stood out

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
like a sore thumb

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
yeah well

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
in the south

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
right it was like impossible

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
together

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
right yeah

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
and we learned some chords

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
and stuff so I said hmm how do I

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
overcome this

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
I've got to find a white guy

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
right

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
to

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
hitchhike with

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
brilliant yeah you have to hitchhike

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
by first hitch you have to

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
racially hitchhike before you

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
vehiculatively hitchhike

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
right

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
yeah that's hilarious

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
oh my god yeah

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
I came across the really

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
solid guy you know my house long

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
right and there was this guy

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I was on my way first

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
just to go to a New Orleans for Mardi Gras

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
hey talk about that you know

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
we're talking in a very opportune

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
pertinent time because Mardi Gras

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
is going to be happening soon

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
in now to about this time

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
of the year right 1980

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
yeah

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
yeah

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
so I want to go to New Orleans

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
you know

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
so

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
with my buddy I'd reached up to Atlanta

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
right from college

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
hitchhiking with him to Atlanta

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
so I went to Atlanta

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
to New Orleans

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
three days day in day out

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
when I go to the exit you know which is a bit of a

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
it's not that easy to go

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
from downtown Atlanta

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
like Salvation Army or something like that

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
sure

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
to the exit

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
so anyway three days

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
and I couldn't get it right nobody was stopping

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
I knew it okay

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
so I said okay I'll take a greyhound

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
to New Orleans

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
I go to New Orleans and that was

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
heaven for me there was like

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
the hobos and the hippies from everywhere

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
for Mardi Gras

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
and that guy

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
looked like Jesus Christ in the hair

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
yeah

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
the oldest and self-blown hair

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
brilliant yeah

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
he didn't guru for him

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
so

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
because we got along

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
really quite well like

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
house and fire

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
so

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
yeah he had been

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
hitchhiking for like 10 years

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
so with him

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
the world was a different world

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
you know because

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
people would stop for him

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
I would be like back

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
back a bit in the back and when the class

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
stopped I would run

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
and people would see

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
they're safe enough so it's good

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
right

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I went all around quite a bit of time

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
in Boulder, Colorado

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
and Kansas City where it's home was

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
and then

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
I wanted to

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
following the Grateful Dead

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
I was wanting to follow

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
to Mount McKinley

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
in Canada

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
but got stopped at the border

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
the Canadians wouldn't let me in

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
so I spent some time in Seattle

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
yeah no

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I had a passport

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
it was best in all that

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
so it was always good

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
I went to University of Virginia

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Charlottesville

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
but the student visa

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
runs out

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
after you are a student

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
you know the visa

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
has got a termination date

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
so when I

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
my plan was

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
to go to

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
to the concert

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
the last

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Grateful Dead concert

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
happens in like

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
the equinox or something of that sort

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
you know

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
one of those dates

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
the day when there's

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
the largest amount of flight

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
in Alaska anyway

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
and I would come back because

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
the flight was out of Seattle

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
but the Canadians said no

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
your visa

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
your American visa

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
is

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
over

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
so they won't let you back into America

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
so since they won't let you back into America

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
we can't let you into Canada

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
I see

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
I did not need a visa to Canada

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Canada being in the Commonwealth

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Malaysia is in the

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
there was no need for a Malaysian

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
to have a visa to enter Canada

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
I see yeah

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
you know

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
but it was on the grounds that

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
I wouldn't be allowed to

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
leave

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
if my basis was

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
I was flying out of Seattle

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
I wouldn't be allowed to enter

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
I would not have enough money

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
and whatever

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Canada can stop me from entering Canada

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
not on the grounds that

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
I don't have a visa

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
but on the grounds that do you have enough money

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
to sustain yourself when you're in Canada

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
yeah

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
that's reasonable in pretty much all the world

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
countries all over the world

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
have environment

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
exactly

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
I didn't prepare for that

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
because on the thing that

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
I'm just going to come

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
for the concert come back

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
get on my plane now I'm home

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
I don't want to be here

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
I mean

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
you have a short term goal

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
you know

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
you have a short term goal

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
I'm sorry go ahead

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
yeah me not

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
realizing immigration

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
things in a black and white

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
very strict way

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
that's pretty much the half tool

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
but

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
it didn't

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
fully occur to me

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
because in my head

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
I'm still in America because I'm going to Alaska

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
man

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
but

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
it didn't

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
register in my head

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
that hey

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
doesn't matter what you think

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
it's so funny you say that

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
it's really funny that you say that

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
because I was just thinking about

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
when I was a runaway and when I was hitchhiking

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
I was so naive

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
that it literally didn't

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
occur to me even

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
slightly

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
that I might

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
want to be careful

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
because what sort of an adult

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
picks up a 13 year old boy

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
on the side of the road

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
yes

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
never even occurred

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
to me

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
that I was filtering the adults

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
right

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
and I'm filtering them

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
in a specific direction

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
right which is has

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
some interest

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
in a 13 year old kid

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
now thankfully

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
only

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
I don't know how many times I was near

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
trouble

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
but only twice did I

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
actually get close to trouble

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
and both times

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
I was able to

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
to kind of like avoid them

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
yes both times I was able

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
to resolve the situation by

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
acting tough

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
yeah yeah

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
it drives past my stop

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
and I'm like hey my sauce

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
back there and he's

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
not speaking to me

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
and it's late at night

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
and we're out in the middle of nowhere

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
and I just basically said

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
I will

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
cut your fucking head

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
off with my pocket knife

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I will stab you right now in the neck

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
if you don't pull this car over

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
and he was like boop

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
I got out

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
oh wow

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
oh so

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
did you actually have a knife then

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
yes I did

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
oh good

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
I used to carry a dagger

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
little dagger

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
you're not that naive then

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
I was

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
it's just that in this case

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
I realized

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
like

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
yeah

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
I can still be

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
I can still be very naive

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
I'm not cunning

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
the way some people are cunning

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
and I honestly

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
it never once

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
occurred to me

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
that most of the people that would like

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
that most of the people that would stop for a kid

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
that looked like me

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
would probably

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
have ulterior motives

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
or at least

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
a goodly you know some

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
portion of the people

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
never occurred to me one time

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
not once

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
is it

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
because okay

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Darren

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
when I was in the US too

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
like

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
I mean

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
the country was a different country

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
in the sense that

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
I would have thought

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
it's

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
nowhere as dangerous as it is now maybe

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
me I would agree

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
yeah

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
also I was in a strange

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
I was

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
in a strange sub context

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
right I was in the Russian

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
river

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
so there's a lot of basically the three primary

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
okay this is going to be really bad

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
say here but

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
the three primary populations

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
there were rednecks, homosexuals

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
and hippies

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
and the hippies and the homosexuals

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
got along fine

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
the rednecks hated

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
both the other camps pretty much though

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
got along better with the hippies than

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
the gay people

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
so

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
that was the context there

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
and obviously

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
you know

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
yeah I could have gotten a lot of trouble

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
but I never did

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
I never did

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
no one ever hurt me

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
so growing up after the age of

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
leaving home

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
you hadn't been exposed to

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
the dangers of

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
such dangers as much

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I was

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
you have no idea how naive I was

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
in your wildest estimations

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
you will underestimate my naivety

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I was

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
yeah I was

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I was very intelligent

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
and skillful

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
in certain ways

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
but my god was I naive

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
it's just one of the

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
feelings I've always had yeah

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
it never even

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
okay look let me be really clear

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
about this so you can understand the depth

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
not only did it never occur

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
to me that I was attracting the people

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
who would have some interest

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
in a 13 year old boy ever

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
it never occurred to me

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
not only that

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
it never occurred to me

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
that it didn't occur to me

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
until just now

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
40 something years later

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
50 years later

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
it never occurred to me

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
that it didn't occur to me until this conversation

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
today

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
that's how naive I am

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
wow

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I never realized

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
that I didn't realize

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
until just now

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
yeah

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
it's that bad

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
you know

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
to me in my

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
when I got rights there

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
when I started getting rights and stuff

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
the people who were picking us up were so generous

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
that made a big difference

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
and innocent

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
usually it would be like a small town

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
you know the tour in some way

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
and then

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
at the back

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
yeah some of that too

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
and

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
all beautiful it was

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
right beautiful it was

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
I mean nowhere else in the world

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
I think I mean

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
would you get that

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
yeah it's true because the

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
counterculture in the United States

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
at that time was still

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
kind of blossoming

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
a little bit

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
and how old were you

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
were you like 18

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
20 or something

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
yeah I would have been

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
21

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
perfect

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
so

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
you know you present

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
to

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
the drivers

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
obviously

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
something they might

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
find fascinating

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
and

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
adventurous

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
to some of them

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
yep

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
so that works in your

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
favor but yeah it was pretty good like

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
most people were very kind

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
some people gave me

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
money or brought me food

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
some people asked me

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
you know like how do you survive

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
they were curious

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
occasionally

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
like if it was raining

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
or something somebody would be like hey

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
you can just crash at our place if you want

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
you know

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
and obviously that could be very dangerous

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
but never turned out to be

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
not once

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
because I mean I was 22

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
so it didn't occur to me

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
you know

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
anything would happen to me

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
I was least

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
concerned about it

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
to me it's like how do I get it right

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
I don't know the money

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
yeah that's all I was concerned with

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
too I was just like how do I get

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
to where I'm going I wasn't thinking about

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
why someone would

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
or wouldn't stop to pick me up

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
in other words

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
there was no

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
there was no meta reflection

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
right

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
there was no

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
there was no meta cognition

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
yeah

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
no meta cognition about my circumstance

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
whereas you

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
must have had some by your age

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
yeah

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
I mean

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
more

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
I mean

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
but you know violence wasn't

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
like you didn't have the school shootings

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
you didn't

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
yeah

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
the malware wasn't

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
concentrated yet

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
yeah

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
and

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
say for example

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
people may say okay

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
blacks are dangerous

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
but

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
right

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
I'm almost black

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
right exactly

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
so

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
you know

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
I'm more likely to see you as an ally

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
than as

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
an enemy or prey

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
yeah

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
and I wanted to try it

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
I had to

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
because part of

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
that was the American equivalent

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
of you being a sadu

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
of you being like

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
you know

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
that's funny yeah I got you

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
right yeah

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
that's a hilarious way of saying it

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
like you're

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
yeah it's the American version of you're a holy man

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
or something

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
oh no you have faith in nature

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
oh you have faith I see

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
I see that

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
come on don't be

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
yeah that's what I had actually

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
that is what I had back then

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
in a way

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
I had faith

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
that it was

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
possible to be myself

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
without a house

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
without a roof

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
without money

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
without food

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
with nothing

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
I

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
knew that

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
money would be an issue so I had to

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
watch out and you know

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
in our places we stopped

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
anyway we made it

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
because we could get jobs in some

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
places and

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
little short term jobs

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
especially

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
in Boulder Colorado

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
I remember

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
in 4th of July

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
around about 4th of July

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
I was there and it was snowing

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
right

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
in Boulder California then

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
it was a bit of a surprise but

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
that was good climate I mean they had

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
you know like a

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
job placement

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
for tramps and hobos

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
you know

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
but because I was with this guy called

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Bernie

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Bernie McGraw

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Bernie McGraw

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
yeah

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
he knew the ins and outs

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
where you go and get food stamps

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
and where you get

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
day jobs

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
and stuff like that so

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
rather quickly

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
after 4 days I got a job as a

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
dishwasher

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
in

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Boulder

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
right and

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
you know that was fun and

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
the pay you get

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
compared to what you need is like

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
great because it was staying in like

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
in Boulder

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
after a while was staying in like

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
an abandoned

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
house in the edge of a river kind of

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
like in a forest right

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
so

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
we had sleeping bags and stuff like

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
rather

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
winter proof sleeping bags so

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
managed that was good you know

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
there were other people later

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
we met some people

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
and we lived in the house for a while

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
very liberal

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
I mean very truly liberal place

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Boulder was when I was there you know

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
very

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
very generous

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
you know

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
the first day I remember too

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
I remember too

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
I tell you this

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
I

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
already I had rather little money

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
like 25 dollars or something

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
like that and I had a camera and stuff

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
and my buddy was hitchhiking with me

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
he said let me borrow your camera

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
and then he goes and fawns in

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
fucking

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
and so

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
because of that

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
I remember that day I had no more money

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
I had no more money and I didn't

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
have a camera and I was like

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
how am I going to solve this well

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
this is this I've got to

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
learn this and I've got to learn how to

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
be without any money so

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
I walk along

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
the street pearl street in

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Boulder you know so downtown

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
one street

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
that is

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
walk only no cars

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
right so I think I walk

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
and I signboard right

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
on the side of a building and he said

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Naropa

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
this is this

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
institute

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
me

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
wow this is like

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
next to bumfuck

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
U.S.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
I mean

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
I'm not even Kansas City

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Salina, Kansas by the highway

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
this is like

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
for me it's like nowhere

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
and how come it's got a Buddhist institute

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
this is my thing

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
this is my

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
culture yeah

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
in the middle of America

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
so I said I have to go upstairs

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
so I go up and I see you know there's

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
two guys and stuff and it's like a

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
conversation and they're so wonderful

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
they offered you know one of the guys

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
offered his place for me to stay in

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
because his buddy was

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
had gone off somewhere so there was

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
they can see

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
so come and stay with me and stay at my

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
place and it was great

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
you know beautiful

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
always the whole thing was beautiful

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
and Seattle

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
my last stop was fantastic

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
you know after by the time I reached

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
to like Seattle and stuff I'm on my own

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
but

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
I was walking you know I get

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
I was walking and this guy in a pickup

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
truck you know comes past me

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
stops

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
winds his window down looks at me and says

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
are you going somewhere

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
can I take you I was like wow

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
because

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
you know they were

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
they could see me

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
and I'm like wow it was

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
great it was because

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
I

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
to me

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
the folks then in Seattle

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
were like a great above the rest of the world

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
they were like really

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
friendly to

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
it is actually okay there is

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
something weird about

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
it

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
how to put this

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
so I have

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
not traveled much

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
I've mostly only been

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
in central and northern California

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
throughout my entire life I've been

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
basically nowhere

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
but a couple times I traveled

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
a couple times I traveled a little bit

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
and I went

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
for example to Oregon

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
or Washington State

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
and

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
I don't know

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
I think

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
I think

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
that because I'm not well traveled

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
I probably have a

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
a distorted sense

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
but the people in

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Oregon were very different

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
the people in Washington were

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
very different it may be that

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
it does actually seem

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
to me that places

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
have

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
something that

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
resembles a personality

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
and that the humans in those

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
places

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
reflect that does that make any

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
sense?

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
yeah yeah yeah

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
something like that

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
that's a yep

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
I'm an echo yeah

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
because the man made me think much

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
and I always say this

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
I know this quite well

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
because I go to India often

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
I've gone to India quite a lot

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
and they're forever complaining about

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
the outside and places dirty

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
and this and this

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
it's a manifestation of

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
the sum of the minds

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
in

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
in Hindu culture there are

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
words for these things

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
in English there are not

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
in Sanskrit there are words for

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
words

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
you have a culture that's like

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
8,000 years older than ours

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
and the white people

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
think they're intelligent

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
what?

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
you guys are playing with Play-Doh

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
or something works

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
you know

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
my son

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
he studies Advaita Vedanta

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
I know there are words

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
for all of these in Sanskrit

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
and in

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Indian philosophy

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
there's very complex

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
sophisticated language about

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
all the different features

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
of anything

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
you might want to

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
refer to in consciousness at all

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
it's very interesting

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
compared to

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
how it is in English

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
it's so much richer

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
and more intelligent in some ways

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
you remind me of one thing

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
I was talking to another

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
buddy who might join us

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
who's a good candidate

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
to join our team

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
I must ask you to hold

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
I'm getting an important call

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
okay

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
oh it's too late

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
I missed it

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
it's alright, I'm here

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
oh I see

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
okay

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
maybe I'll talk about that

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
and we'll

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
we can continue another day

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
of course

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
there's a word

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Darren

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
the word we are looking for is like

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
sensibility

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
meaning

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
what is it that we are looking

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
what is it that we are trying to get

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
artificial intelligence to do?

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
what is intelligence?

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
acumen

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
but they seem

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
the western world seems

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
to not want to talk about

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
the word

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
which is even more clear

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
in the Indian language in Tamil

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
and some of our local languages

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
it's called Bhutti

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Buddha's name comes from that

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Buddha is not his name

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
no

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
but they call it

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
like miss the sensible

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
what I

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
see I want to talk to you

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
I mean one word in English is equanimity

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
equanimity is it?

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
yeah it means not biased

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
you don't

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
you don't collapse into extremity

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
you're balanced

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
hmm

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
ah yes

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
that says that

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
your balance

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
what

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
I guess what to me

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
why the western world my trip over

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
it is when we talk about

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
sensibility

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
in the context

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
they are thinking of cognition

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
the western world

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
when it talks about AI

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
it's like forever going into cognition

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
and we are saying no the body

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
and the mind

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
must be both taken into account

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
in realizing what is the right

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
sensible thing to see sensible

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
or the right thing to do which is

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
which we will say is a sensible thing

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
to do the sensible thing to do

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
includes what your body

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
which means instinct

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
what your instinctive reactions are

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
because you're dealing with for example

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
indigenous people

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
and pretty much they're running on instinct

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
you know we don't know about

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
what cognition they have or they don't have

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
it doesn't matter

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
they're functional people on instinct

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
so sensibility

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
the word sense immediately implies

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
you know the five senses

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
for example right

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
more cognition

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
why had it occurred to you

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
or does it occur to you why does the western world

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
not talk about sensibility

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
the question is very

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
broad

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
meaning

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
like say when

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
in the AI circles and stuff

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
right when you're talking about

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
ethics and whatever

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
why not say

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
hey

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
which of these LLMs

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
is more sensible

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
takes into account

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
sensibility

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
which is different from intelligence

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
and I think enough people would know

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
that yeah

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
because intelligence immediately in a big way

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
kind of like

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
in the slides

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
or the leans towards

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
academia

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
leans towards

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
it does

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
but the common humans have no

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
all

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
they're missing

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
what you have

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
they're missing the experience

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
of

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
coherent

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
daily life

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
that

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
most of whose

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
rules don't need

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
to be written or declared

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
so what they have is something really

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
weird they have a thing where

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
all the rules are written

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
and declared

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
and you have to either obey

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
the ignorant of

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
or reject them

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
and one of the reasons why

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Trump is about to get elected in this country

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
is because the rejection crowd

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
is really pissy at this point

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
in history

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
everybody all the males

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
all the ignorant poorly educated males

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
who have no fucking

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
no clue about

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
what it means to be human and yet are

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
anyway

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
they want somebody who gets away with breaking the rules

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
and they will elect that guy

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
if we don't you know

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
if something doesn't stop them

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
and

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
the guy

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
so he's the opposite of sensibility

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
but he masquerades as sensible

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
right

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
I saw some advertising with him

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
between masquerading

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
as sensible

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
and having to be sensible

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
to get elected and stay there

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
in a way from the other

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
prejudice

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
you're not going to get elected if you're sensible

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
there's no chance

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
of that happening

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
yeah that's

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
no

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
that's not going to happen

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
you get elected not okay

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
in America you get elected not because you're sensible

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
you get elected because you're sensational

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
it's a society of spectacles

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
right

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
the better your spectacle the better the brand

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
of spectacle that you produce

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
the more likely you are to be elected

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
that's sick

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
that's sad I mean

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
it's screwed that up so bad

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
I mean like

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
here let me ask you this

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Kamala Harris should not be there

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
should not be up there

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
should she

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
I don't know

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
how would I tell

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
I mean supposing I really cared

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
right

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
how would I make the determination

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
do I want

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
a pissed off para-feminist

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
having a voice in the government

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
yeah I probably do

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
her particularly I'm not sure

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
I mean like

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
like a fly on the wall

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
you know

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
I don't know Kamala Harris's

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
talk very much

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
maybe I'm actually thinking of AOC

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
when you said her name

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
at least AOC is

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
I mean like she's

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
she's smart

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
yeah I mean

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
yeah smart

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
she

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
I mean she knows how to get attention

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
and it's not just

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
she used to be good

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
but I think she's going downhill

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
by the way

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
I've spent about 27 minutes

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
of my life listening to politicians

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
in 2020

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
acts

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
that's something I mostly

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
just ignore to be clear

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
and also to be clear for posterity

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
if anyone listens to this

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
I'm not well educated

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
okay

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
so and you're able to

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
I guess

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
for whatever you do

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
it doesn't affect you too much

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
or you find spots where

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
you're not affected by

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
you operate

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
I have a simple principle

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
at this accelerated age

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
that I'm at almost 60

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
not a kid anymore

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
the simple principle is

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
try not to actively import suffering

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
outside

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
so

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
the news is basically all about

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
importing suffering

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
so I mostly buffer that off

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
I may glance at it but I don't take it seriously

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
and I rarely reflect on it

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
it's mostly just me taking

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
the temperature of modernity

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
is the apocalypse likely to happen today

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
or next week

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
yeah

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
it's mostly that

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
do you pay much attention to news

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
what's your relationship with it like

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
not much

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
I mean I pay attention

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
to the news

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
in the last 5-10 years

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
some areas I'm a bit interested

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
more like world issues

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
well I mean like say India

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Russia

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
is hitting

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
China to some extent

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
of course

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
I want to get

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
for orientation

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
then

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
being a bit more attentive

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
I'm still more

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
I would read news

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
that touches on our area

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
like what I'm talking to you about

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
getting funding

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
or if it's not funding

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
how do I go to the next step

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
from where I am

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
and the next step in

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
your village

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
becoming a voice

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
and making connections

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
and me

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
finding a way to

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
self sustain it

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
to fund it

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
when I sent you

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
the link

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
to

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
we move

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
we found this or whatever

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
basically

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
align with people

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
who would

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
invest in us or finances

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
or help us out

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
because we've got

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
enough

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
if we have a team

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
enough of us have to be paid

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
right

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
such as the world

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
so

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
where can you get funding and who funds them

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
and what are the requirements

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
and who has been successful

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
that kind of news

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
that I keep up

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
and then over and above that

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
when you see me

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
writing

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
most of my writing is under

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
the under

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
the substrate of it is

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
how do we

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
why can't we be

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
the same state

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
develop

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
why can't we be the same state

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
high state we were

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
500 or 600 years ago

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
right in my neck of the woods

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
and in particular

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
like

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
saying the villages

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
why

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
all of the things

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
zero crime

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
embodied currency

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
embodied learning

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
why can't we have that

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
it's like

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
why can't we have what I had from

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
zero to seven with an unconditional love

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
mother

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
I can go and sleep

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
and I want kids

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
and I want my

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
I want the work

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
of hundreds of generations of

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
my forefathers to continue

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
instead of it going

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
so downhill in one generation

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
it has gone downhill too

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
everybody

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
is doing it meaning

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
you go around with solicit doing crime

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
and whatever just casually

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
and you ask me what the hell are you doing

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
and they say hey everybody you can't

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
you don't do it everybody is doing it

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
and I said no

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
not everybody is doing it

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
I'm not doing it come on

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
for example a lawyer who is

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
stealing and cheating and screwing his customer

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
hey don't have faith in your intellect

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
that you can do something else

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
for example we stopped

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
you know emerging we stopped creating

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
anything new for 600 years

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
why didn't we do part of that

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
that needs law too

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
I mean the young kids

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
the younger people are a bit ready to

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
listen to that the folks

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
who are the lawyers and stuff

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
big names no they're not interested

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
in that they want to screw the system

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
bloody hell I'm so

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
but I guess they're not born in the

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
kind of village and conditional love

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
environment that I was

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
look whenever you take

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
a cohort like lawyers

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
or doctors or dentists or

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
teachers

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
you're gonna find a large prevalence

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
of what I'll call the worst common

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
denominator

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
which is the people who

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
you know

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
but what you're actually looking at

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
is a topology

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
and as you come to understand

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
the structure of the topology

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
you'll be able to find the people in

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
the cohort who aren't defecting

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
and those people will be excited to discover

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
you as well

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
this is a moment of mutual

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
appreciation

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
that's long been coming

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
many of us would like the dreams of our

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
ancestors

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
not to be flushed down the toilet

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000
in a single generation

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
and some of us would like those dreams

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
to be actually fulfilled

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
so that's

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
those purposes live

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
in the hearts of humans

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
and if we can

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
awaken them it will be very

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
powerful

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
and it doesn't have to be a cult

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
it doesn't even have to be

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
political it can just be human

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
and you often you know in your writing

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
you know you say

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
this is an everyday

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
thing

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
this is normal

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
yes

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
I think that's what those guys in the

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
book I quoted from earlier were saying

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
too they're like we have this narrative

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
that it's impossible to change this

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
and that humans are fundamentally broken

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
it's not true

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
they're just trapped in why are they

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000
trapped in thinking they're broken

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
so yeah these are things that I

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
want to keep

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
exploring and understanding better and get

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
people doing something around

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
right experimenting

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
play grow learn discover

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
remember

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
remember how we can be

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
yeah

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
I'm trying to

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
you know in my own way

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
yeah yeah okay good good

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
so you know

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
between Indonesia

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
and San Francisco

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
you know I'll

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
on this you know formulate

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
some more what's next steps

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
we can take

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
making this happen

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
yes

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
we let us

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
let us bookmark that

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
for our next conversation but there are

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000
some for sure

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
and I'm absolutely

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
willing to explore them together

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
I just need to get some food in me

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
okay good on you

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
profoundly

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
educational for me

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
