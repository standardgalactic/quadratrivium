WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Great to see you again, Lee. I'm so happy.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Great to see you again, Darren.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
I'm really excited. There's so much to cover.

00:13.000 --> 00:20.000
We'll probably, we'll be sort of continuing along the lines that we established in our previous conversation.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
And let's see here. So,

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
sort of where we left off, we were talking a little bit about

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
how it's possible.

00:37.000 --> 00:49.000
A process that resembles the caterpillar going into a priceless right where, where, where you can sort of liquefy the structure of history and the self.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
And then reforge it, maybe without some of the impediments.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Right.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
But it was

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
perhaps carrying historically and struggling with.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
And we can return to therapy.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
I just want to sort of bookmark that idea.

01:11.000 --> 01:22.000
But there's a, so there's a, there's a span in your story previously that I'd like to revisit, which is the span between your walk.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
And when you begin to

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
enter

01:29.000 --> 01:44.000
the learning process that I think starts with NLP goes to hypnosis goes to mesmerism and then circles back maybe to the walk and the events during it.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Right. Okay.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:56.000
Okay. So maybe if you can help prompt me, because I'll be coming up with a lot of a lot of things here, which will be quite free form, but

01:56.000 --> 02:05.000
so we spoke about in the previous interview or conversation, I prefer to put it really that we did.

02:05.000 --> 02:15.000
There was the coast to coast walk that I mentioned and the particular section called the like wake walk, which I, which was particularly important.

02:15.000 --> 02:28.000
That's where I had my, what I'll call my Milky Way experience, where I had the experience of connecting the heavens and the earth through my through my physical body.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
It was a very visceral experience.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
And after this walk, as I mentioned, returning back to London where I was living at the time.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
So like I say, this was around 1990.

02:46.000 --> 02:58.000
I ended up having, I was catapulted into a, into a kind of what they would call in the alchemical tradition kind of like a niggerado state.

02:58.000 --> 03:11.000
So I felt a bit a little bit like everything was disintegrating like, like I've been ripped open and my psychic skin was really raw and bare.

03:11.000 --> 03:21.000
I was able to sense everything around me, the vibrations of all of the people around me.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
But in an uncomfortable way, when I returned from doing that walk, which was a very joyous experience.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
It was, you know, an incredibly joyous experience doing that walk.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
Like I say, returning to the city, returning to London at that time, very, very difficult.

03:38.000 --> 03:49.000
The important thing is, is that during, during that time, like I say, it was almost like entering into a type of depressive state.

03:49.000 --> 03:59.000
But it also felt like I had terrible flu. So it was all, it was almost like a physical state as well.

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
But as I was coming out of this, I started to come out of this, due to a series of dreams that I started to have.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.000
This is where dreams become really important in this whole scenario we're speaking about.

04:14.000 --> 04:26.000
So I started to have lots of dreams and in, in this, in these dreams, I think I touched on this in the previous part, but I didn't go into great detail.

04:26.000 --> 04:35.000
In these dreams, I, there was a specific hill that was in these dreams.

04:35.000 --> 04:43.000
It was very, very characteristic. So it was the kind of thing that stuck in my head and it was a recurring dream as well.

04:43.000 --> 04:56.000
And from the top of the hill, I looked down the hill and there was some cornfields and there was a river flowing through the cornfields.

04:56.000 --> 05:08.000
And I even could see, because of the dreams, because my encounters with a particular figure in these dreams that I found, there was a boat.

05:08.000 --> 05:20.000
And it was on a river. And this river was within the cornfield that I could see down in the sloping valley in the veil seen from this particular hill.

05:20.000 --> 05:27.000
And inside this boat was a goddess-like figure, a feminine figure.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
And every time I got into the boat with her, we would go for a ride.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
And every night, we would go a little further.

05:37.000 --> 05:51.000
And this ride down the river was going from the vision of the hill, from the view of the hill looking down, the river flowed left to the left.

05:51.000 --> 06:01.000
So I got into the boat with her and every time I woke up, I felt an immense surge of healing energy.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
So this dream, I noticed, was beginning to act as a kind of medicine.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
It was healing me every single night, every night that I had the dream.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
I was looking forwards to actually being back there again.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
And sure enough, every now and again, it kept coming back.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
And this dream would just heal me a little bit more.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
And this is what got me out of whatever it was I was in at the time.

06:29.000 --> 06:39.000
Do you have any impression about, how did you think about the woman, the boat and the river, but particularly the woman about her identity?

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
Was it a matter of concern to you?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Weirdly no.

06:44.000 --> 06:57.000
I just knew that she represented some kind of divine feminine force, that she was somehow a personification of nature that I was meeting in this boat.

06:57.000 --> 07:06.000
And that's all that really concerned me.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Can you describe her from your recollection?

07:10.000 --> 07:15.000
I mean, maybe she doesn't have a specific appearance, but what do you recall?

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Well, I do recall that she had long hair.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
I do recall that she had a long dress.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I think it was white.

07:23.000 --> 07:30.000
If I remember, I don't have full recollection of that.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
The Dreaming Mind is a wooden rowing boat, I remember that.

07:34.000 --> 07:44.000
Yeah, the Dreaming Mind isn't as concerned with what we might think of as particulars.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
But it was a cornfield, that I find significant, the fact that it was a cornfield.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
And this takes place looking down from Nap Hill.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
That's right, that's right, but I didn't know it was called Nap Hill.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
I see.

08:03.000 --> 08:13.000
Now, I've mentioned this to you obviously in private, but the thing is, is I had no idea who this person was.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
I had no idea where this place was.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
It was a dream.

08:20.000 --> 08:30.000
But you see, in 1994, in the summer, I think it was the summer of 1994, there was a couple of friends of mine.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
I used to work on markets in London.

08:35.000 --> 08:45.000
I used to sell old 50s rock and roll collectible records and 60s psychedelic stuff and things like that.

08:45.000 --> 08:57.000
A couple of my friends there, I got chatting with them on the stall and they just said to me,

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
they knew I had a van and we had similar interests, we discovered.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
And they said, should we take a trip out to the West Country, would you take us?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I said, sure, you know, I'd love to do that.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
So we got in the van and went looking for crop circles.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
So this is in the summer of 1994.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
And whereabouts are you when you're on this journey?

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
Yeah, you mean in terms of geography?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Where are you going?

09:27.000 --> 09:37.000
Right, OK, so we got in the car in the van and we drove out of London and went over to the area of Avebury,

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
which is, you know, a really amazing place for those who've never been there.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Look it up.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
It's in Wiltshire, which is in the West Country.

09:50.000 --> 09:57.000
And we were looking around for all of these crop circles.

09:57.000 --> 10:08.000
And we found one or two that day around Avebury, around sort of in that vicinity in the fields around.

10:08.000 --> 10:15.000
Drive out of London to Avebury and you find crop circles just out there without even knowing where you're going.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
There's no internet, right?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
No, there was no internet.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Just venturing out in your van and you come across crop circles.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
And I find that kind of surprising, but I'm listening, please continue.

10:28.000 --> 10:38.000
Well, as the story actually goes, is the fact that we actually basically all three of us agreed that all of the crop circles we found that day.

10:38.000 --> 10:45.000
I think it was two or three we saw were kind of just fake.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
And it was kind of crop circle season.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Right. OK, I follow.

10:52.000 --> 11:04.000
Yeah, so there were supposedly some around or so they'd heard, which is what spurred them on to want to go and do the, you know, do the trip.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
So we went out there and all day we were looking for these things.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
We found two or three, like I say, and but we weren't convinced.

11:16.000 --> 11:27.000
They seemed a bit scrappy and a bit kind of, you know, like maybe some teenagers had knocked it up overnight, you know, sort of thing.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
So we sort of were everyone was a bit disappointed.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
We'd had a great trip out, but everyone was really tired and it was the end of the day.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
We'd been traipsing around all day through these fields and cornfields and stuff.

11:41.000 --> 11:50.000
And I just got this thought as a driver thought, oh, how about taking a different route?

11:50.000 --> 11:58.000
Let's let's go just take a random route off and go up through another through another route another way.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Instead of going the main roads home, let's go off some some other way.

12:02.000 --> 12:11.000
So we did this and I didn't really know the area apart from maybe a couple of the main routes around there.

12:11.000 --> 12:20.000
And all of a sudden, like as we were going through all of these open planes.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
I suddenly saw the way the road swooped up to the right.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
There was a there was a track path coming away from the road.

12:31.000 --> 12:40.000
And as soon as I saw this, I had this immense impetus, this impulse to just stop the car and get out and walk up that track.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
So I did.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
And of course they were really, really tired and they were they were complaining.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
It's like, oh, we've not found anything you've been walking all day.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
We're really, really tired.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
And we were supposed to be on the way home.

12:57.000 --> 13:04.000
So I said, you can wait here.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
And so they did they waited in the van.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
And I traipsed on up the track.

13:10.000 --> 13:18.000
And so I got out got out of the van traipsed up the track and went to the top of this track, the top of the hill.

13:18.000 --> 13:27.000
So when I got when I got to the top, I stood there and looked down across the hill.

13:27.000 --> 13:41.000
Lo and behold, I was absolutely transfixed by the fact that what I had in front of me was exactly what I'd seen in my dreams.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
At least five years earlier.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
So back in, like I say, coming from the coast to coast back in 1990.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
So about four or five years earlier, I'd seen this very, very place in my dreams.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
You can't ignore that when that happens.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
You're there looking at the scene and lo and behold, there is the there is the valley.

14:05.000 --> 14:14.000
There is the river snaking through exactly the same place.

14:14.000 --> 14:22.000
And while this is in my mind right now, I must mention this just in case it's not completed.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
It's only about a month ago, I think just before our interview, the last interview we had.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
That I met a lady through a mutual friend around here where I live.

14:37.000 --> 14:48.000
And she actually revealed what I understand to be the actual name of this particular goddess that I'd come across.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Okay, this is the thing I was having for a pastime, right?

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I sensed to like, she is someone who is she I'm listening at least.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Right.

14:57.000 --> 15:02.000
Now, I feel it's maybe not the right circumstance to reveal that name.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Okay, I understand that.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Yeah.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
And such things, there are some things that is important to keep private.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
And also to not speak about.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
That's right.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
And I honor.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
And you can feel that viscerally, you can feel, don't speak of it.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Yes, yes, good.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Yes, I honor this and understand.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Yeah.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
But please continue.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
I'm with you.

15:24.000 --> 15:33.000
In actual fact, all I've mentioned up till this point, including the fact that there was this feminine figure, it was a goddess figure, it was there in the boat.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
It was revealed in a dream.

15:35.000 --> 15:42.000
These parts until very recently, I've had, I've had a do not speak about it.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Oh, wow.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Okay.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
So what is only now I'm beginning to speak about it.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Wow.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
So do you have any sense of what the change what changed that made you feel more comfortable to speak of it?

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
That's an interesting question.

15:58.000 --> 16:05.000
In my physical body, my body is telling me it's okay to mention it.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
It's a visceral sensation.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
There's a stop feeling when you know that something is not the time to speak about it.

16:13.000 --> 16:27.000
Yes, it's funny that you say that because, you know, we have this colloquialism in English, what we call the still small voice.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Right.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Right.

16:29.000 --> 16:36.000
And also, I think, though I'm not an expert on this topic, Socrates is Daimon.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Yeah.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
What it primarily did was just say no.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Didn't tell him what to do.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
It didn't have, they didn't have conversations, at least not in the records that we have.

16:49.000 --> 16:58.000
And one thing that we know about it is it tells him just don't, this is, don't do this, or it might say, you made a mistake.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Yeah.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Yeah.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
And so there's this interesting in my own experience with this a couple of times in my life.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
I heard it tell me it, whatever it is, right.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Don't.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Just like, no.

17:17.000 --> 17:35.000
And not, I've had other experiences of, you know, sort of a Daimonic intelligence or whatever, but I honor that. And I want to just mention that I have a close friend who works with neurodivergent people.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
And her prime, one of her primary areas of expertise is a process called positive disintegration.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Okay.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
And when you were talking about what took place when you returned to London.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
It has the earmarks of this process.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Right.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
And she talks about it as in, in a variety of senses, but it's, it's, it's quite fascinating.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
Because she says that it's, it's a, it's a somatic array. It's an array of somatic intelligences.

18:06.000 --> 18:14.000
And you talk about feeling that you had the flu, but you also talk about having these extra sensitivities where you can feel people's energy and things like this, right?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah, yeah.

18:15.000 --> 18:24.000
But it sort of has the earmarks of this process. I recognize from my recent discussion with her a similarity there.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
Okay. So you've, you've met a woman somewhat recently.

18:28.000 --> 18:36.000
She revealed to you, and I presume that when she revealed this, it was resonant. You were like, oh, or how did you feel?

18:36.000 --> 18:53.000
Yeah, actually, I was absolutely gobsmacked because the very moment that and the odd thing is the fact that I was describing this specific place also caused a huge reaction and huge

18:53.000 --> 19:01.000
explosion for her also, because she said that I can't believe the synchronicity of what you're describing to me.

19:01.000 --> 19:13.000
She said it was literally just last night for the very first time that I was earmarking that very place you're telling me about to actually go and visit it.

19:13.000 --> 19:21.000
And then she revealed to me the actual name of the, of this particular, of this particular goddess figure.

19:21.000 --> 19:30.000
So it was kind of like a mutual, explosive, amazing sort of cross flow of information.

19:30.000 --> 19:36.000
And yes, I definitely feel it's not the right time to talk about the name. I'm not saying that.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
I'm not saying that just the sake of theory, you know, to be serious.

19:40.000 --> 19:54.000
This is, this is trivial. What we're doing here is, I mean, it's beautiful and profound for me and, you know, but this is a, this is not the place for, for this kind of

19:54.000 --> 20:02.000
I just honor the fact that there's some things we shouldn't speak openly and particularly publicly or even on recordings about.

20:02.000 --> 20:12.000
Okay, so I mean, I just have a couple of questions about this. How did you come across this person? How long have you known them? What was the tell me something about that?

20:12.000 --> 20:22.000
That's the peculiar thing. I'd never, well, actually, funnily enough, I'd, I'd seen this person a couple of times.

20:22.000 --> 20:35.000
And, you know, there'd been an acknowledgement, like I was recognized and so on. But there'd been no interaction. And there's been no interaction since either.

20:35.000 --> 20:45.000
It was purely just on this day I was there to meet someone else entirely. And it happened to be one of these talks over a coffee table that ended up sort of spilling out.

20:45.000 --> 20:54.000
And oddly, you know, it somehow, probably because of the company I was in, the conversation turned in that direction.

20:54.000 --> 21:08.000
And, and just strangely, these hugely important missing fragments of information that I'd been hanging on waiting for these extra pieces to arrive for years.

21:08.000 --> 21:28.000
And this very much touches on something central to my own personal attitude towards receiving gnosis or, you know, how it happens with dreams, with actual encounters.

21:28.000 --> 21:37.000
Whenever you receive anything what seems to be significant at the time, I take quite a, quite a detached approach to it.

21:37.000 --> 21:46.000
I don't let myself get overattached or over excited by anything which seems significant.

21:46.000 --> 21:59.000
What I tend to do is I tend to sort of earmark, earmark the events or earmark these things and put them put them on the shelf, so to speak.

21:59.000 --> 22:15.000
To let them hang around because I have absolute faith or certainty in one way or another, that these things will be answered or I will understand their true significance, even if I have to wait years for it to happen.

22:15.000 --> 22:23.000
And this was a really good example of what I'm saying because I take life as one whole, if you like.

22:23.000 --> 22:44.000
So there are things that we can be experiencing now in our esoteric internal experiences, in our dreams, in our personal revelations of any kind, or synchronicities, significant synchronicity, which I have no doubt we will find the answers to.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
20 years from now.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
I have full faith in that. There's no rush about this.

22:54.000 --> 23:13.000
So it's really interesting to hear you say this because I trust the wisdom of the intelligences in you that have this sense of no need to get super excited about this.

23:13.000 --> 23:25.000
Put this on the shelf, let it sort of, I don't know what the word is, be enriched by time or sort of like age, let it age.

23:25.000 --> 23:34.000
And then in time, it will become clear. The thing that I find funny about that is I'm completely the opposite and it gets me in trouble.

23:34.000 --> 23:42.000
I get super excited, right? And so I can become so excited and enchanted that I get very spun up.

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
And then various things, it doesn't always lead to disaster, but sometimes it does, right?

23:48.000 --> 24:02.000
I'm disoriented by the excitement and the enchantment. And when one is disoriented, you know, untoward events may occur.

24:02.000 --> 24:11.000
OK, so there's a number of threads here, and I have them fairly well organized in my mind.

24:11.000 --> 24:18.000
You mentioned in private conversation earlier, the like wake walk.

24:18.000 --> 24:25.000
Why don't you tell the audience a little bit about the definitions of those two terms and what they came to mean for you?

24:25.000 --> 24:34.000
Right, OK, so like I said, back in 1990, I undertook the like wake walk, which was part of the coast coast walk.

24:34.000 --> 24:41.000
So I'll just recap very, very quickly from what I explained a little bit of in the previous part.

24:41.000 --> 24:51.000
No, we did. England's a bit like a hand. The coast coast walk, of course, goes directly from the east to the west coast.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Then the starting and ending places, if you don't mind.

24:54.000 --> 25:12.000
Yeah, so on the west coast, sorry, on the west coast, which would be, if this was the hand of England, you know, this is Scotland up here, this is Northumbria, and here is the Pennine Ridge running down the middle.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
The Lake District over on the west is sort of where we started.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
So it's kind of like from the west coast over to the east coast.

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
Of course, this would be Cornwall, London somewhere over here. The Cornwall is a bit like where the thumb is.

25:30.000 --> 25:40.000
So you would travel across starting starting, well, in this instance, I started from the west coast going to the east.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
Yes, but what is the place where you started the name?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
So it's Saint B's Head.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Great, thank you.

25:47.000 --> 26:02.000
Saint B's Head. So going from Saint B's Head, and then going across the Lake District, crossing the Pennine Ridge, which was very peculiar, I've just remembered, I may as well say these things as they're coming into my mind.

26:03.000 --> 26:16.000
Crossing the Pennine Ridge, I ended up meeting an old couple on the top of the Pennine watershed, really boggy watershed in mist.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
A really old couple who were happening to walk this particular stretch of the Pennine Ridge.

26:22.000 --> 26:29.000
And so I kind of started chatting to them in the middle of mist, in the middle of nowhere.

26:29.000 --> 26:43.000
And I thought, this is interesting, this lady's, I said to the lady, old gent, old lady, I said to the older lady, I said, your accent sounds quite familiar.

26:43.000 --> 26:54.000
It sounds like it's from where I grew up, which is a place called Aquarth, which I grew up in as a small child, which is an old oak grove.

26:54.000 --> 27:03.000
Originally, it was part of an old druid oak grove up on a moor top.

27:03.000 --> 27:20.000
And she said, oh yeah, I come from a place near to Leeds, because don't forget this is, the Pennine Ridge here, it's sort of on the way to, it's almost closer to Manchester, really, at this particular point.

27:20.000 --> 27:31.000
So she could have been from anywhere up north, but I said, no, she identified her accent, she said, no, I'm from closer to Pontifract, Wakefield, outside of Leeds.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
I said, oh, so am I, so am I.

27:35.000 --> 27:41.000
She said, well, do you know a place called Aquarth? I said, well, yes, it's the village I grew up in.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
And she goes, oh, really? She said, well, I lived on Moor Top in Aquarth.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
I said, well, that's interesting, because I lived on Moor Top in Aquarth as well.

27:51.000 --> 27:57.000
And it turned out, she said, oh, well, you know that big house near to the roundabout.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
There's a, it used to be called, it's now called the Elm Tree Restaurant.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
Well, that was my house when I was a child.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Well, my house is literally joined onto your house.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
It's part, it's the coach house that belonged to your house.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
She goes, oh, the coach house.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
I said, yes.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
So she was, she was literally my next door neighbour.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
Her house was literally physically joined onto the house I grew up in.

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
Surely it has occurred to you that this might not be an ordinary couple.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
It has, while I was actually speaking to you now,

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
it kind of started to dawn upon me.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
I was beginning to think, I was describing the mist and everything.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
And I was thinking to myself, hmm.

28:46.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah, because what she's saying in a way is in code, right?

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
In a way that wouldn't necessarily reveal it.

28:55.000 --> 29:01.000
She's saying, you and I have been associated our entire lives.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Right.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Which is the kind of thing that, for example, the moon might say.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Yes.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Yes.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.000
The moon.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Yes.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And it's very common in.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
Now I'm not making any claims about what took place with you.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Right.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Sure.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
I'm just noticing that.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
It's common in indigenous stories.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
For a very elderly couple to appear.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
Oh, right.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And I didn't know this.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Yes.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Yes.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
Very, very elderly couple appears and they may appear frail or weak.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
And they often look quite old.

29:39.000 --> 29:43.000
And it's, it's very strange to find an elderly couple out in the middle of

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
wherever you were.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Like wandering around in the midst.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
I mean, yeah.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.000
Yeah.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Where, what are they doing?

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
Like, I know what you're doing and you're a young guy and you're,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
you know, you're on a quest.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Yeah.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
And since you're on a quest and you encounter an elderly couple,

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
but in many cases it's not clear to the people at the time.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
At the elderly couple represent the sun and the moon.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
But they often do, right?

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
And it's, it's quite often that.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
The sun may give a gift or the moon may give knowledge.

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
But yeah, it's, I just can't help but notice the strange.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Be like, it's not metaphor.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
There's another word for it that I don't know what it is.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
But the, the, the shape likeness.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
In what she's saying.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Oh, you go through a series of steps.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Right.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Oh, you sound like, oh yes, you, you know, do you know this?

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
You know, and then, and then it just traverses to.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
We've been there the whole time.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Like we've been together the whole time in the strange way.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Right.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Our origins are linked up.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Right.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
So that's very profound.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
And I'm grateful to hear that story.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
I'm glad we glad you came across it.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Please continue.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Yeah.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
A couple of other things have just dawned on me because you've pointed this out.

31:09.000 --> 31:13.000
And that's the wonderful thing about doing these sessions with you is that,

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
you know, all of these new parts of insight suddenly spring up while I'm in the

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
middle of speaking to you.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
So the Pennine Ridge is quite literally, I mean, it's known as the backbone of

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
England.

31:27.000 --> 31:34.000
But what's significant about this from the west to the east is that it's the

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
threshold between them.

31:37.000 --> 31:46.000
So this watershed was quite literally the barrier, the physical barrier that

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
divides Yorkshire from Lancashire.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
So you've heard of the War of the Roses, the red rose and the white rose,

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
but they're quite literally divided by these two sides.

31:57.000 --> 32:02.000
And what's what suddenly came upon me is the fact that the old man was from

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
Lancashire and she was from Yorkshire, which was where I was from.

32:06.000 --> 32:15.000
So so you literally had a Yorkshire man and a Yorkshire woman and a Lancashire

32:15.000 --> 32:21.000
man on this particular threshold between the two halves of the walk.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Yeah, this curious sir and curious sir.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
Yeah, yeah.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
Yeah.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Yeah.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Beautiful.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Interesting.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Interesting.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
It's wonderful to have these conversations just to document this stuff as well,

32:37.000 --> 32:43.000
you know, because this is the thing, you know, when we it's often helpful to have a

32:43.000 --> 32:51.000
companion to lead us along and help with the sort of the sequencing, right?

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
But when you begin to recover, I'll just mention this very briefly.

32:55.000 --> 33:01.000
So yeah, my roommate recently came to me and said, you know, totally up to you

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
if you want to do this, but let's talk if you want, let's record like a life

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
history thing.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
Okay, so we started doing this, not for public sharing or anything for like

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
my own use.

33:11.000 --> 33:16.000
And, you know, all those things started lighting up because you're, you're

33:16.000 --> 33:21.000
resurrecting these moments and they link, they start to link together.

33:21.000 --> 33:25.000
And the whole map starts to light up and that brings to mind perspectives you

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
haven't, you know, perhaps you haven't seen before.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
So let's not get too sidetracked by that.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Please, please continue.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
So you come across the couple.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Go ahead.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Yeah, yeah, I came across the couple.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
And it was on this particular threshold area.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I mentioned it was a watershed as well.

33:45.000 --> 33:52.000
So basically all of the rivers flow, flow down from this place over the

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Pennine Ridge itself.

33:54.000 --> 34:02.000
So, so it's a source of rivers and lakes.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
So where is I going with this?

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
So after this point, of course, you cross over and then you're going into

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
East Yorkshire, into the East part of the country and into Yorkshire.

34:14.000 --> 34:20.000
And then it's from there that you pick up after, after a very small area, I

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
think it's called Appleby, Westmoreland.

34:22.000 --> 34:27.000
Remember, we, we walked through a place called Appleby in Westmoreland.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
And you go through there.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
That was a very beautiful area.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
It was almost like a very Edenic, very, very Edenic kind of feel, very lush

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
and green and full of apple blossoms and apple trees.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
And that was an interesting place as well.

34:45.000 --> 34:52.000
Because that had some resonance later, but I won't talk about that now.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
And then you join on to the beginning of the like wake walk.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
So I think you mentioned a little earlier, tell everyone about the like

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
and the meanings of the words and how you.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Yeah.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
Yeah.

35:04.000 --> 35:12.000
So the like wake walk, like, L, Y, K, E.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
So the like is the corpse itself.

35:16.000 --> 35:22.000
But another interpretation is the double, that which is a like to you,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
that which is like you.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
But if you're departed and if you're, if you're departed.

35:29.000 --> 35:37.000
So in like in the Egyptian cosmology to call it that you have the cat or the mummy,

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
the mummia, the body, the corpse, the like.

35:40.000 --> 35:49.000
And then above that you have the car and the car is like the ghost body.

35:49.000 --> 35:58.000
So the more closer to the ghost body, if you like, so it's the habitual body in

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
the herbalistic terminology, they would call it like the nefesh, the animal soul,

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
that which hangs around the body or hangs around the corpse.

36:08.000 --> 36:16.000
So if you were, say, for example, the like from the point of view of the nefesh or from the point of view of the car,

36:16.000 --> 36:24.000
you would be separated from your physical body but close to it.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.000
So the like is your double, your doppelganger in some sense.

36:30.000 --> 36:37.000
And the wake is like in Irish, you know, in Irish ceremonies when you have somebody who's passed over,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
they hold a wake.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
So the wake is, is the celebration of the person's life.

36:44.000 --> 36:51.000
And you usually have a good old knees up, you know, around the grave of the person.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
It's quite often with the person physically present there in the room.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
So that's the traditional Irish style of having a wake, celebration of the person's life.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Now, this is the like wake walk.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
It covers 40 miles.

37:05.000 --> 37:11.000
And this 40 mile expanse, which 40 miles in itself is obviously heavily symbolic as well,

37:11.000 --> 37:22.000
because it's the number 40 is always linked with passengers of moving from one state to another.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
You have like 40 days and 40 nights in the biblical symbolism.

37:27.000 --> 37:34.000
You have quite often in quite a lot of Tibetan Buddhist internal work,

37:34.000 --> 37:45.000
they have like 40 day passages through dark, through darkness, or should we say a 40, 40 day and 40 night passage through darkness,

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
just total darkness in some of their works.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
With five days on either side.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Right.

37:54.000 --> 38:00.000
As like the lead in, then you have one moon, and then the string out.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Yes.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Similar.

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
It's like a, it's a, it could be understood as a lifespan, even.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
I'm with you.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Please continue.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Yeah.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Yeah.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
I think, I think indeed, indeed.

38:13.000 --> 38:27.000
And so the, it was on this particular part of the walk, the, the like wake walk over this 40 mile expanse,

38:27.000 --> 38:41.000
which, that's where I saw them, where I had my Milky Way experience, which was incredibly profound, incredibly significant for everything that followed.

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
Say a little bit about the experience again, even though I'm sure you have previously.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
I did, but I can go a little more into granular detail this time.

38:50.000 --> 38:56.000
So, so it was the time of year.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Let's see.

38:57.000 --> 39:05.000
It was the beginning of August, end of August, beginning of September.

39:05.000 --> 39:12.000
And this point in time was deliberately chosen because it wouldn't be too seringly hot.

39:12.000 --> 39:20.000
So it was the end of summer coming into, into autumn.

39:21.000 --> 39:33.000
So there was the weather was kind of quite temperate, but I do remember the entire walk up to this point had actually been quite, quite bloody hot actually, all through the Lake District and so on,

39:33.000 --> 39:40.000
apart from maybe some misty and rainy days halfway through on the Pennine Ridge.

39:40.000 --> 39:49.000
So going onto lightweight walk, these incredibly blue, sonic blue sky.

39:49.000 --> 39:56.000
But the lightweight walk itself passes through this 40 mile expanse known as Winnie Moore.

39:56.000 --> 40:06.000
Now Winnie Moore is actually in Old English means the Wine Red Moore, Winnie Wine Red.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
So the Wine Red Winnie Moore.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
So you're passing through the Winnie Moore.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
So it's a form of abyss.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
It's a type of abyssal symbolism.

40:17.000 --> 40:28.000
And what it actually I've later come to understand, what I've actually come to understand it means is that you're actually passing through the menstruation period of the goddess.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Beautiful.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
Because the track takes you through the track of death.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
So it's very Scorpio laden.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
It's very, very scorpionic, Scorpio symbolism, but it's all wine red.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
It's like a menstruation period.

40:43.000 --> 41:03.000
Now this is interesting and it just dawned on me right now as I'm speaking that perhaps this is why and where the goddess symbolism came from that led me out of the dream which is really amazing how that's just dawned on me.

41:03.000 --> 41:13.000
So, truly, you know, I mean, some quite revelatory thoughts come to me even while speaking here now.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
It's so beautiful.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
This is what I'm hoping for, yes.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah.

41:17.000 --> 41:27.000
And the actual track is laden with marker points, marker posts.

41:27.000 --> 41:32.000
And those marker posts are actually carved.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
I have a book with me.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
I'll show you some pictures.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
I'll try and find some pictures.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Yes.

41:38.000 --> 41:48.000
The marker posts themselves are ancient pagan standing stones which mark the track.

41:48.000 --> 42:01.000
Some of them have been turned into some of them have been turned into crosses were carved into Celtic crosses.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Here we go.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
But quite a few of them are still pagan standing stones.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
This is, I don't know if you can see.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
Yes.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
This face, this face here.

42:17.000 --> 42:28.000
And some of them are just many as typical many as so over the 40 mile expanse the way you find your way is by spotting these stones on the hill ridges.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
As you're walking along the track.

42:31.000 --> 42:41.000
And all of the heather, the reason why it's the wine red more is because all of the heather goes sonic purple red.

42:41.000 --> 42:55.000
So with the blue sky and the sonic purple red, the weather had been very much like this clear clear blue, sonic purple red and these standing stones marking the way along the way.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
Some of them are are actually goddess stones as well.

43:00.000 --> 43:05.000
One of them is called fat Betty.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
So.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
So there we have it.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.000
That's actually the destination of where it goes Raven scar.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Right.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
So that's that's the where you actually stop Raven scar.

43:21.000 --> 43:28.000
And the actual emblem for the walking for the lightweight hand with a candle inside.

43:28.000 --> 43:38.000
Interestingly, I decided to light a candle before I actually started this interview.

43:38.000 --> 43:47.000
So, so there you go a little bit more information there for you but it came across to me very much that the wine red more is that is actually the menstruation of the goddess.

43:48.000 --> 43:55.000
That's crucially beautiful. We can return to this topic, but I want to keep on the thread that we're on.

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
And I'm trying to carefully track that. So describe a little bit more about the experience.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
So I'm just going to say something briefly.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.000
Sure.

44:05.000 --> 44:16.000
There was a phase before my own experience where I used to practice a sort of a Tai Chi Chi gum practice actually, where

44:16.000 --> 44:24.000
basically my teacher had taught us to gather up the energy from the earth, bring it up into the body.

44:24.000 --> 44:35.000
Distributed up into the sky, right into the universe, and then draw the universal energy back down into our body and down into the earth.

44:35.000 --> 44:45.000
And basically just you lean over, you picked up the energy bent over you draw it up into your bodies with an in breath.

44:45.000 --> 44:52.000
You, you know, you send it up with an out breath, you draw it back with an in breath, you send it down with an out breath.

44:52.000 --> 45:04.000
Yeah, I added to that practice that I was drawing the love of the planet, all together, all the animals all the living places all the histories that love

45:04.000 --> 45:17.000
energy, and then, you know, sort of like many branches of a tree, sending that love out into the universe, literally saying like we love you we remember you we adore you.

45:17.000 --> 45:27.000
And then the same thing back right we love you we remember you we adore you back into the earth. I used to do this all the time, without having any complex

45:27.000 --> 45:37.000
interaction about it right. And when you talked about your experience with a milky way I was reminded of this was practice.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Right.

45:38.000 --> 45:46.000
So please share whatever comes to mind about the experience.

45:46.000 --> 45:56.000
Yeah, so it's been really hot. I remember during that day.

45:56.000 --> 46:20.000
And there was a, I put up the tent in the middle of this more, and I chose to put the tent in a field at the side of an in. So it was like a pub an in in the middle of nowhere.

46:21.000 --> 46:33.000
And I went into the pub. And in those days I hardly used to drink at all I used to have like lime and soda something like that you know like I wasn't even drinking.

46:33.000 --> 46:57.000
I went into the pub and had a couple of these lime and sodas or whatever. And came back out to the tent. And I was shocked to find that after the sun had gone down that there was a there was a light frost on the ground.

46:57.000 --> 47:20.000
Because the moors out there were very exposed. And there was a couple of other things I learned at that time as well which taught me some really interesting things to do with the action of the sun upon the earth and interacting with the earth and the waters.

47:20.000 --> 47:33.000
Which actually led me to some really, really quite amazing understandings of the the entire process of nature.

47:33.000 --> 47:46.000
I was going to use the word, it taught me quite a lot of the secrets of alchemy, but that sounds really that sounds really grandiose, but I don't have to be too afraid of that.

47:46.000 --> 47:57.000
It truly did. And, and I'll explain a little more of that later, but that day the frost was on the ground.

47:57.000 --> 48:14.000
That evening the frost was on the ground the temperature had dropped quite quite a lot. And because it was so cold, and because the sky was so clear and because there was no light pollution whatsoever.

48:14.000 --> 48:20.000
I looked at the frost crunch crunch crunch feet on the floor crunch crunch crunch.

48:20.000 --> 48:31.000
So my attention was diverted down by the crunching, and then I lifted my head up. I wanted to just instinctively wanted to know what was right above me.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
So crunching feet lifted up the head.

48:35.000 --> 48:41.000
My my the trajectory of my vision literally caught from the very moment my head was lifted.

48:41.000 --> 49:00.000
The whole path of the Milky Way just shot up in front of me and above me all the way behind me and it felt like the entire thing from from right above me right through my feet just like the two things just collided and like like a huge bang.

49:00.000 --> 49:13.000
And this intense visceral feeling of absolute connectivity, like an explosion coming from within the core of me reaching out forever.

49:13.000 --> 49:19.000
Everything met in that moment.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
So there was something really really special about it.

49:24.000 --> 49:29.000
It was like yoga in the true sense of the word.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
True Union.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
So beautiful.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
Yeah, it was it was it really was touching for some reason to hear the story.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Yeah.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
Please continue.

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
Ever since that time.

49:55.000 --> 50:01.000
I've not been able to comprehend anything as separate.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
What a gift.

50:03.000 --> 50:09.000
What a what a healing inversion.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
It also comes with a great price though it seems.

50:13.000 --> 50:21.000
Because the although that's a although that's a huge understanding in and of itself.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
And like you say could be seen to be a gift.

50:25.000 --> 50:31.000
It's it's I think the I think the Buddhist would have called it.

50:31.000 --> 50:37.000
You know, it leads to the vision of universal sorrow.

50:37.000 --> 50:53.000
In the sense that although you you understand the pure joy that's behind everything you can see and sense and this is what led me to that sorrow when I came back to the city.

50:53.000 --> 50:59.000
There was this understanding that everyone is so disconnected from that reality.

50:59.000 --> 51:10.000
And that such great pain and suffering results because of the lack of understanding of the connectivity.

51:10.000 --> 51:17.000
And I understood that all healing is rooted in bringing people back to that sense of connectivity.

51:17.000 --> 51:28.000
Yes, and thus, in some sense, perhaps you will understand I'd be surprised if you didn't what I mean when I say, I'll try.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
I doubt you'll have any trouble.

51:31.000 --> 51:44.000
Many of my closest friends, these are people who I would call bridge bridge souls, right they join, they join to ordinarily disparate.

51:44.000 --> 52:00.000
I'm looking at my reflection it's backwards so my miss using the wrong app. But yeah, they join to ordinarily disparate people's places, histories, futures.

52:00.000 --> 52:07.000
So for example, one of my friends, Ryan first diver, he's a Blackfoot beaver man.

52:07.000 --> 52:18.000
And he's so in the Blackfoot traditional in their in their traditional life, the beaver man is the central ceremonial.

52:18.000 --> 52:24.000
All the all the other societies orbit the beaver bundle tradition.

52:24.000 --> 52:31.000
And so he's, and he's half, you know, he's half Caucasian to so.

52:31.000 --> 52:42.000
So he joins like the colonizers and the Blackfoot people. He also takes care of rattlesnakes there so they are protected there.

52:42.000 --> 52:56.000
So he joins the snake people to the to the regular people he's like this bridge between five or six different things I just use him as an example because he's a great example of this, but many of my close friends are like this there.

52:56.000 --> 53:07.000
They're the between, right, even when you're telling the story you're saying like the sky came down and the earth, and they, you know, they joined, right.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Yeah.

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
So it's a, but say more about.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
Was it painful for you.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
In, in what time what respect.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Right.

53:21.000 --> 53:37.000
You say that you weren't able to see things as separate. And I say that's a gift and you say yes but there's a price. Yes, it seems there is a price and the price have bite in you.

53:37.000 --> 53:45.000
It can do it can do because because sometimes, you know, if sometimes you you can't.

53:45.000 --> 54:03.000
It's what it's quite, it's quite difficult to sometimes see the disconnection the lack of connectivity I think is the way to put it with with certain individuals that you know it's quite painful to see the lack of connectivity that they actually have.

54:03.000 --> 54:14.000
You can, there's nothing you can do the only thing you can do is do things in an incredibly subtle way to help coax people towards this experience or this understanding.

54:14.000 --> 54:25.000
So that brings up a topic that I think you'll that I think is relevant here. Yeah, literally, and as it relates to human communication in general.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Yes.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
The common difference between men and women.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Yeah.

54:34.000 --> 54:45.000
And hypnosis and LP, perhaps mesmerism, but certainly the idea of suggestion, which is something. This is a topic we didn't properly explore previously.

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
One of my bookmarks so I've noticed.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
I've always tended to emulate girls.

54:54.000 --> 55:04.000
When I was in elementary school, they were the high performers, they could do seven things the boys could do to I emulate the girls, right.

55:04.000 --> 55:10.000
And I learned very quickly that that was a much faster path to progress.

55:10.000 --> 55:23.000
And the women are masters of indirection, generally speaking, right. They can suggest very subtly something. They're very cautious about making direct statements because they can then be held the task board later.

55:23.000 --> 55:29.000
And then historically subjected to masculine inquisition.

55:29.000 --> 55:36.000
Every like a billion times per lifetime right every woman, right.

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
Masculine in inquisition.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
You know.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
So,

55:46.000 --> 55:51.000
where am I going with this.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
I myself have realized.

55:54.000 --> 55:59.000
We spoke briefly of this in the last interview, but there are problems with declarative statements.

55:59.000 --> 56:06.000
And what you were saying was essentially what you can do has to be very subtle.

56:06.000 --> 56:15.000
By which you mean indirect and suggestive rather than the typical masculine thing is just to go like, well, of course you just do this.

56:15.000 --> 56:23.000
You just tell them, here's the problem. Here's the solution. Right. The guy, you know, what brings out his toolbox.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
You know, when and often doesn't.

56:26.000 --> 56:37.000
There's no subtlety whatsoever. And there's also no sensitivity to the other person's sort of where they are in the process.

56:37.000 --> 56:43.000
What might be appropriate at this moment or in that in the phase of the process that they're in.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
Yeah. Yeah.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
So yeah, please.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
Anything comes to mind about this.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Well, once again.

56:52.000 --> 57:04.000
I mean, there's two things, obviously there's the therapeutic approaches, there's the actual use of these things for therapy within a therapeutic setting, which is one thing.

57:04.000 --> 57:25.000
And then there's the things that we encounter and the things we experience in daily, everyday life in terms of how we what we see around us, the types of interactions you see amongst people, you know, friends that you may have and so on and so on.

57:25.000 --> 57:36.000
And just generally, I mean, like you say, you've studied language patterns and so on and so forth.

57:36.000 --> 57:47.000
It's amazing how I think I think NLP just to talk about that for a moment that really highlighted.

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
You know, the old saying the map is not the territory.

57:52.000 --> 58:12.000
It's kind of what I'm talking about that disconnect that some individuals have between what's going on in their own minds and how they choose to communicate those ideas and such things, simple things as the art of conversation and so on.

58:13.000 --> 58:23.000
It seems, I don't know if I'm right or wrong by saying this, but I've noticed a marked increase.

58:23.000 --> 58:40.000
I'd be interested in your opinion on this, a marked increase in a kind of almost a fragmentation of the ability to communicate in a meaningful manner, in a way whereby individuals can actually have meaningful conversations,

58:40.000 --> 58:46.000
where people have the ability to listen and have the ability to speak and be heard.

58:46.000 --> 59:02.000
These, this cross flow, this dance, which seemed to be so much part of everyday life seems to be becoming rarer and rarer, I would say in the last three or four years.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
And I don't know if that's experiencing this.

59:06.000 --> 59:14.000
Yeah, there's some kind of a, you know, my friend was using the phrase positive disintegration.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Right.

59:15.000 --> 59:20.000
I'm not sure it's positive. There's certainly a disintegration going on.

59:20.000 --> 59:25.000
And I would, you know, we can talk about this.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
I want to be careful to preserve the threads.

59:28.000 --> 59:52.000
I, so one of the things I pay attention to is a neologism that occurred to me at the beginning of my experience of whatever it was I experience was where I imagined the network of human minds as an as a place as a physical environment.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
And I call that the human cognizium.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
There are cognizia all around us that feed into ours.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:11.000
But the human cognizium is undergoing a series of what look like catastrophic fragmentations to me.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Yeah.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And that's being reflected in dissonance in human communication, and particularly in our perceptions related. I mean, this is kind of a running joke at the moment, but in our perceptions related to identity.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Right.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Someone is what something is why it's function.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And I was talking with a friend last night, and we often have very playful, revelatory conversations.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And I suggested to him that without us knowing it over the past few years, the world is no longer the world.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Like it's a completely different thing.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Now, it looks the same on the outside.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000
It seems to be, we all think it's the same thing, but it's not that thing anymore. It's a different thing.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:17.000
And so we were sort of playfully, I was suggesting that we could experiment by sending signals to the world, like pinging it, like in a submarine, right?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:27.000
When you ping another submarine, you could ping the world and see what it brings back so that you could get a sense of what whatever it has become or what it is becoming.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Yeah.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Well, I think that that's to some extent what we're kind of doing now is.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Yes, yes.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:56.000
The part of the thing that's certainly driving me on to speak about these things and maybe driving you on to speak about these things is because it feels like an important time to speak of these things in a way where one hopes others are going to be giving us some feedback with

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
regards to what's going on.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Yes, drawn into the conversation and fascinated and curious and have a sense of wonder and exploration with us.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Absolutely.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Yes, yes.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:15.000
As if maybe we are, what, I can't quite find the word.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:23.000
It's strange because in a way you can, I imagine something actually this, I don't know why but it's bringing, it makes me feel tearful.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I imagine two magicians, not that I'm claiming to be one or that you claim to be one, but I imagine two magicians playfully getting together on stage.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And embodying the curiosity and passion and life paths of the audience without the magicians themselves knowing it, right?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:58.000
And then engaging in this play on the stage that enlightens the magicians as the avatars of the audience, something like this, right?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And what a beautiful, what a beautiful, like ecstatic figure.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Thank you.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And I feel that we're at a very, very interesting time.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Most definitely certainly a very, very interesting time because I think I'm not sure if I remember, if I actually said this to you last time or whether I said it to you in private on another occasion, but I really feel like we're at a really, really important point in terms of this communication we're speaking about.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Yes.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Communicating ideas. There's something really quite important about this type of work, you know, sharing these things that we're doing right now. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:54.000
You know, I'm sure you wouldn't be here either doing what you're doing if you didn't feel this, this same, almost a duty to be speaking.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Emergency.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Literally, it's an emerge and see, right? It's an emerge and see.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Right.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Emergency.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yes.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Yes.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And yes, it is. It does seem very urgent and very, there are many people who are, they are dying inside. They're, they're completely lost, you know, and I'm not entirely free of that myself.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Right.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I think all of us are to some extent, you know, experiencing the hardships of the age that we're living with it. That's for sure.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Yes.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I think many would be very, would possibly be foolish to say they're not, but at the same time, I think it's a really, really, a really incredibly hopeful time.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:55.000
There's a time where some, some incredible new points. There's a type of regeneration that seems to be taking place at the moment.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And I feel a new opening for these types of explorations in a way that I've never quite seen to this extent before.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I really do. I really feel like we're, we're on without claiming to be in any sense, you know, grandiose or an expert on these subjects. I'd just say, very happy to be part of opening the conversation.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Yes, I agree. And I don't, I mean, one of the things that I'm learning more about that it's been clear to me as an artist for a long time is that personal identity is kind of a trap.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Right.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:46.000
So, the, the, yes, I understand. Obviously, I have some concern about Darren and his life and his whatever, right? His opportunities and so forth.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:53.000
But it's much more fascinating at the layers above Darren and beneath Darren. Yeah, yeah.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
They're together. Right. Yeah.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:11.000
You know, something very strange is going on. I made a recording recently where I, where I said, I think the recording is just called 2024 is not a year.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:25.000
It's like, there's no more of whatever the hell was going on before has been thrown up into the suspended sort of cloud storm state, and nobody understands what the hell is going on anymore.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Or if they do, it's just because they're clinging to the teddy bear of their previous suppositions about the world like desperately.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:48.000
But yeah, it really is something profound because on the one hand, there's all these new opportunities. And on the other hand, there's this catastrophic and agonic, you know, dissolution and pain and death.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:58.000
So yeah, I don't want to use the trope from Shakespeare. So I'll just suggest that without saying it.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Okay, so there's so much more. And by the way, how are we doing on time? I'm fine, but I want to I'm okay. I'm okay for for time at the moment as well. Yeah.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I think I'm excited to continue.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Okay, so what happened that night, the frost.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
You look up the thing the whole thing. Yeah, yeah, as I explained.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
What was I feeling at that moment?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:33.000
What was I feeling? As I say, just just this incredible, energetic connectivity.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And, and I felt like I was touching eternity, quite literally like touching eternity.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And that experience, strangely, I had.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I kind of discovered how to switch it back on at will.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Oh, beautiful.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
But this came much later.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Whenever I did switch it on at will, it reminded me immediately of that moment once again, you know, so like immediate recognition of that experience.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:26.000
So that what I'm referring to is, and this touches on the courses that I do and things like this back here in England, I do them elsewhere occasionally if people ask me as well but

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
they're very important about those.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Yeah, yeah, so like I, I do.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Every year, I try to do one, maybe two courses in usually they're advertised as mesmerism fascination presence.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I mean, this is how you and I connected.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Yeah, good.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I think I said on part part one of this that it was about about nine years ago or so that we actually first connected but I think it was more than that was

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I think it was more like 12 actually I started doing I started doing those courses about 12 years ago now.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Mesmerism fascination presence so obviously the thing I do sort of every year is hold these courses mesmerism is a for those who don't know is a type of hypnosis is an earlier type of hypnosis more of

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000
a nonverbal form of hypnosis.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:38.000
And it was popularized by France on Tom Mesmer, hence the term mesmerism.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
When was he active.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Yeah, so this was sort of in the in the 1700s so mid 1700s.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And it was just prior to the French Revolution actually he was around just prior to the French Revolution doing a lot of his work.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
He was connected with some quite interesting people.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:12.000
I don't know if you know this but he was he had his a thing called the glass almonica, which was an actual instrument.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Yes, I know about this instrument.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And the classical piece of music Moonlight Sonata was written for this instrument.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Yeah, so what this is is it's a series of rings glass.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Yeah, it's like a it's like a plate with a with a ring around the edge of the plate to sort of, and these are put on a spindle.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And it's a call it's a cone.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Yes, perhaps there are either pedals or keys pedals.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Yeah, pedals and then and then a little tray of water to dip your fingertips in that you can actually rub on to the.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Okay.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yeah, so the spindle spins and you get the sound that's like what you get when you circle a crystal bell or glass.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Precisely, precisely.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Yes, profoundly non ordinary sound.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Absolutely.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
It's like a harmonic.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:21.000
It's almost like being able to play an instrument that only produces harmonics, which themselves are kind of a magical thing.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Absolutely.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And so and so like I say Moonlight Sonata was composed with this instrument in mind.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And then and then Benjamin Franklin actually gifted this instrument he had one made and gifted it to Mesma.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Oh, wow.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Yeah, there's one in London actually there's there's a Franklin Museum I think in London and there's an example of it there.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I've never seen one.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Have you seen one?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Like I say, there's actually been one.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:03.000
There's one on display there in London, or there was some years ago.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I spent a long, long time since I've seen it, but there was there was actually a model of it.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I don't want to branch, but I'm curious.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Have you ever been in a place where one is being played?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I haven't heard one being played.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I have to say no, no.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
But you have heard recordings of them.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Oh, yes, for sure.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Me too.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.000
I remember this and just being blown away and thinking like I must find a way to have one of these when I first heard it.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Yeah.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Well, the thing is, is the actual tones themselves.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Mesma believed that the tones themselves catapulted the individuals who heard them because of the tones actually activated certain states or trans states in themselves.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Yeah.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
The tones themselves activated some of these states.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
So, so that's interesting.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Yes, I have a sort of peculiar personal sensitivity to anything that produces a non ordinary effect or, you know, like in terms of Stephen King's book like the shining.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Certain features are facets of reality.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
They don't. It's not like a visual shine.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
There's like a spiritual shine to them.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
They resonate.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
They ring.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Right.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
You can tell like, oh, here's one of the hidden keys.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Yeah.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And two very obvious features of this for me that were apparent in childhood were spiders and they make what they're making of webs.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Right.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Just watch them make what is going on there.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:41.000
There's some that's you could study just that one thing and it would lead you everywhere you needed to go.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Right.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It's like a master key to every library hidden in an organism.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Yes.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And then similarly, another place where a similar key is hidden, a living key is in the praying mantises.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Ah, yes.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I've noticed you're particularly keen on mantises.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
But let's not branch too far.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So what were met?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
What were the precursors that led Mesmer to his discoveries?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Do you think?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Right.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Okay.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:30.000
So when Mesmer was, um, I think when Mesmer's career was just beginning, when he was first, he was first introduced to the concept of magnetism from a priest.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I forget the name of the priest.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Fair enough.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Um, but he introduced him the concept of magnetism and he utilised actual magnets.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Wow.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
On different points of the body.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Uh-huh.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Though some esoteric priests have actually done this and used this therapy in different ways.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
But of course you and I both know that the power isn't necessarily in the magnets, is it?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
No.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Okay, please continue.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Yeah.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:22.000
So Mesmer himself, um, you know, quickly jumped the use of the magnets and, uh, sort of really concentrated more on the natural ability that we all have as individuals.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:31.000
They call it animal magnetism because of the fact that the animal kingdom exhibits this force in abundance.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.000
But we humans kind of don't seem to believe we have it, but clearly we do.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And certain individuals seem to have had it in historical epochs, perhaps more than others.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And there are famous examples of this.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And so, you know, some people, they thought of it as charisma or something like this, um, which itself, you know, the word charisma relates to the golden anointing.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:15.000
So, uh, so, so this force is something all individuals have at different levels.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
So it's a natural ability, natural ability.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I would suggest that, um, if you wanted to see a clear example of it that's commonly accessible, the gaze of infants.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Oh, yes.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Right.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I think they're actually surprised.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I think the infants can be surprised when it fails.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Right.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Right.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Because they know, they seem to know that it works.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:55.000
But yes, match gaze with an infant or a very young child, and you will see directly an example of the kind of thing I think you're talking about.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000
And I would also suggest that praying mantises are doing something very similar.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Right.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:09.000
There's a reason why a creature this big can terrify a grizzly bear.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Right.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Right.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
And then it's screaming for the woods, you know.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Right, right.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
It's not an accident and it's not just a visual display.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Yeah.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Yeah.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Please continue.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000
So, um, so basically, uh, where was I going with this?

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Well, you said that certain people were clearly more so.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Animal magnetism, the humans don't necessarily believe they have it, but we do.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.000
And some people either have sort of a greater capacity and or develop it.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Right.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Yeah.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
So, so it's something that is, is there in abundance in the animal kingdom.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I was talking about the example of snakes on the previous part we were doing, you know, and basically it's not just.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Not just the vision, not just the gaze that they exert, but it's also everything else.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:12.000
It's the actual awareness of the physicality of their existence in this present moment.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:22.000
So this is where we link back to the Milky Way experience because the key component is the physical presence.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:35.000
The key component that empowers all of those other techniques is the physical moment by moment awareness of your existence or of each one of our existence.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:51.000
So by contacting that, we generate through the conscious awareness of our physical existence, we generate a kind of a field and we, and we switch it on.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And that experience that I had with the heavens and the earth and me sandwiched or hit between them was very much a moment where crunching of the feet, the stars above my head, me between the biting of the chill of the air on what had been a really hot day.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Yeah.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
It's like a rod ringing.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Yes.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Yes.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000
It's, it's the origin world and the physical earth.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Yes.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Eating and sort of mating and resonating.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Yeah.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Yes.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Absolutely.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Absolutely.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
So I was talking about the alchemical components of this.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And of course the actual earth that I was walking upon at that particular point in the path was pure Pete.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:57.000
So the Moorlands have the blackest Pete I've ever seen in my life.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And like I say, even at certain other points like the Pennine Ridge, you'd be walking on the Pete on that particular part of the walk.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:19.000
You'd be walking upon the Pete and the black soil of the Pete, which the Egyptians used to call chem, by the way.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So chem, K-H-E-M.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Which chemet comes from.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Which chemet comes from.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:36.000
So it was the actual residue cast up from the Nile over and over again would bring all of this fertile Pete onto the surface or the silt.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
So that would be the thing that would give the fertility and bring the fertility to the land.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And of course the likewise.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Almost like a menstrual exudate of the river.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Yes.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Yes.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Yes.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Exactly this.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Exactly this.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Exactly this.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:05.000
So you have the Nile delta with this, you say, you know, with this exudate coming out and fertilizing all of the land around it.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Oh my God.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
We're starting to get all Egyptian again here.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Yeah.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
We're talking about this fragmentation.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:21.000
And of course the fragmentation and the whole art of healing is to bring back together that which is scattered.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:30.000
So the body of Osiris, of course, represents like all the shamanic myths, you know, the body is scattered to the four winds, so to speak.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:53.000
And Isis was the one that got the separation from the land, turned herself into the hawk, looked down upon the land and discovered the fragments scattered across the land and brought them back together again to actually make the first mummy, which was the resurrection of Osiris from the world of the dead.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It strikes me that the Eye of Toth is actually related to the Eye of the Kestrel.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Right.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Little hawk.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
The Desert hawk.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Right.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Which you can't really see it, but this image is an image, a very complex magical image of Kestrel.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Inside the frame behind you.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Yes.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Yes.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:37.000
It also implies rising above the human or even the temporal, right, into the what might, what Oman Hillman calls the aonic life.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Right.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:49.000
It's not just outside of location in space. It's outside of location in time. And from there, you can find all the pieces.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Yeah.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Speak.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And again, now here again, we have this concept of the bridge being.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Absolutely.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:13.000
The bridge being who becomes sort of a linchpin above all of these fragments, linking them together and then perhaps drawing them back down into a being, a situation, a place, the healing.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Please continue.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Well, exactly.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:26.000
What are my big questions today was basically, okay, so what is healing anyway, in its truest sense, you know, we can have some

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:38.000
fairly simple examples like, oh, you know, you want to heal bad eyesight, you want to heal, I don't know, a throat condition or something like that.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
We've got these small examples of healing.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:55.000
But of course, the healing we're, we're speaking of really when we're speaking of sacred healing is we're talking about like, it's an overused term, but you know, making something, bringing the holism, bringing the, the bringing

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
something back to a sense of holiness.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
There is also a feature of an amnesis.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
You're right.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Yes.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Forgetting.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Yes.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000
No, not everyone knows this, but the word lethal that comes from the River Lefe.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Right.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Yes, in between our lives. And there's, there's a bunch of sort of narratological arcs around why we here on earth forget our previous incarnations or perhaps embodiments.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:51.000
So yes, there's an unforgettable aspect, because it's weird, you know, it's almost as if in some of us in some features of our lives, we specifically bury some part of us that is fragmented by a situation.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And then we enact a drama.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Personally, a personal drama, I have done this right, it's embarrassing, but I know I'm aware of it.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
We humans are sometimes embarrassing.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
It's true.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:16.000
So I will enact a drama about the part of myself that I dissociated from and hid from.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And the drama is very mythic.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Yeah.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Yeah.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
In transactional analysis.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
There's a concept of life scripts.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Yeah.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Right, which, which are coping mechanisms often established in childhood that are useful, sort of fairy tale ish. Right.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:50.000
But when they are not conscious in our adult lives when when they're no longer really necessary and we have the capacity to negotiate and work with what's actually going on.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:56.000
It's helpful for us to make conscious this life script, this mythic story that we've been playing out.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000
And perhaps rewrite it.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Yeah.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And the thing is, of course, you know, if we go into the much, much bigger wider, wider picture, you know, I mean, I've said and this leads on to a lot of the things I was going to say about the the hill.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:32.000
I was talking about it all points to and leads to many details, which confirmed for me in various ways.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:41.000
The threads, the connective threads to actually weave me back to my previous incarnations, so to speak.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
And this is where this becomes really important.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:27:05.000
And this is where I gain this peace and faith, for want of a better word, of this process that whenever I receive any of these pieces, whenever I receive any of these fragments,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I don't worry about chasing them, because I know, I absolutely know that all I have to do is wait.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Because there's going to be a time where, like I said with the individual that I met over a coffee table who told me the name I knew with certainty, I wasn't even looking for it.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I knew with certainty that this was the name and I knew at that moment that all I have to do is call on that name.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:46.000
And I didn't chase it.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:57.000
And all these little fragments that I've parked on the shelf and just bookmarked them, put them on the shelf and waited.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:20.000
What it is, is it's all the fragments that I know, that as long as I keep myself open to all of these possibilities, that everything that is, that belongs to my trajectory, my journey through time and eternity, is all going to come to me.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I don't think the purpose of our current incarnation is necessarily to chase after all of these missing fragments, but they play a really important part and they will come to us anyway.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:56.000
So sometimes I might wake up and be woken up by a repeat, I will be repeating to myself a specific set of words or a specific word.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And sometimes it's not even, it's in a language I don't even know what it is.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:10.000
The important thing is, is that I remember it, I write it down and it sticks with me.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.000
The other important thing about these things is because they're explained later.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And sometimes each one of these phrases and words are like a key that opens up a whole insight into another area.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:32.000
But sometimes it takes five, seven years before I get the next part.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:39.000
So I'm just sharing with you how for me these things work.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:30:01.000
These little fragments which seem to belong to a, I'm sort of lost for words, but like a kind of fragmenting, fragments of like a weaving tapestry that belongs to many other incarnations that have existed from times before.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:09.000
So there's a, there's a, what a figure that perhaps might be useful or helpful here.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Yeah, call it the starry blanket.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:23.000
And one can imagine that over time, many lives, they are sewing in a sense in the sense of like needlework.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:32.000
They're sewing a sort of a celestial blanket with acts of beauty and intelligence and courage and rescue and healing.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And that our souls are actually drawn from stars in this blanket. Many of them, right?

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:47.000
So our soul isn't one thing. It's like a set of connections between historical beings and places and moments and such.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
And then as we live, we are adding to this blanket, right?

01:30:51.000 --> 01:31:00.000
And it might seem fragmentary from down here where the star and that star and the moon and that planet and so forth.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
But from up there, it's not fragmentary.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
No, no.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000
It's fragmentary because of our relationship with linear time, I think primarily.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:15.000
That's right. That's right. Absolutely right. Yeah, because of our relationship with linear time.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
This is the thing that you doubt.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Yes, yes.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
You learn to doubt, right?

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:32.000
And that's why you're not concerned with urgencies when you find the fragment, you place it on the shelf, you know linear time is an illusion.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
That's it.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:41.000
So over you'll you will traverse the illusion of linear time and the integration will naturally.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:47.000
That's it. That's it. I couldn't I couldn't have put it better myself.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:32:01.000
But you've put into words what I kind of viscerally feel because it is a feeling, you know, it's a feeling that there is no need to, you know, there is no need to be too concerned.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:13.000
About it. Although like we said earlier, there is a certain there is a feeling of a sense of urgency right now in in some of the things we're discussing and communicating and sharing.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I understand your point of view on that.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:23.000
But for me personally, in relation to these experiences.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:40.000
It comes across to me personally in very much a way where it's like, right, okay, okay, I'm just getting another little, little bit of confirmation of my want of a better word.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:49.000
My connection with eternity.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I mean, connection is not essentially, it's more your identity as in eternity.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Yeah, yeah, like you and eternity are the same thing, even though there's the Milky Way, and there's Lee.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
It's true for all of us.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Yes, it is. But you and it's so profound because when, like, in our conversation now, you have to disparate sort of wanderers right and they both had these long paths but when they come together there's this profound

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000
conversation.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Which is a kind of a musical composition.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:54.000
The language, the spoken language of which is in a sense the least important thing, even though it's the, it's, it's the glass harmonica of our souls, sort of resonating back and forth.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Yes, yes.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I want to return to something you were speaking about earlier unless there's something urgently in that you need to share right now.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
No, no, please, please go ahead.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Okay, so what is the gaze.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Yeah, we've been taught and I'm sure you'll, you'll have some things to add here but I want to introduce this topic.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:32.000
We've been taught that that what we see is passive, right, that our eyes are receptors for light, that all that's happening in vision is that we receive the reflected light of things around us and the brain organizes that into a

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:45.000
sort of a picture in consciousness right it flips it over on the back the retina we know we have the scientific explanation of the mechanics of human vision.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
So for most of human history.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:54.000
None of that was what was being understood the Greeks were absolutely aware.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:06.000
And I can't explain the complexities of their awareness and understanding of this fact, but that that the eyes project.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Participatory.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Just as in just as when you speak, my ear rings, and I hear something very similar is happening with vision it is kind of a, a speaking of energies into the world, which then press and touch in their various intentional ways.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:46.000
The power, or the cloud, or the ball, and then this returns the, the, the, the sort of resonance of how we reached out to touch, and the purposes for which we reached out to touch affect the world, and this effect returns to us as vision.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Now, yes, say one more thing before I hand this over to you because I'm desperately curious about what you think about these things.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I've had the experience of waking up in my bed, looking around my room, seeing how things are laid out my girlfriend next to me on the bed, the shape of her hair on the pillow and so forth.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:12.000
And then realizing that my eyes are closed.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Yeah, yeah, and opening my eyes and having nothing effectively changed except a feature of the feeling of the origin of the seeing.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Yes, yes.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
So it's very clear to me that it is possible to see without eyes.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Yes.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Now, I'll hand this over to you and whatever.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Yeah, I'd love to get it.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Yes, yes.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Well, if we refer back to part one of the conversation we had last time, we were talking about the sun, you know, and we were talking about where is the sun.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.000
You know, we can point to it in the sky and all of this sort of stuff.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
And yeah, there's the sun and the rest of it.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:58.000
But like we were talking about seeing the sun in dreams, feeling the sun upon your skin in dreams and so on.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And where is the sun in a dream?

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
You know, it's like, where is it?

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Where is the sun you actually see?

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Where is it?

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
You know, where is it?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Also, the whole notion of the heliocentric theory and the geocentric theory, you know, is the Earth in the center?

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Does one go around the other or is it the other going around the other?

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Well, yes, both are true.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000
And so we're back to that old quandary again.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:37.000
And what you've just been describing is I'll bring your attention to a very strong symbol that many may be aware of or may have seen.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000
And that's the image of some of the images of Akhenaten.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:58.000
So you have that famous image of Akhenaten, sometimes with the Arten itself, the sun, his version of Ra, or the solar god, the Arten, with its various rays with hands on the end.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Each ray has got a hand on the end.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Oh yes, yes, yes, the sun and then the rays.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
The rays with hands.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
The rays with hands.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
The ray has like a hand.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Hand on the end, yeah.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
It's sort of like this or something, right?

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
If I remember correctly.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Yeah, that's right.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:25.000
So it's a sun with a splay of different rays and each ray has got a hand on the end of each ray.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:41.000
And sometimes you see, I've seen images of Akhenaten and Nefertiti with rays coming, literally coming out of their eyes, like similar, you know, like rays jutting out of their eyes.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:54.000
So this touches on a lot of the things you're speaking about in regards to

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Is the manifest and does the manifestation come from within out?

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Is it that light which reaches out into space only forms images when it has something, you know, when it has something to bounce off.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:22.000
In the same way as the sun sends out rays to say, for example, the moon and the moon gives the reflection of the light.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Everything we see from the old perspective, you were mentioning the Greeks, but also the Egyptians, there was this notion that everything that was projected from within out, so to speak.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
You have an image here.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Yes.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
That's it.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Of Nefertiti and Akhenaten.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And the, yeah, so you have the the art in with all of the rays coming out and you can't see it too well but on the ends of those rays, you have each one of the rays has got a hand on the end.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Yeah, and she's got a child in her lap.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
That's right.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Yeah.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
That's right.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Very peculiar.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Yes.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Very profound.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Absolutely.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Okay, so I didn't mean to interrupt.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:21.000
So with the gaze itself, all of these things you're talking about come into play.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:36.000
The gaze is not a, if the one who is practicing can truly step inside this, this way that you've just described, this particular perspective, for one's better word.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:49.000
If the practitioner can step inside that and then experience that, then there is the opportunity for that to take place.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Oh, there's so much here.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
The recipient would be the passive one.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Yes, but it's also resembles the relation where, okay, this is just something that's occurring to me.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:13.000
If the practitioner becomes the point of origin, not the sun as hypostasis, but the origin of why there is a sun.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Right.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Right.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And then the patient, so to speak, becomes sort of like the earth or something illumined.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Or the moon.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Yes, exactly.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Precisely.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Illumined by that.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And so this ancient, originary role, not a play, but a role embodiment.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Yeah.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Right.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Sort of naturally and in a way, magnetically.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Yes.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Yes.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Because of the ancientness of these roles.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Yes.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Please continue.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Well, yes.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I mean, what you were saying about, you know, one being literally like a sun, the other being like a moon.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:08.000
You literally create that polarity between the practitioner and the subject.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000
There has to be that polarity created.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:20.000
And it has to be something which is done in a very, I keep using the word in a very visceral manner.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:42.000
So when an animal is exuding this force, like a snake, for example, or a lion or something like this or some other beast, it's actually, it's actually doing it usually with the intention of it being almost like it's going to catch its prey, so to speak.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:49.000
It has to find a way to, in a sense.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I'm trying.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I'm not very, very good at finding words today, but in a sense, it literally plummets that the recipient into a complete trance just for a moment often.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:15.000
And it's that, that state that the recipient falls into that the hunter, so to speak, uses to its advantage.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Okay, I want to say a few things here briefly.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:33.000
In nature, those of us who are sensitive to sentience, consciousness, awareness, intelligence, particularly, we'll see different forms of intelligences embodied in nature.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:45.000
For example, in the eyes of a cow, it's not the same as looking in the eyes of a raccoon, or it's not the same as looking in the eye of a praying mantis, it's not the same as looking in the eye of a cat.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:44:04.000
The snake's eye is a very particular thing, but one of the best examples of what you're talking about is utilized, because it's really obviously a human can easily see it on film, is what a cuttlefish does when it is hypnotizing a shrimp.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:26.000
I see pulses of colorful light traversing the skin of the cuttlefish in an increasing frequency, and you see the shrimp actually start to just sort of float off and then, you know, and then when he grabs it, right?

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000
For the praying mantis, what it does is this kind of thing.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:37.000
It will weave slowly, and then very rapidly, and then strike.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
That's it, just like a snake.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
It's very similar.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
There are forms of martial art that are not the similar.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
That's right.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.000
In martial art, the goal is to hide the, it's to hide the build up, right?

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000
You don't want the build up to be seen.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
So the build up becomes internal.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Right, right.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Like you say, visceral.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Please continue.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Yeah, this is right.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:14.000
And when the individual is practicing with fascination techniques, the gaze techniques, it's very subtle.

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:25.000
This is something, obviously, if I was working with someone directly and teaching them, teaching them exactly how to do this, there is a certain way to do it.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000
And so often you have to demonstrate it on the person you're trying to teach, of course.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:36.000
You know, you have to demonstrate it directly to them so that they actually grasp what it is you're actually doing.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Once they've been on the sort of recipient end of it, then it's my job to actually get that individual to replicate that effectively.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:46:02.000
So I would then coach that individual into how to actually replicate that properly and teach them all the little tips on what to look for, precisely what to look for, to know that it's being done properly.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:08.000
And that's the important thing, is teaching them exactly what to look for.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Because there are certain signs that it's being done properly.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Yes.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Unmistakable, you might say.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Uh-huh.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:25.000
It's different from hypnosis, but there are signs also in the client in hypnosis.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Yes.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Yes, this is very true.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Often you can see the pulse in someone's neck.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
You can see it slow.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.000
You can see the relaxation of the facial muscles.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000
You can detect the shoulders may drop slightly.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
The breathing changes.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:50.000
These are hard to see over a camera, but when you're in person with someone, they're relatively easy to see.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I'm sure there are different signs for the success of mesmerism, but there's another principle I want to speak briefly about here.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:18.000
And before I continue, I just want to say, I think that sometimes when people are listening to me speaking, they may have the impression that I'm reading from the book of what I already know.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Right.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Because this is what it is common for us to think when people speak.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:33.000
They, that they are saying things they already know.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
They have known before.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000
And in our conversation, much of what is taking place is not that.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.000
It is something very strange is happening where.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
My awareness.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000
It feels like is touching a nonverbal mirror in you.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Right.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000
And I'm able to somehow coalesce.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:03.000
It's like the thing we were talking about with, with seeing, I can less the reflection.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:10.000
And then I can begin to articulate what I am feeling or seeing, which is not something I have known before.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Or articulated before.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Right before.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
So this is what is so beautiful and exciting.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Part of what is so beautiful or exciting for me.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000
As well as the an amnoetic.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Reweaving of histories and, and potentials and seeing.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000
The thing I wanted to mention is that.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Again, my friend Ryan first diver who.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:47.000
You know, certainly doesn't consider himself a magician, but the path of a black foot ceremonial person is involved with something.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
They don't have the concept for magic.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
There's lots of words in English.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
They don't even have a concept for it.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
And their treatment of identity is so different.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:01.000
From ours, that the idea of concrete identity basically doesn't exist.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000
So you see a person, it's not necessarily that person.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Right.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.000
They don't just presume, oh, it's that person.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Because you could be coming from the sun, or you could be coming from the land, or you could be coming from another tribe.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:22.000
So your identity is in how you relate rather than in your visage and, you know, your name badge or whatever.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
As it is in the West.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Right.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:31.000
We just know we think, oh, that's Joe, you know, I was taught to not think that way.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:36.000
And during my experience, I was taught to very carefully.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Participatorially establish our identities together rather than presume them.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:48.000
But there's two principles that I think are relevant, perhaps to hypnosis and maybe mesmerism.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And one is similitude, the resemblance.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Right.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Resembling.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:00.000
When you say like, I get them to emulate me.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Right.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
That's the similitude principle.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Right.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Well, there is, it can never be truly emulated because it's such an infinitely variable and minuscule actual thing that takes place.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:25.000
But yes, you're on the right track and it's definitely there is definitely a similitude and.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
And there is something.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
It's something you can replicate.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Yeah, it's not emulation that leads to success. It's emulation that gives that maybe communicates the form and then the form has to be embodied.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Yes, yes.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I think that that is successful or not.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000
But then the other principle is I think is quite trippy is contagion.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I'm going to actually use the word transmission, actually.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Fair enough.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Because because there's the principle of transmission is something that's very real when you're working with the type of thing that I'm talking about, because it's something which is, which is coursing through you.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:22.000
It's almost connecting to a field of connecting to a field of information that exists out there beyond us.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:40.000
So if it's coming through me, and I know how to actually, and I successfully or, you know, enable this to be transmitted to the individual that I'm working with, then it's by the very nature of this energetic field starting to connect.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:56.000
One will connect to that continuum, which links through all of my own experiences somehow, and it actually is transmitted to the individual who, who I'm working with.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Yes, so when you say this continuum, so to speak, it's almost as if not just your history, but the lineages that feed in your history.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Yes, go into the other person and as a seed sort of and begin to light up and expand. And I'm not trying to couch our discussion in terms of concepts from, for example, traditional Blackfoot ceremony, but crucially in their way of life.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:40.000
They have this concept that is more primordial than the other two that I was just using, which are similitude and contagion. And obviously those are English words.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
It's transfer.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:53:08.000
You know, in English, we might call it initiation, but it's much more intimate than this. It's literally both something being placed into you, and also you being drawn into a lineage history that you now become a family member of, so to speak.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:29.000
So we can bring this analogy to say, for example, when somebody is in certain types of tradition where you have, say, for example, the laying on of hands as an actual transmission, it's similar to this.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:42.000
There is something that is transmitted through time from lots of different individuals who have existed physically, but maybe don't exist physically anymore.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:49.000
However, they're present in you at the moment that you transmit to the next person.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Yes.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:54:13.000
And you, in the future, when you're no longer this incarnate in the normal sense, will be transmitted through your, you know, the connection you had, you have added to that continuum of energy, amplified it in some measure, and then that's added to what's passed down to the future generations.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Yes.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:30.000
So there is a type of transmission that we're speaking of here. And initiation, as you say, it's all, these are all relevant terms, maybe not always satisfactory words, but, you know, they don't have the same idea.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.000
I think the concepts are easily understood. I just want to share a couple of other things briefly.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:49.000
When I began to study Tai Chi, I studied it before with it with a teacher and then I lost my form and there's a whole adventure behind that, but I found these five older men who were practicing every morning and maybe end to teach me.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Yeah.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:55:02.000
And I was very passionate about this, right? And pretty soon, within about three months, about three months in, I started having dreams. I had three or four of them.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:14.000
In which a group of older Asian men would come and they would just straight up tell me, you know, we've heard that, you know, we've heard about you and we're here to check you out.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Yeah.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Want to see, like, who are you? You know, what are you for real? You know, either kind of person we would want to join the family, you know, this kind of thing. And thankfully, in those cases, it worked out well for me.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:42.000
There was a similar thing that happened when I experienced a transfer from Blackfoot culture where, and it was much more profound and like primordial.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:59.000
And there were, there were like hundreds of men, warriors and bound ceremonial elders and stuff that came. There was this quest. There were all these amazing features that were nothing like a regular dream.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Right.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Very obviously, something's going on here. So I just, I just wanted to share that because it might help people to understand what is meant by joining a lineage or being introduced or having a transmission.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Right. It really is to become a part of a lineage and a family.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:42.000
And to be checked out, right? To be sort of, you know, tested. Like, are you, are you for real? You want to sell this? What do you want? You know, actually, often there's a question when you meet a non-ordinary being or intelligence, they may praise you, right?

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:50.000
They'll sort of, they may sort of build you up and say, oh yeah, you're really cool. We like you, blah, blah, blah. And so we're going to give you a gift. And what do you want?

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Sorry, because they're really trying to figure out, are you, are you selfish?

01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Yeah, right.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Right. Are you selfish? It's really kind of the question. And by the way, that question leads to a ladder of other questions.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Yes.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:13.000
That's the first question, right? I think. But yes, please continue.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000
And how are we doing? How are we doing on time? How are you?

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I think I can do maybe, maybe about another 10 minutes or something like that, more or less, on this occasion.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:42.000
So, I'm just trying to work out where we were because, so really, to me, all I'm trying to find a way to sort of conclude it on this, on this occasion.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000
So,

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Yeah, I mean, we can have, we can hopefully we'll have further explanation.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Yeah, well, well, you know, like I say, when, when I've got the ability to make it coincide with everything I've got going on here, I'm very, very happy to do that.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
As a mile.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Yes.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Yeah, great. So, so to sort of try and pull this together at the moment, it's more a thing of like, you know, where is all of this going?

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:14.000
You know, what, what is all of this giving to us?

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:21.000
You know, it seems as if there is a, there is a question hanging.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
We experience these things.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I'm sure there are many, many, many others similar to ourselves who've been having these experiences.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:41.000
And it's been feeding into the work that we're doing and reflecting itself back in the work that we're doing.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Certainly, we can, we can very likely even identify what we believe our roles and our duty is in this incarnation with regards to how we pass this onto people and what you what utility it has as well.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:05.000
You know, for the benefit of others.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:15.000
But there is a big question which is hanging there all the time and that that is where is this all ultimately leading to.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:27.000
You know, this is this is the question for me, or at least the question which I'm going to leave hanging in the air, perhaps.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Now, of course, it would probably be foolish for us to to conclusively answer anything of the kind.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:46.000
We've touched on that previously, you know, sometimes there's no point in, you know, it's not right to kill the to kill that question.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:55.000
But it's certainly something which is worth putting out there.

01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Even if it's for our own personal work.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.000
In our conversations so far.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
We have run.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:13.000
We have sounded bells along a trajectory, right.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:18.000
And those those ringing notes.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:22.000
They naturally coalesce over time.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:37.000
In the same way that you were speaking about the recovered fragments and how it's not you allow them to be sort of preserved without constant attention and inquiry.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Yeah, exactly. Yes.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:55.000
And also the concept of suggestion and indirect communication is very profound. So for me, our conversation sounds these notes that ring in the between of our conversations, and I'm sure we'll ring in the audience.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:02.000
In a very, very generative and fertilizing way like that.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Like the Pete, like, like the menstruational, you know, intensity of the blue sky and the sonic purple, the red purple.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Yeah, I have so much faith in you and your way and your path.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:34.000
You as a being who who has a noble purpose. You know, you have great charisma, but you're not like a personality.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:39.000
You know, in the way of someone who's self aggrandizing.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:46.000
And so I'm just so grateful for this opportunity to learn and see with you every time we may have it.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Yeah, and Darren, similarly with with yourself, you know, you the way you the way you lay things out in terms of your own summaries and descriptions are incredibly, incredibly illuminating on the spot, you know, for me.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:17.000
It's not even like I'm sure maybe if I listen to this interview in the future, I'll have further revelations but in the midst of actually being here talking about these things.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:31.000
There's been a great deal of actual living, you know, things kickstarting like coming to life in my own understanding right there on the spot as as we saw earlier today.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And that in itself, you know, is is incredibly inspiring and there's something about the way that you're presenting these things to me or reflecting them back to me in some instances, which is incredibly illuminating for me.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:56.000
So it's it's there's something very fruitful about the way I feel we're we're interacting on these matters.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:06.000
It's profoundly the same for me it's almost as if the light of my history and awareness and the light of your history and awareness, they meet somewhere.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:15.000
And then there's, there's like, there's like a group of figures who speak back to us from the the the intersection. Right.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:20.000
It's so beautiful. And I'm just so grateful and humbled.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Me too. Me too. And I'm also curiously aware of the fact that there is something I feel there's something in in your own experiences and background and in and in mine that somehow relates to something beyond us, which we've not quite yet been able to quite fathom or grasp

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:52.000
but there's a it feels like there's a reason why this connection came together. So absolutely.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.000
So healing for me. Yeah, inspiring.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:07.000
And it's so insightful. I've seen I've learned so much. I mean, it sounds like I'm talking and blah, blah, blah. I get it. But I've learned so much.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Every time we come together and it really is humbling because it's not like a what is it's not like it's about what Darren knows or anything like that something very magical, sort of mysterious and alive.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:26.000
And I just want to honor that and you and your work.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.000
I'm so grateful and I can't wait for the next time.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Well, well, hopefully, when you're when you're over here in the UK, I mean, I'm, you know, we I don't think we can miss the chance to try to, you know, to pull that together to meet up and and do something.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Go to some of these sacred sites around.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:58.000
I just want to extend the invitation you ever want to come here you've got a spot, you know, I don't know have you ever been to California.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:09.000
You've never been. Well, actually, I think when I was 10 years old, I did, but that was when I was 10 years old, I, it was actually Florida, not California now.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Sorry, just like, well, we'll talk about the soft line, but I'm there.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:24.000
And yeah, I'm just so excited and thank you so much, Lee. It's brilliant to have a chance to speak with you and learn together so.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Absolutely.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Our next adventure. Absolutely. Yes. Yes.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
May your path be blessed and beautiful.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Yours too, sir.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Bye bye for now.
