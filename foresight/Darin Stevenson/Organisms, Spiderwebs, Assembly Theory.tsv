0	24000	Hello everybody. Welcome. So part of how I learn, I'm sorry to say, is by being intellectually
24000	34440	impetuous, precocious, and naive. And what that usually turns out to mean, or what that
34440	45440	commonly often turns out to mean, is that I'm going to make bold mistakes in my first
45440	60120	essays of an idea that will sort of fertilize the garden of my mind if I'm lucky. If I'm
60120	71480	unlucky, those bold mistakes become doctrine, dogma, or my pet theory. And that happens too.
72200	85120	This is part of the danger of trying to chase insight alone, right? So that I don't have to
85120	99520	fight anyone powerful who's got an objection or a contrary perspective. This is part of why
99520	111240	I've been willing to put up with my scientist friend Kevin for 15 years or something, 20 years,
111240	121360	because he only fights me. He nearly never agrees with anything I've thought, believed,
121360	135600	perceived, and so forth. And he's very adept in the intellectual confines of argument or debate.
135600	159080	I wonder if we'll hear some coyotes because of the siren. Sorry about that devastating
160080	173880	oral attack. I suppose I could edit it out, but it seems useful. I'm seeing something really
173880	183280	interesting here. Okay, so there's a there's a three pronged pine needle floating in midair,
184120	197080	and moving around on the breeze. And the closest branch it could be connected to is probably a
197080	209760	minimum of 15 feet away. And the branch it's probably connected to is 20, 25 feet away. Oh shit.
209760	218520	Oh yeah, there it is. Wow. Okay, so oh, huh. All right, this is even weirder than I thought.
218520	233120	Because the branch it actually appears to be connected to is not above it. That's funny.
233120	239360	Maybe a friend just flew right past my face to wake me up to the fact that it's here.
239360	251840	All right, so what's actually going on isn't what is apparent. And this is the problem with ideas.
252160	262640	It certainly looked, I'm gonna have to test this, which is sort of frightening because I don't want
262640	271400	to change. I want to understand something about the situation without modifying the situation.
271840	282120	And this is the problem with knowledge and perspective is that often it is impossible to
282120	288120	determine what is the case without so severely disturbing the case quote unquote,
288120	302160	that we cannot, our first moves wrong foot us for all future moves. So I'm trying to understand
302160	311240	this what I'm looking at, which is a triad of dry pine needles floating apparently floating in the
311280	321720	atmosphere. And what I'm trying to understand is, and it seems very unlikely that this is the case,
321720	336560	but it is possible. Because spiders are crazy, amazing in their abilities to forge what I call
336720	344560	anchor strands for webs. And that's what this is is a spider kite. It's an anchor strand kite.
345920	354000	So a spider at some point in very recent history has attached a web.
354440	366040	And originally, I thought the web that was attached was from the kite up.
366040	379080	But I can see that there's a web from the kite sideways. What I can't tell is if there are two
379240	390400	webs, because the kite is behaving as if there are two. And I don't really want to disturb it.
391360	400240	But I'm going to try to determine the movement of the kite
405040	406880	is so counterintuitive.
407880	429120	I can't understand what is lofting the kite. If the only web is to the side,
429360	446800	because when the wind is reduced, the kite should fall. And it does fall some, but not enough.
449200	454480	And so it appears when I'm looking at it just doesn't seem possible, but it is.
455360	468080	I don't think there's a second strand attached above it. But the way the kite is flying,
468080	473200	it appears that there would have to be two strands. I don't think there is. I tried to test it.
475920	478800	Again, the problem with something this delicate, well, first of all,
479760	490240	it might be safer to test than I thought, because it's most likely that the web strand
493200	501120	is not sticky. Ah, okay, I've just figured it out. There are two strands. One is invisible.
501920	510720	Okay, that makes sense. Now the behavior of the kite makes sense. I cannot see the second strand,
510720	516080	but I could interfere with it. Wow. So now,
520080	527200	now I really don't understand how the object was formed, because I can understand the spider
527920	535840	attaching. Ah, there's the second strand. I can see it now. But from the opposite angle,
535840	540240	I can see it. Okay, and both of them go to the side. But what I can't understand,
540240	547760	what seems impossible to me, is how the spider got this kite in the middle of what appears to be
548320	558400	two strands. Yeah, no idea. It just seems impossible. I can imagine the spider attaching the kite,
560480	569360	you know, dumping the strand from a high branch. I have no idea how the kite could be in the middle
569440	579760	of two strands. No idea. I'm going to take a picture of this just for kicks, so I'm going to,
579760	594960	oh wait, I can take a picture without stopping the recording.
600080	608560	Huh, effectively invisible in the photograph.
613360	614960	Very blurry in that one.
614960	629120	A little, yeah, useless. All right.
632800	634480	Forgive my throat clearing.
634800	645680	Yeah, it seems impossible. I'm looking at it. I'm sure there was a method that produced this
647920	649760	seemingly absurd impossibility.
652800	655680	And I've seen stuff like this before. Spider kites are amazing.
655920	664400	And if you actually look at large webs, particularly those of orb weavers,
666480	670160	and it turns out that this topic is covalent
674320	682240	to the topic I'm going to stumble into with great impetuous ignorance in a little bit,
686080	694320	um, if you look at the large webs, particularly of orb weavers,
696240	698320	and you actually try to understand,
702960	705360	it's not too hard to understand how the web is constructed
706800	715200	once the anchor strands are in place. But if you try to understand how the anchor strands were forged,
716560	727520	whoo, good luck. You're going to have to see it happen or, you know, have an entomologist.
729520	734960	I don't know if there are arachnologists, there probably are, study arachnids.
736560	738720	But yeah, you're going to have to have someone explain it to you.
738800	745920	And until you actually see it happen, if you carefully think about the web and you look at it,
746640	751440	it's going to look impossible to produce many of the anchor strands,
751440	756880	and especially to connect them at tension in the center of the web.
757360	763520	And this turns out to be
768960	776000	correlated with the topic that I intend to pursue here, as soon as I manage to effectively
776000	778240	clear my throat, which I will not do in your ear.
784480	786560	Let's see. Okay.
791120	791360	So,
798240	802000	I think before I even get to the topic, I'm going to talk about the web some more.
806480	812080	The world line of an organism
815200	823920	can be imagined as the size, shape, spacetime tunnel
826400	830080	that an organism traverses during its lifetime.
830640	840960	Now, it should be obvious that the world lines of other similar organisms
843440	849360	are productive of the world line of a single organism, i.e., a human baby has two parents,
850240	851520	two immediate parents.
851600	861920	It's unclear. There's a problem with trying to compute the number of progenitors of a human,
863120	868320	because there's a problem where, and even the common answers to the problem don't actually
868320	872560	solve the problem. As far as I understand it, I'd love to be corrected about that,
873920	878480	because this is something that has bothered me for a long time. It looks like,
879440	887760	as you go backward in time with two ancestors, you know, my dad had two ancestors,
888640	894400	my mom had two ancestors, so that's four. They each had two ancestors, so that's eight.
895520	901200	Sixteen, et cetera. You have the chessboard problem of one grain of sand on each, you know,
901600	915200	N plus one grains of rice on each. Is that it? Is it N plus one? No, you double the grains of rice,
915200	931440	so it's N to the X, N to the 1, 2, 3, 4 powers as you traverse the chessboard.
932400	944240	Long time ago some, it is claimed. Some astute mathematician was offered a reward by a king or
944320	953440	queen for having solved the problem, and they requested one grain of rice on the first square
953440	961840	of a chessboard, two on the next, four on the next, and so forth. At first glance, this looks
961840	972080	like a paltry sum, but if you understand the nature of powers, you realize that on the final
972080	978800	square you'll have, I don't know, more of grains of rice than there are on earth or something,
978800	991200	a ridiculously large amount of grain of rice. So organisms have a world line, and for the purposes
991200	998000	of our discussion, and I may even be misunderstanding the world line, because I often do misunderstand
998800	1004640	complex principles from science, not having had to mathematically validate them myself.
1007200	1012400	So I can have a naive understanding of things, and it's not uncommon for me to do so.
1014080	1019760	It is uncommon for me to notice in real time that my understanding is or is likely naive,
1020160	1033360	but, okay, where am I going here? So imagine
1036400	1045360	that an ovum in my mother's womb has a world line, and it is the size and shape of an ovum,
1045600	1051200	and it is traveling inside my mother's womb, so it's tracing. Imagine that we light it up and we
1051200	1059840	make a tracer backward and forward in time. It appears sometime during or after her embryo
1059840	1067440	genesis, probably after, I would guess. There's a light, and it's the size of an ovum,
1067440	1076800	and it makes a tunnel as it travels through time, and then eventually it meets another light,
1076800	1082080	the size of a sperm, which has been doing some traveling in my father's testicles,
1083680	1090960	and it meets these two lights that make a tunneled shape, a tunnel of their shape
1091600	1098320	in time space, right? So wherever my mom goes on the surface of the earth, that changes the tunnel's
1099120	1105200	trajectories. The earth is spinning, so that changes the trajectories. The earth is orbiting
1105200	1111920	the sun, so we're going to follow it inside my dad's body on the surface of the earth,
1111920	1117280	around the surface of the earth's spin, around the earth's orbit of the sun, and then around the sun's
1117920	1122320	orbit in the galaxy, and then around the galaxy's orbit, orbits, or movements in the universe,
1124240	1132400	and you'll get exactly one tunnel, sperm size shaped, and ovum size shaped, and then these two
1132400	1142400	meet, and my world line begins there. So at first I am the size of an ovum with an embedded sperm head
1142400	1154160	in it, and then it becomes a multicellular blastocyst, and so forth, and becomes Darren.
1154800	1160880	So first I'm baby-shaped, and my world line is baby-shaped and sized, and then as I get older,
1160880	1165200	it gets bigger and more complex, more numbers of cells, and actually each of those cells has a
1165200	1171280	world line, each of the bacteria in me, each of the viruses, so I'm kind of a galaxy of world lines
1172160	1181360	if we're taking my components. Okay, so why am I saying all this? Because the spider is insanely
1181360	1196960	brilliant. What the spider does with its own body, with no, no, with no artificial technology,
1197840	1206800	the spider extends its world line so that in time space the world line of the spider is always
1206800	1220880	extended by any web it is presently occupying or connected to, and that means that the world line
1220880	1231680	the world line of a spider has a secondary element, the web, and the web is literally
1233280	1241280	at least where the web is not. Spiders do all kinds of things with webs, they don't just make
1243280	1249040	they don't just make the webs the capture webs, they also make various kinds of travel webs,
1249440	1259920	and they probably make and discard webs as they're attempting to forge a capture web.
1267760	1272640	All right, so
1279920	1286560	the world line of a spider
1294480	1297600	has two components at minimum,
1302000	1306960	the spider and the web. Now notice that what the web does is it literally filters time space
1307920	1310800	to capture the world lines of other insects
1315120	1316400	which it then consumes.
1321360	1325920	It probably doesn't consume all of the insects that intersect with its web,
1327040	1333520	but the spider has two world lines, the spider-shaped one extended by the web-shaped one.
1337920	1339440	And that's pretty astonishing.
1351600	1353680	Okay, so here comes the more complicated thing.
1356640	1357520	The spider web
1358320	1366320	is an object with an organismal origin.
1374800	1379040	There's no chance you will encounter one
1379760	1387120	that has neither an organismal origin nor a mechanical origin.
1388480	1393040	And a mechanical origin in the way that I'm going to use this word
1394880	1402720	has an organismal origin because it means something built robots to build spider webs.
1409440	1412880	Now I differ with many scientists,
1420800	1422160	particularly Lex Fridman,
1426400	1426880	in that
1434000	1438080	I have a limited definition of the word machine.
1439040	1453120	And because I haven't had to refine it in careful argument, it's probably fairly clumsy.
1456080	1457360	But it goes something like
1460720	1466160	a non-organic tool or device forged by humans.
1469760	1481280	Many scientists, particularly physicists and neuroscientists,
1482640	1486640	I think they're making a monumental category error
1489280	1490160	when they claim
1493600	1498560	that organisms and biologies are machines, that neurons are machines.
1500000	1506000	Now I understand something of how they come to that,
1507840	1515680	but the humans have a problem in which we transfer, we, devastatingly ignorantly,
1517360	1522480	we transfer metaphors from technology back onto organisms.
1523360	1532560	Thus we say, for example, your heart is a pump, your lungs are bellows.
1533920	1538160	Both of these things are impossible, formally impossible.
1538160	1541200	You will not have ideas without your heart, right?
1541200	1545360	There will be no arguments, no science, no religion, no nothing.
1546640	1551360	There is no pump that produces such effects in time space.
1552560	1559360	There is no pump that causes ideas, although
1564080	1570960	large language models, some might argue, I think we're getting close, Darren, with LLMs.
1574720	1577840	But LLMs are built by humans, right?
1577840	1588240	So the humans exist in the causal chain of origination necessary to LLMs.
1589760	1594160	So LLMs don't just arise out of the nature of time space, you have to have,
1594960	1597920	apparently, you have to have humans on earth so far as we know.
1598880	1602080	All right, so
1606640	1616640	when I imagine organisms, when I think of organisms, I think of
1617440	1630320	unimaginable complexity, single cell, to simulate it properly at, say, the level of the atom,
1631680	1637440	to fully simulate it, would require much more than all the computation humans have ever done,
1638320	1647520	would require something like 400 million years of the fastest computer we have pinned
1648400	1654400	at its top operating capacity. The Fugaku, I think, is the name of that computer.
1657760	1660240	And again, I'd like to be corrected if I've got this wrong.
1662080	1665600	I think accurately simulating the, oh, by the way, that's accurately simulating
1665680	1674960	the activity of a cell over one second. Okay, so you're talking about
1677600	1683360	truly monumental in actions of intelligence and physical complexity.
1688160	1692480	And as we attempt to understand how best to simulate a cell,
1693440	1698720	our knowledge of the cell's complexity is increasing very rapidly. So
1700800	1702640	the thing that's increasing more rapidly
1707600	1712800	is the complexity we're facing, not our capacity to simulate it.
1718480	1719920	So when I think of organisms,
1723440	1732080	I think of living beings, we could call them systems, but I prefer to call them relationships,
1738080	1743680	or relational hyperstructures or biorelational hyperstructures. And by hyperstructures, I mean
1744960	1751200	a multi-dimensional structure that entangles and complexifies temporalities,
1751200	1754640	not just one temporality, webs of temporality.
1760080	1765600	So that is nothing like a machine. In fact, that might, if we were going to attempt to
1765600	1773760	define the opposite of a machine, organisms and minds would be likely candidates because
1774080	1783360	organisms, so far as we understand them, contribute to and sustain negentropic
1784400	1793040	relationships on the surface of living planets, whereas machines dump death into that system
1793040	1800800	in the form of entropy. So machines offload entropy into living systems, living systems
1801680	1809600	levitate, in a sense. If entropy is gravity, organisms are,
1813200	1815520	can be imagined as anti-gravity.
1818800	1826800	They do something that should be impossible, or that seems impossible at first glance,
1826800	1831360	and maybe there are biologists who can explain this in such a way as to satisfy
1832320	1836560	my troubled mind about this matter. Then correct me.
1844000	1846880	I haven't seen evidence of negentropy in machines,
1848000	1853920	and on any planet where those begin to show up, where you have an organism complex enough to
1853920	1862640	produce mechanical objects. It looks to me like, unless that organism is vastly more intelligent
1862640	1868880	than humans, in terms of knowing what not to do with technology, you will get a dead world there
1868880	1873680	right quick, geologically speaking, a few thousand years at most.
1874480	1887600	So, unlike Lex Fridman and his ilk, who I respect and admire, and I want his voice at the table,
1887600	1893760	I just don't agree, and I love his podcasts. In fact, the reason I'm making this recording
1893760	1900640	is due to one of them. It's due to his podcast with Lee Cronin and Sarah Walker.
1904640	1908480	Who are producing theoretical children if they have not produced physical children.
1911520	1914960	I can't tell if they're a couple or not, and I haven't done the research to figure it out,
1915520	1920800	but listening to them part of me is just like, oh please let these two humans
1920800	1926400	mate and produce offspring. I've rarely felt that, though I did feel it with
1926400	1934080	Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner. They would have produced an offspring capable of just laying
1934080	1939920	waste to human consciousness with humor. It would have been like the atomic bomb of comedians.
1946560	1953680	So, Lex seems to think that if you get a complex enough machine, it's alive,
1953680	1963760	and if you build a robot, that's your baby. Thus, he projects his own essence into his
1963760	1973520	mechanical creations in a way that he defines as lifelike enough to qualify as life.
1974160	1982640	I think this is a ridiculous misapprehension of the nature of organisms, but again,
1984160	1992800	I'm excited. I would love to sit down and talk about this with him. Never happen. I'm a nobody.
1992800	2010000	Lex is famous. All right, so let me explain partly why I don't think machines
2011760	2019760	have the same mode of world line that organisms have.
2022800	2032320	It is that they cannot inherit or participate in directly the world line complexity of origination,
2033120	2046560	relation, heredity, and lineage that the simplest organism has more of than all the numbers you
2046560	2054720	could ever make. The simplest organism has an infinite historical relational web
2057440	2066160	of trillions of endless amounts of numbers of transformations and relationships per
2066160	2069680	instant, whatever interval you want, billionth of a second.
2073760	2086080	And so, in a sense, the organism's historical body is transcendentally vast and intimate,
2086560	2099040	and the transactions that the organism, that that body has participated in,
2103760	2110000	are monumentally vast and supportive generally of nearly all other organisms.
2116240	2133200	Machines, on the other hand, by existing end the world lines of organisms.
2135440	2141520	Many, many organisms must die to support the existence of any machine, at least around here.
2141520	2147120	And so machines look like, to me,
2151120	2158560	a sort of deadly plague for organisms, generally speaking. They look like the opposite of life.
2158560	2164960	They put an end to organismal lineages. Any automobile is a perfect example of this
2165760	2170640	that will kill nearly everything it touches, and many things it never touches. In the past,
2171280	2178240	and in the future. How does it kill things in the past by ending the lineages of living beings
2178240	2185520	today? That, effectively, can be understood to travel back in time and destroy the entire lineage
2187360	2193040	of relationships that produce and exist as, say, a duck run over by a car.
2201200	2203120	All right, so where am I going here?
2206560	2216560	Now, Lex seems to believe that what I will call simulacra are
2216960	2235680	as vital, as potent, as alive as organisms, particularly as we approach the churning limit
2237440	2242480	of our incapacity to distinguish them.
2242880	2253040	So, if I simulate a philodendron, and you can't tell the difference between that philodendron
2253840	2259680	and an actual philodendron, a living one, it inherits the property alive.
2259840	2273280	This is the argument for touring tests in artificial cognitive systems,
2275120	2281760	and I never bought it. I'm sure that Lex could table some very fierce objections to my objections.
2283200	2284320	I don't know what they are yet.
2284960	2295680	It has never seemed to me that if you can't tell the difference, they're the same thing. Sure,
2295680	2301680	they're the same thing in terms of the lexical category we are likely to use to refer to them,
2302800	2312960	and yes, if I'm looking at the plants I am walking past, and 87% of them are simulations,
2312960	2320240	and I am unaware of that, then they will seem to me to be plants, but if I discover,
2322480	2324080	okay, then it comes down to
2327760	2333280	is there any way to determine the distinction? Is there any way to notice the distinction,
2333920	2339040	to experimentally observe the distinction between a simulation and an organism?
2340000	2348240	And I will argue that I don't believe it's possible to produce simulations as complex as organisms
2349280	2355040	at all. There may be exceptions to this, and I'm open to changing my mind.
2357680	2365120	But to me, and one of the things I like about the topic that I'm going to start to blather on about
2365120	2375440	here is that it looks like we may have found a way to measure,
2378720	2391760	to reliably determine the developmental complexity of anything we may observe or interact with.
2395440	2405440	And this is an incredible thing. Now, it may turn out, this is early days for this theory,
2406400	2412320	it may turn out that the theory is falsifiable, or it may turn out that the theory becomes falsified,
2412320	2420960	is what I meant. It's incredibly bold, but of course, like any good scientist,
2421040	2426480	Lee Cronin and his teams, and Sarah Walker, and so forth,
2429200	2433760	who I imagine to be among the parents of assembly theory,
2438720	2441760	like any good scientist, if they're wrong,
2442560	2451840	and the theory is formally falsified somehow, we'll get smarter. So,
2452560	2456720	build the boat, float the boat, if it sinks, okay, we'll make better boats thereafter,
2457520	2460160	because of what we learned from this one that sank. But
2464080	2468960	the arguments and data, as I understand, the arguments and the arrangement,
2469440	2476880	arrangements of data that comprise assembly theory presently look
2478160	2485920	provocatively convincing. And this is where I'm going to get into trouble, and being naive and stupid,
2489440	2495760	because I've only just, I've only accidentally stumbled onto this topic
2496400	2503600	over the past few weeks. I've listened to a couple of long interviews with Lee Cronin.
2505040	2513200	I'm not mathematically sophisticated enough to understand it the way a scientist understands it.
2513200	2520720	I believe their paper on this theory
2524000	2532240	was published against all odds, right? I think it was published in nature.
2532480	2544160	And I heard the story of its publication, and I work in that field. I work in the field of
2545920	2552800	editing biomedical manuscripts for publication in what are referred to as high impact journals,
2552800	2568080	such as Nature Cell, so forth. So, let me see if I can encapsulate, meaningfully,
2569040	2585760	what I imagine to be the core positions of assembly theory is something like this.
2585760	2602960	Instead of proposing a new physics, assembly theory originating,
2603920	2618080	Lee Cronin, I believe is a chemist, assembly theory posits a new definition of objects.
2620400	2628480	And so, instead of positing that point particles, electrons, photons, etc., are fundamental,
2628640	2634960	it posits that objects are fundamental and provides a definition of objects.
2634960	2638000	By the way, I'm not reading this. I should be.
2640800	2651440	It provides a definition of objects based on their, on decomposing them and determining
2651920	2660960	the index of complexity required to produce the objects.
2665920	2673680	And this produces models such as causal graphs
2674560	2683680	that are empirical measurements of
2686640	2693760	historically, of timelines, of world lines, of objects,
2694720	2698400	that are determinative
2702480	2709040	and produce a metric for the complexity of any given object, say a molecule,
2712160	2717520	or an organism, or a machine.
2718400	2725200	And this discovery is absolutely mind-blowing.
2730240	2739120	The number of technologies and ways of knowing that are likely to emerge
2739360	2750720	quickly, if this theory is further validated, obviously it's fairly well validated to appear in nature,
2757520	2758720	are staggering.
2761840	2766640	But the thing that I find particularly surprising about it is that it will give us
2769440	2782080	an empirical measure of various features of organisms
2783680	2790240	that I argue it will give me a way to prove that machines can't participate.
2791200	2795200	In
2803200	2803840	how to put it.
2806800	2814080	It is as if there is a living water inside the organisms that is made of their origin
2814080	2820880	and lineage relationships that is carried forward in time and comprises a dimension of its own.
2822160	2828080	Not only do machines not participate in that specific dimension, they tend to tear it apart
2828800	2834800	and replace it with something that's dead inside, in my view.
2835040	2841280	And, you know, am I an ideologue about this?
2842560	2843120	Partly.
2844720	2851760	I certainly want to learn and be convinced otherwise, if
2857200	2862800	if that's the direction toward greater insight and intelligence.
2863760	2865760	I fiercely doubt it.
2866800	2870160	I am a biofile, not a technophile.
2872800	2878320	If you wanted to rip the entire history of life on earth to shreds,
2878880	2880960	all you have to do is give humans machines.
2881840	2884960	They don't have societies intelligent enough to survive that.
2885680	2887200	I would liken it to
2892720	2903760	finding a, okay this is a very abstract analogy, but imagine I have a two and a half year old male infant.
2906720	2908880	I abuse it in a variety of ways.
2910480	2913840	This is no, not suggesting we abuse infants here,
2913920	2918800	but I've used the infant in a variety of ways that make it very angry.
2918800	2922400	Stop feeding it, give it no attention, yell at it, whatever.
2924640	2927840	And then once it's thoroughly spun up,
2931920	2941280	I give it a thermos with no lid, and the thermos contains, I don't know,
2942240	2948160	molten steel, but it's so well insulated you can't tell it's hot on the outside.
2948800	2952240	And then I just give the infant the thermos and leave.
2953920	2957280	What is going to happen is going to be really bad for that infant.
2958400	2965840	And similarly, giving humans any kind of technology, this goes to my argument that
2966800	2971360	actually ethical scientists would nearly never publish.
2976800	2978400	Well that's not going to help the worm.
2981600	2984000	I'm not sure what to do about that poor creature.
2984400	2995600	Yeah, actually ethical scientists would nearly never publish because
2998160	3004400	there are no intelligent systems of humans competitive enough
3005120	3011760	to prevail against the lethally oriented organizations of humans
3012640	3021680	that will certainly end life on earth or, at the very least, produce an extinction event
3022800	3028080	of staggering scope. Some will argue, yes, extinction events are good.
3029120	3036640	By extinguishing vast rays of organisms previously, we ourselves arose.
3036640	3042800	Okay, great, but I'm actually concerned about the agently conserved ecologies.
3042800	3043840	Those things are rare.
3046400	3054080	And there's also a timeline. Just like a human being, a planet has a lifespan,
3055040	3061360	and as it gets nearer to the probable end of its lifespan,
3062320	3066560	the sudden effusive generation of new forms becomes less likely,
3067280	3071120	and the ability to sustain those forms over time becomes less likely.
3073440	3080960	In a sense, it looks to me like the earth is bio-evolutionarily old enough
3081920	3087760	that it has cancer, and the cancer on the earth is the appearance of machines.
3088560	3095920	Right, these are tumors. They are highly structured modes of time-space artificially
3095920	3101040	produced that kill everything so that they can be sustained and reproduced.
3101760	3105680	There's something similar in human cognition that I call thrips.
3107600	3111840	So I would argue that human cognition has become elderly in the sense that
3112800	3114320	it's no longer producing.
3121360	3130480	It produces far more artifacted structure than it does useful intelligent novelty
3130480	3131840	and relational novelty.
3132000	3143280	Now, assembly theory gives us a variety of metrics and perspectives
3146480	3151440	that would allow us to determine, and by the way, Cronin himself says,
3152720	3156080	I certainly am suffering from the hammer-nail problem.
3157040	3159040	Got a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
3159920	3161760	Vis-a-vis assembly theory.
3164640	3174400	And naturally so, because I've never seen a model that could give us the ability
3175120	3190800	to empirically determine so many, like literally to observe that, which was previously unobservable.
3192400	3197680	It's almost like assembly theory is a kind of a cognitive lamp that sheds light
3198160	3205840	on features of the universe that we have previously understood to exist,
3207360	3212880	but had no way to formalize. That's incredible.
3216880	3227120	So I'm going to try to make a future recording about this in which I am vastly more capable
3228160	3232400	of reiterating some of the root concepts
3236240	3240400	associated with assembly theory. And I have to say that
3244480	3252880	I've been a, what, a scientophile. I've loved science since childhood because
3253840	3256800	it looked like one of the ways of knowing
3259680	3265360	that the humans propagate that is relatively likely to produce
3266640	3271840	intelligent understanding, behavior, societies, and so forth. Turns out, not the case.
3275040	3280960	At least not in my lifetime. Turns out, science is the way of knowing most likely to produce
3281520	3289200	absolute devastation on earth. And by absolute, I mean the capacity to snuff the biosphere,
3289760	3295200	shut it off like a fucking light switch. And everyone says, oh, there's no way to do that.
3295200	3305680	They're wrong. I could show them five ways to do it now. Once you have a certain array of technologies,
3311200	3319120	you will have the capacity to combine them in relatively accessible to single humans or
3319120	3322720	small group ways. This is what Daniel Schmockenberger is on about with,
3325520	3333840	let's call it, multi-polar threats. He's got some other nomenclature that's also very useful,
3333840	3344480	race to the bottom. So yeah, life on, you know, the earth is very similar to a cell
3345920	3355040	in certain respects. And its robust resilience is absolutely dependent on
3355760	3366160	the continuation of the organs that produce the possibility of homeostasis
3367520	3374080	in the atmosphere and environment. Much like a cell, if you lies the membrane,
3375120	3380560	you penetrate the membrane of the cell in the right kind of way, the membrane collapses,
3381520	3388320	that planet will die. You'll end up with something not dissimilar to Mars. Now, some will argue that
3392480	3395600	the continuous existence of liquid water on the surface
3397360	3407760	is sufficient to guarantee the continuance of organismal complexification on earth.
3408320	3408960	Could be right.
3413120	3420240	But for myself, I'm bonded with the anciently conserved ecologies in my heart, mind, and spirit.
3421360	3424880	Science turns out to be the way of knowing that will allow humans to dispose of those,
3426480	3435440	and in a sense causes them to dispose of them by continuously producing new technologies
3438720	3442560	that, in factively,
3449760	3458640	in other words, the continuously penetrate new dimensions of the organs of the biosphere
3459760	3461440	and offload entropy into them.
3462000	3469280	This doesn't mean I'm anti-science.
3474160	3477760	Science is one of the most reliable ways of knowing that we have.
3481760	3486960	However, science is also heavily compromised
3487120	3494640	by malignant imperatives
3498080	3509200	that propagate like a kind of mold in human culture.
3510160	3514080	And then those imperatives capture ways of knowing
3516320	3519600	and weaponize them for the sake of profit, power, or
3522640	3533840	decimation, obliterating things, crushing the opponent zero-sum games.
3533920	3543600	So science is still half noble, or a tenth noble,
3546320	3553600	but most of what science will actually produce is likely to further human
3554720	3561440	technological development, which looks to me lethal to both humans and the history and future
3561440	3565840	of life on earth. And whether or not it completely obliterates life on earth
3567120	3575760	sort of doesn't matter, right? If I murder your entire family and one of your children
3576480	3578160	manages somehow to survive,
3578960	3593920	this doesn't validate my murder or the murder of the entire family.
3593920	3596880	I guess there was some Russian royal family that was essentially
3599840	3604240	captured up, taken somewhere and just executed. I can't remember who the Romanovs may be.
3605040	3612160	And the fact that some janitor
3614160	3623840	survived in no way reduces the atrocity index of the slaughter of the family
3623840	3629040	and their children and everybody. And I think it's funny that we, it's natural,
3629760	3635280	but it's also peculiar that we pretend that, well, it's relatively okay to kill the adults.
3635280	3639840	They, they had some life, just don't kill the children and keep some women around.
3639840	3646640	That's in, you know, that kind of moral relativism doesn't fly well with me. I think all of the
3646640	3656320	beings, all of the adults, arch still children too. There's very few, if any,
3656320	3672240	statuses that ameliorate the moral or ethical imperatives that orbit do not kill
3673120	3677840	and especially do not murder, do not slaughter.
3682000	3684000	So back to assembly theory.
3686480	3697360	So there are two particular forms of data that, and by the way, I deeply encourage you to listen
3697440	3707600	to Lee Cronin describing the origins and publication of the assembly theory paper.
3708320	3711280	I may be able to produce a link in the description later.
3713840	3722560	But the two primary forms of data that emerge that I, that I understand to some degree at this point
3722880	3732560	are what's called the assembly index, which is a measure of the necessary extant complexity
3732560	3742560	required for an object to become possible in the universe. Now that, by the way, Cronin says that
3742560	3754560	time turns out to be fundamental to anything relating to analyzing objects. And I agree with him
3754560	3762560	that at least through the lens of assembly theory and a number of lenses familiar and preferable to me,
3762560	3768560	time is something far different from tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.
3772800	3784160	In fact, organisms and their relationships create modes of time. I refer to these as
3784160	3790480	temporal hyper, biorelational hyper structures or biotemporal hyper structures. And when idiots,
3791280	3801440	or when people make idiotic statements, and I've heard both Neil deGrasse Tyson
3802960	3810960	and Sabine Hossenfelder, I'm not sure if I got her last name right,
3814160	3819040	make bold and idiotic claims such as,
3823120	3828640	there's no reason for aliens to travel, you know, millions of light years, thousands of light years
3829120	3838080	to visit the earth because humans are boring. That is the epitome,
3840400	3848320	hi, nice to see you. That is the epitome of egoic anthropocentric stupidity,
3848320	3852480	in my view. And maybe they're stirring the pot, right? Maybe they're trying to,
3853280	3859040	they're just trying to produce trigger bait. But the earth
3861120	3870800	is a vast library of biorelational hyper structures. These must be incredibly rare
3871760	3886960	in time space by volume, even if they are common in number, right? Even if there are billions
3886960	3895760	of living worlds as complex as ours, as stable as ours, stable enough to produce hands,
3895760	3902640	eyes, wings, tentacles, minds, so forth, embodied minds.
3906480	3914960	Those things are not merely interesting. They are producing modes of time space that if you,
3916960	3922480	it's like looking for diamonds or looking for gold, right? Walk all over the place,
3922480	3928720	you'll find nearly no gold. In the entire history of me walking around on the earth,
3929840	3937760	the only diamonds I've seen are on women's fingers, generally, or men's. Or unfortunately,
3937760	3943200	in the latter part of my life, inside people's teeth, come on people. Are you guys nuts?
3943680	3955760	Apparently. So yeah, living worlds produce forms of biotemporal complexity
3957200	3964160	that are unimaginably uncommon in time space, even if there are lots of them. And each one of them
3964720	3974800	will have incredibly unique features. So for shame, Tyson, you are acting the public idiot here
3975440	3984880	in an anthropocentric and egoic way that is truly embarrassing, not just to you, but to the idea
3984880	3993440	that you're a scientist. And similarly, Sabine, what the hell are you thinking? You think the humans
3993440	3999920	are the only reason to visit earth? I mean, as a human, are you only interested in the humans?
4001520	4007920	The fuck are you thinking? And again, maybe these people are just trying to produce trigger bait.
4009760	4012960	They certainly succeeded in my case. Because honestly,
4015840	4019600	if I was capable of publicly slapping them in the face for such a comment,
4019840	4025840	I might be willing to descend to that.
4029520	4037680	Yeah, I find that just ridiculous. And it does stir me up if I'm willing to be stirred up that way.
4039360	4044640	So the two concepts in assembly theory are the assembly index of an object,
4045600	4058400	which is an empirical measure of, it's like a graph, I guess, or there's actually a second concept,
4058400	4066240	which is the causal graph. And I think I sort of understand the assembly index
4066240	4079440	as a measure of the complexity necessary in the temporal historical context of the universe
4081040	4095680	to produce for an object to be constructed somehow. And then the causal graph is a bit more obscure
4097120	4099920	Let me see if I can find the definition for that.
4102560	4106480	I suppose the causal graph is a way of encoding
4108880	4121360	propositions about the paths of origination of an object. Now again, assembly theory is very new.
4121600	4129280	A lot of scientists are quite upset about its existence.
4136160	4145200	I mean, there's a vast population of haters already for this theory, because it,
4145200	4152240	in some senses, if properly validated,
4156640	4165600	it might comprise a super science, something that steals the foundations
4167600	4173600	from many other branches of research. It just captures those foundations.
4175840	4182240	And it's very early days. There remains a great deal of work to do.
4184880	4187840	However, one problem with
4194800	4202240	sir, your dog, it's having trouble. It has, yeah, there you go.
4202880	4206480	Yeah, it was just walking funny because it was trying to
4215040	4224000	So whether or not assembly theory is validated, it's already producing
4224160	4228800	uncommonly useful results.
4234480	4238720	And in listening to cronin,
4242800	4251040	I've spent some time listening to intelligent humans, and particularly intelligent males.
4254320	4258080	I guess just because the media puts more of them in front of me, generally speaking.
4261040	4270560	However, Sarah Walker is a wonderful example of an absolutely brilliant intellectual female.
4272960	4277920	I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to use explicit gender terms in 2024.
4278640	4284240	I may, I may end up canceled or beheaded for having done so.
4286400	4295120	But yeah, Lee is one of the most intelligent minds I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.
4295120	4299200	This doesn't mean that I agree with everything he says or believes.
4299200	4304160	And in fact, one of the reasons I find him intelligent is you will very commonly hear him say,
4304160	4311040	I've just changed my mind about this. This is something I've nearly never heard out of the
4311040	4319920	mouths of anyone. And even in the interview with Lex Fridman, where he and Sarah Walker,
4320480	4323360	you know, the interview is ostensibly about aliens. There's, I don't know,
4324000	4328640	like eight minutes of talk about aliens in the interview, and it's four hours long,
4329360	4339120	which is awesome. As most of you know, I'm down with long form. Let's do it long form, you know.
4339120	4346480	Let's have the foreplay for hours, and then, you know, all the other stuff, and then the meal,
4346480	4353760	and then the bath, and then, you know, the dreaming, and then, yeah, everything. Let's have it all.
4354320	4362800	Of course, I'm not getting any of that stuff. That's all pure fantasy at this,
4363600	4371520	in my present circumstances. And has long been that way. Maybe that's why I'm,
4373360	4377360	maybe that's why I have changed my perspective. But my point was just that,
4377360	4386480	yeah, I can see if you can give Lee an argument that allows him to visualize, particularly
4387280	4394480	to visualize experiments that can be done to determine, qualitatively, quantitatively,
4395440	4407600	empirically, ideologically, the validity of an argument, or the power of an argument,
4407600	4414800	the conclusiveness of an argument. He will immediately change his mind if he can see
4414800	4422080	and understand the structure. And I've rarely seen this quality. I'm not sure I have it.
4422320	4433120	I am very, I'm very likely to be committed to my pet theories. And I encounter so few
4434240	4445760	intelligent people to explore with that it's uncommon for me to
4445760	4456400	be presented with something I find.
4456400	4478400	Wow, coughing child, death knell. The child will probably survive.
4478560	4482960	But who else will?
4487920	4494640	Yeah, I just don't, I don't encounter anyone intelligent enough, or motivated to push against
4497520	4504400	commonly. There are, there are a few such people in my circle.
4508720	4510400	Hmm.
4520240	4524720	The most profound tree that I know is in this little part of the garden.
4530240	4533920	I'm going to pause for a moment. I hope I will return.
4539120	4548640	So I've noticed that some one, I can't recall the guy's name, just saw it briefly,
4549840	4559760	has published an essay on medium called The Eight Fallacies of Assembly Theory.
4560400	4563840	Definitely people are going to be highly motivated to attack this thing,
4564400	4569360	which is probably good. I mean, I think Cronin himself and Sarah Walker would,
4570240	4580320	and they have other associates, Sharma at all. You can see their team on the primary paper.
4580480	4597600	So the thing is going to undergo a radical evolutionary process by furious objection.
4599120	4603920	People are going to be very highly motivated to attack this thing, primarily because
4604800	4612880	if it turns out to be valid or useful, which it seems extremely likely
4614480	4617920	to be profoundly useful in the sense that
4621920	4630240	it gives us ways to detect the existence of stuff that we've never been able to see before, like
4634720	4637760	it's not merely a new language.
4641280	4649520	It's a new method of considering the nature of identity, what things are.
4653280	4657920	And this is incredibly provocative and profound.
4664720	4671920	I mean, literally my mind is so blown by what I've heard from Cronin
4671920	4682320	that I mean, one analogy would be
4682720	4690720	if
4694240	4702720	so in some ways, as someone who has reason to suspect that I've had
4702720	4713040	long-term contact over some interval of my life with a non-human intelligence of extremely exotic
4713040	4719840	and profound nature and ability. It's not just similar to someone who says,
4720640	4732080	you know, not only did one day out in the field at night, my family and I encountered
4733200	4736160	what appeared to us to be a vehicle from time space.
4736240	4746000	But they took me with them in
4750240	4757440	their vehicle and they taught me some of their ways of knowing
4758160	4763360	right over many months and showed me
4765920	4774400	how they perceive the universe, organisms, time space, all these things. So in a sense,
4780000	4783120	compared to the minds of common others around me,
4783600	4793120	my mind is a bit like a UFO landing in their backyard
4795840	4800800	because I'm attempting to convey some of the things that I, some of the perspectives and
4800800	4807040	orientations that I have acquired over my lifetime, but particularly during my contact
4807040	4812880	experience. And there's lots of different ways to conceive of that experience other than
4813760	4818160	the contact with a non-human intelligence, though I would argue that most of what's
4818160	4824240	going on is precisely that because nature is a non-human intelligence of unimaginable sophistication.
4826720	4832640	You know, a library of such intelligences that upscale form a unity. And by the way,
4832640	4836320	it looks like a assembly theory might allow,
4839360	4843760	might endow the possibility of proving empirically
4846400	4856080	that the earth and the biosphere comprise a unity, an accessible to humans' unity.
4856640	4866240	And many other things that are important, philosophically, ethically, morally,
4866800	4875520	and intellectually to me, perhaps even spiritually. I will admit that I associate my
4875520	4881280	biofilia, my adoration of living beings and their relationships and origins,
4883280	4888320	that does feel to me like a spiritual faculty,
4893360	4901120	or an expression of my soul, of the nature of my soul, which I imagine is a much more
4901200	4908560	complex entity than is commonly supposed. Yeah, that thing's got a lot of different
4908560	4914320	features depending on how and why we may be referring to it in language or making models
4914320	4922640	in language concepts and so on. I'm going to pause for a bit because I'm coming to a place
4922640	4931520	of a lot of noise. With luck, I will return shortly. So I hope in the future to be able to produce
4933840	4934800	a concise
4939760	4941440	description of assembly theory
4946320	4949280	and its primary propositions.
4953280	4961280	But it looks like we may get a grasp on an entirely new form of knowledge
4968320	4978240	with the power to produce otherwise impossible insights about a broad array of features of
4978240	4986720	biology and particularly some of the most confusing problems
4989520	4992400	in science is concerned with origin of life.
4996800	5004720	I have recently been listening to some debates on this topic and they are profoundly contentious
5005680	5007040	primarily because
5010080	5011120	the common models
5015120	5018720	in play in biology are ridiculous
5021520	5026160	and avoid nearly all of the fundamental questions necessary
5029280	5032240	to produce reasonable scientific arguments.
5035280	5038080	So assembly theory may give us
5041360	5053040	both a foundation for reasonable arguments and a path to evaluate them in the laboratory.
5053200	5053760	Right?
5056720	5064720	Cronin has a variety of radical and I think trustworthy ideas
5069200	5073040	about what we might do
5073440	5077280	to
5084160	5088160	produce both the precursors and perhaps actual life in the lab.
5090720	5098560	Again for my view, Lee if he's correct and his team and Sarah and her team
5098880	5106880	or their teams are giving the humans again something very likely to produce
5108000	5109920	incredibly lethal technologies.
5113120	5116000	Scientists often
5118720	5123440	inhabit the role of the villain in Frederick Brown's story The Weapon
5123680	5136480	in which a journalist comes to visit a scientist who is about to give the humans
5140960	5148320	something similarly deadly to nuclear weapons. The journalist argues against this.
5148560	5159520	The scientist just says, you know, it's not my job to determine whether or not something
5159520	5165520	should be done. My job is to do what can be done. I can do this. I'm going to do it.
5165520	5175120	It turns out that the scientist has a developmentally
5180960	5183840	inhibited child.
5189440	5191840	I'm not sure what the right nomenclature for that is these days.
5196480	5202400	A child who is 12 that has the mental age of that might be associated with a three-year-old
5203840	5208320	and the journalist manages to give the child a loaded gun
5210080	5217360	surreptitiously which the scientist later finds him with in his bed.
5217840	5231600	It's a powerful refutation of the argument. We should do what we can. Whatever can be done
5233040	5233680	should be done.
5237760	5242320	No, absolutely it should not be done. There are all kinds of things we can't do that we must
5242320	5250240	never do. In fact, it turns out that much of what is productive and
5252480	5260720	supportive and crucial to what I mean when I use the word intelligence,
5262480	5271200	much of that is prohibitive. It's what must not be done for it to continue to be possible
5272560	5273920	for us to be intelligent
5279280	5284320	or to exist at all. Obviously, if you're not existing, you can't be intelligent anymore.
5289040	5297680	I hope to return with a more educated perspective on assembly theory, but I want to encourage my
5297680	5311840	listeners to explore it because honestly, it looks like a discovery with the potential
5313440	5321840	to have more impact than relativity did or at least a discovery of a similar degree of impact.
5322720	5333600	If it isn't defeated, it will change the face of science as far as I can see
5334720	5336560	from my current understandings of it.
5340720	5347120	So for example, there's a degree of demonstrable complexity in a system
5347840	5364800	that is demonstrative of the activity, interference, or origination by an intelligent being or system.
5368000	5368640	In a sense,
5369600	5376800	here we might find proof of God, but we might also be able to just look
5381040	5393120	at nearly anything in the universe and look, God is in quotes. I think it's my perspective that
5393680	5403200	time space itself is, while not being fundamental, something productive of time space,
5407760	5414240	it is the result of a transcendent,
5414240	5425360	a layered array of transcendences in nature, in existence.
5444240	5462240	So assembly theory may give us the ability to empirically determine
5463040	5470720	whether it is possible
5473760	5479760	for most of what exists or any specific element
5480000	5496320	to have originated without the interference or creative engagement
5498160	5501200	of some intelligence or transcendence.
5504400	5508400	Now I may be misunderstanding that, but from what I can tell from what I heard,
5509360	5521280	there's a specific sort of cutoff point in the assembly index or the causal graph of an object
5522160	5528400	that is determinate, empirically determinate of whether or not it could
5529360	5535760	have come into existence without being purposefully or
5541280	5552720	or purposefully or tangentially resulting from purposeful activity.
5553360	5560880	And there may be some overlap here with other ideas. For example,
5561600	5570720	Cronin sneers at Scheldrake's morphogenesis, and yet there seems to be some
5573040	5579840	conceptual overlap. It may be very minimal, but there seems to be some conceptual overlap
5579840	5585120	between assembly theory and Scheldrake's concepts to me.
5588240	5595520	Because it may well turn out, for example, that in a given possibility space,
5596640	5606880	once you assemble the first salt crystal locally, it now becomes easy to, in Cronin's language,
5606880	5618720	teleport the properties to other objects. And that resembles the results of
5618720	5621040	Scheldrake's theory of morphogenesis.
5624720	5629360	So there's much more to learn here. I'm going to be spending some time digesting
5630640	5636400	more about assembly theory, and I encourage those of you who are interested to explore it.
5636720	5641840	It looks either it's going to get defeated completely, in which case it will produce no
5641840	5648720	useful results, which seems impossible to me, by the way, or it will get partially defeated in that
5648720	5665760	it is not, its scope will undergo radical limitation, or we have a new way of understanding
5668320	5675200	objects, identity, interactions, and historical development of such matters.
5675760	5682160	And it looks pretty likely that that's what's actually going to happen so far. So
5683920	5690000	thank you all for joining me. I look forward to learning and growing and seeing better together.
5691040	5696000	Again, sometime in the very near future, may your ways and lives be beautiful,
5697200	5705040	blessed, insightful, playful, and joyful. Bye-bye for now.
