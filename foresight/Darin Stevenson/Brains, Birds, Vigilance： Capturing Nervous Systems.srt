00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,080
Hello everybody. Welcome. I appreciate all of you who listen to my recordings and it

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,720
would help me a lot if you subscribe or like them or make a comment or ask a

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:33,160
question. My engagement is embarrassingly minute. So to reach more people, whatever

4
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,680
help you care to lend would be greatly appreciated. But I'm glad you're just

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,280
here and that I'm here. We're both still alive. Apparently we're breathing. I'm

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:53,920
crossing urban streets on foot, which is vastly more dangerous than we like to

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:03,240
think. It turns out that although there are many explanations for the complexity

8
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,680
of our human brains, I strongly suspect many of them are either completely

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:24,320
wrong or put the precedents on the wrong thing. Obviously social cognition is one

10
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,160
of them and it would be amazing if we developed complex brains to handle

11
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:40,640
social cognition. Only to discover that that would cause us to simulate, this is

12
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,000
one of the explanations for human brain complexity, that would cause us to simulate

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,160
another which would become the self a fiction. Because similar to one of my

14
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,360
fingers deciding that it is real and the rest of the hand is well whatever that

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:15,000
is, we would become catastrophically misguided thereafter, continue to produce

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,480
simulations, as well as representational culture, right, where we with each thing we

17
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:38,000
lose direct participation and relation with. We form a token and then thereafter

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,600
relate with the token instead of resurrecting the relationship and the

19
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:55,440
participation. And so we end up in an endless thirst trap where the more

20
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,920
representations we make, the more we are suffocating for participation and

21
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:08,280
meaningful roles and relationships, and this leads to a descending nightmare of

22
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:25,720
self-amplifying, what is the word, poverty, impoverishment. And this seems to

23
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:36,200
match up pretty damn good with what I see going on. But the social cognition

24
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,240
argument is powerful, the problem is it leads to an endless cascade of disasters

25
00:03:43,240 --> 00:04:00,840
as we stop relating with and in pod groups in which our identity and purpose

26
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:13,800
of motivations are useful, celebrated, effective, alive, vital, creative, playful,

27
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:21,040
joyful, fulfilling, rewarding. You know get together with a team of three people

28
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,360
and do anything meaningful, right. The rewards at the end of the day are off the

29
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:39,080
scale compared to any possible representation you could form. Yes, this

30
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:51,720
is all the change I have. The large coin is a dollar. You're welcome. That poor old

31
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:03,360
woman, my goodness, she must be 70 and she's living on the street. You see what

32
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:13,840
ends up happening, right, like without meaningful cohorts that are real, our

33
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,680
elderly end up dying alone in boxes or we're still on the street. And what do I

34
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:27,040
mean by our elderly? Okay, I get the problem with the language. I do. We could just say

35
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:36,880
the elderly, which we will all become. So that's us in the future. Okay, what else?

36
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:47,720
Where am I here? Social cognition, meaningful groups, pods. So in our situation,

37
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,840
what's the what's the antidote here? So the first is to teach each other to

38
00:05:52,840 --> 00:06:01,320
understand the representational gambit's foundations, right, which involve the

39
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,680
simulation of a separate self and then the inaction of a separable self that

40
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,840
becomes an isolated self. Ask yourself this question. I'll ask myself the same

41
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:25,160
question. How many times per month do I directly physically engage meat space

42
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,640
with other humans for meaningful purposes that I trust and are beautiful

43
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,800
and noble? So first of all, how often do I engage with meat space others for

44
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:47,880
anything? Myself, with a couple of trenchant exceptions, one being somebody I

45
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:55,920
live with, the number of times per month that happens for me is zero. And that's

46
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:08,200
part of why I make these videos, because this is a way for me to participate, to

47
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:25,840
work my vocabulary, which is important because my vocabulary is one of my

48
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,520
as a writer and someone who values articulate intelligent speech. My

49
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,920
vocabulary is crucially important. I've worked hard to develop it over my life,

50
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:50,080
although it was natural for me to do that because of my interests. And also to

51
00:07:50,800 --> 00:08:06,800
create a context where I'm doing something meaningful in the day to me that

52
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,760
may provide benefit for distance others, some of whom I know, some of whom I love,

53
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:23,160
many of whom are unknown to me. There's just sort of people who manage to find my

54
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:30,640
channel. But this is not particularly crucially important to my point. I'm

55
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,800
merely trying to say that ask yourself the question. How often over some

56
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,840
interval, say 90 days, are you able to get together with other humans and enact

57
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,480
your humanity intelligently, creatively, meaningfully for a purpose you believe

58
00:08:50,480 --> 00:09:00,720
in? And even if today in our time, right, circa 2024, that's a virtual get

59
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,520
together. Let's count those. We'll open the aperture from meat space only to

60
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,240
virtual context. But you can see the radical difference, right? Suppose that

61
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,960
I'm just going to pick something incredibly trivial. Three neighbors once a

62
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,760
month get together, wander around their neighborhood together and pick up trash.

63
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:39,480
Not particularly heroic, but powerful because they're doing something they

64
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,960
believe in and they will communicate and act as a single member, right? Act like a

65
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:53,240
hand. In fact, they'll literally be picking things up. It's very handlike. And

66
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:00,680
of course, it turns out that the hand is one of the best metaphors for human

67
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:09,480
togetherness and unity that you can possibly come up with. It might be the

68
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,760
best because there's there's just there's nothing. It's a part of your

69
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,360
physical body, right? So hello.

70
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:36,400
It was developed by evolution. So the model is not a human intellectual model.

71
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,440
It's an evolutionary model. It's older than old.

72
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:55,520
It's a really good model for the actual nature of human existence being

73
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:04,000
interiority. I noticed that the first thing that happens when you destroy

74
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,200
human social groups is that you get individual fingers attempting to do

75
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:21,240
things to enact their humanity in ways that require a hand. I'd love to see

76
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,480
any one attempt to use any of our tools. Though, you know, they might succeed with

77
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,600
a few. Try and use pliers with a single finger. I mean, try to do anything with a

78
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,480
single finger. You might be able to sort of play some kind of musical

79
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,520
instrument as long as it didn't require your breath. You could plunk your way

80
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,000
along something with a single finger, presuming that you had a hand that the

81
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,600
finger was on the end of. The way that our systems work is as if they amputate

82
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,880
the fingers and then scream at them for not being able to do all the things that

83
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:06,560
a hand could do. So obviously what I'm trying to say here is that the

84
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:15,000
embodiment and fulfillment of our potentials as human beings naturally

85
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:28,520
requires communion. Potting up. You will see very few intelligent animals

86
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:39,440
there are exceptions that don't pot up. One exception would be octopuses. The

87
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:54,040
other polarity are the organisms that form supergroups. These would be creatures

88
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:03,720
that form hives. Ants, bees, wasps, certain species of spider form

89
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:16,360
massive web communities. Unclear. It may be that the fundamental problem with our

90
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:28,680
species is just that we form misguided supergroups. So what was I thinking

91
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:38,320
originally here? Oh yes. All right.

92
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:49,040
So we've actually I've actually covered much more ground than I was imagining

93
00:13:49,040 --> 00:14:00,240
when I began my talk and what was inspiring me. Okay so I'm going to circle

94
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:12,320
way back here. I sometimes form relationships with animals by offering

95
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:24,880
them food and there are certain animals with which it is less dangerous for

96
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:35,080
both of us than it would be with others. So for example I am currently in the

97
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:41,200
San Francisco Botanical Gardens. The coyotes here are reasonably well known

98
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:50,600
to me. I see them commonly. I could easily form relationships with them by

99
00:14:50,600 --> 00:15:01,760
bringing them some meat. Any transaction between humans and wild things,

100
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:09,320
especially city humans, will produce a lot of danger for both participants.

101
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Primarily because the human is dumb about what is important for the animals.

102
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,160
Don't know if you heard that. That was a coyote.

103
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,080
Let's see if it, yeah it's yipping.

104
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,080
All right let's examine this problem here.

105
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:58,320
Okay this is a really good, really good instance of synchronicity.

106
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:13,040
It's crucial for all animals to avoid danger and one of the ways they avoid

107
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:19,800
danger is by avoiding calling attention to themselves. There are some situations

108
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:29,960
under which it is relatively more safe to call attention to oneself and others

109
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:39,960
under which it's extremely dangerous. There's only one animal here around here

110
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,600
that is a threat to the coyote and that's homo sapiens. If I were to begin

111
00:16:49,600 --> 00:17:00,120
feeding a coyote and I could delude myself into thinking this is a good way

112
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,760
to establish a relationship with them and to nourish that relationship

113
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:18,360
literally, physically. Okay the reason that coyote is calling out at full

114
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:28,880
volume in broad daylight. Very dangerous thing for it to do is that there are

115
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:41,200
sirens. So the humans make a machine that mimics a signal that essentially

116
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:51,600
causes, nearly forces the coyote to reveal its location. I mean if you wanted

117
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,560
to hunt coyotes you could just bring a device with you that produced sirens and

118
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:06,600
they would light up their location with calls because they're physically, to some

119
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:19,040
degree, they are physically unable to resist that stimuli.

120
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:41,360
Hi. Now if I were to begin feeding coyotes around here what would naturally

121
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:53,600
happen is that I would interfere with their natural tendency, one might call

122
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:00,680
it, at least around here, to avoid contact with humans. Now if I live, if I were not

123
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:09,480
a city dweller and I lived in the wilderness and I wanted to have a

124
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,480
relationship with the coyotes, there are a number of different ways I might go

125
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:24,560
about forming that relationship. Perhaps the most important but least blatant is

126
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:33,680
to imagine that the coyotes form an emissary to the humans and I form an

127
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,520
emissary from the humans and in my imagination and perhaps in my dreaming

128
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:48,480
me and the emissary meet and we exchange protections and potencies and

129
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:58,640
medicine and so forth. Humans are unlikely, modern particularly, unlikely to pursue

130
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:07,480
that kind of connection. Many of them would not believe that it's real but

131
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,040
that would be a good way and then perhaps I could ask the coyote emissary

132
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,400
questions and it could ask me questions and it might even have things to say

133
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,440
to my people, things that wished to be communicated to my people about their

134
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:34,480
people and our ancient union because some animals, synanthropes particularly,

135
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:46,080
have had more than a million years of relationship with Homo sapiens and you

136
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,800
could say well our species really isn't that old, are you sure? Yes, our species

137
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:58,440
isn't that single age old or it probably is. I don't know what the current model

138
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,760
is of our estimated age of Homo sapiens. Probably measured in flat years though

139
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,560
which there never were so our age is actually the time since the appearance

140
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,160
of Homo sapiens in the in the records so to speak times the number of humans

141
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:26,840
who have lived one year right and for each year we'd have to add age so our

142
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,320
actual age and the age of our relationships with synanthropes is

143
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:44,280
absurdly enormous. Bees, ants, wasps, mice, rats, porcupines, possums, skunks,

144
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:54,920
moles, gophers, house cats, house dogs, coyotes, wolves,

145
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:15,560
blue jays, magpies, sparrows, hawks, eagles, raptors, owls, crows and ravens, spiders,

146
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:24,480
all of these are synanthropes, these are creatures that prosper and are used to

147
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:34,920
the proximity of human symbionts, companions. Extended body is the concept

148
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:45,080
here not Darren has crow friends, extended body, I am crow, I am blue jay, I am

149
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:52,960
sparrow, I am spider, these organisms as they interact with me extend my

150
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,360
intelligence, they extend my senses dramatically, I will learn things from

151
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,760
observing them that are formally impossible for me to discover on my

152
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:14,000
own quote unquote. So in a sense what I'm advocating here is the formulation not

153
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:24,560
merely of a human relational hand-like situation but a very complex hand-like

154
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:32,520
situation involving many non-humans including the non-synanthropes presuming

155
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:39,200
that there is any such thing because synanthropy is a matter of degree, not

156
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:49,880
necessarily, you know, binary polarization either is a synanthrop or isn't.

157
00:23:49,880 --> 00:24:01,640
On if you take the planet as a whole and you realize that like your comparator is

158
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,600
what we know of time-space

159
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,960
so if you take sorry I'm having an actual exchange with synanthropes right now

160
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:30,640
again ironic or synchronous or both

161
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:41,440
if you take as your time-space as your comparator then the earth is basically

162
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:49,400
like a little droplet of water in a vast desert and that droplet there's nothing

163
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:57,040
that isn't synanthropic there because essentially from this perspective from

164
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,360
the perspective of time-space toward the earth rather than the earth out you

165
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,320
know the human out to nature nature out to time-space which is the perspective

166
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:15,120
we are trained to take by our language and its categorical gambits it's absurd

167
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:23,080
and stupidifying categorical gambit. The whole package of lies that comes along

168
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:31,840
with English courtroom mind war mind anthropocentricity terracentricity all of

169
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,040
these things so from from time-space toward earth what you obviously have

170
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,440
here and if you're not capable of thinking this way I will argue you're

171
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,800
barely capable of thinking at all is what you have here is a single organism

172
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,880
that takes many forms now it may turn out to be absolutely a physical fact that

173
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:05,080
that's what you've got here one imagines for example a space faring organism

174
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:16,160
that I'll call starfish it naturally swims between the stars in a proto form

175
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,320
that proto form could be incredibly profusely transcendent not merely

176
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:30,080
intelligent and it may only be a cellular form and still be transcendent

177
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,000
there's no reason to believe bacteria are probably not

178
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,240
representationally intelligent but it's unlikely that we could get the forms of

179
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:53,800
intelligence we're familiar with in human beings without them and so which is

180
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:01,520
superior right is the origin superior or is the results superior well once you

181
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,120
decide that one of them has to be superior you're already having courtroom

182
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:14,240
my point is just that it may well be that a single organism was primordial

183
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,000
here and that everything that you see that lives on this planet is actually

184
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,360
starfish's morphs right morphs of starfish one thing one one organism it

185
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:38,920
may also be that that organ that there were multiple forms of starfish that

186
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:44,440
lived that came here dwelt here there might have been some competition stuff

187
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:53,600
that looks like war but isn't but yeah you got one organism here so you should

188
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,240
definitely be able to think that way and you should probably think that way in

189
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:05,320
precedence to thinking oh these are all separate Darwinian Lee competitive

190
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:12,760
morphs that last thing can't be true primarily it's the problem with the

191
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,000
idea of competition there's no such thing as competition without symbiosis if

192
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:27,000
you don't have cooperation you don't get forms complex enough to compete so

193
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:36,600
the emphasis on competition is almost certainly a bad move all right if I

194
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,920
feed the coyotes in the botanical gardens it will reduce their suspicion

195
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:51,320
and avoidance of humans in general what that will mean in very short order here

196
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,680
is that the coyotes I feed will eventually realize ah humans are a source

197
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:06,520
of food food is difficult and dangerous to get here I'm gonna occasionally

198
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,600
approach humans some of those humans will have children some of them may have

199
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:20,440
dogs and coyotes will generally see small dogs small coyotes smaller

200
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,160
coyotes will see small dogs actually all coyotes will most coyotes will see

201
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:33,360
small dogs as prey that's a that's a good meal that's fairly easy to obtain so

202
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,480
they may go after those small dogs and that will result almost certainly in

203
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,360
the humans killing them particularly here in the botanical gardens

204
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:08,720
similarly if I feed the blue jays peanuts which they love

205
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:23,800
that signal

206
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:33,880
resembles playing a siren in the territory of coyotes

207
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:56,120
an analogy would be dropping hundred dollar bills along a busy freeway why a

208
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:08,360
busy freeway well for the blue jays many of them live in the hunting territory

209
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:19,440
of hawks and so when I come with my peanuts it doesn't shut off their

210
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:30,040
vigilance their vigilance but it radically reduces it it's funny I have

211
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:45,440
learned to recognize the shadow of the birds that I know so that sometimes I

212
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:54,600
can detect them behind me so if I put peanuts out and if I'm not careful

213
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,680
about it and I'm not attentive and I had to learn this by error by making bad

214
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:09,520
mistakes costly mistakes then I'm interfering with their vigilance

215
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:16,640
who's responsibility is it it's not a courtroom this is a communal animal me

216
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:31,520
plus the birds right so I also love the hawks and I have some relationship with

217
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:42,920
them as well but I don't want them to eat my blue jay friends obviously I want

218
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:54,800
them to get fed now all of this is very complex the problem is that I am not

219
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:09,320
aware ordinarily of the environmental relational historical biological

220
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:20,760
necessities of blue jay life or hawk life or coyote life and so if I wander

221
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:32,800
into that stumbling around like a magical thinking human an indictment that I

222
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,600
certainly deserve but I'm now beginning to understand in a in a richer way I

223
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:50,920
like to think I'm learning I will cause harm where my goal is to have beneficial

224
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:59,960
relations usually beneficial relations and that will be emotionally painful for

225
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:16,200
me because my desires are not utilitarian I am aware that the animal

226
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:32,720
intelligences including the insects will in a sense make offerings of

227
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:43,160
intelligence dreaming communal identity they will benefit me they will try to

228
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:51,480
figure out what what will benefit the one who is our friend and many of those

229
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,720
offerings will not be ordinary it's not like they're gonna bring me cash money

230
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,160
though in the case of a representational animal like say a particularly precocious

231
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:12,480
raven such a thing could take place it could bring me objects so if I want to

232
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:22,040
actually honor the relationship I have to to some degree protect the living

233
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:40,400
beings from the rapacious and omnicidal stupidity of my species and also my own

234
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:50,480
ignorance it will be difficult for me to form physical relationships with the

235
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:58,360
coyotes in this garden without feeding them if I feed them it is very likely

236
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:04,320
that will lead to them being shot by parts in Iraq or whoever does animal

237
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,520
control whatever parts in Iraq will call animal control will come out and

238
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:18,760
quote-unquote basically need to obliterate them you know more stories of

239
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:27,720
during stupidity so one night I was sitting in my room and out one of my

240
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:36,240
windows I noticed a family of coyotes excuse me a family of raccoons boy

241
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:47,400
here's a if you want to talk about courage motivation intelligence difficulty

242
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:58,720
heroism one pride one standout exemplar of this would be raccoon mothers in

243
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:06,080
urban settings there's no one to babysit the children the children like

244
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:16,720
any children are precocious playful curious very difficult to orient meanwhile

245
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,760
this mother has to bring them through places with dogs and cars and broken

246
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:30,640
bottles and poison and every kind of dogs every kind of threat cats you can

247
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:38,080
imagine coyotes every night every night that mother is going to bring their

248
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:45,240
children through a battlefield of things that will kill them and her so one night

249
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:57,200
I'm in my room it's late quiet and I hear the chortling of the of the

250
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:06,640
children naturally stupid as I am and also you know at that point prone to

251
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:16,400
magical thinking I emulate the sound back to them what happens the family of

252
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,800
raccoon stops dead in the middle of the street trying to determine the source of

253
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:28,280
that sound meanwhile a car doing 40 miles an hour comes up the street and

254
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:38,280
somehow I think that even though they were in the car's path when it passed I

255
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:47,080
think they all managed to survive unscathed I am not sure one of them

256
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,880
might have been struck by the undercarriage of the car however if that

257
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,400
were true there should have been a dead raccoon nearby in the morning probably

258
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:08,080
baby in any case if you want to imagine me cringing to the core of my being for

259
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:20,680
a moment you know I thought I was being playful and human and intelligent and

260
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:26,960
recognizing them and relating with them what I did not realize is they are on a

261
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,680
street there is traffic in the street this is why I made the metaphor of dropping

262
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:44,920
$100 bills on the freeway when I put out peanuts for the blue jays I had best be

263
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:51,400
complicit in their survival concerns vigilance protocols I had best

264
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:58,360
understand something deep about these because if I don't I am I am giving

265
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:07,200
them an irresistible stimulus in a terrain where there are hawks not only

266
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:18,320
that there are most likely nearly all of these would be males by the way case you

267
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,960
think gender doesn't matter there are most likely people who would kill the

268
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,000
blue jays for fun so once they learned for example that you could bring a blue

269
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:41,640
jay to your hand with a peanut they would do so for nefarious purposes the

270
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:51,640
other day I was in a part of the garden where there's a scrub jay that knows me

271
00:40:52,080 --> 00:41:03,960
by the way that jay remembered me I fed it one time like five years ago and that

272
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:11,400
jay remembered me every time it saw me thereafter the animals have their

273
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,240
memories are unencumbered by representation so they have a lot of

274
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:28,760
memory resource to enact it's funny what a long road it's taking me to get back

275
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:42,200
to my original motivational thought here that started this this topic so for some

276
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:59,000
birds the appearance of a peanut is so compelling that they become like their

277
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,320
nervous system actually divides against itself and their ordinary instincts

278
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:14,960
for self and companion protection at least briefly collapse into must get

279
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:26,640
that peanut before something else does and so this messes up their vigilance

280
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:39,920
activities now a brief you know a brief

281
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:53,520
divergence from protocol probably won't get you killed at least not the first time

282
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:06,120
oh yeah see I was just feeding them and a hawk has come one of the coopers has

283
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:18,480
come to see oh it was turned away from you know it's hunting I respect that hawk

284
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:30,720
and have felt its talons because again ignorance got in trouble with the hawks

285
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:39,920
so there are some kinds of stimulus and you know the humans have the same problem this

286
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:48,480
is why social media has become a terrifying this manipulative disease you can see that

287
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:54,000
the goal is to capture attention which has for some time been the new form of cash

288
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:02,880
and this is natural for an organism that's collapsing away from participatory relation

289
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:11,360
meaningful roles and relationships into representations money porn social media

290
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:25,520
shows video games etc the coyote can't help it it's not powerless but it's nearly powerless

291
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:33,120
when the siren is near it directly captures its nervous system and this is what happens to us

292
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,400
with our technologies we undergo nervous system capture

293
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,960
now there's a blue jay in a part of the garden that remembers me from a long time ago a couple

294
00:44:46,960 --> 00:45:00,080
weeks ago I was I gave it a peanut and because it's a male and it knows me it will come to my hand

295
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,960
now by the way that's a particularly interesting situation let me explain why

296
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:18,080
if I put the peanut on the ground or on a branch the jay must do if it wants to live

297
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:30,560
it's going to check maybe between eight and 30 vectors before it moves and then when it lands

298
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,160
it will recheck those vectors ordinarily the jay will have a companion up high

299
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,760
they can directly check with to see if it can't if there's something it can't see yet

300
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:55,440
and this complex participated relationship of mutual positive vigilance keeps both jays safe

301
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,600
relatively well

302
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:14,480
now if instead I am aware that there's a male and the male knows me I hold out a peanut in my hand

303
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:26,160
the male can be relatively certain that it can cross the interval between its perch and my palm

304
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,400
safely because it's a very short interval and it's fast

305
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:41,840
and grabbing the peanut from my outstretched hand it doesn't have to do a bunch of vector checking

306
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:53,760
because a hawk is very unlikely to attempt to take a jay from a human palm

307
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:06,960
unless the hawk has previously succeeded at such an endeavor so in a way the male's

308
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,760
willingness to come to my hand

309
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,440
is a bit more safe

310
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,400
than coming to ground

311
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:33,760
huh what's she shooting oh I see sparrows are eating seeds in a bush

312
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,440
interesting that we call photography shooting

313
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,360
leads to a whole other conversation wherein

314
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:53,200
human vision is understood to be a complex series of rays

315
00:47:53,600 --> 00:48:02,880
that travel out from the eye bouncing back from the things these rays touch

316
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,560
so in a sense the male that comes to my hand is fairly safe

317
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,720
and as long as such interactions between me and the birds are infrequent

318
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:30,320
it's unlikely to produce their death unless there's something wrong with the peanuts

319
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,520
or conceivably but awfully unlikely

320
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,920
they acquire some microbe from my skin surface or something

321
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:54,720
so I was feeding this this male and there were a couple of men approaching and they saw the

322
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:05,280
bird come to my hand and they said uh do you speak with birds and I playfully said doesn't everyone

323
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:16,240
laugh and made some comment like well I don't I don't see the birds coming to the hands of people

324
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:23,040
here's a male scrub jay that knows me so now I will do the thing that I was just talking about

325
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:30,960
where the bird comes to hand and he lands briefly on my hand when he grabs the peanut now if there's

326
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:39,520
a female around I can put I'll usually put a peanut out for her

327
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,680
so that she can also have the benefit of

328
00:49:52,400 --> 00:50:02,160
what a birder I know called bird heroine which he meant peanuts so yeah the guys said said this to me

329
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,960
and I said well

330
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,480
peanut is a language understood by many birds

331
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,680
and they laughed

332
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,560
so

333
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,360
you know the humans do some degree of monkey see monkey do

334
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:40,400
so additionally if I'm out in public and I'm witnessed relating with animals by giving them food

335
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:47,360
creates problems very unlikely that other humans are even

336
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:54,960
even similarly sensitive to the well-being of the creatures that I am and I've made terrible mistakes

337
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,680
not on purpose so yeah I put some in danger

338
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,800
and what I was thinking when I began this walk and talk was

339
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,960
there's some crows that know me and

340
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,400
when I'm near them when I'm near their their terrain

341
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,720
they group up and follow me

342
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,720
and people might see this

343
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:41,760
and I wonder what they would think if they noticed I mean I often wonder if people think actually at

344
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:49,520
all but I wonder what they would think if they saw you know five crows following me up

345
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:58,160
up or down some street in the city and I thought that they might think I'm a witch

346
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:08,960
human's naturally

347
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:17,200
surveil each other and they do so sometimes in obvious ways and sometimes surreptitiously

348
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,080
I was just being surveyed surveilled by a male in the garden

349
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:30,480
so yeah I wonder what the humans might think but the thing that I find interesting is that

350
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:36,720
there's a very clear pecking order in the group of approximately five crows

351
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:45,760
that know me well and I give them peanuts sometimes

352
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:52,880
so they know that I am

353
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:03,840
I'm gonna bring them something good to eat and it's winter harder to get food colder need more

354
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:12,160
need more fuel it's very it's relatively easy to discern the genders

355
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,160
in the corvids behaviorally

356
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,600
I have almost never seen if ever

357
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,840
a female who's relatively adventurous and aggressive

358
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,600
whereas the males the males will come right down and grab a peanut and

359
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,040
they won't merely grab a peanut they'll check the other peanuts they'll like do a weight test

360
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,480
they'll try to figure out which peanut is best so they might pick up with their beaks three or four

361
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:57,360
peanuts before the females even get near the food and

362
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,320
so that creates a problem where it's difficult to get a peanut to the females at all

363
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,240
um the male crows have a craw so that they can

364
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:27,440
store one probably one peanut maybe two if we're talking raven

365
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,280
um

366
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:31,840
and

367
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,680
so they can grab up you know most of the peanuts

368
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,880
and and the females are so timid in in this particular group

369
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,960
that although they may land near where the males are grabbing peanuts

370
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:02,160
and they may make some tentative passes toward peanuts um what you will notice

371
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:10,000
with crows and ravens is they have a complex neurological behavior where

372
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,520
they all make a pass at something they intend to grab and then bounce

373
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,160
right like leap backward leap away they'll make a pass towards something and leap away from it

374
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,640
and when they grab something they'll leap away from from it even though they've got it

375
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:38,880
and this seems to be a what humans call an instinctual behavior most corvids share it

376
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,000
I imagine I haven't seen all the different kinds of corvids I've rarely been able to

377
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:50,240
observe magpies um I think I've seen one in my life for a few minutes in real life

378
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,240
though I have sometimes observed them in video by the way there's a bunch of

379
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,000
so convocation of crows

380
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,760
and they seem stirred up

381
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:21,520
yes I am speaking of your people please do not poop right on my head

382
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,800
so interesting the foreground background feature of vision because

383
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,320
in the foreground I see the crows and in the background there's these

384
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,440
like

385
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,600
visually challenging puffs of cloud

386
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:57,040
that what I mean by visually challenging is that they

387
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,560
if you look at one area of the cloud forms

388
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,840
the others seem

389
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,080
the others

390
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:23,360
could almost be in motion the kind of motion that one sees in anything in the foveal vision

391
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:32,560
under the influence of psychedelics this kind of internal efflorescing outward

392
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,200
like transformational non-motion

393
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:49,520
that envision probably due to forms of neural feedback still things appear to be moving

394
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,440
the whole context may appear to be breathing so forth so the clouds are kind of

395
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,720
um relevant with this

396
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:08,400
interior spirit or energy although I am not under the influence of any drugs at the moment

397
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,800
unless you consider peanuts a drug I did eat a couple

398
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:24,560
so it's hard to get peanuts to the crow girls and I have a natural

399
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,560
um

400
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,160
tropism

401
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:48,000
for the underdog for the little one for the rejected one for the outsider so forth

402
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,600
so

403
00:58:53,840 --> 00:59:00,560
I remember one beautiful afternoon fairly safe this this I think where I walked to the ocean

404
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:06,720
after not having seen it in many many years and I brought some peanuts with me and it turned out

405
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:15,840
that when I got there I encountered an enclave of ravens and so first thing I think I did

406
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,040
I'm not really sure actually which thing came first let me be

407
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:26,000
we speak with integrity about this I'm not sure I may have given them peanuts first

408
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,680
I may have sang to them first

409
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:41,840
but both things were offerings of respect and uh honoring them

410
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:52,800
honoring their people and their spirit honoring our communal

411
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,080
relationship

412
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:14,640
and I remember that there was one raven

413
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,320
it's funny how emotionally effective

414
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,440
a affect effective this is for me affect

415
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,040
when I remember this I'm starting to choke up

416
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,320
there was one raven

417
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:54,800
there might have been a few ravens that I could visibly detect ticks around their eyes

418
01:00:54,800 --> 01:01:00,480
but there was one raven who its eyes were surrounded with ticks

419
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:09,280
and if you've ever watched young young crows and ravens

420
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,160
you will commonly see brother and sister pairs preening each other

421
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,280
and maybe brother and brother pairs maybe sister and sister pairs

422
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,960
I don't know how common it is that a clutch produces one male and one female

423
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,680
but you will see them preening each other

424
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,080
right they will come very close together on a telephone wire or something

425
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,560
and they will preen each other or one of them will preen the other and they will

426
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,760
request you can see them request preening

427
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:56,400
and I knew as I was looking at the raven with all of the ticks

428
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:02,400
that it was not treated well by the rest of the

429
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,200
they can be very mean in their in their social pods

430
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,040
corvids well the crows and the ravens at least

431
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,240
if the jays form extended communities I've not seen them

432
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,760
I know that magpies seem to but what I realized when looking at the the raven was

433
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,120
first of all obviously this bird is not being preened

434
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,400
and it cannot remove the ticks but any other creature could

435
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:54,880
any of those jays any any of those ravens excuse me could have preened it

436
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:05,040
and they would have received a tasty nutritious insect meal by so new me

437
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,680
at least you know in my thinking confused as it may be

438
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:22,720
so I worked extra hard to make sure that raven got some peanuts

439
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:35,200
and having fed them and sung to them I walked up the

440
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:50,480
I walked up the shoreline where was I walking north I guess I can't remember probably

441
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:56,480
I walked up the shoreline and I acquired an entourage of ravens

442
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:10,320
so either you know if someone were watching me they would either think this is a magically potent

443
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:20,160
person very few people would think that or they would wonder why they wouldn't have a conjecture

444
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:27,200
they just wonder what the hell is going on here or they would intelligently infer that I had given

445
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:45,680
them food it's pretty hard to get a peanut to the girls in the little crow enclave

446
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,960
but what I noticed the other day that I thought was great

447
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:57,120
was that it appeared to me that one of the males cashed a peanut in his

448
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,960
his claw

449
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,480
and then when the other crows weren't on the ground

450
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:15,760
exuded the peanut for the bird that I imagined to be his sister

451
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:22,960
or could be his mate to consume and I thought that was really cool

452
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:36,160
you know I life is very challenging and difficult and much more so in a world filled with machines

453
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:48,640
and perhaps somewhat naively I believe I'm an extreme altruist an exalt

454
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:56,800
um in Andrea Kuzhevsky's nomenclature

455
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:06,400
I generally will travel in the direction of mutual benefit naturally

456
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:16,880
in any way that I can understand how to do so my heart is more intelligent than my brain at this

457
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,880
time much more intelligent and so I get confused by my thoughts

458
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,840
often I make mistakes

459
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,960
there's an explanation for the complexity of the human brain that I prefer

460
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:55,600
which is that we might not be the alpha symbiont

461
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:04,320
and what I mean by that is something really weird I don't mean the symbiont that dominates

462
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:12,560
overall others or is the most important I mean the symbiont

463
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:21,360
that naturally becomes the summation lens of all of the other intelligences around it

464
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,840
all the forms of intelligence produced by starfish fungal microbial

465
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:38,080
vegetal animal land creatures water creatures air creatures living place being skybeam

466
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:43,360
all these intelligences and

467
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,400
you know I think the humans have this role

468
01:07:53,520 --> 01:08:07,920
there's a bunch of very intense child signaling going on there

469
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,920
so

470
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,880
pause for a moment here while a loud noise doesn't get recorded

471
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:34,000
it seems to me that I've said this before in a very real sense the human species is the

472
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,120
the arbiter

473
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:51,040
of the well-being or destruction of everything that isn't too small for us to see and much of what is

474
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,840
so whether or not

475
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:04,240
some creator god divinely mandated that we were the shepherds for life on earth

476
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:13,440
it turns out to be the case by fiat or by uh by function anyway

477
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:32,000
now I think there are other similar alpha symbionts like us on earth

478
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:40,480
and some of the microbial ones might be far more profound in the scope of their

479
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,800
relationships than we tend to be

480
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:06,720
clearly in the waters the whales and dolphins represent living summation lenses of the aquatic

481
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,720
intelligences

482
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,760
how ironic the humans would slaughter them thereby denying themselves access to those organs of

483
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:27,200
intelligence perception and relation for what for the commodities their dead bodies produce

484
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:36,000
those are so worth pennies on the trillions of dollars of what is being disposed of as

485
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,200
usual for humans trapped in representational cognition

486
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,280
but yes our form has incredible unique

487
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:58,800
monumentally profound faculties and abilities that are disposed of almost entirely by our

488
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,280
representational behavior cognition

489
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:13,280
our great forgetting our our amnesia

490
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,800
our actively self-generating amnesia

491
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,560
so I like to think that

492
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:47,360
the complexity of the physical organ that we refer to as our brains pretending it's

493
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,200
distinct again pretending that

494
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:01,200
obvious it should be blatantly obvious that again one organism first the singularity of

495
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:05,520
the organism has precedence to any organ by many orders of magnitude so that

496
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:15,760
if you say the word brain you're actually referring to the entire body and the extended

497
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:21,600
environmental relationships and the entire history of life on earth and the

498
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,160
potential and future of life on this planet

499
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,480
because there is no brain without a heart you don't have a brain without kidneys

500
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,320
no skin no brain no mouth no brain

501
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,280
there are certain organs you can do away with and still have a brain

502
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,080
but not most of them

503
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:56,640
and the humans are doing the same damn thing to the earth right they are they are ripping the

504
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:03,520
organs of the earth out selling them on the black market for cars and guns and bombs and

505
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:09,760
shit and terror and torture and cages and awfulness the species

506
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,640
can't tell if this guy's yelling at himself or if he's yelling at his phone

507
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,480
so yeah I mean if the earth is a single animal and the humans are an organ of that animal

508
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,720
they are an organ destroying organ of that animal

509
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,400
most of us have no desire to be anything resembling that

510
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:48,800
and ordinarily we would have a fairly minimal and perhaps relatively net positive effect

511
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:58,720
on the biosphere and the environment particularly if our population were limited

512
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:08,720
but also if the object population that we produce were dramatically limited

513
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:11,920
this is interesting

514
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,000
many people complain about the human population certainly it's a problem

515
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:31,120
but the actual problem seems to me not to be the number of human bodies but rather what the masses

516
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:37,920
of them tend to do and one of those things is madly proliferate objects

517
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:47,520
and thus create from living beings and places effectively garbage and machines

518
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:57,440
so I think there's another explanation for the complexity of our brains

519
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:06,560
which is that the meta organism that earth is naturally produces in her organs

520
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:22,800
complex meta symbionts capable of astonishing feats of symbiotic sensing relation cognition

521
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:33,760
participation so forth and the more of those the earth has the the more alive her own

522
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:44,160
this creates webs of jewels in the net of her transcendentions

523
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:56,160
expanding it dramatically to whatever degree those meta metacognitives and meta symbionts

524
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:06,240
uh remain true to the beautiful and noble and heroic missions of living beings

525
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,080
on a delicate world in time space

526
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,280
there's a my foot there's a little plastic elephant

527
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:25,280
or maybe it's a pig

528
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,760
I wonder how many billions of those we've produced while the elephants and pigs were slaughtered

529
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:42,320
you know at the species level we are deadly poisoned to living worlds presently in our in

530
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:50,720
our current whatever is orienting our groups is malignant fundamentally malignant and life

531
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:57,680
despising intelligence despising because any intelligence that tears itself to shreds must

532
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:08,480
fail to qualify and similarly any intelligence that attacks its own foundations in relation

533
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:17,040
and organism must fail to qualify it's not clear at all individual humans are can be relatively

534
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:26,240
intelligent small groups of bonded humans can be preternaturally intelligent but large disoriented

535
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:32,800
cohorts of humans tend to be omnicidal in our time and that's a game with a short future

536
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:39,680
so one thing that I want to encourage you to do and I'm going to try and take my

537
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,680
own advice here is get together with a small group of other intelligent humans

538
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:54,320
and come up with a mission that you all believe in and go on have that adventure together in the

539
01:17:54,320 --> 01:18:04,640
living world very hard to emulate that sound

540
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:14,320
it's funny there's there's ravens right above me

541
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:22,640
and one has to wonder if right if this is accidental

542
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:34,640
so

543
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:40,640
it's a pair

544
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:50,320
now I can't tell what their signals mean so I can't really tell

545
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,960
if they're upset

546
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,960
right I can't really tell

547
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:06,800
if they're upset at my behavior I've been circling a tree if they're curious

548
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:11,040
or something else

549
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,320
if we want to experience the potentials of our intelligence our dreaming aspects

550
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,160
our transcendence as human beings

551
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,120
there are paths where this can be pursued in isolation

552
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:38,880
but if you want an accelerant

553
01:19:43,760 --> 01:20:00,080
go with trusted others into adventure meaningful relation meaningful roles nick names private lexicons

554
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:09,360
explore the palm that unites the fingers and you will never be disappointed

555
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:16,000
you might have misadventures things may go wrong but even from those you will learn

556
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:28,880
very profoundly and quickly and you will develop new senses new abilities new perspectives

557
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,160
so it turns out the guy that was yelling nearby is yelling into his phone

558
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:47,440
I wish you beautiful lives and ways companions adventures love and play and creativity

559
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:58,640
and I look forward to learning together again very soon thank you for joining me bye bye for now

560
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:00,640
you
