00:00.000 --> 00:12.320
Hello, everybody.

00:12.320 --> 00:18.400
Welcome.

00:18.400 --> 00:27.920
It's sometime on a Gregorian Monday afternoon in March of 2024.

00:27.920 --> 00:41.920
This is the weirdest year in the history of my life.

00:41.920 --> 00:50.920
I'm out for a wander.

00:50.920 --> 00:58.920
I'm by tracks on the path.

00:58.920 --> 01:04.920
I don't know if any of my ancestors were skillful trackers,

01:04.920 --> 01:12.920
but there is a kind of a genetic predisposition I suspect.

01:12.920 --> 01:20.920
I suspect this from knowing members of my family

01:20.920 --> 01:38.920
and watching them in various situational contexts.

01:38.920 --> 01:48.920
My mother used to have an annoying habit,

01:48.920 --> 01:58.920
and I recently discovered some letters from him to my mother in his teenage, late teens.

01:58.920 --> 02:10.920
I think they were 17 or something.

02:10.920 --> 02:14.920
There were some letters from him that I haven't actually read.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.920
I've only seen the beginning of one of them.

02:18.920 --> 02:32.920
He was about to launch into a dissertation on a system that he had stumbled on in his observational mind.

02:32.920 --> 02:46.920
A system for getting a perspective on people and situations that might be understood as preternatural.

02:46.920 --> 03:02.920
He implies that in the following letters he will encode a system.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.920
A system of seeing.

03:04.920 --> 03:12.920
He never spoke of this during my life,

03:12.920 --> 03:20.920
but he did seem to have an uncanny influence among humans,

03:20.920 --> 03:24.920
and sometimes with dogs.

03:24.920 --> 03:34.920
But the annoying habit that he had was he understood the language of film,

03:34.920 --> 03:44.920
and he could see very quickly from the observation of subtle cues what was about to take place,

03:44.920 --> 03:48.920
and I thought to myself, I remember thinking to myself as a kid,

03:48.920 --> 03:52.920
of course my mother would become very angry with this.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.920
You're ruining it.

03:54.920 --> 03:58.920
My dad would sort of chuckle.

03:58.920 --> 04:02.920
It's obvious, but I thought this was very peculiar.

04:02.920 --> 04:08.920
I didn't know anyone else at the time, had no experience of others with this skill,

04:08.920 --> 04:10.920
and sometimes his predictions would be uncanny, right?

04:10.920 --> 04:20.920
He was a bit of a detective.

04:20.920 --> 04:30.920
Similarly, other members of my family, particularly my sister,

04:30.920 --> 04:42.920
display an almost dangerous awareness of tiny details that others cannot see,

04:42.920 --> 04:50.920
or do not notice.

04:50.920 --> 04:56.920
With most of my male friends, I can quickly predict where they're going to go conversationally,

04:56.920 --> 05:02.920
and this is perhaps part of the experience of being intimate as human beings.

05:02.920 --> 05:18.920
In a sense, we form a kind of a shared mind space that includes both of us, but is beyond ourselves.

05:18.920 --> 05:24.920
An in-between mind.

05:24.920 --> 05:35.920
Last night I had a very strong experience of the texting equivalent of telephone telepathy.

05:35.920 --> 05:40.920
A picture of my friend whose name begins with J came into my mind,

05:40.920 --> 05:48.920
and immediately I then was doing something on my phone after that,

05:48.920 --> 05:51.920
and he had just sent me a text.

05:51.920 --> 06:05.920
I don't use notifications on my phone, and I've had a number of situations like that.

06:05.920 --> 06:20.920
A long time ago, I'd had a very enthusiastic and profound conversation with a friend in Morocco.

06:20.920 --> 06:27.920
This is one of the most peculiar examples of it.

06:27.920 --> 06:39.920
When we closed the call, a few minutes later I got an effusive text from her about how wonderful our conversation was,

06:39.920 --> 06:49.920
and how it makes her feel really happy.

06:49.920 --> 06:57.920
It was quite, this is actually so blatant as to seem ridiculous.

06:57.920 --> 07:02.920
She described tasting a peach flavor in her mouth that was so delicious,

07:02.920 --> 07:11.920
and all these went on for two or three sentences effusively.

07:11.920 --> 07:26.920
After the call, I was eating a piece of peach gum, a very strongly flavored peach gum from Japan.

07:27.920 --> 07:34.920
Naturally, if we don't find a good reason to form up against one another,

07:34.920 --> 07:40.920
to object or to play domination games,

07:40.920 --> 07:47.920
then I think we as humans generally, and I'll speak only from my own experience,

07:47.920 --> 07:49.920
but I've watched other people doing it.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.920
We get into a situation where we can complete other sentences,

07:52.920 --> 07:58.920
and there are circumstances under which non-ordinary communication takes place.

07:58.920 --> 08:03.920
I wouldn't argue that the cell phone is separate from that communication.

08:03.920 --> 08:13.920
In fact, though it's not the kind I want, it provides a physical link.

08:13.920 --> 08:20.920
There's a physical link that extends to many, many humans in that phone.

08:20.920 --> 08:31.920
And like many of our technologies, I don't think the humans have reflected carefully enough

08:31.920 --> 08:34.920
upon what that actually turns out to mean.

08:34.920 --> 08:39.920
Because it means that if human minds naturally form networks,

08:39.920 --> 08:53.920
they're now going to form networks in spite of or as a result of technologies

08:53.920 --> 09:00.920
that restructure our networks according to mechanical principles.

09:00.920 --> 09:05.920
For organisms, that doesn't usually go well.

09:05.920 --> 09:21.920
For disembodied humans imagining some kind of eternal life in the body of a robot or something,

09:21.920 --> 09:27.920
maybe it goes well, but it tends to end organismal development on living planets.

09:27.920 --> 09:35.920
As we can see from our own behavior, we don't even need a second example yet.

09:35.920 --> 09:43.920
So the smartphones do, our technologies, affect what I call the Cognizium.

09:43.920 --> 09:56.920
And what I mean by this is a topology that isn't merely physical and is like an environment

09:56.920 --> 10:03.920
in that certain kinds of things can undergo developmental, quote, competition,

10:03.920 --> 10:07.920
unquote, within that environment and be transmitted.

10:07.920 --> 10:13.920
This is a bit, this resembles slightly, or perhaps more than slightly,

10:13.920 --> 10:16.920
Sheldrake's theories of morphic resonance.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.920
Excuse me, resonance.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.920
That's interesting, resonance.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.920
Amorphic resonance.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.920
I guess maybe that's what a mind is like.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.920
Amorphic resonance.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.920
But I'm not trying to explain what I think is the case, right?

10:32.920 --> 10:34.920
What I think is true.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.920
I'm not sure what is true.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.920
If someone says, you know, what are the facts?

10:40.920 --> 10:47.920
We could probably do studies that would validate or invalidate the idea

10:47.920 --> 10:51.920
if our science has advanced enough to chase such matters.

10:51.920 --> 10:57.920
And if our perspectival orientations are heuristically sound, right?

10:57.920 --> 10:59.920
They will teach us for sure.

10:59.920 --> 11:09.920
They won't mislead us by causing us to misconstrue the results of data acquisition

11:09.920 --> 11:15.920
or data gathering and analysis.

11:15.920 --> 11:25.920
So, in my family, it's common for us,

11:25.920 --> 11:33.920
and honestly, I think my mother had a similar array of senses,

11:33.920 --> 11:42.920
whereas my father's were relatively, almost mechanically empirical seeming.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.920
He had a method, right?

11:45.920 --> 11:50.920
He was running a protocol or a series of them,

11:50.920 --> 11:52.920
and possibly parallel.

11:52.920 --> 11:58.920
My mother was more of an intuitive person,

11:58.920 --> 12:03.920
but also could see...

12:03.920 --> 12:07.920
She was, in a way, the sort of perfect match for my dad's strange intelligence,

12:07.920 --> 12:16.920
because she could see into the emotional spectrum of humans and animals

12:16.920 --> 12:18.920
and living places and things.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.920
And she had long ago learned not to talk much about it.

12:22.920 --> 12:31.920
As any person who wants to survive in the relatively harsh climate of human culture,

12:31.920 --> 12:36.920
most of us do learn to shut a lot of that down

12:36.920 --> 12:44.920
or at least hide it from common perv, right?

12:44.920 --> 12:49.920
We save it for conversations with trusted people

12:49.920 --> 13:00.920
who either share our values and the urgencies of our interiority

13:00.920 --> 13:08.920
and our ethical concerns and our moral concerns and our relational concerns.

13:08.920 --> 13:13.920
We may save it for those usually rare situations,

13:13.920 --> 13:18.920
unless we form a group, right?

13:18.920 --> 13:22.920
If we form a group or if we join an existing group,

13:22.920 --> 13:28.920
then we may find ourselves in the company, generally speaking,

13:28.920 --> 13:32.920
of others of, quote, like-mind, unquote,

13:32.920 --> 13:37.920
which I'm not sure that really means like-mind.

13:38.920 --> 13:47.920
I don't know what those principles shining in our hearts and bones

13:47.920 --> 13:51.920
and ancestors and lineages, what are those principles?

13:51.920 --> 13:54.920
Are those mind?

13:54.920 --> 14:05.920
I find it confusing.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.920
But that may be.

14:08.920 --> 14:14.920
It's funny, the gentleman I just saw resembles a guy who was in my dream last night

14:14.920 --> 14:18.920
or actually this morning.

14:18.920 --> 14:26.920
Yeah, it looks like my family, my core family,

14:26.920 --> 14:33.920
they all have a peculiarity about noticing tiny divergences from that

14:33.920 --> 14:37.920
which is expected or the ordinary.

14:37.920 --> 14:47.920
And I also tend to pay attention to the ground when I am walking.

14:47.920 --> 15:01.920
So I will see occasionally something that stands out.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.920
I never really learned to track.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.920
I had little opportunity to do so.

15:08.920 --> 15:15.920
But I did pursue a slightly similar discipline.

15:15.920 --> 15:23.920
I learned to interpret, I learned to diagnose problems with computers

15:23.920 --> 15:27.920
which usually aren't hardware.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.920
It can be.

15:29.920 --> 15:38.920
But almost all of the problems I was diagnosing were problems with the operating system

15:38.920 --> 15:50.920
or the software is installed or an associated file on the computer that had become corrupted

15:50.920 --> 15:56.920
or problems with the directory of the disk.

15:56.920 --> 16:01.920
And I became quite skillful at intuiting.

16:01.920 --> 16:06.920
Even if I couldn't find the problem which most of the time I tried to do.

16:06.920 --> 16:09.920
I wanted a theory.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.920
I think it's this.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.920
And then test it.

16:13.920 --> 16:14.920
Nope, wasn't that.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.920
Okay, next.

16:16.920 --> 16:21.920
And just go through a sort of decision tree which by the way if you call Apple this is what they do.

16:21.920 --> 16:26.920
The text have a book.

16:26.920 --> 16:31.920
But I was that book for a long time.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.920
So I'm really good with Apple stuff.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.920
Generally, having affinity for it.

16:37.920 --> 16:43.920
And preferred that OS over the other extant OSs.

16:43.920 --> 16:48.920
Each of which has their unique benefits, whatever.

16:48.920 --> 16:52.920
And of course this exposure and the exposure to computer programming

16:52.920 --> 16:55.920
got me to think in very unique ways about the mind.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.920
Now rather than like many technologists deciding like,

16:58.920 --> 17:03.920
oh the mind is a computer.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.920
When I was a teenager I had already, and I was first exposed to computers

17:07.920 --> 17:11.920
and fascinated with their possibilities.

17:11.920 --> 17:17.920
Kind of in love with them as a device.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.920
I became interested in artificial intelligence.

17:20.920 --> 17:25.920
I was reading Ray Kurzweil and stuff in my late teens.

17:25.920 --> 17:31.920
And as a science fiction reader I had long, right, in the,

17:31.920 --> 17:39.920
in what the 60s we saw examples in on TV.

17:39.920 --> 17:46.920
Of computers that we could speak to.

17:46.920 --> 17:51.920
And they would respond and do data analysis

17:51.920 --> 17:56.920
and suggest solutions to various things

17:56.920 --> 18:02.920
and eliminate theories of identity or cause.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.920
No, it's not that.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.920
And so forth.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.920
So, you know, by the time I was a teenager

18:11.920 --> 18:20.920
the idea of artificial intelligence was quite well seeded in my awareness.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.920
Now back then it never occurred to me that human minds form networks.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.920
This is something that's obvious whether you believe my cognizium model or not.

18:27.920 --> 18:32.920
I'm not asking you to believe the model that I call the cognizium.

18:32.920 --> 18:40.920
Which is a model that was shown to me by another intelligence as an example.

18:40.920 --> 18:49.920
Look at it like this for a moment. See it like this.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.920
And as I've commonly said lately there are perspectives that are very profound.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.920
They're not profound based on whether they are true or not.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.920
They're profound based on whether they deliver useful intelligence,

19:00.920 --> 19:05.920
opportunity, protections, so forth.

19:31.920 --> 19:38.920
It's challenging when, for me,

19:38.920 --> 19:46.920
when another human being enters what I consider my personal space, right?

19:46.920 --> 19:57.920
Sort of the bubble within, I don't know, a foot of the surface of my skin.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.920
As if I'm not there.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.920
Or as if the fact that they're moving quickly

20:03.920 --> 20:12.920
liberates them from the respect of other people's sort of private body space.

20:12.920 --> 20:18.920
That's quite challenging.

20:18.920 --> 20:23.920
Most of the time I don't bristle, but sometimes I do.

20:23.920 --> 20:30.920
And I wonder what that's all about.

20:30.920 --> 20:38.920
I mean, I get some of the basic stuff, right?

20:38.920 --> 20:45.920
And occasionally it seems as though this is being done on purpose.

20:45.920 --> 20:54.920
A sort of gleeful entitlement to intrude on the space of others who are moving more slowly.

20:54.920 --> 21:03.920
Hopefully that's rarely going on.

21:03.920 --> 21:12.920
And for the sake of not, what?

21:12.920 --> 21:17.920
Not fomenting conflict, physical conflict?

21:17.920 --> 21:21.920
I normally ignore it.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.920
At least I don't respond, right?

21:23.920 --> 21:29.920
I don't say, hey, blah, blah, blah, what are you doing?

21:29.920 --> 21:31.920
There might be exceptions.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.920
I haven't come across any yet.

21:34.920 --> 21:50.920
But I don't enjoy it.

21:50.920 --> 21:57.920
So when I was walking on the path earlier, I noticed splash pattern.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.920
This loops back to where I began.

22:00.920 --> 22:07.920
I'm recursing on the topic that led to the filial awareness of little details,

22:07.920 --> 22:13.920
which, by the way, can become really problematic for human cognition.

22:13.920 --> 22:25.920
Primarily because if you have this proclivity, if you enact this inclination to observe details,

22:25.920 --> 22:33.920
then hypervigilance and its dangers are not too far away.

22:33.920 --> 22:43.920
Now you start to see a pattern in the tiny details.

22:43.920 --> 22:50.920
And thinking that no one else sees these details,

22:50.920 --> 23:04.920
this pattern-matching aspect of consciousness tends to acquire a unique form of authority in consciousness.

23:04.920 --> 23:12.920
And this can lead to lots of trouble, delusions, megalomania, paranoia, schizophrenia.

23:12.920 --> 23:23.920
These are just labels, but they are useful in broadly circumscribing various kinds of human experience,

23:23.920 --> 23:37.920
even though I understand the modern concern with diagnostic labels

23:37.920 --> 23:44.920
and to some degree share it.

23:44.920 --> 23:54.920
The way that I generally cope with that for myself is I distinguish between clinical, casual, analytical,

23:54.920 --> 24:02.920
and various kinds of conversation or purpose.

24:02.920 --> 24:13.920
Certainly, for example, if something is wrong with us and we can take two very different examples,

24:13.920 --> 24:19.920
we can imagine someone going to a Western doctor, let's take three.

24:19.920 --> 24:25.920
And the Western doctor has an algorithmic chart in their mind.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.920
They're a bit of a detective, they're meant to be clinical, not personal.

24:29.920 --> 24:40.920
This is how this branch of medicine functions.

24:40.920 --> 24:50.920
I can't remember the technical term.

24:50.920 --> 24:59.920
There's allopaths, osteopaths, homeopaths.

24:59.920 --> 25:03.920
I think there's one more. It might be allopaths that I'm talking about.

25:03.920 --> 25:12.920
Anyway, we go to the doctor and we tell them something about what's going on with us.

25:12.920 --> 25:16.920
I was listening to a doctor talk about this, actually.

25:16.920 --> 25:20.920
He said that people come and they want a diagnosis.

25:20.920 --> 25:27.920
He was saying that to diagnose a human being's condition, unless it's something very obvious right away,

25:27.920 --> 25:36.920
where you run down a few algorithms and you can run a test.

25:36.920 --> 25:44.920
You can try something and see if it affects the condition, and if so, how?

25:44.920 --> 25:47.920
But he said people come and they want a diagnosis right away.

25:47.920 --> 25:54.920
Well, if you're going to a doctor, categories kind of matter, don't they?

25:54.920 --> 26:01.920
The doctor takes a nose swab and says, okay, you have an infection of X

26:01.920 --> 26:07.920
and it's moving to another part of your body or something like this, right?

26:07.920 --> 26:10.920
And they may want to prescribe antibiotics or whatever they do.

26:10.920 --> 26:13.920
And some of that stuff is devastating.

26:13.920 --> 26:22.920
Humans aren't all the same thing and diseases aren't all the same thing and just health problems.

26:22.920 --> 26:26.920
But you kind of do want a categorical answer, right?

26:26.920 --> 26:38.920
So if you hurt your limb, if one of your limbs is somehow injured, may you be protected from injury?

26:38.920 --> 26:45.920
Then you want to know, you know, in one of the four or five ways that I can imagine that it can be hurt,

26:45.920 --> 26:49.920
which one is it hurt?

26:49.920 --> 26:51.920
For example, does it need to be immobilized?

26:51.920 --> 26:54.920
Immobilization is a category.

26:54.920 --> 26:58.920
A broken bone is a category.

26:58.920 --> 27:03.920
A broken bone is empirically demonstrable via X-ray.

27:03.920 --> 27:15.920
Very unlikely that something affects the X-ray machine to produce a visible break in the anatomy of a bone

27:15.920 --> 27:18.920
and there's actually no problem with the bone.

27:18.920 --> 27:25.920
It probably has happened with humans attempting to deceive each other on purpose or something,

27:25.920 --> 27:31.920
but probably extremely unlikely in other cases.

27:31.920 --> 27:34.920
So when we go to the doctor, that doctor, we want categories.

27:34.920 --> 27:46.920
And another person goes to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine.

27:46.920 --> 27:52.920
This person is more osteopathic and they tend to treat the whole person.

27:52.920 --> 27:58.920
That's the idea of osteopathic medicine, I believe, treat the whole person.

27:58.920 --> 28:09.920
TCM is similar but very old and involves things like humors, heat and cold, moist and dry,

28:09.920 --> 28:17.920
fluid or stagnant, dynamic or stagnant.

28:17.920 --> 28:27.920
These kinds of principles and it examines sort of the energetic body of the person.

28:27.920 --> 28:37.920
And thus includes treatments such as herbs and acupuncture and sometimes cupping or acupressure

28:37.920 --> 28:46.920
or the stimulation of Qi, life energy in a specific, along a specific meridian

28:46.920 --> 28:49.920
and perhaps centering on one or more organs.

28:49.920 --> 29:00.920
But still, when you go to the TCM doctor, she will say,

29:00.920 --> 29:06.920
you know, your liver Qi is very weak and your heart Qi is too much.

29:06.920 --> 29:12.920
We have to balance them.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.920
And here's what I recommend and then we'll try this.

29:15.920 --> 29:22.920
They are also somewhat experimental.

29:22.920 --> 29:28.920
And then you could go, now I don't actually know what a session with an indigenous medicine healer

29:28.920 --> 29:31.920
would be likely to look at, to look like.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.920
I can imagine, I imagine things.

29:33.920 --> 29:38.920
And so what I'm talking about here are just my imaginings.

29:38.920 --> 29:46.920
And in case someone ever says to us something that resembles,

29:46.920 --> 29:52.920
you don't have the right to imagine or speak of your imaginings.

29:52.920 --> 30:00.920
Well, I'm not going to agree with that probably ever.

30:00.920 --> 30:06.920
And if there are highly motivated individuals who want to come to me and say like,

30:06.920 --> 30:15.920
you know, accusations of appropriation or whatever the violation is,

30:15.920 --> 30:21.920
I will listen for a time and I will reflect on what they say.

30:21.920 --> 30:36.920
But the urge to take that kind of offense is problematical.

30:36.920 --> 30:44.920
I mistrust it in many of its common implementations.

30:44.920 --> 30:48.920
That said, if you went to an indigenous person,

30:48.920 --> 30:54.920
they might say many different things.

30:54.920 --> 31:03.920
And it almost, in this case, the category will also be discussed.

31:03.920 --> 31:07.920
It's this kind of a problem.

31:07.920 --> 31:10.920
I'm going to make something up here out of whole cloth.

31:10.920 --> 31:18.920
When you cross that stream to get to the place where you got your food,

31:18.920 --> 31:29.920
you did not take time to recognize the stream, the waters there, the living waters there.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.920
And they're not used to that.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.920
So they are angry at you.

31:35.920 --> 31:39.920
We must appease them.

31:39.920 --> 31:48.920
Now, this might sound like nonsense to an empiricist.

31:48.920 --> 31:58.920
Nonetheless, the often astonishing efficacy of non-ordinary interventions

31:58.920 --> 32:10.920
granted that many of them are in our world and in our time, many of them are fake, right?

32:10.920 --> 32:22.920
Or possibly delusional, the ones that we are likely to encounter in western culture and so forth.

32:22.920 --> 32:26.920
Commonly fake.

32:26.920 --> 32:32.920
Or often, sometimes delusional.

32:32.920 --> 32:37.920
But there are lots of diseases that are not merely physical.

32:37.920 --> 32:43.920
And the allopath can't do doodly squat about that.

32:43.920 --> 32:51.920
The homeopath, well, that's basically a religion.

32:51.920 --> 33:00.920
It's very difficult to disambiguate that.

33:00.920 --> 33:10.920
An empiricist, materialist, you know, person who is very upset about the idea that there are metaphysical models at all

33:10.920 --> 33:18.920
will certainly point out the many studies that have failed to show any effect.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.920
I'm not here to comment on that.

33:21.920 --> 33:28.920
What I'm actually concerned with is just that when we go to see a healer,

33:28.920 --> 33:36.920
there will probably, and it's almost certainly better if there isn't in some ways, particularly if they're very skillful, right?

33:36.920 --> 33:47.920
If they're really skillful, it might be better not to say anything about what the actual problem is and just to deal with it.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.920
But we expect, you know, categories.

33:50.920 --> 33:58.920
And when you go to the store, there are no products there.

33:58.920 --> 34:05.920
There are precisely zero products that don't belong to any category.

34:05.920 --> 34:11.920
It's a, it's a metaproduct, right?

34:11.920 --> 34:13.920
It doesn't belong to any category.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.920
It's not food.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.920
It's not pet supplies.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.920
It's not kitchen gear.

34:19.920 --> 34:27.920
It's not some branch of food, vegetable, animal, you know.

34:27.920 --> 34:42.920
There's, you will never buy at the grocery store something that you don't understand what category of thing it is.

34:42.920 --> 34:47.920
And now that I've introduced the topic that preceded my beginning of this recording,

34:47.920 --> 34:52.920
I'm going to go back again and circle back to the beginning.

34:52.920 --> 35:06.920
I was walking on the path and, you know, I do notice details and frankly this detail is fairly, it's not subtle.

35:06.920 --> 35:10.920
There's some splash marks on the asphalt.

35:10.920 --> 35:14.920
They are darker than they should be.

35:14.920 --> 35:18.920
They're clearly not something that is being tracked, right?

35:18.920 --> 35:35.920
They're not something stuck to the bottom of someone's shoe making an impression every step or every other step or something.

35:35.920 --> 35:45.920
And the, the Stellar's Jay family is here.

35:45.920 --> 35:50.920
I recognize their filial chatter.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.920
Another network intelligence, right?

35:53.920 --> 36:02.920
Tightly, intimately filial, a little pod of Stellar's Jay's.

36:02.920 --> 36:19.920
They're adventuring together, protecting one another, looking out for one another, sharing knowledge, skillfulness.

36:19.920 --> 36:28.920
So I was walking along the path and I saw splash marks and they're dark and they had a reddish tint even though it was very,

36:28.920 --> 36:32.920
that was modestly subtle.

36:32.920 --> 36:49.920
And they occurred at intervals of approximately perhaps six to eight feet and sometimes longer and sometimes shorter.

36:49.920 --> 36:56.920
They went on for quite some time, they disappeared, they started up again, they disappeared.

36:56.920 --> 37:03.920
And, you know, it looks like blood.

37:03.920 --> 37:18.920
Now, there are people, perhaps wisely, who would say something resembling, do not interact with such things.

37:18.920 --> 37:24.920
They don't even concern your mind with them, right?

37:24.920 --> 37:30.920
This will tarnish your mind.

37:30.920 --> 37:35.920
But you will get some of it on you in a way so as to become unclean, right?

37:35.920 --> 37:46.920
And there are many ancient traditions and spiritual traditions.

37:54.920 --> 38:23.920
That are, that contain very complex systems of what must be avoided, when to avoid it, when not to avoid it.

38:23.920 --> 38:32.920
And also some things that are declarative commandments, you know, you must do this.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.920
But a lot of avoidances, right?

38:35.920 --> 38:52.920
There are vast books of such things that seem to arise perennially throughout the, what comes down to us in written form of older peoples.

38:52.920 --> 39:14.920
And I suspect about these books that, while sometimes intelligent, right?

39:14.920 --> 39:20.920
Some of this stuff, there's traditional knowledge encoded in it.

39:20.920 --> 39:28.920
But the encoding normally is handed down family to family, tribe to tribe and so on.

39:28.920 --> 39:32.920
I mean, within a given people.

39:32.920 --> 39:39.920
And sometimes exchanged, perhaps, that maybe there's some crosstalk between peoples about this.

39:39.920 --> 39:47.920
But this looks to me like the evidence of a problem.

39:47.920 --> 40:04.920
A problem where the corpus of the traditions within the people has been lost.

40:04.920 --> 40:15.920
And someone's trying to forge a sort of a counterfeit or a replacement for it.

40:15.920 --> 40:26.920
And thus it is that, for example, it's a well-known, I suppose it's a well-known tradition among Blackfoot people, according to my friend, Ryan First-Diver,

40:26.920 --> 40:30.920
that if a bird flies into your house, you have to kill it.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.920
Otherwise bad things will happen.

40:32.920 --> 40:43.920
Now this looks to me like the remnant of something that somehow got promoted to first a principal, right?

40:43.920 --> 40:45.920
And then a law.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.920
Obviously this is not so.

40:47.920 --> 40:55.920
And also obviously, just thinking rationally, any event can produce.

40:55.920 --> 41:03.920
Any event can be causally linked to some future result.

41:03.920 --> 41:10.920
And we can get really busy analyzing the opposite, right?

41:10.920 --> 41:17.920
It didn't fall down on the path today and that led to me losing my wallet later.

41:17.920 --> 41:25.920
Because I left my wallet somewhere and it disappeared.

41:25.920 --> 41:33.920
It's funny, you know, there's a problem in English for me as someone who's aware of human psychies and cognition.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.920
There's a problem.

41:35.920 --> 41:48.920
And the attempt to avoid it is really confusing because to properly avoid it one has to kind of avoid certain purposes in speech.

41:48.920 --> 41:55.920
And one of them is to alert others to a flaw or a danger.

41:55.920 --> 42:06.920
By doing this, inadvertently, there's psyche, there's features of the psyche that invert what we're saying.

42:06.920 --> 42:09.920
So I'm really not sure what to do about that.

42:09.920 --> 42:24.920
It's a very peculiar feature of human cognition and psychology that involves problems with prohibitions and taboos.

42:24.920 --> 42:32.920
It doesn't merely make them more interesting, though, you know, there is a natural proclivity.

42:32.920 --> 42:44.920
If someone says, don't do this, there's some, you know, however modest aspect of ourselves that sees that as a challenge or,

42:44.920 --> 42:50.920
well, I need to do that and find out why they said that or, you know, whatever, right? Something like this.

42:50.920 --> 43:01.920
We're really strangely self-conflicting and some of us more than others and under certain, you know, situations or under stress or whatever it more so.

43:01.920 --> 43:08.920
I'm going to leave off on that topic because it's not crucially important, but you can see the problem, right?

43:08.920 --> 43:17.920
If the bird comes in the house and has to kill it or bad things happen, this has to do probably with a bird coming into a house in a story

43:17.920 --> 43:23.920
that is fundamentally traditional.

43:23.920 --> 43:31.920
I don't really mean a story because it's not really what they are, nor are they the same thing as myths,

43:31.920 --> 43:44.920
but maybe cultural, hmm, I wish my friend Ryan were here, he could tell me, he could help me see better anyway.

43:44.920 --> 44:06.920
They often involve origins and histories and specific characters who are often both human and somehow primordial at the same time

44:06.920 --> 44:16.920
or are primarily primordial, like the sun, for example.

44:16.920 --> 44:35.920
These stories have in them principles of a kind of knowledge that has been mostly lost because nature is not understood by western minds, so to speak.

44:36.920 --> 44:45.920
So I saw the splashes and you can see already in my mind, there's a category thing going on here.

44:45.920 --> 44:55.920
Well, first is what is that and then what's the frequency and then how old is it, how old does it look and was someone hurt here?

44:55.920 --> 44:57.920
Did somebody suffer?

44:57.920 --> 45:04.920
Was there, you know, this is near a street, there are many animals here.

45:04.920 --> 45:23.920
Animals can get hit by cars, especially at night here, so I'm looking and I'm tracking the shape, the splash patterns, color, trying to figure out how old it is.

45:23.920 --> 45:46.920
Now, even I am aware of two principles, similitude and contagion.

45:46.920 --> 46:06.920
These are the words that my friend Ryan uses and I was aware of them in my own way before he spoke of how pervasive they are in the Blackfoot way of life.

46:06.920 --> 46:14.920
What we might think of as tradition, but we'd be half wrong at least.

46:14.920 --> 46:34.920
A way of thinking about relationships and transformation, a way of thinking about safety and taking care of one another and the living places and the living beings.

46:34.920 --> 47:03.920
Two fundamental principles in the topic that might slightly equate to the topic of magic or one of the dumbest words the humans ever made, which is nonetheless still useful, the supernatural.

47:04.920 --> 47:13.920
The mysterious relational exchanges that happen outside our efficacious model systems.

47:13.920 --> 47:24.920
So I'm approaching where the splashes begin and I'm not so OCD about it that I counted them or anything.

47:25.920 --> 47:43.920
The first splashes here, the next one is six and a half feet, then inches, then three feet, then two feet, then inches, then two feet, and so forth.

47:44.920 --> 47:54.920
And the splashes point east. Creatures traveling eastward. Whatever's making the splashes is traveling eastward.

47:54.920 --> 48:18.920
And they begin in a specific spot and they continue. They acquire relative regularity, which is mostly more than what an average person's gate would connect.

48:24.920 --> 48:43.920
If someone were running, if a human were running, for example, and had either cut themselves or had a nosebleed, but then they stopped for quite some time and, you know, it's hard for me to imagine what it could be if it isn't blood.

48:43.920 --> 48:56.920
But even I do not interact with such things directly. Like, I'm not unaware of the principle of contagion, but neither do I.

48:56.920 --> 49:07.920
And here there's a lot and there's a short, yeah, here they're almost a pace, they're a pace apart and there's more.

49:07.920 --> 49:17.920
And it's a long sequence, right? We're talking about like 100, 150 yards.

49:17.920 --> 49:26.920
No, I don't know what happened and I'm not trying to disturb my listeners at the same time.

49:26.920 --> 49:35.920
I mean, this is just part of my experience that, you know, I'm experiencing today.

49:35.920 --> 49:47.920
But I am curious. I have an aspect of my intelligence that when it sees things tries to reconstruct them from evidence.

49:47.920 --> 50:05.920
And obviously there's only certain kinds of things that arouse this interest in me, but tracks arouse this interest.

50:05.920 --> 50:16.920
And I guess anything having to do with blood would certainly ring that little bell in my consciousness.

50:16.920 --> 50:29.920
I don't know what I make of that. I think it's probably blood, but it also looks a little pinkish, like anemic if it's blood.

50:29.920 --> 50:36.920
And I don't think it could be spilling. I mean, that's not true.

50:36.920 --> 50:46.920
I think it's plausible that it's at least possible that somebody was like carrying something and spilling it every few feet for 150 yards.

50:46.920 --> 50:52.920
It just seems wildly unlikely to me. It looks like something got hurt.

50:52.920 --> 51:10.920
And I don't know. But you can see that my concern begins not with, oh, there's some marks on the pavement, but with the categorical concern.

51:10.920 --> 51:17.920
Are these marks blood? What is it? What are these?

51:22.920 --> 51:48.920
The geese are signaling. I mean, it's a display.

51:48.920 --> 51:59.920
And it's probably a lot more complex than what I'm inclined to think is a human, because we're inclined to think things like, oh, it's a territorial incursion.

51:59.920 --> 52:11.920
The males are, you know, got their hackles up, because it does appear that one of the groups is pursuing the other one from the shore to far away.

52:11.920 --> 52:27.920
And the other group appears to be sort of trying to get out of eye shot, but these are human interpretations.

52:27.920 --> 52:36.920
Now where I'm going to go from here is quite complicated.

52:36.920 --> 52:53.920
Because I'm going to talk a little bit about how it is both true that categories can be used in tyrannical ways by humans with untrustworthy motives.

52:53.920 --> 53:05.920
But also, it's unreasonable to suppose that we can just do away with them at will. Very unreasonable to suppose this.

53:05.920 --> 53:15.920
There are purposes for which the intelligent suspension of categories turns out to be very useful.

53:15.920 --> 53:31.920
And there are other purposes, especially if anyone should go around declaring aggressively that categories are some...

53:31.920 --> 54:00.920
The active categorization in human consciousness descends or arises from colonizing patriarchal, authoritarian,

54:01.920 --> 54:12.920
traditions. Are they involved? Yes, they are involved. Is our category tree screwy? Yes, it is screwy.

54:12.920 --> 54:25.920
Do we get stuff wrong with it all the time?

54:30.920 --> 54:48.920
We are in our time faced with very strange situations that are profoundly confusing to attempt to understand or amend.

54:48.920 --> 55:04.920
Involving the intentional weaponization of a variety of features of conceptual thought.

55:04.920 --> 55:32.920
And it's clear to me, at least it seems relatively clear, that a goodly portion of this is intentional sci-opping made contagious by social media.

55:32.920 --> 55:45.920
And media in general.

55:45.920 --> 56:07.920
I know for certain that there exist companies that sell these services as a weapon to countries with military agendas.

56:08.920 --> 56:34.920
Again, one of the ways that I manage to deal with my own exposure.

56:34.920 --> 56:52.920
I view media. I use the internet. I have a Facebook account, a Twitter account I nearly never use.

56:52.920 --> 57:13.920
Someone has been very energetically attempting to hack my Facebook account for some time now.

57:13.920 --> 57:21.920
I have exposure and part of how I deal with that exposure is compartmentalization.

57:21.920 --> 57:33.920
You can think of it in a similar way as if you had to be really concerned about contagion at your house.

57:33.920 --> 57:52.920
You might respond to the necessity in various ways. You might have staging areas where, for example, when we come home, there is a specific area where we put things that are going to be brought into the home.

57:52.920 --> 58:11.920
If we don't take our shoes off at the door, we take them off near the street and there is a staging area.

58:11.920 --> 58:15.920
So we had quite a pause there.

58:15.920 --> 58:32.920
I'm going to change the topic a bit. I'm going to bookmark where I was. It was categories and how their intentional distortion.

58:42.920 --> 59:03.920
The usefulness and dangers underneath the common behaviors that we see in various cohorts, primarily in the United States or in the western nations.

59:03.920 --> 59:06.920
I'll come back to that.

59:06.920 --> 59:24.920
When you grow up in the same city, you live in one city most or all of your life for a long time, long ago anyway, and I don't know how common it is these days, it seems less common.

59:24.920 --> 59:43.920
But there are certain kinds of people or certain instances of humans that are quite eccentric and also what you might think of as local color.

59:43.920 --> 59:48.920
They tend to not be wealthy people.

59:48.920 --> 59:55.920
The wealthy people can be eccentric.

59:55.920 --> 01:00:11.920
And they tend to form a bit of a following, right? Their characters.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.920
I am one of them.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:26.920
I remember in Santa Rosa there was a pair of twin women, older women, they were elderly by the time I knew them, and clearly they had been famous there and their youth were very well known.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:33.920
There was also a woman named Pepper who always wore all red.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:45.920
There is an older woman in my neighborhood who I've known actually for quite some time, who almost always wears only white, but sometimes red on top of it.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:53.920
And then there's the woman that I just met, Nancy DeStefanis, who is well known here as the Heron Lady.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:01:04.920
Now this lake has just been renamed Blue Heron Lake, and for many years in a dead tree on one of the islands, it's a man-made lake here.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.920
It used to be called Stow Lake.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:14.920
Five to seven, it was a social tree, right? Five to seven Heron nests every season.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:23.920
But storms broke a lot of the old dead trees' extensions off, and so the Herons have moved around.

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:36.920
And I ran into Nancy and we know each other for many years. She knows that I pay close attention to the birds.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:47.920
And she was talking about how the Herons will sun themselves on the top of this pine that they're currently nesting in on the other side of the lake.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:02:00.920
And I mentioned that I think I noticed that many water birds use sunbathing, and I theorize that perhaps it's assisting their metabolism in digesting food.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:04.920
Of course, this is true of many animals, right?

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:11.920
All the animals pay attention to heat gradients. They pay very careful attention to them.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.920
Survival often depends on this.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:27.920
The cats, given the opportunity to share bio-warming, will usually want to do so. The dogs too.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:39.920
It makes everything better, right? We hitchhike on each other's heat gradients and on the heat gradients of the sun and also these days of machines.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:49.920
This is a lesson I learned in a very difficult way that I will keep to myself at the moment when I was a young man.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:57.920
So, I had some time with Nancy, and I could have just left the recorder on, but it seemed indelicate to do so.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:04.920
But she's a fascinating, brilliant, elderly person who I care for.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:09.920
Now, I could just say she's a person. Why do I have to say she's elderly?

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.920
Well, I say that she's elderly with great reverence.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:21.920
Should I refrain from saying anything about...

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.920
Should I refrain from categorizing her?

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:36.920
Am I committing an injustice by categorizing her as elderly?

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:43.920
Now, certainly much like all the people I know, very, very few people I know are old inside.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:52.920
Most of them, they're just like children or like they're 20 or 30 inside. Their body is elderly.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:58.920
And many elderly people walk this lake. It's a pretty safe place.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:09.920
Also, people would probably come to your aid if something went wrong.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:17.920
I revere the elderly people.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.920
I'm sure someone could make some kind of accusation about this. Were they thusly motivated?

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:42.920
I want to know what motivation should encourage them or even require them to indict me for categorizing Nancy as an elderly woman.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:49.920
Now, when I was speaking to her, I asked deferentially how she prefers to be called.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:57.920
I said, what do you mean? I said, if I see you, which name should I use?

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:03.920
She said, you can just call me Nancy. I was like, yes, great. But it's nice to ask.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:13.920
She said, if there are children around, then it's Mrs. D.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.920
I said, oh, because it's your last name. She's like, yes, yes.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:22.920
So we had some negotiated, you know, I mean, negotiated monikers.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:27.920
But what she probably prefers to be known as is the Heron Lady.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:34.920
And that's a pretty unusual category. There's only one of them around here or they ain't two.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:41.920
It was just one. Just as there was only one pepper in Santa Rosa.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.920
And there were characters around the city at various times, too.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:55.920
There was an African man who was the mayor of one of the little districts or something for many years.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:01.920
I don't think I met him. And there are lesser and greater characters.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:14.920
It seems much less common these days that the goodwill of the people supports the peculiar characters who, you know, they're not doing anyone any harm.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:27.920
I don't think, generally. And they're contributing something profound to the local culture.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:35.920
I have great admiration and respect for Mrs. D.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.920
She runs a website about the Herons here.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:51.920
And often you will see her driving her car with a large plastic Heron sticking up through the sunroof.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:58.920
But people know that, you know, this is all about Herons.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:06.920
It's funny she said, and speaking of certain nests, she said, you know, I just pray that I don't think she's religious.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:15.920
And if she is religious, she's Heron religious.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.920
I never got the sense of her to speak as if she believes in God.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:29.920
She seems much more like a pragmatic atheist or someone who's willing to pray but isn't really religious, right?

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:35.920
I don't think everyone that hedges their bets is wrong.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:42.920
Obviously, the atheists, just kind of a peculiar position to have.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:57.920
It's not peculiar to have atheist leanings in the face of some of the ridiculous nonsense that modern religion promulgates.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:07.920
But we should also be careful of similarly forged weapons.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.920
So let's go back to the category thing.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:19.920
It's funny her fascination with just one of the birds.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:28.920
All of her attention has gone to Herons for a long time, such that she is identified with them.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:39.920
Perhaps she thinks of herself as belonging to the Heron people, though I would be shocked to hear such a declaration from her.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:48.920
And there might be private things, there must be both private things and secret things about who she is.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.920
And some portion of the secret things are secret even to herself.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:09:01.920
And this is the matter with being human.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.920
Now, can I say anything useful about this category problem?

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:14.920
First of all, it is important to occasionally invent or repair categories.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:24.920
Because our lexicon, its categorical structure, which I'm sure there's technical language about,

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:35.920
the library of categories native to English, for example, is missing all kinds of things.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.920
Lots and lots of things are missing.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:44.920
And if they're missing, we're inclined to overlook them because the language doesn't direct our attention in that way

01:09:44.920 --> 01:10:02.920
and thoroughly does direct our attention in other ways.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:12.920
It's a sunset crow call, raven call.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:22.920
I often wonder what that call means.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:24.920
It seems a communal.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:41.920
I always get the sense that it's a remembering of some kind when I hear this particular double call.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:50.920
Something like this, except it's got tremolo in it.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.920
What can I say about the category?

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:58.920
So I was listening, I was briefly exposed early this afternoon.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:08.920
I was working on getting a video up and YouTube presented me with some shorts.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:17.920
And unlike my ordinary inclination, which is to completely ignore all such things,

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:25.920
I think there is a contagion problem there.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:35.920
But I suspended my ordinary disinclinations and watched a few.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:43.920
Some of them were artistic performances or musical performances, some of them were martial performances.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:48.920
Some of them were wow.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:57.920
And I watched maybe 10 or 11, most of them were less than a minute long, kind of short attention span theater stuff.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:24.920
And in one of them, one particular male, you know, white male, was arguing with proponents of critical theory or critical race theory or stuff we might associate with the derogatory label Wokeist.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:37.920
That would be a little bit too aggressive.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:55.920
Categories are fundamental to conceptual awareness.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:06.920
And certainly the linguistic apperception of identity.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:13.920
But most of what's actually going on doesn't fit in them, right?

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:29.920
So in that sense, you know, over time we've become subject to a variety of modern, if I want to be friendly about it, I'll call it linguistic transformations.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:38.920
And if I want to be diagnostic, I might call it contagions.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:52.920
It was not very long ago that precisely zero people used the filler word like.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:14:21.920
And the contagiousness of that linguistic habit had to do probably with a disaffinity for the declaration.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:30.920
Of explicit identity, situation, relationship, transformation, and so on.

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:35.920
Because there's a natural disinclination.

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:40.920
Our psyche, our dreaming mind, our emotional self.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:15:09.920
We have many features that resist the sort of boxy cages that categories, perhaps particularly or peculiarly in English, forces into.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:25.920
So there's a kind of a natural pushback against that explicit declaration of history, situation, identity, relationship, transformation.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:50.920
And when we say, when we use this filler word, it's a way of retreating from both the onus of declaration for which we can later be indicted.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:59.920
Yeah, it's funny.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:13.920
If I say explicitly what I did, then someone else can catch me out on that either right away or in the future.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:20.920
It can be used as evidence against me, I can be judged by it.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:28.920
So this like word blurs features of identity and category.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:36.920
And we're seeing a similar blurring or rejection.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.920
And I was watching the YouTube videos.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:46.920
I don't know who the man, I don't know who the guy I was watching was who's probably 26.

01:16:46.920 --> 01:17:00.920
He had kind of a broad face and a young white guy he was arguing with in one clip.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:12.920
In both clips, he basically tabled a demand for a definition.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:26.920
And in both cases, the people he was arguing with were poorly equipped to support whatever their or even declare whatever their position might have been.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:39.920
I'm sure he's quite, you know, anyone who's rhetorically trained or anyone who's practiced debate with any degree of regularity.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:54.920
Having arguments with ordinary people is like using a tank to swap flies or something, not that the people are fly like or I'm not meaning to denigrate them.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:18:01.920
I'm just saying like it's overkill, profound overkill.

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:09.920
And I suspect that, you know, he's carefully, he's probably fought many battles, won many battles.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:16.920
If winning is the goal, really insight should be the goal.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.920
Mutual understanding and insight when we get together.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.920
Not winning.

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:28.920
But in both cases, he asked that I saw.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.920
He asked a very simple question.

01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:38.920
What is a woman?

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:57.920
And in my own thought, there is a place where I can entertain linguistic deconstructionist, postmodernist, neo, what, neo what?

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:08.920
Neo put any word you want after neo, but also neo ideological constructs.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:12.920
There's a, there's a compartment where I can play that.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:20.920
And there's another compartment where I'm clinical.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:25.920
And there's another part compartment where I experiment.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:37.920
And there's another compartment where I'm actually fascinated by the existence of categories and what's missing from them.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:20:00.920
And part of my mind is familiar with the dangers and tribulations

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:16.920
around the propagation of viral, sci-fi human linguistic behavior.

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:24.920
So I have these many different facets and I can play well with others in most fields.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:43.920
I am going to say, however, to declare openly that I believe in the biological categories of gender, however poorly I may understand them.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:21:05.920
And I'm going to take a break and have some food and then we'll see how much intelligence is left in me when I have to both digest and make allocutions.

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:27.920
As someone who has the joy of sometimes engaging in creative activity, I've noticed something that I've heard before.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:38.920
But like most of what can be said, it's very different to hear it and experience it directly.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:54.920
And I'm speaking of the difference between being hungry, which is a statement of state.

01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:05.920
Being hungry, I'm rarely as inspired when I'm full as I am when I'm hungry.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:18.920
And if I'm writing and I'm sort of on a roll or something, or whatever I might be creating music or my recordings or whatnot, it's just a radically different experience when there's food in my tummy.

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:26.920
Much less impetus and inspiration and motivation.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:38.920
Of course, probably slightly depending on what kind of food I eat and perhaps the company I'm keeping.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:23:06.920
So for me, as someone who studies language and semantics and has long been curious about how language affects our minds and psyches and societies, if we dare call them that,

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:16.920
there are situations which look to me more like diseases than development.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.920
It's pretty similar with my physical health.

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:37.920
I might notice a slight catch where my nasal passages meet my throat.

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:44.920
A tiny bit of post-nasal drip or slight irritation.

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:56.920
And often I get over it most of the time, but sometimes that turns into illness.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:19.920
It's much more difficult to understand mimetic and linguistic contagions, and all of us are surely exposed to mimetic pathogens.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:32.920
I'm very concerned when I see the kinds of things.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:44.920
Nearly every psyop raises the flag of virtue, of liberation, of unity.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:25:13.920
And it's very common for the language to transform dramatically when the principles of democratic coexistence

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:37.920
and mutual concern and so forth begin to be captured and or weaponized.

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:56.920
Generally what is common when some kind of psyop is going on, one of the key signals that you can see when you sort of take the pulse of the linguistic situation,

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:16.920
particularly as it surrounds cohorts of humans, groups of humans, tribes, so forth, whether they're ideological or genetic or based on some feature of gender.

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:36.920
When something attacks the roots of our lexicons and makes the claim of heroic revision, whether that claim is overt or covert,

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:50.920
we want to be extremely cautious and look very carefully both at the ploys, the methods, the techniques, the protocols, and their actual results,

01:26:50.920 --> 01:27:08.920
not what they claim to be doing. What's actually going on as the transformation of categories becomes prominent.

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:24.920
And on the one hand we should together be willing and capable and trained to intelligently for each other for the sake of insight,

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:47.920
question the nature of categories, and perhaps repair our lexicons.

01:27:47.920 --> 01:28:16.920
That's an important part of my goal as a cognitive activist. At the same time we should have watchful concern about certain kinds of transformations.

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:45.920
Our capacity to be rational, to weigh evidence, to think clearly, to revise our thinking in the face of new data, to attend the authority of facts without becoming entranced by them.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:29:10.920
There is a compartment within which I understand that conceptual facts, linguistic facts, there's a compartment in which I can play as if they are in fact an authority ploy.

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:22.920
And there are certainly situations in our culture, relationships, societies, and so on where this is so. The facts are not actually facts.

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:36.920
For example, the fact that the CDC promoted the COVID vaccines as safe and effective. Not fucking true.

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:50.920
We may have needed vaccines. There might have been a real fire where our infrastructure of society was at risk, which was the primary argument, or one of them.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:30:09.920
But even that, you don't get facts about complex situations immediately. Data never catches up to what's actually going on unless what's going on is so simple, like is the water boiling?

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:29.920
That's a fact you can get a relatively clear grasp on because it's very simple. Where did COVID originate? Not facts. That's speculation and data and research and analysis and so on.

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:52.920
And wherever the humans don't do the data or research or analysis, then the data never reaches the common people. And the common people don't get much clarity of data at all unless they're connected with somebody who's professional, like a scientist or something.

01:30:52.920 --> 01:31:05.920
It's actually doing the research or gathering data. Data is always partial, never complete, and it takes a long time for it. It can never catch up to what's actually going on now.

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:26.920
So it's always post facto, right after the fact. In its hindsight, what we get is mostly from data unless the analyses are very simple or temporally accessible rapidly. We don't get good data.

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:51.920
And our data is always partial and it's biased, and all of that is true, but that doesn't entitle us to just dismiss, pretend that the data isn't there, or that all facts are really just, for example, a result of the agendas of colonizing patriarchy or this kind of thing.

01:31:51.920 --> 01:32:15.920
That's ridiculously nonsensical. And if we say, it's not that there's no truth in it. There's a little bit of truth there. There's a branch of factfulness that is emerging from colonizing entities and perhaps even patriarchal motivations.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:23.920
True. The whole thing, impossible. Cannot be so.

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:42.920
And when you see in the common people the signal that we're going to blur, doubt, and erase fundamental categories,

01:32:43.920 --> 01:33:04.920
I strongly suggest that we recoil, become very studious and cautious about what the fuck might be going on, because on the one hand, anything that damages fundamental categories, these are things that I call holophores in English.

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:24.920
These are root concepts that if you change them, all other concepts inherit the changes you've applied, each concept somewhat uniquely, but you cannot change, for example, the meaning of male or female without affecting all other concepts.

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:51.920
And in a situation where the fundamental basic elements of the sort of primitives of our lexicons, the categories, if these come under attack and the attack is successful, our people will go nuts. It will cause insanity.

01:33:51.920 --> 01:34:14.920
It's possible to produce waves of transformation in the lexicon and in the categories, that it's not possible for humans to keep up with cognitively, and it's also possible to destabilize the basis of human identity this way.

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:33.920
There's so much trouble going on here, and this is a very sophisticated topic, which I'm giving a fairly superficial treatment to at the moment. I'm merely speaking of some of my concerns.

01:34:33.920 --> 01:35:02.920
No matter how many people try to tell me that their transformation of a fundamental category feature is true, good, appropriate, noble, reflective of actual understanding,

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:22.920
and so forth. I'm willing to have the discussion. I'm not willing to be threatened into categorical changes that I fundamentally don't agree with.

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:48.920
I've read works that question the common human gender categories, male and female. I'm well aware, for example,

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:58.920
that if we want to use gender to talk about bacteria, there's probably seven or more genders, and there's different ways they can connect.

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:24.920
I am aware of what has been called hermaphrodism in nature and humans. I am unwilling to submit my mind and my lexicon to the whims

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:50.920
of people or groups of people whose motivations may appear superficially humanistic, but whose activity largely creates very...

01:36:50.920 --> 01:37:14.920
It inverts the problems of racism and genderism and then points those back at the people who it wants to frame as oppressors, many of whom have never actively oppressed anyone or anything much.

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:30.920
There has been colonialism real, patriarchal dismissal of women, children, living place, absolutely. There has been chauvinism.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:58.920
There has been unjustifiable suffering visited on peoples and groups, all through. The resolution for those matters is clearly not being woke.

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:25.920
And this nation that I live in, which I do not identify closely with, is clearly suffering a series of assaults from various bad actors, other nations, factions and so forth,

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:47.920
that are intent on fomenting schizogenesis. And one of the best ways to do that is to attack basic categories. It just so happens that these primordial features of our lexicon

01:38:48.920 --> 01:39:04.920
are both vulnerable to capture and distortion and very rewarding, rapidly rewarding in terms of schizogenesis of populations and cognition.

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:21.920
So, I'm not trying to call anyone out. I'm saying I don't trust this situation. I've watched it carefully from its origins. I was reading post-modernist texts in the 1980s.

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:35.920
And already I developed not exactly an allergy, but a significant concern about that direction in intellectual development.

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:57.920
Some will claim that the wakest concerns don't start there, but that's not their origin or parentage. I find it a bit difficult to believe.

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:23.920
So, there's much more to say on this topic. Perhaps I am trying to say that I'm very skeptical of particular transformations

01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:41.920
in our lexicons that look to me more like the result of weaponization than they do of insight or humanitarianism, person-terrainism, whatever you wish to call it.

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:57.920
In the shorts that I saw earlier today, I just saw this guy asking one question to a couple different people.

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:19.920
And the question was, what is a woman? And none of those people answered. They made various claims like that he was grandstanding or that he's found a pivot point around which he can dance and sort of score points.

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:28.920
And one of them said, I just don't think categories are that important in human relationships or something to this degree.

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:45.920
Well, I'm not judging the person. Again, the guy on the stage was clearly rhetorically trained and prepared for actual debate, and the people that were approaching him were not.

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:53.920
This is a typical gambit, also sort of what disingenuous, right? Fake.

01:41:53.920 --> 01:42:12.920
Typical gambit in videos that are intended by their creators to capture audiences via outrage and other dangerous purposes.

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:24.920
But I do think the question is relevant.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:48.920
I don't know the answer to the questions that arise in the wake of the methods that allow people to modify their bodies.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:13.920
Identify their gender or perhaps even what is it, right? What is it that gets identified?

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:23.920
Sometimes it's gender, sometimes it's sexuality, sometimes it's public face.

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:38.920
I wish to be known in the public as masculine or feminine or neither. I'm not binary. I'm not plus or minus. I'm not boy or girl. I'm beyond.

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:53.920
Now again, there's this problem in the background, which is that we can all sense that there's an issue with categories and their explicit declarations of identity.

01:43:53.920 --> 01:44:08.920
And this can be the source of injustice for sure, but so can the other side of it, right?

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:22.920
So for now, I really just want to highlight the questions and I'm pretty sure I know how I would answer. I'm not going to try to do it here at the moment.

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:34.920
The question, what is a woman? What do we mean by the word woman? This is always a question of who we are and what we intend to mean rather than what does the word mean?

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:48.920
Biologically, though there are outliers, there are outliers in every category, right? There are things that cross over into other categories.

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:59.920
Think about the idea of food, right? There's food that you know to be food and there's also food that you know not to eat.

01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:09.920
The rotting apple is rarely consumed by humans. An apple is a fruit. A fruit is food.

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:17.920
But there's all kinds of edge cases. We don't then decide there's no such thing as apples.

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:25.920
I mean, unless, you know, we're really advanced philosophically or something and we realize that language is a game.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:40.920
But unfortunately for us, that game has very profound social and historical and what? Future repercussions.

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:59.920
How humans play with categories is fundamentally determinative of many aspects of thought, relation, behavior, expectation, objection, vehemence, anger, fear, all these things, right?

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:09.920
So if we're going to just mess with fundamental categories at the root of our lexicons, we had better be prepared to ask the really hard questions there.

01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:20.920
And not come to the table with standing presuppositions on either side.

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:28.920
The question of what is a woman? Does biological gender actually exist?

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:49.920
Is delicate and sophisticated in measured, almost in like a kind of mathematical relation to our purposes in asking the question and our purposes in pursuing the question.

01:46:50.920 --> 01:47:09.920
I don't think, in the same way that I don't think that machines qualifies intelligences at this point, that doesn't mean intelligences couldn't hitchhike on them.

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.920
Ours do. Ours does.

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:26.920
In the same way that I don't think machines are intelligences and we should call artificial intelligence something like human assisted computational heuristics.

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:52.920
I don't think, I'm certainly willing to call my friend who I knew was born male, she, if my friend really presses me and says this is important to me, this is what I want, I will do it.

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:59.920
But I will not be thinking of that person as a woman.

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:13.920
I still believe in gender as, at least in the bubble of biology, right, in the compartment of my mind where I think about biological situations.

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:25.920
I believe in genders. The concept makes sense to me, it's familiar to me. I'm not going to try to rationalize it here.

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:36.920
And in another bubble, a different one, I'm willing to acknowledge the concerns of someone I care for or am in relation with.

01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:39.920
But there's a limit.

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:54.920
If they want to police my lexicon for the sake of some ideology they've come under the sway of, we're going to have some very serious discussions over long periods of time.

01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:05.920
And I would expect the same thing if I demanded they change their lexicon or be indicted.

01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:16.920
That's not going to fly, that creates a disproportionate power dynamic in the relational envelope that I don't agree with generally.

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:20.920
There's much more to learn here and much more to explore.

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:26.920
For now I'm going to wrap up just because it's getting late, not because I have a full tummy.

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:28.920
Thank you for joining me.

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:35.920
I wish you every beautiful thing and I would love to hear your comments, thoughts and concerns on anything I've been sharing here today.

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:40.920
Please feel free to speak up in the channel on YouTube.

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:53.920
I look forward to learning again together very soon and I wish you every beautiful way and relation.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:58.920
May you be healthy, joyful and well loved.

01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:01.920
Bye bye for now.
