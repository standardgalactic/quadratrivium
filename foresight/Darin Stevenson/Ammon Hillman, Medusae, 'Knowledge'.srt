00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Hello, everybody. Welcome.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,200
I'm going to just straight up. I don't usually go in for this kind of thing.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,080
But I'm going to straight up.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,200
I'm going to warn you that the topics I'm about to explore here

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:31,760
are so profoundly controversial, so provocative,

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:43,520
that if you're not up for some serious provocation,

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,360
feel free to turn aside.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,040
And I know my audience well enough to know that that will have no effect on nearly all of you.

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,320
But for those people who haven't listened to me before,

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,440
and I'm also going to say that I'm going to be holding back.

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,840
In fact, that's normally what I do, because if I were to talk openly about what I have seen

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,240
and come to know as a human being,

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,760
yeah, people would not probably, it would not be allowed for one thing. I would be shut down

14
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,680
very quickly. And, you know, other collectives or whatever might actually hunt me down.

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,960
I don't talk about what I've seen and what I've known, what I've come to know.

16
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,760
I talk about the wrapping paper around the surface of that stuff that I can get away with

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:51,040
speaking about in public. Even in private, if there's even such a thing anymore,

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:07,840
I would be extremely hesitant to delve directly into the incredibly shocking implications

19
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:18,320
of what I've been shown by non-human intelligences that are not demonic. I'm pretty damn sure.

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,440
What I've seen and what I've experienced and what I've come to understand in my own

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,120
walk as a human being, and as not merely human being.

22
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:40,000
So, over the past couple weeks, I've been listening to Amon Hillman.

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:52,560
And, you know, I would argue that Amon himself doesn't understand what he has clearly discovered

24
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,920
in ancient texts about religion, magic, and knowledge.

25
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:12,880
I was listening to him today talk on a podcast, I think it's number 63, interesting number,

26
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:27,840
of The Sacred Speaks. And, he's talking about before the stories of Odysseus and Achilles

27
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,520
and so forth, there was a woman named Medea, who is essentially the origin of magic.

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:43,600
And, the origin of magic has to do with a mixture of basically, okay, this is going to go way out

29
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:51,920
there, people, but get ready for this. So, the idea of Christos is a medicine that is put in

30
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:59,840
people's eyes. It's not Jesus, and whatever Jesus might have been up to, it's probably

31
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,680
nothing like what we are trained to think, if Jesus actually existed.

32
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,200
And, in fact, most people will literally go out of their minds and say,

33
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,200
if they even try to understand some of the things that Amon

34
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:26,480
is saying exist in the primary sources, what does he mean by this? He said, you know,

35
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,200
I had a great advisor in my early education, this guy has a PhD in classicism,

36
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,320
he reads Greek like pretty much no one on earth can. There might be a few people that are close

37
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:49,440
to his skill level, from what I understand. I'm going to wait till this monstrosity ceases its

38
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,760
overhead, fundamental disturbance of all beings.

39
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:09,120
You know, in antiquity, if something like a helicopter went over and just disturbed everything,

40
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,920
people would think that was a God, because how could you have such universal effect? You'd have

41
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,160
to be a mountain or, you know, thunder or something like, there's no way, how could you project such

42
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,800
incredibly generalized and universal effect from on high, if you weren't a God.

43
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,840
And this is part of why I say that the humans essentially invent demons,

44
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,160
and they think these are conveniences or powerful.

45
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:55,040
Yeah, here it comes again, maybe, utterly disturbing.

46
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,560
They don't understand that the dog is disturbed by the helicopter, but it is.

47
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,920
Their dogs just stopped moving when the helicopter flew over.

48
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
And it's the same principle I was trying to explain, and I'll bet now that it's, yep,

49
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,160
now that it's gone, the dog is totally fine. And the humans were confused, they couldn't

50
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,640
figure out what was frightening the dog, even though something in the sky was dominating

51
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:34,640
everything around it universally. And the dog naturally felt unsafe to move. It would not move,

52
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:43,280
they tried to drag it, it wouldn't move. And let me be really clear, what I'm talking about right

53
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,480
now, and much of what I talk about, is forbidden knowledge. You're not supposed to be able to

54
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:59,440
know these things. And this is part of what Amon Hillman's game is, except that Amon himself

55
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,520
doesn't actually understand, I think. If he does, he gives little evidence of it,

56
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:19,840
because he presents his perspective as opposed to what he has learned about the ancients,

57
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:29,360
the topics of magic, medicine, visionary experience, the non-ordinary, all of these things.

58
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:38,880
This man has seen a universe that moderns know nothing of, and it has blown his mind.

59
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:48,320
You know, what he actually said was, I thought, kind of hilarious. He wrote a dissertation

60
00:07:50,320 --> 00:08:04,400
on what was going on in Roman Athens. And, oh my god, the poor. Every naive human is subject

61
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,800
at some point to this kind of catastrophe. I'm going to get back to the whole thing I was talking

62
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:17,760
about with Medea. Yeah, this is going to go way, way into outer space. So,

63
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,400
he wrote a dissertation, and his advisor said, he wants you to remove all references

64
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:36,720
to anything that we could imagine to meet recreational drug use by the ancients,

65
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,720
which was probably, you know, I don't know, wild guess here, 70% of the material,

66
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,440
except that they didn't have the idea of recreation related to drugs at all. It was

67
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,640
it was pharmacopia, right, was the use of poisons. You need to understand this, this pharma,

68
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:07,440
it doesn't mean medicine in the way we imagine. It means the titration of poisons.

69
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,920
And there are two primary sources of poison, maybe three, if the human body is the third.

70
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:26,160
The first is plants. The second is animals. The third is humans, and the fourth is

71
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,600
just take those first three and put a make a concentric rings around them, and then take that

72
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,840
and put a plus symbol next to it. It's that plus. It's anything that's beyond those first three.

73
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:53,280
And the whole history of medicine is the titration of poisons, right, meaning the dosage,

74
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,280
and not just the curing, not the idea of curing, but actually of rebalancing,

75
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,360
right, of rebalancing the body. So what the ancients were doing in many cases is,

76
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:19,040
you know, something incredible to our minds. They are going to the edge of death while embodied.

77
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:28,080
They die, and then they are resurrected from this state by the administration of an antidote.

78
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,400
Do these people actually not even know that I exist? It's so funny.

79
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,080
Some moderns, particularly younger people, they have no concept of personal space.

80
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,400
They'll walk right within, you know, like a half an inch of my body as if I'm not even there.

81
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,360
And not just when they're looking at their phones, but I want to be really clear about something.

82
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,800
Anyone who is walking around in the world with a phone in their hand is disoriented.

83
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,360
And if they're looking at that phone, they are completely disoriented. They might as well be

84
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,840
unconscious. Okay, no, it's not possible to pay attention to their environment or their body

85
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:20,160
or anything when they're looking at that phone. That thing is an energetic and attentional black hole.

86
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,040
And people say, well, I've seen you, you know, walking. Yes, how do you think I figured it out?

87
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,920
I had to first resist what they did for many years and then eventually give in and try it myself.

88
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:43,120
It's terrifyingly dissociative. You might as well just take like a shot of ketamine right to the brain.

89
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,440
It's totally dissociative, except it's worse because at least with the ketamine, you might have

90
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,000
something like a dream or a vision, but with the phone, you just have game empty.

91
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:05,600
It's like a cartoon where your brain just starts producing square waves like a synthesizer with

92
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:16,080
a bad LFO or something. Yeah, a bad oscillator is just nothing in there. The whole brain activity

93
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:25,440
goes to poop, zip-o, this is nothing. Or it goes to like the opposite of anything resembling

94
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:36,240
attentional or relational coherence. In any case, all right, so the thing with Ammon is that he,

95
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:43,440
he, okay, I'll put this, people have the wrong idea about him. They think he's,

96
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:54,000
they think he's demonic, right? And weird things happen all around him very regularly,

97
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:04,000
which that is not surprising at all. Also, if you look at the guy, he's basically like a walking

98
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,840
psychedelic. So that's a third problem, right, is that ordinary people are going to freak out

99
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,480
in his presence for nine different kinds of reasons that he himself probably can't even

100
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,840
understand. He probably thinks there's some. I mean, I think he has an idea about it.

101
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,840
I don't know what those ideas are. Perhaps I may reach out to this guy and see.

102
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,520
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

103
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,200
The geese are gathered. There's a bunch of feathers on the ground. Have they pulled them out themselves?

104
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,720
This is so weird.

105
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,080
That's a huge lot of feathers, but there's no blood on them, which implies that

106
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,840
the geese pulled the feathers themselves in their preening behavior, which they're doing very

107
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,120
attentively at the moment.

108
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,280
If those feathers had been pulled by a predator, there'd be blood on them.

109
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,000
What is that Greek word for hymen? That's the Greek word for blood hymen,

110
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,600
according to what I heard from Ammon.

111
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Yeah, these quills would make excellent pens for ink.

112
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:50,080
So I'm sure Ammon doesn't really know why people get really freaked out by him,

113
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,080
although if you look at him, he's thoroughly tattooed with Greek

114
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:05,600
phrases and words. I'd love to know what the Greek word for my body has become a book is,

115
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,000
or my body is a papyri. This would be great to know about.

116
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,120
Okay, so things are going to get much weirder here just to be clear.

117
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:28,560
What he's talking about are the intentional use of extremely complex pharmacological

118
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,680
substances. Often aphrodisiacal,

119
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,120
substances introduced during rites of orgiastic

120
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:14,000
flagrancy, often into the rectum or the eyes or the mouth, almost invariably by women or

121
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,720
a male officiant who are not merely priests.

122
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:38,960
And many of the substances involved came from the bodies of children.

123
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,120
We've heard nonsense, probably hopefully nonsense, but not necessarily about this

124
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:51,360
in our modern situation with extremely wealthy people or powerful people.

125
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,680
There's myths, I think, I hope, about some substance called adenochrome or something, adrenochrome.

126
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,840
But I haven't heard Ammon say anything about the sacrificing of children. Rather, he speaks about

127
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:21,200
getting substances, initiates, taking substances from the bodies of

128
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
prepubescent boys and girls, mixing these substances with the venoms from snakes

129
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,960
and substances that are botanical, and also possibly substances that are cathonic

130
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,440
or from the earth. In other words, very specific soils or dusts.

131
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,720
I haven't heard him mention that specifically, but from my own knowledge I would be shocked if

132
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:58,560
there's none of that going on. And then the ceremonial introduction of these substances

133
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:10,640
into the eyes, noses, mouths, vaginas, rectums of people who either are undergoing

134
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:22,160
a spiritual transformation or are being healed. He talks of, in what I was hearing him talk about

135
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:30,640
today, he was speaking about Medea and how she became sort of the origin of the idea of magic.

136
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:41,440
And he also talks about, in the Bible, a segment where I suspect he's talking about the horror

137
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,960
of Babylon, quote unquote, and that's the English. I'm sure the Greek is vastly different.

138
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,640
That's funny. People are trying to balance a rock on a rock. If only they could balance their mind

139
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:15,920
on their mind, things would go much better. So wildly unlikely. All right, so Medea became,

140
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:25,200
and also almost certainly Cleopatra, they became adepts with the use of various toxins,

141
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:36,240
which they kept in their hair often. This is where you get the idea of a Medusa,

142
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,200
a woman whose hair looks like snakes, right? What that means is she has dreads, and the dreads are

143
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:51,760
thick with substances that can either be, you could apply moisture to them and get them on your

144
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:59,200
fingertips and then fling them into the eyes of a person in front of you, similarly to what a cobra

145
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:08,320
does, right? Or you could twist a spine or an arrow, some sort of projectile into the dread

146
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,040
with a substance on it that would cause the concentrated toxins in the hair to

147
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:26,880
both become liquefied and to then be absorbed onto the surface of the projectile. You could

148
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:40,400
then shoot that into someone and it would paralyze them. A mirror basically keeps the gaze

149
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:48,320
of something from touching you, and this is the concept I think, though I haven't read the original

150
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:57,680
Greek, which you know would certainly be useful and helpful. A mirror would keep the gaze of

151
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,000
someone from touching you, and it's the idea that it's the gaze of the Medusa that paralyzes.

152
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,320
Not entirely impossible, but I'm going to wildly guess here that Amma would tell us

153
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,520
there's no evidence of that in the primary sources, and what his first counselor told him,

154
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm circling back now, was you need to keep three things in mind as you pursue your academic

155
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,160
passions. The first thing is primary sources. The second thing is primary sources.

156
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,680
You can probably imagine what the third thing is. It's primary sources. What his advisor is saying

157
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:55,360
is give no credence to anything that has to do with someone discussing their opinions or perspectives

158
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:06,080
as a classicist, as a Greek scholar. You can only rely on primary sources. You must always rely

159
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:15,120
on the first texts and never mind what other people think, say, because what you'll find is that

160
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:25,360
very quickly beyond the primary sources, political and religious and military and

161
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:39,760
what philosophical orientations rapidly warp the originals, which is why we are catastrophically

162
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,000
confused according to Ammon about who Jesus was and what he was actually up to.

163
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm not going to get much into that today. You can check out Ammon yourself if you want

164
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,760
his views on that, but let me just say this. It has nothing to do with what we are thinking.

165
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:16,480
Jesus was, in Ammon's view, a, what is the right word, a lasia? I can't remember,

166
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:28,000
lasie, lasia, lasia. Essentially, a trafficker in young children. If you can imagine anything

167
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:39,680
more provocative than that. And as Ammon will tell you, the sources that we have for the Torah

168
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:47,760
are not in Hebrew or Aramaic. They are in Greek. We don't have sources for written,

169
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:58,960
the written Torah is translated from ancient Greek into Hebrew, which is insanely ridiculous

170
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,880
to imagine. I had heard this elsewhere. I had heard this from a scholar,

171
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:17,120
God. I was eventually able to find the source. I heard this from a scholar who was writing on

172
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,400
Korah, a brilliant author actually, who was doing something very, very dangerous on Korah,

173
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,800
for which he eventually got banned because he was masquerading as a woman

174
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,960
and had written some astonishing sort of memoirs of things that had happened to him

175
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,680
as a her, which of course didn't actually happen in the way that he

176
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,240
so artfully wrote at all. But one of the things he was writing about was a day when he was studying

177
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:04,160
the history of the actual origin of the Torah and why there were, why it was that

178
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,440
the original sources were all in Greek. I mean, can you imagine how provocative that is?

179
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,040
And I'm sure there are people who will want to yell at me and go like, oh, you're an idiot.

180
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:26,880
Of course, they were in Hebrew or Aramaic. But I challenged them to produce the dated

181
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:38,000
material that shows that the Hebrew or Aramaic predates the Greek from which the Torah was

182
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:48,080
certainly translated into Hebrew, which is, again, staggeringly unexpected.

183
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,680
But this is the kind of thing we will consistently discover when we look into

184
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,160
not just history as a record of what happened, history is the mysterious origin of our present

185
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:10,000
circumstances. History as that first tone that's being echoed cyclically, recursively in a spiral

186
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:22,000
that rhymes with its previous arcs. History is that. So basically, his advisors told him,

187
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,440
you have to take out everything that we would understand is related to recreational drug use

188
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,560
among the Romans. And he said, why would I do that? And they said, because it's obvious that

189
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:42,640
the Romans would not neither do that nor put up with it. And he thought to himself two things,

190
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:51,440
I think. The first one is, how the fuck would you know that? What, you just have some moralistic

191
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:59,280
predictor of what you think the Romans would or would not have done? But the second thing he thought,

192
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:11,360
which I think is hilarious, was, okay, I'm going to take all this stuff out so that I can at least

193
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,560
publish my dissertation. But for the rest of my life, I'll find all the things that the Romans

194
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:27,520
wouldn't do. My job from now on is I will be the human who knows all the things that you think the

195
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:39,040
Romans wouldn't do, wouldn't allow. And he cites, knownness, primarily. Galen,

196
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,200
Escalus, not sure if I'm pronouncing that right. Some of these things are hard to pronounce,

197
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:57,360
but knownness and Galen aren't. And a big shout out to my friend who's actually named Galen.

198
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:05,360
Here. Because he's almost like the, no one would ever believe it, but he's almost like the rebirth

199
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:16,240
of one of the Greek scholars in the modern times. And wow, what a problem that is for him.

200
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,680
And you know, those who love him, and I'm one of those people.

201
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:34,640
So yeah, he cites the actual Greek in the New Testament, from which the New Testament is derived

202
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:42,080
in English. And he points out all kinds of catastrophic mistranslations, which are endemic

203
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:49,440
to the Bible that we read. I mean, the idea that you could translate Hebrew into English

204
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:59,200
is pretty nearly insane if it's biblical Hebrew, or you know, Torah Hebrew. But again,

205
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,280
you have the same problem, right? There's no such thing as biblical Hebrew. Biblical Hebrew is a

206
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:10,960
derivation of biblical Greek. And the chances of you translating a language is sophisticated in

207
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:21,600
its connotative and technical features into English. I don't even know. It would be like trying to

208
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:30,560
translate Romanian geometry into basic arithmetic. It's just not going to ever happen.

209
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,040
And this is part of the problem that we face

210
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,480
with our historical documents in general, and anything that where we can't go to the original

211
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:57,440
source with, you know, arm in arm with a scholar of significant educational and linguistic depth,

212
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,600
right? And clearly, Ammon is one of a few such scholars that exist. He's not the only one.

213
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,880
But uh,

214
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,720
there's so much going on here that it's really hard to remain focused. All right, so

215
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:29,440
so they made him remove everything that that they thought might possibly indicate what they

216
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,040
call the recreational use of drugs by the Romans and the Athenians. And this is the birthplace

217
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,360
of the idea of democracy in so much as we moderns understand it in the West. Obviously, there were

218
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,520
experiments long before this, and there were things more like liquid democracy than formal

219
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,040
democracy. By the time you have to formalize a system, you've lost most of its essence and

220
00:30:53,040 --> 00:31:00,160
origin completely, right? By the time you have to formalize relationships, you have a problem where

221
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:06,480
the concept of the individual has achieved an unjustified primacy. You follow me? It should

222
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:14,960
never be this ultimate. This idea of individual should never be this ultimate. So um,

223
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,080
I'm going to carefully skirt the, oh god, what a pun. I'm going to skirt the topics

224
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:34,160
that are related to what I have said, which is the ceremonial use of substances produced

225
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:41,840
by the bodies of prepubescent humans. I'm going to skirt that topic, but I'm going to circle it

226
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:48,960
and highlight it just so that it remains in the orbit of what we are here trying to understand.

227
00:31:50,960 --> 00:32:01,440
Medea became a master of the uses, both of snake venom and the mixtures, the careful mixture,

228
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:12,400
like as if, as if, as if each venom. So the substances that a human body produces can be

229
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:26,160
understood as elixirs, right? The sweat, the tears, the saliva, the, oh my god, dare I even say these

230
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:41,920
things? I, no, I'm not going to say it. Sexual exudations and a couple of other things that

231
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,880
I'm going to leave out. If you're really imaginative, you'll figure out what I'm pointing at. Most of

232
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:55,680
you won't, probably for everyone's best interest that you don't. And these topics are so forbidden,

233
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:02,000
right? They're, they're so forbidden that you will be killed for considering them in many cases,

234
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,760
but certainly you will be, you know, obliterated for publicly discussing them.

235
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:17,600
And so I'm taking a lot of risks here, even though I'm being relatively circumspect.

236
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,920
This guy looks like he's aware of principles related to

237
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:40,320
interior martial arts. He's using hand gestures that are evocative of the manipulation of chi,

238
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,280
which is a related topic here, okay? But things are going to get really weird in a moment.

239
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,760
So Amon decided, I'm going to find out everything that those, those Greeks wouldn't have been doing.

240
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,000
And he did. I mean, he's, you know, and he's been accused of strange

241
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,840
things that I think people have him entirely backwards. If they think he's interested,

242
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,520
for example, in summoning demons or opening portals. I mean, the problem with Amon

243
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,840
is that if you're walking around on earth with the knowledge that he has,

244
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,800
you might, you are a portal. You don't have to go opening them. You are one.

245
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,400
And, and this is a problem for him that I think he'll hopefully artfully

246
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:46,160
negotiate, right? Mitigate or work with. All right. So remember, this is a, this is a topic that

247
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:54,400
other things down here. This is a topic that has fascinated me and I've had some brand new insights

248
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:02,320
today based on what Amon was talking about that are staggering to me and wildly unexpected

249
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:10,240
because I felt like I mostly knew what was going on because I had been shown

250
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:18,160
stories, but the stories omitted certain things. And Amon's

251
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:32,720
discussion has illuminated something fundamental. Okay, I'm going to take a couple of these quills

252
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:43,200
because these quills are seriously great. So I want, I want this one.

253
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,200
This one.

254
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:31,520
So, long ago,

255
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,080
an on-ordinary being offered me a wish and had I been intelligent,

256
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,840
I would have perhaps wished differently. And I now for the first time understand something about

257
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,360
why that being seemed very surprised by what I had selected.

258
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,000
But the fundamental wish was help me understand how my species got broken and if there's any

259
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:13,200
medicine for that. And what it did was it dripped insight into the eye of my mind

260
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:20,320
very delicately so it would not destroy me. And so that I would understand the origins

261
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,400
of what I refer to as representational cognition in our species

262
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:41,840
and the histories and mysteries of how that very problematical feature of we moderns originated.

263
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:53,600
But I also asked specifically, talk to me about the tree incident in Genesis

264
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:02,080
because this seems to be at least for some people or in some way a crucial origin story

265
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:15,840
where the problems apparently get started. And I'm going to spoil the charade here because,

266
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:24,800
okay, so what I was first shown was that the serpent, quote unquote, was an angel

267
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,480
in a sense and it was the angel of the knowledge of dividing things, one from another,

268
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,480
the knowledge of distinguishing. And so it made divisions in the minds

269
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:51,440
of first of Eve and then of Adam by giving them the fruit of the tree of knowledge.

270
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,720
And certainly,

271
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:12,800
this can be thought of in a variety of ways. I've had many perspectives on what that

272
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,200
concept of the fruit might refer to. And it's much better to have three to five good

273
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,640
perspectives than it is to have one. If you have one, it will blind you. And some of us,

274
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,600
some people will think, well, there's a difference between things that are actually

275
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:35,040
true and those that aren't. Yes, there are, but insight is not always forged from the facts.

276
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,680
Often it's forged from the dreaming, which is the intelligent,

277
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:53,840
what, reambiguation of the facts. The intelligent reamb, getting the facts

278
00:39:53,840 --> 00:40:01,360
is useful. The intelligently reambiguating them is profound. And this is what happens

279
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,600
when we dream. This is part of what happens when we use certain substances, pharmacoya.

280
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:18,880
And what I've seen today for the first time is, okay, let me go back to Medea.

281
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:28,000
So, Ammon was saying that Medea became a master of the, not just the application

282
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:41,440
of substances derived from vipers and snakes. Oh my God. I can't believe I can see so many

283
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,800
problems in me sharing this recording. I can't, I'm going to be surprised if the recording even

284
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:55,840
survives. Am I still actually recording? Yes, apparently I am. Okay. Wow. So,

285
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:05,440
Medea became

286
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:23,200
supra humanly adept, not merely at the acquisition of venoms from snakes and possibly other creatures

287
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,760
and possibly

288
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,680
botanical and perhaps cathonic substances as well, the mixing of them.

289
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:47,120
This, in a sense, he's saying she is, at least in some historical lines or traditions,

290
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:56,960
the first pharmacologist, the one who mixes toxins and also understands them probably in a kind of

291
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:07,360
a spiritual way that results in the capacity to produce antidotes, which are not merely curatives.

292
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,360
They can rebalance

293
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:22,000
and possibly even resurrect. So, what is being implied here by Ammon,

294
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:29,280
and I don't think he's going to agree with me about this if he even becomes aware of my theory,

295
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:42,960
is that the viper at the tree in Genesis, the serpent, which in my, in the stories I was shown,

296
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,400
is essentially an angel. It's like the first angel. It's the angel that divides.

297
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,480
It's the angel with the gift of cutting, essentially cutting in the mind. So, it's

298
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,320
the angel that allows for the possibility of distinguishing and thus the beginning of the

299
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:13,520
concept of naming and thus the beginning of concepts themselves and the tree of nomenclature,

300
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:23,760
reference, representation, tokenization and consciousness, commodities, all these things.

301
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,240
You can see, in a sense, it could be understood as the origin of evil,

302
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:38,800
because all of these departures from unity and communion are necessary for the idea of knowledge,

303
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:49,920
right? And knowledge is so often, if not always, the death of participation. It's the knife that the

304
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,760
waking awareness brings to the bubbles of dreaming, collapsing them into awakening,

305
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,600
where identity is declarative rather than connotative or relational. It is declared rather

306
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:14,800
than suggested, which is what happens in moonlight. Sunlight is declarative, moonlight is suggestive,

307
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:25,760
invocative, invitational, connotational, associational, more like the imagination

308
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:34,880
than the denotation or the dictionary. And so, the implication here is that the serpent, both

309
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:44,400
the amonic, I'm going to call it the amonic implication for me, is that the serpent gave

310
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:53,280
Eve the toxin that brought her to the verge of death, to the liminal space between worlds,

311
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:01,360
the hypnagogic, pompic space. The serpent injected her with this venom and gave her the

312
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:07,360
knowledge of the venom and how to use it and also how to comprise the antidote.

313
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:18,560
And then she died and was resurrected and thus had knowledge, because the whole idea of knowledge

314
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:29,760
is equated with death in the Hebrew. The tree, the sephiroth in the center of it that isn't

315
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:37,840
numbered is doth, which is knowledge. And this doth and death are closely related. So the concept

316
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:47,440
here is that Eve was brought to the verge of death, essentially killed by the serpent, resurrected,

317
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,520
given the knowledge of the antidotes. She communicated this knowledge to the males, to Adam,

318
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:01,840
by producing the same series of events in his body and consciousness. They both were awakened

319
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:14,000
to the reality of death, which before had been perhaps impossible for them. And now that they

320
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,480
were no longer immortal in the sense of a rising moment to moment from the communal essence of

321
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:34,320
being, now they have become subject to mortality and physical death. And this is the

322
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:46,640
implication of the Ammonic knowledge that Ammon himself seems very resistant to. He claims that

323
00:46:46,640 --> 00:47:16,400
this is the Canaanite path that he associates with all kinds of apparent ethical

324
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:30,720
deviation. I'm going to go check out this music, but we're going to come back to this. And the place

325
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:42,240
we'll come back to is Medea and how we get to the idea of Medusae from there. All right, so

326
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:55,760
I walked into the concourse between the museums here in San Francisco. There's a bunch of people

327
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:04,160
with spacesuits on the stage of the amphitheater, and they're playing a jazz version of Hallelujah

328
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,840
while I'm making this recording, which I think is fairly ridiculously

329
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:20,080
synchronistic and trippy and bizarre. All right, so Medea became one of the first

330
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:30,240
masters of the formulation and applications of venoms from serpents.

331
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,480
We must imagine particularly vipers, but probably also

332
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:45,760
cobras, and there are a variety of, okay,

333
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:54,720
ophi, let's see, what was he talking about?

334
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:05,600
I cannot recall the genus name that refers to the serpents, but it's OPH, right? It's like

335
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:18,960
ophiologists study serpents. So he talks about, in the book of Revelation, a reference,

336
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:35,360
it's insane people, unfortunately. He talks about

337
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:53,760
people referred to as essentially devotees of both this woman who

338
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:05,360
distributes elixirs that are derived both from serpents and her sexual exudations.

339
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:20,480
The ophians, ophidians, something like this. I can't quite find the word. In any case, Medea ends up in

340
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:29,520
what later becomes Sicily. I can't remember the other s name it had previously, which turns out to be

341
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:37,680
the birthplace of my direct paternal ancestors. Syracuse, I think, is what he called it.

342
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:46,880
And there's a man who's been bitten by a marsh viper, and she reaches, and this is in the original

343
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,840
sources, right? This is in the ancient Greek, probably in Nonos or Galen or something. She reaches

344
00:50:52,640 --> 00:51:02,480
beneath her undergarments, produces a substance from her vagina with which she resurrects the sky.

345
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:13,760
And, you know, moderns, you poor, benighted folks, you can think whatever you feel comfortable about

346
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:22,400
thinking. You can think people are just making this stuff up. This is wildly improbable. Of course,

347
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:30,880
we know what's actually true about Jesus and pharmacology and molecular chemistry and all

348
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:36,560
of these things. Yeah, we know the mechanics to some degree. We know nothing of that plus.

349
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:44,880
And very, very little, we don't. We stopped mixing snake venom, you know, 8,000 years ago,

350
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,240
but there were people all over the world who knew that what could kill you could heal you,

351
00:51:51,760 --> 00:52:03,840
and that particularly the energies and the capacities of the human spirit when driven into

352
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:12,960
either ecstatic modes. And when I say this word mode, I want you to think of both the

353
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:23,120
frequency and an array of shapes, a progressing array of shapes like you might see on a drum head

354
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:31,440
with sand or another substance on it when frequencies are being played on speakers

355
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:38,160
underneath the drum head so that geometric figures arise in the sand on the surface of the drum

356
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:51,280
head. This is what I'm, the human soul is capable of producing an array of iterative transformations,

357
00:52:52,080 --> 00:53:00,000
right, that can be recursively self-amplifying and can produce staggering forms of healing.

358
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:08,880
In someone who is sick or poisoned. And what these ancients were often concerned with

359
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:17,200
was something, you know, when you hear, no one would think when they hear the psalm,

360
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,560
yea, though I walk through the shadow, you know, through I walk, yea, though I walk through the

361
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:31,920
valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. And they think this means you will not

362
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,320
fear evil because the holy ones are with you. But what it actually means is I will not fear dying

363
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:50,240
because the people of the antidote are with me. No one will think this. And yet the actual texts

364
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,960
almost certainly refer to something like this rather than what we are trained to think.

365
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:06,240
Now I have seen and was shown histories that are much more shocking and staggering than anything

366
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:14,800
Ammon has even hinted at. I don't speak of them to humans ever, not even in private.

367
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,360
I was shown

368
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:36,320
modes of relation that led to abilities that are wildly non-ordinary and unexpectedly profound.

369
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:45,440
I don't practice these things. I am simply aware that we are very confused about what it means to be

370
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:51,680
human. And actually we are extremely confused about what knowledge is because it has almost

371
00:54:51,680 --> 00:55:00,240
nothing to do with the capacity to form mechanical tools. Actual knowledge is insight. And insight

372
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:10,800
means knowing the span from origin to the present, intimately and amnoetically recalling it

373
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,000
as if you are doing a sort of spiritual and or genetic

374
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:29,680
and amnoetic, right? Unforgetting archaeology within the depths of our bodies and being

375
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:36,160
and relationships. This is what real knowledge is. It's not mechanical knowledge. It's not physics.

376
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:42,880
It's not math. It's not mere geometry. Though geometry is strangely profoundly

377
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,880
related to all of these topics.

378
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,200
To concentrate on surviving the street crossing there.

379
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:21,520
So somehow today, for the first time, I've become capable of imagining

380
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:30,400
a gloss on the tree story that had never occurred to me before. That the serpent

381
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:45,120
took Eve to the brink of death or actually into death, right? And then gave her the antidotes,

382
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:57,760
revived her, resurrected her, and then she in turn led Adam through the same initiatory

383
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:14,080
process. I don't know, I may never know what Ammon actually thinks because I suspect that

384
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:21,280
if he's intelligent, like me, he won't share with, he won't say anything about this

385
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,600
to anyone ever. Or he might say something about it in private. I don't know what he

386
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:35,600
actually thinks or believes. One of the things he said when Danny Jones asked him if he was religious at all,

387
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:45,520
because he often apparently says the phrase, Hail Satan. And Danny asked him,

388
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,040
you know, why do you do that? Are you Satanist? He says, no, I don't like those people.

389
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:53,600
And Danny says, so why are you doing that? Who's Satan? And he says, he talks about Satan as

390
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:09,920
the Morning Star, the Lightbringer, the Enlightener, who was lied about because Zeus was a liar and so

391
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:19,200
projected, if I understand, this is very spooky and sketchy, but Zeus projected his own failings

392
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:33,680
and perhaps flailings onto Lucifer. And these are matters I inquired into during my own experience.

393
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:43,920
And I'm happy to communicate about privately, but I don't want to make clumsy abstractions about,

394
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:51,280
clumsy abstract generalizations. In effect, that is a form of sin. It's

395
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,440
sin by generalization and sin by abstraction.

396
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:04,640
In order to speak meaningfully about such matters, we must inquire together. We must begin with the

397
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:17,360
spirit of inquiry, not the spirit of dissertation or locution, has to start with inquiry together.

398
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:27,760
Then we have a chance to speak intelligently and learn intelligently together. So I will resist

399
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:38,400
the urge to speak about that matter abstractly at the moment. And I want to be clear that

400
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:45,920
for those of you who may have a desire to actually drink the waters

401
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:56,400
together, that's a wedding that doesn't happen in the invitation.

402
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:06,720
That's something that happens one on one. If we both agree that we want to cleanse our eyes

403
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:19,200
of the anciently complicated obstructions that language, concept, religion, policy, expectation,

404
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:31,520
tradition have imposed on us so unjustly, so terrifyingly. And yet some of the jungles,

405
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:39,600
you know, there are portions of the jungles of insight that are at least as terrifying to our

406
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:47,040
common expectation of meaning, identity, relationship, origin. They have nothing to,

407
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:53,280
they don't care a whit about what we prefer to believe or what we think is sane,

408
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:04,640
what we think is clean. There's no, you know, it's like dumping a bucket of water on the sun's surface,

409
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:13,600
if you could transport one there somehow. There's no respect for that.

410
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,760
There, it cannot be preserved there.

411
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:37,600
Huh. Okay, I'll try that.

412
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:49,840
There's a little library here on my street where a woman puts her books out and I saw her yesterday,

413
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:53,600
she came home and it's the first time I've seen who it is that's putting the books in here.

414
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,360
And I said, you know, you have some very interesting books and she looked at me

415
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:03,920
like I was an insane person, like I was a dangerous person, like I was someone she would

416
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:11,280
prefer to have no Congress whatsoever with. And it was really weird. She definitely

417
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,720
both refused the compliment. I feel like, yeah, you can keep that compliment to yourself, buddy.

418
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:28,720
I don't care. And I don't want to know you. And your mother was a conigate and your father

419
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:40,160
smelled of elderberries, et cetera, et cetera. But yeah, I've just found a book called the Child

420
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:50,160
Garden, which has extraordinary praise written all over it by Geoff Reiman. So maybe I'll read

421
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:59,440
some science fiction again instead of living it. But yeah, if you think what I present in my

422
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:06,320
recordings is deep, you should get a taste of what you're actually carrying, where you come from,

423
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:14,720
where we come from, where our minds, by what parents, our minds and souls were forged,

424
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:22,320
and for what purposes. And when we breach or broach the topics that I've been playing with

425
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:32,960
today, which were masterfully introduced by Amon Hillman, we're at least closing in on the vicinity

426
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:48,400
of stuff that really matters. We're closing in on the outskirts of the gardens of infinity

427
01:03:49,280 --> 01:04:03,680
that are the origins of not just the lights in the sky, but the sky itself, and that from which

428
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:14,080
it emerges as a reflective embodiment of this thing, the living waters,

429
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,800
which Amon, a phrase that Amon actually mentions in relationship to

430
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:29,680
what he calls the third ventricle, which is a capacious space inside the brain

431
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:41,040
where a liquid circulates, an elixir. And what he talks about is women learning how to produce

432
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:50,960
drugs in their own bodies, so that their bodies became a pharmacopia. He says that the sources speak

433
01:04:52,240 --> 01:05:05,760
of Medea and other women, Medusa, she calls giants not meaning huge, in size meaning huge,

434
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:16,560
in knowledge, gigantus. It's lovely to hear the reverence and terror with which he sometimes

435
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:26,000
pronounces Greek words. He claims that small serpents were treated with oils and stored

436
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:33,680
in the vaginal cavities of these women. I know how the moderns are just going to

437
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:39,200
like squinch up their faces and go like, okay, this dude's nuts, or maybe Darren's nuts.

438
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,680
But neither of those things are true. What's actually true is we moderns are completely broken

439
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,160
because we have

440
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:58,800
absolutely wrong ideas inculcated by nonsensical absurdities.

441
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,120
About matters related to medicine, origin, spirit,

442
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:18,160
Christ, the meanings of these ideas, all of these things are completely delusional.

443
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:28,000
We have this weirdly puritanical opposition to anything that might actually resemble understanding.

444
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:36,000
And if we are to have understanding, we must divest ourselves of the obstacles between us and that.

445
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:46,720
And some of that divestment is profoundly uncomfortable and conceptually unimaginable

446
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:54,080
to we who have grown up in a world divorced from these original stories.

447
01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:02,560
So, as usual, I'm grateful for this time we've had together. I have arrived home.

448
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:08,400
I'm going to wash some feather quills that I retrieved and listen to more Ammon

449
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,680
and probably regret that I didn't speak further and longer on this topic,

450
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:18,160
which is so fascinating to me because for the first time I've started to see what

451
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:33,040
the possible relationship is between the snake in the tree in the garden and insight,

452
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:42,240
and also possibly a mystery in the black foot lore where the moon falls in love

453
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,440
with something that is referred to in the English translation

454
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,800
as a many-legged snake that lives in a hollow log.

455
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:58,640
Oh, God, this is so... I'm not even going to start to elucidate my concerns and thoughts about that

456
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:05,680
matter, which has been a primordial question that I and Ryan Firstiver have been chasing together

457
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:13,040
for many joyful years now. Thank you for joining me. I wish you all blessings, a beautiful path in

458
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:20,160
your life and day and moment. I wish you the wonders of actual insight. May the

459
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:28,240
may the plank in your eye be removed and may you resist

460
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:40,160
the compulsions of judgment so that you may taste the nectar.

461
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:50,160
Of liberation and insight. Bye-bye for now. Thank you for joining me.
