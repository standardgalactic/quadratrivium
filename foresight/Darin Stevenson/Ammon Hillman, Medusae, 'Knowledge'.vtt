00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
Hello, everybody. Welcome.

00:04.880 --> 00:09.200
I'm going to just straight up. I don't usually go in for this kind of thing.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.080
But I'm going to straight up.

00:15.440 --> 00:21.200
I'm going to warn you that the topics I'm about to explore here

00:21.280 --> 00:31.760
are so profoundly controversial, so provocative,

00:34.880 --> 00:43.520
that if you're not up for some serious provocation,

00:46.240 --> 00:47.360
feel free to turn aside.

00:48.320 --> 00:53.040
And I know my audience well enough to know that that will have no effect on nearly all of you.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.320
But for those people who haven't listened to me before,

00:56.320 --> 00:59.440
and I'm also going to say that I'm going to be holding back.

01:00.720 --> 01:07.840
In fact, that's normally what I do, because if I were to talk openly about what I have seen

01:07.920 --> 01:10.240
and come to know as a human being,

01:13.680 --> 01:21.760
yeah, people would not probably, it would not be allowed for one thing. I would be shut down

01:21.760 --> 01:29.680
very quickly. And, you know, other collectives or whatever might actually hunt me down.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.960
I don't talk about what I've seen and what I've known, what I've come to know.

01:35.760 --> 01:41.760
I talk about the wrapping paper around the surface of that stuff that I can get away with

01:41.760 --> 01:51.040
speaking about in public. Even in private, if there's even such a thing anymore,

01:51.760 --> 02:07.840
I would be extremely hesitant to delve directly into the incredibly shocking implications

02:09.840 --> 02:18.320
of what I've been shown by non-human intelligences that are not demonic. I'm pretty damn sure.

02:19.280 --> 02:23.440
What I've seen and what I've experienced and what I've come to understand in my own

02:24.160 --> 02:29.120
walk as a human being, and as not merely human being.

02:32.320 --> 02:40.000
So, over the past couple weeks, I've been listening to Amon Hillman.

02:40.400 --> 02:52.560
And, you know, I would argue that Amon himself doesn't understand what he has clearly discovered

02:54.080 --> 03:01.920
in ancient texts about religion, magic, and knowledge.

03:02.080 --> 03:12.880
I was listening to him today talk on a podcast, I think it's number 63, interesting number,

03:15.280 --> 03:27.840
of The Sacred Speaks. And, he's talking about before the stories of Odysseus and Achilles

03:27.840 --> 03:33.520
and so forth, there was a woman named Medea, who is essentially the origin of magic.

03:34.800 --> 03:43.600
And, the origin of magic has to do with a mixture of basically, okay, this is going to go way out

03:43.600 --> 03:51.920
there, people, but get ready for this. So, the idea of Christos is a medicine that is put in

03:51.920 --> 03:59.840
people's eyes. It's not Jesus, and whatever Jesus might have been up to, it's probably

03:59.840 --> 04:03.680
nothing like what we are trained to think, if Jesus actually existed.

04:06.720 --> 04:11.200
And, in fact, most people will literally go out of their minds and say,

04:12.160 --> 04:17.200
if they even try to understand some of the things that Amon

04:19.360 --> 04:26.480
is saying exist in the primary sources, what does he mean by this? He said, you know,

04:26.480 --> 04:31.200
I had a great advisor in my early education, this guy has a PhD in classicism,

04:32.160 --> 04:38.320
he reads Greek like pretty much no one on earth can. There might be a few people that are close

04:38.320 --> 04:49.440
to his skill level, from what I understand. I'm going to wait till this monstrosity ceases its

04:50.240 --> 04:57.760
overhead, fundamental disturbance of all beings.

04:58.080 --> 05:09.120
You know, in antiquity, if something like a helicopter went over and just disturbed everything,

05:09.120 --> 05:13.920
people would think that was a God, because how could you have such universal effect? You'd have

05:13.920 --> 05:20.160
to be a mountain or, you know, thunder or something like, there's no way, how could you project such

05:20.160 --> 05:26.800
incredibly generalized and universal effect from on high, if you weren't a God.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.840
And this is part of why I say that the humans essentially invent demons,

05:32.640 --> 05:36.160
and they think these are conveniences or powerful.

05:36.160 --> 05:55.040
Yeah, here it comes again, maybe, utterly disturbing.

06:00.480 --> 06:04.560
They don't understand that the dog is disturbed by the helicopter, but it is.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.920
Their dogs just stopped moving when the helicopter flew over.

06:10.720 --> 06:14.720
And it's the same principle I was trying to explain, and I'll bet now that it's, yep,

06:14.720 --> 06:20.160
now that it's gone, the dog is totally fine. And the humans were confused, they couldn't

06:20.160 --> 06:24.640
figure out what was frightening the dog, even though something in the sky was dominating

06:24.640 --> 06:34.640
everything around it universally. And the dog naturally felt unsafe to move. It would not move,

06:34.640 --> 06:43.280
they tried to drag it, it wouldn't move. And let me be really clear, what I'm talking about right

06:43.280 --> 06:50.480
now, and much of what I talk about, is forbidden knowledge. You're not supposed to be able to

06:50.480 --> 06:59.440
know these things. And this is part of what Amon Hillman's game is, except that Amon himself

07:00.080 --> 07:07.520
doesn't actually understand, I think. If he does, he gives little evidence of it,

07:10.960 --> 07:19.840
because he presents his perspective as opposed to what he has learned about the ancients,

07:19.840 --> 07:29.360
the topics of magic, medicine, visionary experience, the non-ordinary, all of these things.

07:30.480 --> 07:38.880
This man has seen a universe that moderns know nothing of, and it has blown his mind.

07:39.600 --> 07:48.320
You know, what he actually said was, I thought, kind of hilarious. He wrote a dissertation

07:50.320 --> 08:04.400
on what was going on in Roman Athens. And, oh my god, the poor. Every naive human is subject

08:04.400 --> 08:08.800
at some point to this kind of catastrophe. I'm going to get back to the whole thing I was talking

08:08.800 --> 08:17.760
about with Medea. Yeah, this is going to go way, way into outer space. So,

08:20.880 --> 08:26.400
he wrote a dissertation, and his advisor said, he wants you to remove all references

08:27.200 --> 08:36.720
to anything that we could imagine to meet recreational drug use by the ancients,

08:37.680 --> 08:42.720
which was probably, you know, I don't know, wild guess here, 70% of the material,

08:43.840 --> 08:49.440
except that they didn't have the idea of recreation related to drugs at all. It was

08:50.160 --> 08:56.640
it was pharmacopia, right, was the use of poisons. You need to understand this, this pharma,

08:57.280 --> 09:07.440
it doesn't mean medicine in the way we imagine. It means the titration of poisons.

09:08.800 --> 09:15.920
And there are two primary sources of poison, maybe three, if the human body is the third.

09:16.880 --> 09:26.160
The first is plants. The second is animals. The third is humans, and the fourth is

09:29.040 --> 09:35.600
just take those first three and put a make a concentric rings around them, and then take that

09:35.600 --> 09:41.840
and put a plus symbol next to it. It's that plus. It's anything that's beyond those first three.

09:41.840 --> 09:53.280
And the whole history of medicine is the titration of poisons, right, meaning the dosage,

09:54.000 --> 10:01.280
and not just the curing, not the idea of curing, but actually of rebalancing,

10:02.560 --> 10:09.360
right, of rebalancing the body. So what the ancients were doing in many cases is,

10:09.600 --> 10:19.040
you know, something incredible to our minds. They are going to the edge of death while embodied.

10:19.680 --> 10:28.080
They die, and then they are resurrected from this state by the administration of an antidote.

10:28.320 --> 10:36.400
Do these people actually not even know that I exist? It's so funny.

10:40.480 --> 10:46.080
Some moderns, particularly younger people, they have no concept of personal space.

10:47.360 --> 10:52.400
They'll walk right within, you know, like a half an inch of my body as if I'm not even there.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.360
And not just when they're looking at their phones, but I want to be really clear about something.

10:57.360 --> 11:02.800
Anyone who is walking around in the world with a phone in their hand is disoriented.

11:02.800 --> 11:07.360
And if they're looking at that phone, they are completely disoriented. They might as well be

11:07.360 --> 11:13.840
unconscious. Okay, no, it's not possible to pay attention to their environment or their body

11:13.840 --> 11:20.160
or anything when they're looking at that phone. That thing is an energetic and attentional black hole.

11:22.560 --> 11:27.040
And people say, well, I've seen you, you know, walking. Yes, how do you think I figured it out?

11:27.840 --> 11:33.920
I had to first resist what they did for many years and then eventually give in and try it myself.

11:34.880 --> 11:43.120
It's terrifyingly dissociative. You might as well just take like a shot of ketamine right to the brain.

11:44.240 --> 11:49.440
It's totally dissociative, except it's worse because at least with the ketamine, you might have

11:49.440 --> 11:54.000
something like a dream or a vision, but with the phone, you just have game empty.

11:57.280 --> 12:05.600
It's like a cartoon where your brain just starts producing square waves like a synthesizer with

12:05.600 --> 12:16.080
a bad LFO or something. Yeah, a bad oscillator is just nothing in there. The whole brain activity

12:16.080 --> 12:25.440
goes to poop, zip-o, this is nothing. Or it goes to like the opposite of anything resembling

12:25.440 --> 12:36.240
attentional or relational coherence. In any case, all right, so the thing with Ammon is that he,

12:36.400 --> 12:43.440
he, okay, I'll put this, people have the wrong idea about him. They think he's,

12:46.320 --> 12:54.000
they think he's demonic, right? And weird things happen all around him very regularly,

12:54.800 --> 13:04.000
which that is not surprising at all. Also, if you look at the guy, he's basically like a walking

13:04.000 --> 13:11.840
psychedelic. So that's a third problem, right, is that ordinary people are going to freak out

13:11.840 --> 13:16.480
in his presence for nine different kinds of reasons that he himself probably can't even

13:16.480 --> 13:23.840
understand. He probably thinks there's some. I mean, I think he has an idea about it.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.840
I don't know what those ideas are. Perhaps I may reach out to this guy and see.

13:29.840 --> 13:35.520
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

13:38.480 --> 13:43.200
The geese are gathered. There's a bunch of feathers on the ground. Have they pulled them out themselves?

13:47.680 --> 13:48.720
This is so weird.

13:51.760 --> 13:56.080
That's a huge lot of feathers, but there's no blood on them, which implies that

13:56.080 --> 14:01.840
the geese pulled the feathers themselves in their preening behavior, which they're doing very

14:03.680 --> 14:05.120
attentively at the moment.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.280
If those feathers had been pulled by a predator, there'd be blood on them.

14:15.360 --> 14:22.000
What is that Greek word for hymen? That's the Greek word for blood hymen,

14:22.800 --> 14:25.600
according to what I heard from Ammon.

14:34.080 --> 14:38.080
Yeah, these quills would make excellent pens for ink.

14:42.960 --> 14:50.080
So I'm sure Ammon doesn't really know why people get really freaked out by him,

14:50.640 --> 14:56.080
although if you look at him, he's thoroughly tattooed with Greek

14:57.600 --> 15:05.600
phrases and words. I'd love to know what the Greek word for my body has become a book is,

15:07.280 --> 15:12.000
or my body is a papyri. This would be great to know about.

15:14.560 --> 15:17.120
Okay, so things are going to get much weirder here just to be clear.

15:18.080 --> 15:28.560
What he's talking about are the intentional use of extremely complex pharmacological

15:28.800 --> 15:35.680
substances. Often aphrodisiacal,

15:46.800 --> 15:53.120
substances introduced during rites of orgiastic

15:53.120 --> 16:14.000
flagrancy, often into the rectum or the eyes or the mouth, almost invariably by women or

16:17.760 --> 16:20.720
a male officiant who are not merely priests.

16:23.840 --> 16:38.960
And many of the substances involved came from the bodies of children.

16:40.400 --> 16:45.120
We've heard nonsense, probably hopefully nonsense, but not necessarily about this

16:45.840 --> 16:51.360
in our modern situation with extremely wealthy people or powerful people.

16:52.240 --> 16:59.680
There's myths, I think, I hope, about some substance called adenochrome or something, adrenochrome.

17:03.600 --> 17:11.840
But I haven't heard Ammon say anything about the sacrificing of children. Rather, he speaks about

17:12.800 --> 17:21.200
getting substances, initiates, taking substances from the bodies of

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
prepubescent boys and girls, mixing these substances with the venoms from snakes

17:28.720 --> 17:34.960
and substances that are botanical, and also possibly substances that are cathonic

17:35.600 --> 17:41.440
or from the earth. In other words, very specific soils or dusts.

17:43.280 --> 17:48.720
I haven't heard him mention that specifically, but from my own knowledge I would be shocked if

17:48.720 --> 17:58.560
there's none of that going on. And then the ceremonial introduction of these substances

17:59.280 --> 18:10.640
into the eyes, noses, mouths, vaginas, rectums of people who either are undergoing

18:12.080 --> 18:22.160
a spiritual transformation or are being healed. He talks of, in what I was hearing him talk about

18:22.160 --> 18:30.640
today, he was speaking about Medea and how she became sort of the origin of the idea of magic.

18:33.120 --> 18:41.440
And he also talks about, in the Bible, a segment where I suspect he's talking about the horror

18:41.440 --> 18:48.960
of Babylon, quote unquote, and that's the English. I'm sure the Greek is vastly different.

18:57.600 --> 19:02.640
That's funny. People are trying to balance a rock on a rock. If only they could balance their mind

19:02.640 --> 19:15.920
on their mind, things would go much better. So wildly unlikely. All right, so Medea became,

19:15.920 --> 19:25.200
and also almost certainly Cleopatra, they became adepts with the use of various toxins,

19:26.160 --> 19:36.240
which they kept in their hair often. This is where you get the idea of a Medusa,

19:36.960 --> 19:43.200
a woman whose hair looks like snakes, right? What that means is she has dreads, and the dreads are

19:43.200 --> 19:51.760
thick with substances that can either be, you could apply moisture to them and get them on your

19:51.760 --> 19:59.200
fingertips and then fling them into the eyes of a person in front of you, similarly to what a cobra

19:59.200 --> 20:08.320
does, right? Or you could twist a spine or an arrow, some sort of projectile into the dread

20:08.960 --> 20:15.040
with a substance on it that would cause the concentrated toxins in the hair to

20:15.040 --> 20:26.880
both become liquefied and to then be absorbed onto the surface of the projectile. You could

20:26.880 --> 20:40.400
then shoot that into someone and it would paralyze them. A mirror basically keeps the gaze

20:41.360 --> 20:48.320
of something from touching you, and this is the concept I think, though I haven't read the original

20:48.320 --> 20:57.680
Greek, which you know would certainly be useful and helpful. A mirror would keep the gaze of

20:57.680 --> 21:04.000
someone from touching you, and it's the idea that it's the gaze of the Medusa that paralyzes.

21:04.960 --> 21:10.320
Not entirely impossible, but I'm going to wildly guess here that Amma would tell us

21:10.960 --> 21:17.520
there's no evidence of that in the primary sources, and what his first counselor told him,

21:17.520 --> 21:29.200
I'm circling back now, was you need to keep three things in mind as you pursue your academic

21:30.160 --> 21:36.160
passions. The first thing is primary sources. The second thing is primary sources.

21:37.440 --> 21:43.680
You can probably imagine what the third thing is. It's primary sources. What his advisor is saying

21:45.200 --> 21:55.360
is give no credence to anything that has to do with someone discussing their opinions or perspectives

21:55.520 --> 22:06.080
as a classicist, as a Greek scholar. You can only rely on primary sources. You must always rely

22:06.800 --> 22:15.120
on the first texts and never mind what other people think, say, because what you'll find is that

22:15.120 --> 22:25.360
very quickly beyond the primary sources, political and religious and military and

22:26.400 --> 22:39.760
what philosophical orientations rapidly warp the originals, which is why we are catastrophically

22:39.840 --> 22:46.000
confused according to Ammon about who Jesus was and what he was actually up to.

22:47.920 --> 22:54.000
I'm not going to get much into that today. You can check out Ammon yourself if you want

22:54.000 --> 22:59.760
his views on that, but let me just say this. It has nothing to do with what we are thinking.

23:00.160 --> 23:16.480
Jesus was, in Ammon's view, a, what is the right word, a lasia? I can't remember,

23:16.480 --> 23:28.000
lasie, lasia, lasia. Essentially, a trafficker in young children. If you can imagine anything

23:28.000 --> 23:39.680
more provocative than that. And as Ammon will tell you, the sources that we have for the Torah

23:40.560 --> 23:47.760
are not in Hebrew or Aramaic. They are in Greek. We don't have sources for written,

23:48.720 --> 23:58.960
the written Torah is translated from ancient Greek into Hebrew, which is insanely ridiculous

24:00.240 --> 24:06.880
to imagine. I had heard this elsewhere. I had heard this from a scholar,

24:07.520 --> 24:17.120
God. I was eventually able to find the source. I heard this from a scholar who was writing on

24:17.120 --> 24:22.400
Korah, a brilliant author actually, who was doing something very, very dangerous on Korah,

24:23.120 --> 24:28.800
for which he eventually got banned because he was masquerading as a woman

24:29.520 --> 24:36.960
and had written some astonishing sort of memoirs of things that had happened to him

24:39.440 --> 24:45.680
as a her, which of course didn't actually happen in the way that he

24:47.200 --> 24:54.240
so artfully wrote at all. But one of the things he was writing about was a day when he was studying

24:54.320 --> 25:04.160
the history of the actual origin of the Torah and why there were, why it was that

25:06.320 --> 25:11.440
the original sources were all in Greek. I mean, can you imagine how provocative that is?

25:12.640 --> 25:17.040
And I'm sure there are people who will want to yell at me and go like, oh, you're an idiot.

25:17.520 --> 25:26.880
Of course, they were in Hebrew or Aramaic. But I challenged them to produce the dated

25:26.880 --> 25:38.000
material that shows that the Hebrew or Aramaic predates the Greek from which the Torah was

25:38.000 --> 25:48.080
certainly translated into Hebrew, which is, again, staggeringly unexpected.

25:49.520 --> 25:53.680
But this is the kind of thing we will consistently discover when we look into

25:54.720 --> 26:00.160
not just history as a record of what happened, history is the mysterious origin of our present

26:00.480 --> 26:10.000
circumstances. History as that first tone that's being echoed cyclically, recursively in a spiral

26:10.720 --> 26:22.000
that rhymes with its previous arcs. History is that. So basically, his advisors told him,

26:22.000 --> 26:27.440
you have to take out everything that we would understand is related to recreational drug use

26:27.440 --> 26:34.560
among the Romans. And he said, why would I do that? And they said, because it's obvious that

26:34.560 --> 26:42.640
the Romans would not neither do that nor put up with it. And he thought to himself two things,

26:43.440 --> 26:51.440
I think. The first one is, how the fuck would you know that? What, you just have some moralistic

26:51.440 --> 26:59.280
predictor of what you think the Romans would or would not have done? But the second thing he thought,

27:00.320 --> 27:11.360
which I think is hilarious, was, okay, I'm going to take all this stuff out so that I can at least

27:11.360 --> 27:16.560
publish my dissertation. But for the rest of my life, I'll find all the things that the Romans

27:16.560 --> 27:27.520
wouldn't do. My job from now on is I will be the human who knows all the things that you think the

27:27.520 --> 27:39.040
Romans wouldn't do, wouldn't allow. And he cites, knownness, primarily. Galen,

27:43.680 --> 27:49.200
Escalus, not sure if I'm pronouncing that right. Some of these things are hard to pronounce,

27:49.200 --> 27:57.360
but knownness and Galen aren't. And a big shout out to my friend who's actually named Galen.

27:57.920 --> 28:05.360
Here. Because he's almost like the, no one would ever believe it, but he's almost like the rebirth

28:08.560 --> 28:16.240
of one of the Greek scholars in the modern times. And wow, what a problem that is for him.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.680
And you know, those who love him, and I'm one of those people.

28:20.400 --> 28:34.640
So yeah, he cites the actual Greek in the New Testament, from which the New Testament is derived

28:34.640 --> 28:42.080
in English. And he points out all kinds of catastrophic mistranslations, which are endemic

28:43.040 --> 28:49.440
to the Bible that we read. I mean, the idea that you could translate Hebrew into English

28:50.640 --> 28:59.200
is pretty nearly insane if it's biblical Hebrew, or you know, Torah Hebrew. But again,

28:59.200 --> 29:03.280
you have the same problem, right? There's no such thing as biblical Hebrew. Biblical Hebrew is a

29:03.280 --> 29:10.960
derivation of biblical Greek. And the chances of you translating a language is sophisticated in

29:11.040 --> 29:21.600
its connotative and technical features into English. I don't even know. It would be like trying to

29:21.600 --> 29:30.560
translate Romanian geometry into basic arithmetic. It's just not going to ever happen.

29:30.960 --> 29:37.040
And this is part of the problem that we face

29:39.600 --> 29:46.480
with our historical documents in general, and anything that where we can't go to the original

29:46.480 --> 29:57.440
source with, you know, arm in arm with a scholar of significant educational and linguistic depth,

29:58.240 --> 30:03.600
right? And clearly, Ammon is one of a few such scholars that exist. He's not the only one.

30:06.320 --> 30:06.880
But uh,

30:13.360 --> 30:18.720
there's so much going on here that it's really hard to remain focused. All right, so

30:19.680 --> 30:29.440
so they made him remove everything that that they thought might possibly indicate what they

30:29.440 --> 30:35.040
call the recreational use of drugs by the Romans and the Athenians. And this is the birthplace

30:35.040 --> 30:41.360
of the idea of democracy in so much as we moderns understand it in the West. Obviously, there were

30:41.360 --> 30:47.520
experiments long before this, and there were things more like liquid democracy than formal

30:47.520 --> 30:53.040
democracy. By the time you have to formalize a system, you've lost most of its essence and

30:53.040 --> 31:00.160
origin completely, right? By the time you have to formalize relationships, you have a problem where

31:00.160 --> 31:06.480
the concept of the individual has achieved an unjustified primacy. You follow me? It should

31:06.480 --> 31:14.960
never be this ultimate. This idea of individual should never be this ultimate. So um,

31:17.520 --> 31:24.080
I'm going to carefully skirt the, oh god, what a pun. I'm going to skirt the topics

31:25.680 --> 31:34.160
that are related to what I have said, which is the ceremonial use of substances produced

31:34.800 --> 31:41.840
by the bodies of prepubescent humans. I'm going to skirt that topic, but I'm going to circle it

31:41.840 --> 31:48.960
and highlight it just so that it remains in the orbit of what we are here trying to understand.

31:50.960 --> 32:01.440
Medea became a master of the uses, both of snake venom and the mixtures, the careful mixture,

32:01.440 --> 32:12.400
like as if, as if, as if each venom. So the substances that a human body produces can be

32:12.400 --> 32:26.160
understood as elixirs, right? The sweat, the tears, the saliva, the, oh my god, dare I even say these

32:26.160 --> 32:41.920
things? I, no, I'm not going to say it. Sexual exudations and a couple of other things that

32:41.920 --> 32:46.880
I'm going to leave out. If you're really imaginative, you'll figure out what I'm pointing at. Most of

32:46.880 --> 32:55.680
you won't, probably for everyone's best interest that you don't. And these topics are so forbidden,

32:56.560 --> 33:02.000
right? They're, they're so forbidden that you will be killed for considering them in many cases,

33:02.560 --> 33:07.760
but certainly you will be, you know, obliterated for publicly discussing them.

33:07.760 --> 33:17.600
And so I'm taking a lot of risks here, even though I'm being relatively circumspect.

33:23.760 --> 33:29.920
This guy looks like he's aware of principles related to

33:30.000 --> 33:40.320
interior martial arts. He's using hand gestures that are evocative of the manipulation of chi,

33:41.520 --> 33:45.280
which is a related topic here, okay? But things are going to get really weird in a moment.

33:46.880 --> 33:53.760
So Amon decided, I'm going to find out everything that those, those Greeks wouldn't have been doing.

33:54.560 --> 34:00.000
And he did. I mean, he's, you know, and he's been accused of strange

34:01.440 --> 34:07.840
things that I think people have him entirely backwards. If they think he's interested,

34:07.840 --> 34:13.520
for example, in summoning demons or opening portals. I mean, the problem with Amon

34:14.320 --> 34:17.840
is that if you're walking around on earth with the knowledge that he has,

34:18.800 --> 34:24.800
you might, you are a portal. You don't have to go opening them. You are one.

34:26.240 --> 34:32.400
And, and this is a problem for him that I think he'll hopefully artfully

34:36.720 --> 34:46.160
negotiate, right? Mitigate or work with. All right. So remember, this is a, this is a topic that

34:47.840 --> 34:54.400
other things down here. This is a topic that has fascinated me and I've had some brand new insights

34:54.400 --> 35:02.320
today based on what Amon was talking about that are staggering to me and wildly unexpected

35:03.520 --> 35:10.240
because I felt like I mostly knew what was going on because I had been shown

35:11.200 --> 35:18.160
stories, but the stories omitted certain things. And Amon's

35:21.520 --> 35:32.720
discussion has illuminated something fundamental. Okay, I'm going to take a couple of these quills

35:32.720 --> 35:43.200
because these quills are seriously great. So I want, I want this one.

35:50.720 --> 35:51.200
This one.

36:02.720 --> 36:31.520
So, long ago,

36:33.440 --> 36:40.080
an on-ordinary being offered me a wish and had I been intelligent,

36:42.400 --> 36:47.840
I would have perhaps wished differently. And I now for the first time understand something about

36:48.560 --> 36:53.360
why that being seemed very surprised by what I had selected.

36:57.200 --> 37:02.000
But the fundamental wish was help me understand how my species got broken and if there's any

37:02.000 --> 37:13.200
medicine for that. And what it did was it dripped insight into the eye of my mind

37:14.080 --> 37:20.320
very delicately so it would not destroy me. And so that I would understand the origins

37:21.280 --> 37:26.400
of what I refer to as representational cognition in our species

37:26.640 --> 37:41.840
and the histories and mysteries of how that very problematical feature of we moderns originated.

37:42.720 --> 37:53.600
But I also asked specifically, talk to me about the tree incident in Genesis

37:54.560 --> 38:02.080
because this seems to be at least for some people or in some way a crucial origin story

38:04.480 --> 38:15.840
where the problems apparently get started. And I'm going to spoil the charade here because,

38:15.840 --> 38:24.800
okay, so what I was first shown was that the serpent, quote unquote, was an angel

38:26.320 --> 38:32.480
in a sense and it was the angel of the knowledge of dividing things, one from another,

38:34.320 --> 38:40.480
the knowledge of distinguishing. And so it made divisions in the minds

38:40.960 --> 38:51.440
of first of Eve and then of Adam by giving them the fruit of the tree of knowledge.

38:53.440 --> 38:56.720
And certainly,

38:57.120 --> 39:12.800
this can be thought of in a variety of ways. I've had many perspectives on what that

39:13.520 --> 39:19.200
concept of the fruit might refer to. And it's much better to have three to five good

39:19.200 --> 39:24.640
perspectives than it is to have one. If you have one, it will blind you. And some of us,

39:24.880 --> 39:27.600
some people will think, well, there's a difference between things that are actually

39:27.600 --> 39:35.040
true and those that aren't. Yes, there are, but insight is not always forged from the facts.

39:35.760 --> 39:43.680
Often it's forged from the dreaming, which is the intelligent,

39:43.760 --> 39:53.840
what, reambiguation of the facts. The intelligent reamb, getting the facts

39:53.840 --> 40:01.360
is useful. The intelligently reambiguating them is profound. And this is what happens

40:01.360 --> 40:07.600
when we dream. This is part of what happens when we use certain substances, pharmacoya.

40:08.160 --> 40:18.880
And what I've seen today for the first time is, okay, let me go back to Medea.

40:18.880 --> 40:28.000
So, Ammon was saying that Medea became a master of the, not just the application

40:28.560 --> 40:41.440
of substances derived from vipers and snakes. Oh my God. I can't believe I can see so many

40:41.440 --> 40:46.800
problems in me sharing this recording. I can't, I'm going to be surprised if the recording even

40:46.800 --> 40:55.840
survives. Am I still actually recording? Yes, apparently I am. Okay. Wow. So,

40:58.640 --> 41:05.440
Medea became

41:10.400 --> 41:23.200
supra humanly adept, not merely at the acquisition of venoms from snakes and possibly other creatures

41:23.840 --> 41:25.760
and possibly

41:30.960 --> 41:37.680
botanical and perhaps cathonic substances as well, the mixing of them.

41:39.600 --> 41:47.120
This, in a sense, he's saying she is, at least in some historical lines or traditions,

41:47.680 --> 41:56.960
the first pharmacologist, the one who mixes toxins and also understands them probably in a kind of

41:56.960 --> 42:07.360
a spiritual way that results in the capacity to produce antidotes, which are not merely curatives.

42:07.680 --> 42:11.360
They can rebalance

42:14.720 --> 42:22.000
and possibly even resurrect. So, what is being implied here by Ammon,

42:23.360 --> 42:29.280
and I don't think he's going to agree with me about this if he even becomes aware of my theory,

42:29.520 --> 42:42.960
is that the viper at the tree in Genesis, the serpent, which in my, in the stories I was shown,

42:43.840 --> 42:48.400
is essentially an angel. It's like the first angel. It's the angel that divides.

42:50.480 --> 42:56.480
It's the angel with the gift of cutting, essentially cutting in the mind. So, it's

42:57.040 --> 43:04.320
the angel that allows for the possibility of distinguishing and thus the beginning of the

43:04.320 --> 43:13.520
concept of naming and thus the beginning of concepts themselves and the tree of nomenclature,

43:14.560 --> 43:23.760
reference, representation, tokenization and consciousness, commodities, all these things.

43:23.760 --> 43:28.240
You can see, in a sense, it could be understood as the origin of evil,

43:29.920 --> 43:38.800
because all of these departures from unity and communion are necessary for the idea of knowledge,

43:39.600 --> 43:49.920
right? And knowledge is so often, if not always, the death of participation. It's the knife that the

43:49.920 --> 43:57.760
waking awareness brings to the bubbles of dreaming, collapsing them into awakening,

43:58.640 --> 44:05.600
where identity is declarative rather than connotative or relational. It is declared rather

44:05.600 --> 44:14.800
than suggested, which is what happens in moonlight. Sunlight is declarative, moonlight is suggestive,

44:15.520 --> 44:25.760
invocative, invitational, connotational, associational, more like the imagination

44:27.040 --> 44:34.880
than the denotation or the dictionary. And so, the implication here is that the serpent, both

44:35.440 --> 44:44.400
the amonic, I'm going to call it the amonic implication for me, is that the serpent gave

44:44.400 --> 44:53.280
Eve the toxin that brought her to the verge of death, to the liminal space between worlds,

44:54.640 --> 45:01.360
the hypnagogic, pompic space. The serpent injected her with this venom and gave her the

45:01.360 --> 45:07.360
knowledge of the venom and how to use it and also how to comprise the antidote.

45:10.000 --> 45:18.560
And then she died and was resurrected and thus had knowledge, because the whole idea of knowledge

45:19.840 --> 45:29.760
is equated with death in the Hebrew. The tree, the sephiroth in the center of it that isn't

45:29.840 --> 45:37.840
numbered is doth, which is knowledge. And this doth and death are closely related. So the concept

45:37.840 --> 45:47.440
here is that Eve was brought to the verge of death, essentially killed by the serpent, resurrected,

45:47.440 --> 45:53.520
given the knowledge of the antidotes. She communicated this knowledge to the males, to Adam,

45:54.400 --> 46:01.840
by producing the same series of events in his body and consciousness. They both were awakened

46:02.560 --> 46:14.000
to the reality of death, which before had been perhaps impossible for them. And now that they

46:14.000 --> 46:22.480
were no longer immortal in the sense of a rising moment to moment from the communal essence of

46:22.480 --> 46:34.320
being, now they have become subject to mortality and physical death. And this is the

46:38.480 --> 46:46.640
implication of the Ammonic knowledge that Ammon himself seems very resistant to. He claims that

46:46.640 --> 47:16.400
this is the Canaanite path that he associates with all kinds of apparent ethical

47:17.280 --> 47:30.720
deviation. I'm going to go check out this music, but we're going to come back to this. And the place

47:30.800 --> 47:42.240
we'll come back to is Medea and how we get to the idea of Medusae from there. All right, so

47:46.240 --> 47:55.760
I walked into the concourse between the museums here in San Francisco. There's a bunch of people

47:55.920 --> 48:04.160
with spacesuits on the stage of the amphitheater, and they're playing a jazz version of Hallelujah

48:04.960 --> 48:09.840
while I'm making this recording, which I think is fairly ridiculously

48:11.760 --> 48:20.080
synchronistic and trippy and bizarre. All right, so Medea became one of the first

48:20.800 --> 48:30.240
masters of the formulation and applications of venoms from serpents.

48:35.040 --> 48:38.480
We must imagine particularly vipers, but probably also

48:39.440 --> 48:45.760
cobras, and there are a variety of, okay,

48:48.880 --> 48:54.720
ophi, let's see, what was he talking about?

48:57.840 --> 49:05.600
I cannot recall the genus name that refers to the serpents, but it's OPH, right? It's like

49:05.600 --> 49:18.960
ophiologists study serpents. So he talks about, in the book of Revelation, a reference,

49:18.960 --> 49:35.360
it's insane people, unfortunately. He talks about

49:36.240 --> 49:53.760
people referred to as essentially devotees of both this woman who

49:54.320 --> 50:05.360
distributes elixirs that are derived both from serpents and her sexual exudations.

50:10.720 --> 50:20.480
The ophians, ophidians, something like this. I can't quite find the word. In any case, Medea ends up in

50:21.120 --> 50:29.520
what later becomes Sicily. I can't remember the other s name it had previously, which turns out to be

50:29.520 --> 50:37.680
the birthplace of my direct paternal ancestors. Syracuse, I think, is what he called it.

50:40.560 --> 50:46.880
And there's a man who's been bitten by a marsh viper, and she reaches, and this is in the original

50:46.880 --> 50:51.840
sources, right? This is in the ancient Greek, probably in Nonos or Galen or something. She reaches

50:52.640 --> 51:02.480
beneath her undergarments, produces a substance from her vagina with which she resurrects the sky.

51:05.520 --> 51:13.760
And, you know, moderns, you poor, benighted folks, you can think whatever you feel comfortable about

51:13.760 --> 51:22.400
thinking. You can think people are just making this stuff up. This is wildly improbable. Of course,

51:22.400 --> 51:30.880
we know what's actually true about Jesus and pharmacology and molecular chemistry and all

51:30.880 --> 51:36.560
of these things. Yeah, we know the mechanics to some degree. We know nothing of that plus.

51:37.520 --> 51:44.880
And very, very little, we don't. We stopped mixing snake venom, you know, 8,000 years ago,

51:44.880 --> 51:50.240
but there were people all over the world who knew that what could kill you could heal you,

51:51.760 --> 52:03.840
and that particularly the energies and the capacities of the human spirit when driven into

52:03.920 --> 52:12.960
either ecstatic modes. And when I say this word mode, I want you to think of both the

52:12.960 --> 52:23.120
frequency and an array of shapes, a progressing array of shapes like you might see on a drum head

52:24.400 --> 52:31.440
with sand or another substance on it when frequencies are being played on speakers

52:31.440 --> 52:38.160
underneath the drum head so that geometric figures arise in the sand on the surface of the drum

52:38.160 --> 52:51.280
head. This is what I'm, the human soul is capable of producing an array of iterative transformations,

52:52.080 --> 53:00.000
right, that can be recursively self-amplifying and can produce staggering forms of healing.

53:01.840 --> 53:08.880
In someone who is sick or poisoned. And what these ancients were often concerned with

53:09.920 --> 53:17.200
was something, you know, when you hear, no one would think when they hear the psalm,

53:17.200 --> 53:22.560
yea, though I walk through the shadow, you know, through I walk, yea, though I walk through the

53:22.560 --> 53:31.920
valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. And they think this means you will not

53:31.920 --> 53:38.320
fear evil because the holy ones are with you. But what it actually means is I will not fear dying

53:39.280 --> 53:50.240
because the people of the antidote are with me. No one will think this. And yet the actual texts

53:51.120 --> 53:56.960
almost certainly refer to something like this rather than what we are trained to think.

53:57.840 --> 54:06.240
Now I have seen and was shown histories that are much more shocking and staggering than anything

54:06.240 --> 54:14.800
Ammon has even hinted at. I don't speak of them to humans ever, not even in private.

54:14.960 --> 54:19.360
I was shown

54:24.640 --> 54:36.320
modes of relation that led to abilities that are wildly non-ordinary and unexpectedly profound.

54:37.200 --> 54:45.440
I don't practice these things. I am simply aware that we are very confused about what it means to be

54:45.440 --> 54:51.680
human. And actually we are extremely confused about what knowledge is because it has almost

54:51.680 --> 55:00.240
nothing to do with the capacity to form mechanical tools. Actual knowledge is insight. And insight

55:00.960 --> 55:10.800
means knowing the span from origin to the present, intimately and amnoetically recalling it

55:11.760 --> 55:16.000
as if you are doing a sort of spiritual and or genetic

55:16.560 --> 55:29.680
and amnoetic, right? Unforgetting archaeology within the depths of our bodies and being

55:29.680 --> 55:36.160
and relationships. This is what real knowledge is. It's not mechanical knowledge. It's not physics.

55:37.120 --> 55:42.880
It's not math. It's not mere geometry. Though geometry is strangely profoundly

55:42.880 --> 55:44.880
related to all of these topics.

56:03.200 --> 56:07.200
To concentrate on surviving the street crossing there.

56:07.520 --> 56:21.520
So somehow today, for the first time, I've become capable of imagining

56:23.600 --> 56:30.400
a gloss on the tree story that had never occurred to me before. That the serpent

56:30.800 --> 56:45.120
took Eve to the brink of death or actually into death, right? And then gave her the antidotes,

56:46.640 --> 56:57.760
revived her, resurrected her, and then she in turn led Adam through the same initiatory

56:57.760 --> 57:14.080
process. I don't know, I may never know what Ammon actually thinks because I suspect that

57:14.640 --> 57:21.280
if he's intelligent, like me, he won't share with, he won't say anything about this

57:21.920 --> 57:27.600
to anyone ever. Or he might say something about it in private. I don't know what he

57:27.600 --> 57:35.600
actually thinks or believes. One of the things he said when Danny Jones asked him if he was religious at all,

57:38.640 --> 57:45.520
because he often apparently says the phrase, Hail Satan. And Danny asked him,

57:45.520 --> 57:49.040
you know, why do you do that? Are you Satanist? He says, no, I don't like those people.

57:49.040 --> 57:53.600
And Danny says, so why are you doing that? Who's Satan? And he says, he talks about Satan as

57:54.160 --> 58:09.920
the Morning Star, the Lightbringer, the Enlightener, who was lied about because Zeus was a liar and so

58:09.920 --> 58:19.200
projected, if I understand, this is very spooky and sketchy, but Zeus projected his own failings

58:19.760 --> 58:33.680
and perhaps flailings onto Lucifer. And these are matters I inquired into during my own experience.

58:36.240 --> 58:43.920
And I'm happy to communicate about privately, but I don't want to make clumsy abstractions about,

58:44.480 --> 58:51.280
clumsy abstract generalizations. In effect, that is a form of sin. It's

58:52.720 --> 58:55.440
sin by generalization and sin by abstraction.

58:58.400 --> 59:04.640
In order to speak meaningfully about such matters, we must inquire together. We must begin with the

59:04.640 --> 59:17.360
spirit of inquiry, not the spirit of dissertation or locution, has to start with inquiry together.

59:17.360 --> 59:27.760
Then we have a chance to speak intelligently and learn intelligently together. So I will resist

59:27.760 --> 59:38.400
the urge to speak about that matter abstractly at the moment. And I want to be clear that

59:40.720 --> 59:45.920
for those of you who may have a desire to actually drink the waters

59:50.720 --> 59:56.400
together, that's a wedding that doesn't happen in the invitation.

59:57.200 --> 01:00:06.720
That's something that happens one on one. If we both agree that we want to cleanse our eyes

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:19.200
of the anciently complicated obstructions that language, concept, religion, policy, expectation,

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:31.520
tradition have imposed on us so unjustly, so terrifyingly. And yet some of the jungles,

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:39.600
you know, there are portions of the jungles of insight that are at least as terrifying to our

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:47.040
common expectation of meaning, identity, relationship, origin. They have nothing to,

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:53.280
they don't care a whit about what we prefer to believe or what we think is sane,

01:00:54.480 --> 01:01:04.640
what we think is clean. There's no, you know, it's like dumping a bucket of water on the sun's surface,

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:13.600
if you could transport one there somehow. There's no respect for that.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.760
There, it cannot be preserved there.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:37.600
Huh. Okay, I'll try that.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:49.840
There's a little library here on my street where a woman puts her books out and I saw her yesterday,

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.600
she came home and it's the first time I've seen who it is that's putting the books in here.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.360
And I said, you know, you have some very interesting books and she looked at me

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.920
like I was an insane person, like I was a dangerous person, like I was someone she would

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:11.280
prefer to have no Congress whatsoever with. And it was really weird. She definitely

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.720
both refused the compliment. I feel like, yeah, you can keep that compliment to yourself, buddy.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:28.720
I don't care. And I don't want to know you. And your mother was a conigate and your father

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:40.160
smelled of elderberries, et cetera, et cetera. But yeah, I've just found a book called the Child

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:50.160
Garden, which has extraordinary praise written all over it by Geoff Reiman. So maybe I'll read

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:59.440
some science fiction again instead of living it. But yeah, if you think what I present in my

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:06.320
recordings is deep, you should get a taste of what you're actually carrying, where you come from,

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:14.720
where we come from, where our minds, by what parents, our minds and souls were forged,

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:22.320
and for what purposes. And when we breach or broach the topics that I've been playing with

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:32.960
today, which were masterfully introduced by Amon Hillman, we're at least closing in on the vicinity

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:48.400
of stuff that really matters. We're closing in on the outskirts of the gardens of infinity

01:03:49.280 --> 01:04:03.680
that are the origins of not just the lights in the sky, but the sky itself, and that from which

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:14.080
it emerges as a reflective embodiment of this thing, the living waters,

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.800
which Amon, a phrase that Amon actually mentions in relationship to

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:29.680
what he calls the third ventricle, which is a capacious space inside the brain

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:41.040
where a liquid circulates, an elixir. And what he talks about is women learning how to produce

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:50.960
drugs in their own bodies, so that their bodies became a pharmacopia. He says that the sources speak

01:04:52.240 --> 01:05:05.760
of Medea and other women, Medusa, she calls giants not meaning huge, in size meaning huge,

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:16.560
in knowledge, gigantus. It's lovely to hear the reverence and terror with which he sometimes

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:26.000
pronounces Greek words. He claims that small serpents were treated with oils and stored

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:33.680
in the vaginal cavities of these women. I know how the moderns are just going to

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.200
like squinch up their faces and go like, okay, this dude's nuts, or maybe Darren's nuts.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.680
But neither of those things are true. What's actually true is we moderns are completely broken

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.160
because we have

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:58.800
absolutely wrong ideas inculcated by nonsensical absurdities.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:09.120
About matters related to medicine, origin, spirit,

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:18.160
Christ, the meanings of these ideas, all of these things are completely delusional.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:28.000
We have this weirdly puritanical opposition to anything that might actually resemble understanding.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:36.000
And if we are to have understanding, we must divest ourselves of the obstacles between us and that.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:46.720
And some of that divestment is profoundly uncomfortable and conceptually unimaginable

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:54.080
to we who have grown up in a world divorced from these original stories.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:02.560
So, as usual, I'm grateful for this time we've had together. I have arrived home.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:08.400
I'm going to wash some feather quills that I retrieved and listen to more Ammon

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:13.680
and probably regret that I didn't speak further and longer on this topic,

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.160
which is so fascinating to me because for the first time I've started to see what

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:33.040
the possible relationship is between the snake in the tree in the garden and insight,

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:42.240
and also possibly a mystery in the black foot lore where the moon falls in love

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.440
with something that is referred to in the English translation

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.800
as a many-legged snake that lives in a hollow log.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:58.640
Oh, God, this is so... I'm not even going to start to elucidate my concerns and thoughts about that

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:05.680
matter, which has been a primordial question that I and Ryan Firstiver have been chasing together

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:13.040
for many joyful years now. Thank you for joining me. I wish you all blessings, a beautiful path in

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:20.160
your life and day and moment. I wish you the wonders of actual insight. May the

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:28.240
may the plank in your eye be removed and may you resist

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:40.160
the compulsions of judgment so that you may taste the nectar.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:50.160
Of liberation and insight. Bye-bye for now. Thank you for joining me.
