0	4000	Hello, everybody. Welcome.
4000	8000	I've been listening to
8000	12000	Danny Jones
12000	16000	interviewing Neil from
16000	20000	Nossom Performance. I can't recall his last name at the moment.
20000	24000	It's like, Sendiac. Sendlak.
24000	28000	Something like this. Fairly interesting.
28000	32000	And this is obviously one of the things
32000	36000	that's going on with Danny's podcast at the moment, Concrete,
36000	40000	is that clearly he's exploring the
40000	44000	world around Amen
44000	48000	Hillman.
48000	52000	And
52000	56000	Neil has a lot of interesting historical
56000	60000	perspective and information. Neil is an
60000	64000	autodidact. He was not educated like me.
64000	68000	He's a self-educating person. He follows his passions
68000	72000	and his interests. And he became interested in these
72000	76000	topics through what he called
76000	80000	studying his way out of Christianity, which is a very interesting
80000	84000	thing to say.
84000	88000	There's a lot of good information.
88000	92000	Neil is very supportive of Amen's
92000	96000	classicism,
96000	100000	his Greek scholarship.
100000	104000	One of the things that Neil says is that most of the people that are attacking
104000	108000	Amen's
108000	112000	perspectives, I will call them.
112000	116000	Just basically attack it from the place of, we'll know
116000	120000	the agreed upon knowledge,
120000	124000	right? The, let's call it,
124000	128000	consensus.
128000	132000	By the way, that's basically just like saying with
132000	136000	the numbers, with the census.
136000	140000	And this is the adpopulus,
140000	144000	historical fallacy. Well, most people think, who gives a flying
144000	148000	poop storm what most people think?
148000	152000	Let's be really clear. If we go with generalities
152000	156000	and generalizations, we're only going to miss
156000	160000	everything important.
160000	164000	Because what will be overlooked is everything that
164000	168000	opposes popular consensus.
168000	172000	And in our situation with the moderns,
172000	176000	the educational level of the common people,
176000	180000	if we,
180000	184000	how would I put this? If we adulterate
184000	188000	the pool with
188000	192000	the entire scope
192000	196000	of the numbers, we're going to find
196000	200000	and we got to include people who are so old their memory doesn't
200000	204000	work yet. We also have to include children and stuff who have
204000	208000	no formal education speak of or not much
208000	212000	yet. So if we
212000	216000	dilute the numbers with the common
216000	220000	people, what you get is basically just stupidity.
220000	224000	Like bald
224000	228000	inveterate ignorance.
228000	232000	Which you can see very commonly in the United States
232000	236000	in our political situation. You have two species
236000	240000	of catastrophic stupidity, you know,
240000	244000	assembling golems in public to war against each other
244000	248000	for the sake of what? Who has nothing to do with running a country,
248000	252000	I'll put it that way. It has a lot to do with lining pockets
252000	256000	and
256000	260000	sustaining lineages of socio-political
260000	264000	economic war, prison,
264000	268000	you know, power, back room power
268000	272000	exchanges.
272000	276000	The currying of favor and favor trading
276000	280000	and so on, which is the opposite of what a democracy
280000	284000	should be about.
284000	288000	In any case, one of the things that was bothering me is that
288000	292000	both Neil and Danny
296000	300000	with all due respect, Danny is
300000	304000	catastrophically naive about anything relating
304000	308000	to spirituality. I'm pretty sure
308000	312000	he's an atheist and
312000	316000	it's, you know, Danny asks
316000	320000	Neil if he's religious and he just says anything but.
320000	324000	So Neil is also
324000	328000	hopefully my wind buffer is going to work here. I did test it a bit.
328000	332000	So Neil is also
332000	336000	what? I'm not going to say he's an atheist.
336000	340000	As far as I can tell, he's anti-metaphysical.
340000	344000	He doesn't believe there's anything like souls or spirits or gods
344000	348000	or diamonds or angels or anything.
348000	352000	And, you know, I'm reminded
352000	356000	of experts on fishing
356000	360000	who've never held a rod.
360000	364000	And this analogy turns out to be really important here in all kinds of ways.
364000	368000	They've never seen a fish. They live in the
368000	372000	desert. They don't believe in fishes. Fishes are a
372000	376000	story that crazy people tell.
376000	380000	And the crazy people are so insane
380000	384000	that these desert dwellers, and these aren't like the
384000	388000	Bedouins who actually have wisdom and stuff. These are idiots.
388000	392000	These are people who live in a world of their own suppositions.
392000	396000	No experience of the things that they speak of. This is what I was talking about in my
396000	400000	recording about knowledge and writing and the problem that
400000	404000	that produces. It also produces amazing
404000	408000	possibilities of learning and the exchange of
408000	412000	the transfer of knowledge on a broader scope than person to person
412000	416000	by song and oral tradition and transfer. That's true.
416000	420000	It does do that, but it comes with very lethal dangers.
420000	424000	Historically the humans tend to ignore the dangers of their new technologies
424000	428000	and then what happens is
428000	432000	the structures of power,
432000	436000	the under structure,
436000	440000	the sort of malignant under structures
440000	444000	of power and wealth
444000	448000	and rape and torture and lying and
448000	452000	not the good kind of lying, not the aurea.
452000	456000	No, no, the kind
456000	460000	of lying that leads to the immiseration of
460000	464000	thousands or millions of people over epochs of time, that kind
464000	468000	of lying. This all gets supported by this process.
468000	472000	What we have here are people, I can't really speak much about
472000	476000	Danny Jones, and it's not my intent to insult him
476000	480000	or to be disrespectful
480000	484000	but it's clear just from listening to him
484000	488000	he sounds like an 11 year old kid
488000	492000	knowing absolutely nothing about the topic
492000	496000	and look, he's interviewed a good, I don't know what his numbers are
496000	500000	but a good probably 500 or 1000 people
500000	504000	very deep minds, very rich
504000	508000	in intelligence. Strangely
508000	512000	his own intellect appears
512000	516000	largely immune to these intelligences
516000	520000	and I find it tragic
520000	524000	this is the problem with the claim
524000	528000	of knowledge, these people are talking
528000	532000	I don't care what they believe and they're welcome to believe
532000	536000	whatever they like or disbelieve whatever they like
536000	540000	they're talking about things they have no experience of
540000	544000	just like people in the desert who make up stories and say
544000	548000	there's these people in the west
548000	552000	and they say that you can go to the end of the world and if you go there you will see the great water
552000	556000	that fills the whole horizon, those people are insane
556000	560000	it's not possible for there to be great waters like that
560000	564000	there's no chance of it being true
564000	568000	water as far as you can see to the horizon
568000	572000	all the way around you, those people are doing, those are drunkards
572000	576000	and silly people, they're just making shit up
576000	580000	which is effectively what they're saying
580000	584000	they're saying Neil studies
584000	588000	the origins of religion
588000	592000	and he's an interesting cat
592000	596000	and he has a lot of name based
596000	600000	date based, place based, he's got this sort of
600000	604000	like you see on those detective shows where you, there's a wall
604000	608000	where all of the sort of major players and situations
608000	612000	and the timeline is there and there's a web of red threads
612000	616000	between all the stuff, Neil's mind is a bit like this
616000	620000	which is super cool, I mean for all it's worth
620000	624000	in terms of trying to understand
624000	628000	classicism
628000	632000	what happened in the ancient world, how did, where did we get
632000	636000	did the Masoretic text come before the Greek
636000	640000	Septuagint or vice versa and why and so forth
640000	644000	and
644000	648000	Neil's defending Amin primarily by saying that
648000	652000	his detractors cite
652000	656000	consensus, well the consensus is obviously that
656000	660000	Masoretic text precedes the Greek, but when you look at the actual numbers
660000	664000	at least
664000	668000	from some of the people that Neil has been interviewing, some of whom are
668000	672000	lifelong scholars of these matters, so not trivial
672000	676000	idiots, you know, who, these aren't political theorists
676000	680000	who, I think, you know, nope, it's nothing like that
680000	684000	these are people who have spent their entire lifetime studying
684000	688000	in the archives and in universities and all around the world
688000	692000	some of them are probably even in the Vatican libraries
692000	696000	which must be catastrophically astonishing
696000	700000	um
700000	704000	many of these people think
704000	708000	that we should ask questions
708000	712000	about the texts
712000	716000	and their origins, so he's defending some of what
716000	720000	Amin is saying and also by saying
720000	724000	that the people who are trying, you know, by saying that the people who are trying to
724000	728000	refute Amin are not citing much
728000	732000	they're really just saying well the consensus has long been
732000	736000	particularly if you see on YouTube some ridiculously
736000	740000	titled video, Amin Hillman debunked
740000	744000	well what a load of bullshit that is, there's no debunking of Amin
744000	748000	first of all you can't debunk a human being, let's just be really clear, Amin Hillman exists
748000	752000	so, you know, the text is already
752000	756000	stupidifyingly
756000	760000	pitifully titled, just insane
760000	764000	you can't debunk a human being, Amin Hillman debunked
764000	768000	what are you debunking, you're debunking your own intelligence in language
780000	784000	so what you can debunk is a claim
784000	788000	not a human being, let's be really clear about that
788000	792000	that little 10 minute video, can't recall
792000	796000	don't even care to recall, the name of the guy who
796000	800000	obviously a friend of Dan McClellands who
800000	804000	has his panties in a bunch about Hillman
804000	808000	and I would argue doesn't even understand, has no chance of understanding
808000	812000	what Hillman is doing because what Hillman is doing
812000	816000	isn't history of religion
816000	820000	it's related, it's related
820000	824000	and it has an influence in that domain
824000	828000	but what Hillman is doing is
828000	832000	magical, it's not scholarly
832000	836000	there's features of it that are academic and scholarly, he's drawing on his
836000	840000	education as a classicist and his fascinations
840000	844000	particularly with ancient Greek
844000	848000	Galen, known as others
852000	856000	everywhere there's these machines
856000	860000	even in the park, the gardens
860000	864000	driving machines around, in any case
870000	874000	what Hillman is doing
874000	878000	is initiatory
878000	882000	he's time traveling, it's like he's opening up
882000	886000	a window to a lost world
886000	890000	inside himself, he's opening up this window, this portal
890000	894000	if you will, and he's transporting us back
894000	898000	he's giving us a
898000	902000	there must be a word for this where
902000	906000	where you are in time is flipped around
906000	910000	in exchange for another place in time
910000	914000	that's what Hillman is up to
914000	918000	in his
918000	922000	paramaniacal
922000	926000	dissertations
926000	930000	and the actual origins
930000	934000	of what's in the Bible, particularly the New Testament
934000	938000	but not merely that
938000	942000	and
942000	946000	you know
946000	950000	Hillman's been accused of various kinds of nefarious activities
950000	954000	I don't know
954000	958000	what the verity of those activities might be
958000	962000	basically
962000	966000	he was specifically accused apparently by some
966000	970000	feature of the Catholic church
970000	974000	of summoning demons
974000	978000	opening portals
978000	982000	he's definitely opening portals
982000	986000	he's trying to understand
986000	990000	he's trying to understand
990000	994000	he's trying to understand
994000	998000	what the origins of the often absurdly
998000	1002000	ridiculous things we believe in modernity
1002000	1006000	he's trying to understand
1006000	1010000	the history of these situations
1010000	1014000	and when he uses the word history
1014000	1018000	he doesn't mean a record of what happened
1018000	1022000	he means to inquire of those with actual knowledge
1022000	1026000	intimate knowledge
1026000	1030000	the kind of knowledge you have of your lover's mouth when you kiss them
1030000	1034000	that kind of knowledge
1034000	1038000	the kind of knowledge you have of a fruit when you eat it
1038000	1042000	direct, somatic, visceral
1042000	1046000	spiritual, originary experience
1046000	1050000	not thinking, not opinions
1050000	1054000	not ideas
1054000	1058000	and he doesn't give a flying fuck about consensus
1058000	1062000	nothing does not care
1062000	1066000	in fact he will blatantly declare
1066000	1070000	that this consensus thing
1070000	1074000	is completely delusional
1074000	1078000	nothing there at all
1078000	1082000	he often yells, he will yell out
1082000	1086000	everything you think
1086000	1090000	all those thoughts you have, all those ideas, all those stuff you've been taught
1090000	1094000	all of that nonsense
1094000	1098000	and then he'll go off camera and you'll hear spanking sounds
1098000	1102000	at least
1102000	1106000	now look
1106000	1110000	nobody has to authorize
1110000	1114000	Hillman, right? you don't have to bow to him
1114000	1118000	he's not running around saying worship me, I am the truth and the light
1118000	1122000	what he's saying is if you want a taste
1122000	1126000	of the ancient world that's much more like
1126000	1130000	what was almost certainly going on than what you've been told
1130000	1134000	we will go together
1134000	1138000	using the ancient greek as a vehicle of travel
1138000	1142000	travel in what? travel
1142000	1146000	in pneumaticon
1146000	1150000	in the freens
1150000	1154000	in the strands
1154000	1158000	the threads, the tributaries
1158000	1162000	of our own origins, our minds, our consciousness
1162000	1166000	our awareness, our souls
1166000	1170000	the spectral body, the soma pneumaticon of the greeks
1170000	1174000	he will spin that up
1174000	1178000	and take us far beyond
1178000	1182000	anything we've ever been exposed to
1182000	1186000	for those who want to go
1186000	1190000	it's an opt-in thing
1190000	1194000	he's not telling the world what to believe or the scholars
1194000	1198000	but he will openly laugh at them
1198000	1202000	and, you know, piss in their faces
1202000	1206000	happily, joyfully, playfully
1206000	1210000	what they've been trained to think
1210000	1214000	they're doing the same
1214000	1218000	kind of thing that they like to accuse him of
1218000	1222000	they're very selectively picking certain senses
1222000	1226000	of certain words that match up not with history
1226000	1230000	not with the consensus of primary sources
1230000	1234000	which consensus Hillman may well
1234000	1238000	theorize. No, they are doing the same thing
1238000	1242000	they're excluding what they don't want to hear
1242000	1246000	why did Hillman have to exclude all references to recreational drugs from his dissertation
1246000	1250000	when the use of drugs by the Romans
1250000	1254000	was probably the primary focus of his PhD dissertation
1254000	1258000	why was he told to exclude these
1258000	1262000	because it was said by the gatekeepers
1262000	1266000	of the institution the Romans would not do this
1266000	1270000	what? What? The Romans were doing this
1270000	1274000	of course they were doing this, we do this, every people who have ever lived
1274000	1278000	have done this
1278000	1282000	and what is this? We use intoxicants
1282000	1286000	and sometimes psychedelics and other sedatives
1286000	1290000	and other things
1290000	1294000	but if you experience anesthesia in the surgery
1294000	1298000	this is what he's talking about
1298000	1302000	so
1302000	1306000	his detractors are doing the same thing
1306000	1310000	they're promoting specific
1310000	1314000	senses of words in Greek
1314000	1318000	and or Hebrew
1318000	1322000	and they are ignoring
1322000	1326000	the senses that don't agree with their pre-existing narratives and biases
1326000	1330000	many of which are ridiculously
1330000	1334000	it's the right word, McDonaldized
1334000	1338000	right? Jack in the Bible
1338000	1342000	eyesed
1342000	1346000	so
1346000	1350000	frankly I think it's weird
1350000	1354000	when people like Danny
1354000	1358000	opine on religious topics
1358000	1362000	or metaphysical topics
1362000	1366000	I don't know his whole history, I don't pay a lot of attention to him
1366000	1370000	but if he has any direct experience of metaphysical
1370000	1374000	the world outside what you are thinking with your representational cognition
1374000	1378000	which let's face it is 99% of the universe
1378000	1382000	point 999
1382000	1386000	basically everything isn't what you like to think
1386000	1390000	is the truth of reality
1390000	1394000	that which is, we might call it, all that is
1394000	1398000	and Danny's over there trying to think his way through that
1398000	1402000	good luck Dan, you're using the fingernail
1402000	1406000	of your pinky for something that needs to become
1406000	1410000	the palm of your hand and replace your representational
1410000	1414000	cognition for you to understand it
1414000	1418000	they're literally arguing about people being possessed
1418000	1422000	and laughing about it, him and Neil, neither of whom apparently believe
1422000	1426000	in possession which I think is hilarious because
1426000	1430000	clearly, Amen
1430000	1434000	it seems very clear to me and I'd love to ask him questions
1434000	1438000	about this but if Amen himself has not experienced
1438000	1442000	various kinds of possession particularly by his muse
1442000	1446000	the
1446000	1450000	dead girl he talks about when he says he has a cheat
1450000	1454000	in the sacred
1454000	1458000	the podcast by quote
1458000	1462000	speaks, unquote, when he talks about
1462000	1466000	this dead girl who resurrects the ancients before
1466000	1470000	him one by one so that he may inquire directly of
1470000	1474000	them, if he's not experiencing something resembling
1474000	1478000	possession I'd love to know what it is that he is
1478000	1482000	experiencing and these two
1482000	1486000	young men who know nothing of what they're talking about
1486000	1490000	apparently and by the way, you know, you can disbelieve
1490000	1494000	something to such a degree that it either kills
1494000	1498000	you or blinds you, right, in the same way that you can believe something
1498000	1502000	to such a degree that it kills you or blinds you, you can disbelieve that food is nourishing
1502000	1506000	and die of intonation, right, you can disbelieve that you need
1506000	1510000	water, you don't need water, dead, you know
1510000	1514000	34 days later, if not sooner
1514000	1518000	you can say, there's no objective evidence for love, that's just something
1518000	1522000	people made up to amuse themselves, okay, you won't
1522000	1526000	have any experience of love, there are certain features of being
1526000	1530000	human and I would argue that many if not most of the features
1530000	1534000	of being human are like this, where if you
1534000	1538000	decide that they don't exist, you become incapable
1538000	1542000	of participating in them, right, and
1542000	1546000	unless something comes and overwhelms
1546000	1550000	your
1554000	1558000	your blatant ignorance
1558000	1562000	your, it's a word I'm looking for that I can't quite find
1562000	1566000	unless something comes and just overwhelms
1566000	1570000	you, right, and takes you over, which by the way is pretty much
1570000	1574000	and I'm not recommending the use of psychedelic drugs here, but that's what happens when one does
1574000	1578000	psychedelic drugs, you don't either nothing happens
1578000	1582000	which is what happened to me the first eight or nine times
1582000	1586000	I smoked weed, nothing, nothing happened, similarly
1586000	1590000	my friend Alan Steinfeld when we were talking the other day, he was like, you know the first
1590000	1594000	time I looked at a television it was just incoherent, I couldn't tell what the hell
1594000	1598000	that was or what was going on there, and he's right
1598000	1602000	it's because the form of our cognition
1602000	1606000	this idea that
1606000	1610000	the crazy people have
1610000	1614000	that what your mind reveals to you is what exists
1614000	1618000	and what it doesn't reveal doesn't exist
1618000	1622000	that is impossible, there's no chance of that being true, because what
1622000	1626000	actually happens is that the mind reforges its own
1626000	1630000	anatomy
1630000	1634000	in order to reveal or occlude
1634000	1638000	features of potential, relation, history, future, possibility
1638000	1642000	and if the mind has never taken on a particular form
1642000	1646000	before, it doesn't know what to do
1646000	1650000	with the information, and so it may generate
1650000	1654000	literally it may just knock you out
1654000	1658000	I've had direct experience of this with things that other people
1658000	1662000	think are completely ordinary and happen all the time
1662000	1666000	your first experience of eating food with your mouth
1666000	1670000	that wasn't just milk was probably like this
1670000	1674000	your first experience of standing up was like this
1674000	1678000	my first experiences of relation
1678000	1682000	erotic relation with women in my teens
1682000	1686000	I go like this, that it was like going to another universe
1686000	1690000	so this idea that you're the arbiter of identity
1690000	1694000	function, situation, circumstance, and you just declare
1694000	1698000	what's happening and what's isn't
1698000	1702000	you can go ahead and play the game of
1702000	1706000	consciousness that way, Neil, Danny, go ahead, be my guest
1706000	1710000	you're going to miss out on most of what it means to be human
1710000	1714000	and from your weird little isolated
1714000	1718000	castle, or your dungeon of naivete
1718000	1722000	you're going to make ex-cathedra declarations that you think
1722000	1726000	other people are just either having us on
1726000	1730000	or they're good actors, I mean this is what the left hemisphere would say about everything
1730000	1734000	that it doesn't originate, grip, control
1734000	1738000	and also anything that would threaten
1738000	1742000	its supremacy and consciousness, and by the left hemisphere what do I really mean? I don't mean
1742000	1746000	the left cerebral
1746000	1750000	hemisphere, what I mean is certain
1750000	1754000	features that we know
1754000	1758000	have an intimate relation with that hemisphere from having done experiments
1758000	1762000	with stroke victims and from having done the water test
1762000	1766000	where we anesthetize one of the
1766000	1770000	hemispheres and we ask the person questions and we can talk to them later about their
1770000	1774000	experiences and so forth, we know that
1774000	1778000	there are faculties
1778000	1782000	from which, okay, there are faculties
1782000	1786000	that representational cognition relies fundamentally upon
1786000	1790000	and these faculties are tyrannical, you can see them
1790000	1794000	in actual tyrants, you can see them all spun up in people like
1794000	1798000	Mr. Trump and other
1798000	1802000	tyrannical nightmarish folks from history
1802000	1806000	who probably need not be named here
1806000	1810000	so there's this aspect
1810000	1814000	again it's like the fingernail on your pinky or the
1814000	1818000	tip of your pinky screaming at the rest of the hand
1818000	1822000	you don't exist, I have never seen a ghost
1822000	1826000	who such thing as possession, I mean that's the hilarious irony
1826000	1830000	is these people who say there's no such thing as possession, okay really?
1830000	1834000	because you are possessed by an array of faculties
1834000	1838000	that are declaring that and you are unaware of your possession
1838000	1842000	and think that what you have is
1842000	1846000	the antithesis or opposite of possession
1846000	1850000	when there's no chance that's true, no chance
1850000	1854000	when there's 10 miles thick
1854000	1858000	you're possessed by a tiny little array of your cognitive faculties
1858000	1862000	a little tiny island, an archipelago in consciousness
1862000	1866000	and that archipelago is saying many things that's not from around here
1866000	1870000	doesn't exist, those other islands have ocean, stuff like that
1870000	1874000	it's not there, there is no boatman
1874000	1878000	boats are a fantasy dreaming thing
1878000	1882000	something very close to me last night was arguing fiercely
1882000	1886000	that romantic love was just an invention made up by poets
1886000	1890000	that everyone decided was a good idea afterwards, he's not entirely wrong
1890000	1894000	but neither is he correct
1894000	1898000	because the mind can reforge
1898000	1902000	its anatomy and under some circumstances
1902000	1906000	that can be
1906000	1910000	not exactly forced
1910000	1914000	but very forcefully catalyzed
1914000	1918000	and so this is really important to understand
1918000	1922000	if you are a person like Danny or Neil who thinks they know things
1922000	1926000	about what it means to be human, what's real and what's not real
1926000	1930000	you don't, you're wrong
1930000	1934000	you're using the point
1934000	1938000	of using one book in a library or one
1938000	1942000	angle of a sphere
1942000	1946000	to determine what is true real good, veritable, trustworthy
1946000	1950000	and so forth, you know Alan Steinfeld who I recently did
1950000	1954000	a beginning interview with
1954000	1958000	spoke about his first experience with a trans channel
1958000	1962000	and he said in the interview
1962000	1966000	you know I met this man
1966000	1970000	and I thought
1970000	1974000	okay either A, he is psychotic
1974000	1978000	B, he's a really really
1978000	1982000	good actor
1982000	1986000	or C, and this is the voice of the left hemisphere
1986000	1990000	incredible doubt and skepticism
1990000	1994000	maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
1994000	1998000	he said maybe like 12 times
1998000	2002000	maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
2002000	2006000	there's something going on here that I don't understand
2006000	2010000	and then later Alan was, Alan is a very intelligent
2010000	2014000	well educated person
2014000	2018000	and then so
2018000	2022000	a performance where this
2022000	2026000	actually I can't remember if it's, I think it's a woman who is the channel
2026000	2030000	and she channels an ancient warrior
2030000	2034000	his name is something like
2034000	2038000	something like this, I can't, it was very, this channel is very famous
2038000	2042000	one of the first trans channels
2042000	2046000	he was at a performance
2046000	2050000	the channel picked him out of the audience, pointed him
2050000	2054000	very reluctantly, so I said you mean me?
2054000	2058000	you talking to me? and then the channel said yes, in very elaborate
2058000	2062000	ancient pre-shakesperean
2062000	2066000	English, I said yes my beloved you
2066000	2070000	and Alan had a full
2070000	2074000	on suddenly, very rapidly, the whole tabloid changed
2074000	2078000	he said that the theater filled with a kind of
2078000	2082000	paraphrasing here, like a glowing mist and he rose
2082000	2086000	kind of out of his body and they embraced and he had this experience
2086000	2090000	unlike anything he'd ever had before and you know you can argue
2090000	2094000	whatever you like, ah, hypnosis, blah, blah, blah, I wasn't there, I didn't see
2094000	2098000	that, ah, it's just hearsay, go ahead, be my guest
2098000	2102000	you can argue the same thing about the flavor of food
2102000	2106000	you're not seeing red, that's just blah, blah, blah
2106000	2110000	make up any noises you like, you can make all the face noises you want
2110000	2114000	and you can have all of the critical left hemispheric
2114000	2118000	refutations, be my guest, you're welcome to have them
2118000	2122000	you're wrong, you're just dead wrong, you're missing
2122000	2126000	the thing you're using to determine what is real
2126000	2130000	is only useful in a very, very tiny
2130000	2134000	scope of human
2134000	2138000	experience, nature, being
2138000	2142000	thought, awareness, consciousness, all these
2142000	2146000	things, very tiny scope, it's very useful if you want to tell
2146000	2150000	is that pot hot or cold, very useful there
2150000	2154000	you know, how many coins are in my pocket, very useful there
2154000	2158000	beyond
2158000	2162000	this applicable scope, those faculties
2162000	2166000	are lethal to understanding
2166000	2170000	they crucify it, they basically just rip out its organs
2170000	2174000	and spray them on the wall, so if you think
2174000	2178000	that you know what's going on based on your rationality, you not only
2178000	2182000	don't know what's going on, you're like a bird that thinks
2182000	2186000	only this one feather on my wing
2186000	2190000	or in this case my right wing
2190000	2194000	because birds are similarly lateralized to us
2194000	2198000	only this one feather can I trust, which guess what that means
2198000	2202000	that means that you will never fly
2202000	2206000	and you're a bird, you're born to be sky born
2206000	2210000	you're born for the wind to just
2210000	2214000	lift you up into the atmosphere
2214000	2218000	into the sunlight, into dance with the clouds
2218000	2222000	this is what you're born for and you're really focused on this
2222000	2226000	one feather, you're like, well I've never seen anything incline me to believe
2226000	2230000	blah, blah, blah, blah, okay
2230000	2234000	good luck and everybody's, you know, lots of us start out there
2234000	2238000	the problem is some of us finish there
2238000	2242000	and I have my own biases and perspectives
2242000	2246000	I too can, I've experienced delusion
2246000	2250000	I've also experienced manic insight
2250000	2254000	mantic insight
2254000	2258000	paranoia, grandiose, yes, yes, I've had these experiences
2258000	2262000	and of course we want to be protected
2262000	2266000	from them, we don't want to
2266000	2270000	we don't want our buffers so permeable
2270000	2274000	that anything gets in and that's part of why
2274000	2278000	rationality reigns
2278000	2282000	supreme is because we're really afraid of the
2282000	2286000	contagion of madness, okay, I get it, but there's other approaches
2286000	2290000	that allow us to explore
2294000	2298000	our nature, our origin, our intelligences
2298000	2302000	our creativity, our participatory
2302000	2306000	transcendence
2306000	2310000	and this is very crucial that we have these experiences
2310000	2314000	so we need a buffer
2314000	2318000	against, you know, having the membrane
2318000	2322000	completely ruined
2322000	2326000	by nonsense, which is conceivable
2326000	2330000	but we still need a
2330000	2334000	trustworthy and worthy array of incitements
2334000	2338000	maps, teachers
2338000	2342000	mentors, and perhaps daimons
2342000	2346000	to lead us
2346000	2350000	out of the prison-eering cage
2350000	2354000	of mere rationality
2354000	2358000	that's it for now, more soon, thank you for joining me
2358000	2362000	may your paths be beautiful and your relationships
2362000	2366000	loving and your dreams amazing
2366000	2370000	bye bye for now
