00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello everybody. Welcome.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Because we are trained by language and culture to think as if intelligence

3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:25,000
is a possession. This is a misuse of the container metaphor. Even though there are examples

4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:50,000
of intelligence localized as the body, history, memory and behavior action of what we could

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:08,000
think of as distinct individuals. The ballet dancer, the classical musician, the neurosurgeon,

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:31,000
the elite coder, the mother who expertly cares for four or more children, the orator who is

7
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:55,000
certainly appearing as an individual performer, the comedian. There are veritable examples

8
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:19,000
of the existence and an action of individual intelligences and profound skillfulness which is where I'm going to go toward in this walk and talk today.

9
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But I'm pretty sure that none of them, none that I'm aware of, arise or exist in absolute isolation. And the arising part is the important part here.

10
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Not for all of us, but for most of us, our capacity to experience, embody, exemplify and enact the vast library

11
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:43,000
of our possible intelligences will profoundly depend on the contexts in which we arise, in which we mature.

12
00:04:43,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And our intelligences are composed with and for and against those with whom we imagine ourselves.

13
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And certainly we have actual local relationships, family, peers, culture, media, so forth. But even those must be imagined. We have to imagine participating in them, to participate in them.

14
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There's a powerful necessity for organized coherent consciousness in relation with the world, history, mystery, possibility, potential.

15
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The Stellars Jay recognizes me and I brought him, it's a male, pretty sure, a peanut. And having received peanuts before, it has an imaginal trace in its memory.

16
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is very strange. What the hell could that even mean? Someone's bag. So it's almost like a trap for humans, right? Put a bag with a bunch of objects in it and just leave it on a bench and then walk away from it and see what happens.

17
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Because the humans are naturally curious about the contents of the bag. No one knows what might be in there. A few weeks ago, in a garden around the corner from my house, the gardener has found $50,000 stacks of $100 bills in a bag.

18
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Apparently the money was filthy, really gross, but still, you know, cash dollars, you can wash them. I didn't feel, you know, I had complex feelings about that and we'll come back to the other topics.

19
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But imagine finding that yourself and then like taking it home and wondering, is this money perhaps cursed? Why is it so disgustingly filthy? Who could have disposed of it in this way and why did they do so?

20
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And is it a trap? Because it's a perfect kind of trap.

21
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:28,000
When my father used to work in the Weberstown Mall in Stockton at Roger's Jewelers, him and the other salespeople, they would often crazy glue silver dollar to the tile in front of the store for entertainment.

22
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And they would watch as women kicked it and broke their heels and people tried to pry it off the floor and they thought this was hilarious.

23
00:08:42,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But it's not unfunny. The problem is rather that it's a cruel kind of humor that depends on deceiving others and then finding their vulnerability to deception, entertaining.

24
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's a very mean-spirited mode of the possibilities of humor and much, many of the possibilities of humor have degraded into such meanly spirited modes in our time.

25
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:37,000
My friend who lives in town here, Johnny Teo, called her own, posted something on Facebook yesterday that I found absolutely hilarious and I still find it hilarious.

26
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But there's nothing mean about it. He wrote, some people have the calm before the storm. I have the panic before the nothing.

27
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And a couple of my friends said that I think that's a generational thing. And I said, yeah, maybe.

28
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He often writes very humorous things, but I thought that was hilarious, mostly because it's so familiar to my own direct experience of having a mind and consciousness.

29
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And part of having a mind and consciousness is imagining futures.

30
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And I want to talk a little bit about what I mean by intelligence because this concept is fundamental for me.

31
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It is orienting, and that's what makes it fundamental.

32
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If I want anything, there's probably a few things I want.

33
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I want to avoid making the most deadly mistakes that can be made during an incarnation.

34
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The ones that really screw futures up and maybe hurt other beings.

35
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I want to see better every time I begin to see.

36
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I want purposes that improve themselves each time I arouse them.

37
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I want more intelligence, which means insight, awareness, seeing from above, and often seeing for purposes and in ways that are extremely uncommon among my species.

38
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Because we are trained to the lowest rungs of the ladders on which we might hopefully together within for each other ascend toward

39
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:41,000
the finest or most beautiful, most profound, most trustworthy, most holy potentials of our humanity and animality and beingness and origin.

40
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And that ascent is crucially important to me.

41
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The relatively malignant gains that are imported into consciousness as we learn English and childhood and as we become enculturated, particularly courtroom mind, possession mind, war mind, and drag us down the ladder mind.

42
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Meaning let's go for even lower hanging fruit until we get to the rotten, moldy stuff on the ground and maybe we'll be able to find an even more deleterious place from there.

43
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There's no end to the low end of the ladders, much like the high end they're infinite, but they're far more easily accessed than what I'm positing as up on the ladders of memory, insight, intelligence, awareness, human and cultural possibility.

44
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So what do I actually mean by intelligence?

45
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And here's the real problem, or here's a real problem.

46
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Speaking abstractly about virtues is ironically almost the opposite of enacting them much of the time, if not most of the time.

47
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's very, one has to be profoundly skillful to enact something while speaking of it.

48
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I have occasionally seen recent examples of this.

49
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I saw a few examples in the not modestly insane locutions of Ammon Hillman in his recent interview with Danny Jones.

50
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There were some examples in there.

51
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I've seen other examples in the locutions of John Verveke recently, who I've managed to fascinate my son with, which is a pretty significant accomplishment for me since nearly nothing that I can present to my progeny

52
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
actually captivates his attention, mostly he attacks it, which, you know, is a perennial problem.

53
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So this is the problem, right? I can talk about what I mean by intelligence, but if I'm not enacting it while speaking about it, then I'm walking away from it by talking about it.

54
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And this is a very complex and difficult problem to resolve.

55
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Actual prodigy tends to be able to resolve this problem without much planning in the natural course of not merely locution,

56
00:16:47,000 --> 00:17:09,000
but a word I recently came to understand the meaning of, if I understand the meaning of it, elocation, which I'm going to pretend means to accomplish what is being spoken of by speaking about it.

57
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Now, I can think of two contrary examples, which will be familiar to some of those who've listened to my recent podcast.

58
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:33,000
One that is the opposite of elocation, which is a statement something like, actually there's a couple of them.

59
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:43,000
One of my favorites is to demonstrate the capacity for incredibly absurd idiocy in language.

60
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
One of the statements is, this is the most important statement you will ever hear.

61
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's kind of my version of the Rossellian paradox, if I understand which paradox that is correctly.

62
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:19,000
A similar anti-illocutive statement is, I will not be speaking to you today about leverage or succession.

63
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And an example, again, if I understand the concept correctly, now I've long understood a similar concept that may not be truly illocution,

64
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:53,000
but it is the capacity to accomplish certain kinds of virtues, mostly perspectival, intellectual, conceptual, to accomplish them by framing them in language.

65
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And also to do what is being said by saying it is very, very different from mere description.

66
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So if I say that a manifold is a bubble of many bubbles, and there are intersections between these bubbles,

67
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and that what we do, what I'm doing right now to form this sentence is collapsing a manifold, right?

68
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm throwing away bubbles until I get a kind of a complex stick figure from the remaining intersections.

69
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And then I select among those for the structure of the sentences I will vocalize.

70
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And it is similar in thought or problem solving.

71
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So what do I mean by intelligence?

72
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Well, one of the best examples is the entire array of non-human, non-representational intelligences embodied in the biorelational hyperstructure that we refer to as nature.

73
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And particularly the bubble of life that surrounds and penetrates and enlivens our planet here.

74
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Those beings are not referring to things.

75
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:59,000
They are enacting anciently sophisticated biorelational intelligences, moment to moment, instant to instant, together as a unity seemingly comprised of individuals.

76
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So, you know, one of my jokes recently was the problem with the idea of non-human intelligences is that it's very likely that that's the only kind there is.

77
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Obviously, our species, at the species level, is profoundly adept at certain terrifying modes of technique.

78
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And as profoundly bereft of the wisdom necessary to know which of them to not implement and how to not implement examples that are omnicidal.

79
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:11,000
On the other hand, our collective technique is like a demon, very profound.

80
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I was talking with my friend Eric the other night and I was recalling when I was a child, it was as if I had lived before in other ages.

81
00:22:41,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And could thus recall what in science fiction or the game Traveler or other science-fiction systems could recall the tech level of the civilization in which I previously existed.

82
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And compared that to what I discovered in this incarnation with objects like toasters and televisions and watches and, you know, hems.

83
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I think about how complex a hem is.

84
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And maybe you could figure out how to sew somewhat crudely, perhaps using the viscera of animals as a thread and animal skins as fabric.

85
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But your chances of composing an actual fabric, very slim, the simple cotton sheet underneath my bed is a catastrophically sophisticated example of human technique.

86
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And zippers are ridiculously, complexly advanced and useful.

87
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So there's this whole dimension of technique at the collective level of the humans that really does provide us with what we can imagine as benefits, reasonably imagine as benefits, comfort, convenience, survivability.

88
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That second word is one of the most dangerous of the demons.

89
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Apparently the humans have no inhibitive intelligence around what not to trade for convenience.

90
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Including our ancestors, our souls, our origin, our intelligence, our health, our planet itself, the anciently conserved ecologies, you name it.

91
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:26,000
We will gladly, or, you know, stupidly, hand all that over, our privacy, our relationships, there's nothing safe.

92
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But the reason that we will hand it over isn't necessarily that we're just stupid or addicted, it's that we're lonely.

93
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
We're isolated.

94
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And the specter of the anti-cultures that arise in the wake of the human relationship with technique

95
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
is recursively self-impoverishing.

96
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It just creates new and greater depths of impoverishment within us and in the world over time.

97
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And the pain of that is what makes us willing to trade away the most precious assets imaginable.

98
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's so precious that their value is impossible to comprehend, which also makes it easy.

99
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Something that's infinite, something that appears infinite to consciousness, one cannot understand that it has been traded away.

100
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It seems impossible to imagine that it could be taken away or fracked for profit, power.

101
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So, it's very challenging to abstractly say what I mean by intelligence.

102
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Since I hadn't practiced it, and I'm really just improvising here, I'm not too sure of my footing, so to speak.

103
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But I'll try to say some things about it.

104
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:53,000
The capacity to usefully improve previously practiced methods, ideas, perspectives,

105
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:00,000
what we call solutions, which is a very strange thing to call them.

106
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The capacity to resolve various conflicts and or problems.

107
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And also the capacity, particularly, to detect and attend the repercussions of such solutions,

108
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:28,000
so as to avoid the self-ironizing weaponization that rather naturally occurs

109
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:54,000
if the intelligences we practice and develop are not broadly pro-generative of insight, rather than mere technique.

110
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So, it's the capacity to rise above the common, often lethal, meaning causative of forgetting results

111
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:34,000
of poorly conceived purposes, motivations, ideologies, conceptions.

112
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Of course, actual insight is not formally above, it's not necessarily up from the other dangerous stuff.

113
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This is a metaphor.

114
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I think we all understand in a basic way what the metaphor implies.

115
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And the simplest way to say that is just improvement.

116
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Now, there are many spiritual traditions that naturally and perhaps intelligently warn us about the dangers of conceiving the purpose of improvement.

117
00:30:34,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And this is in part because conceiving that purpose is distracting.

118
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:28,000
We are inclined to become un-present, to defect from intimate awareness of the moment or bodies, situations, relationships, histories.

119
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And this desire drives much of the problem with human technique.

120
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But it is truly astonishing what the humans can accomplish with their super-organism-like technical behavior.

121
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Unfortunately, most of that stuff is quite malignant in its inaction results.

122
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:22,000
There's a beehive about 15 feet from me, it's an intentional beehive.

123
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Some human put it together and populated it and so forth.

124
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I'm going to take a closer look for a moment.

125
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm a huge fan of the hymenoptra.

126
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:05,000
If I understand correctly, the Greek origins of this word hymen,

127
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:19,000
which we refer in English and maybe other languages to a sheath in the reproductive organs of the female,

128
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:29,000
that must be broken for effective intercourse to occur.

129
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I think the word means blood, it just means blood.

130
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But this is what I derived from listening to Amon Hillman.

131
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:03,000
However, it's also strongly associated with femininity or the female gender.

132
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And so clearly hymenoptra, which is the what, the genus?

133
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I can't remember which Linnaean ladder segment is right of the ants, bees, wasps, termites,

134
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:32,000
because they are female dominated, biologically female dominated societies.

135
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Or at least that's the impression we take from our own purposeful derivations.

136
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So one reasonable definition of intelligence is to just see better,

137
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
to keep continually to forge a cascade of greater insight,

138
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:12,000
that keeps that with each iteration gets a richer, deeper, broader, and more specific array of capacities

139
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:24,000
to derive useful conceptions and potentials for action, behavior, relation.

140
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Surely you can see how different this description is from the inaction of it.

141
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And for that, for the moment I must simply apologize.

142
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm not as sharp as I could be surrounded by intelligence others

143
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:08,000
or with the participation of intelligences far richer and older than my own.

144
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
But another definition of intelligence that's very valuable

145
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:28,000
is one associated with the oath that we associate with Hippocrates.

146
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And I strongly suspect that in the Greek there's a strong distinction between Hippocrates

147
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,000
and the root from which we get the concept of hypocrisy,

148
00:36:49,000 --> 00:37:03,000
which is the ironic violation of espoused principles, intelligences, or perspectives

149
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:17,000
by one's actions and speeches in action too, even though it's a very specific kind of action.

150
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But the Hippocratic oath includes the admonition to first don't make things worse.

151
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And this is part of the admonition in Buddhist and other spiritual systems to not try to improve situations or things.

152
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Let them be as they are. Attend your own, you know, attention.

153
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Attend your own attention, body, perceptions, don't place too much urgency on thoughts.

154
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Let them dissolve away just as they arise.

155
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Try not to enact them or cause them to become recursively self-generative of long sequences of thoughts,

156
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:32,000
which by the way goes back to that hilarious thing that my friend Johnny said.

157
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Because to have the panic before the nothing is the result of too much thinking.

158
00:38:43,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And I guess, you know, intelligence can also be understood as concerned with three primary features of human attentional investment,

159
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,000
which are ambiguity, vigilance, and prediction.

160
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So when something's ambiguous, we're going to tend to pay more attention to it unless it's irresolvable.

161
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
We're going to try to collapse it toward a graspable derivative.

162
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And that's costly in terms of attention and straight-up capitalism, like glucose, whatever feeds a cognitive and nervous system activity.

163
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Because you have to stay in a state of readiness, which is expensive.

164
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So what the humans like to do, and what they often do, and what many of their ideas of convenience orbit is the reduction in ambiguity over time as an equation.

165
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And the attempt to produce something like negative ambiguity, which is something that gravidically pre-resolves possible future ambiguities moment to moment.

166
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And that's why we live in boxes that are dead inside.

167
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Because when they're dead inside, there's nothing to attend.

168
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:33,000
The degree of unexpected, you know, a rise of ambiguity is extremely low inside a house.

169
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
There's nothing is moving, unless we have animals or children or something.

170
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Or, you know, the other humans may move about.

171
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
In most homes, there's very little life.

172
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And the less life there is, the less ambiguity there is, the less of a prediction burden there is.

173
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Now, of course, you know, there's an array of trenchant ironies here.

174
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Because no ambiguity means no opportunity, no adventure, no development, essentially a kind of living death.

175
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
It's very safe, but nothing happens.

176
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:33,000
You know, David Byrne, I think, once said, heaven is a place where nothing ever happens, or rather he sang this.

177
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It's very insightful.

178
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,000
He was aware, whether conceptually or not, is a question in the same way I am.

179
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:51,000
But he was aware of this interplay of vigilance, ambiguity, and prediction.

180
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And so intelligence might then be also a way of balancing these three potentials for maximum opportunity,

181
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,000
minimized but not minimal ambiguity, and efficacious prediction.

182
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That last thing turns out to be really important, because if you don't see the repercussions,

183
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
or if you don't care about them, of the development of technique,

184
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:36,000
your children will be tormented, tortured, if there's even a world on which they might exist anymore.

185
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So there's a super dangerous array of problems that arise from either the failure to predict intelligently,

186
00:42:46,000 --> 00:43:06,000
insightfully, effectively, or we're still the disposition that inclines us to see catastrophes

187
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
emerge from technique as opportunities for profit or business,

188
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:22,000
which is a common malignant cancerous disease in our present cultures.

189
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Those who hold the reins of wealth and power are well protected from almost all of the repercussions

190
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:45,000
of lethally enacted technique and can bubble themselves up inside a broad array of shields

191
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:53,000
that keep them and their families relatively safe as long as the whole damn context doesn't collapse,

192
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:06,000
apocalypse, and any catastrophe that costs life or health is just another way to make money,

193
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
more money, which is another way to get more power.

194
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So this leads to a kind of absolute corruption of principles,

195
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and particularly the principle of an intelligent democracy,

196
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:34,000
which is the principle that our country, the United States, counterfeits.

197
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Because what we really have here is like, I don't know exactly what the right term is,

198
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
but one that I use frequently lately is kleptocracy,

199
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
which is a steal everything you can under the guise of a semi-democratic array of processes

200
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
that have been thoroughly compromised from within,

201
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:10,000
re-compromised, and continue to invent new modes of the counterfeit expression of.

202
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So it's like a recursively self-recounterfeiting opposite of what anything resembling an actual democracy might be,

203
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:32,000
which is also something that Amon Hillman was interested in and concerned about.

204
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I don't know why, but I found him to be one of the most entertaining of the intellects,

205
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
masculine intellects I've ever encountered.

206
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Clearly a genius, also partly mad,

207
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:19,000
and in some ways more like a human drug than most of the people that I've ever seen.

208
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And one of the things that he was talking very clearly about was the necessity of learning a very complex ancient language.

209
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:52,000
For him, this is Greek, and he has excellent defenses for why.

210
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think that he actually believes, I'm not sure about this, because he says he's not religious,

211
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
and he says he's too lazy to be religious, which is interesting.

212
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:13,000
But he does seem to believe that there is something that resembles the idea of the logos,

213
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:29,000
which is, at least in my mind, a being, a metaphysical entity, that is the origin of the possibility of rationality.

214
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But he used a different word, he didn't say rationality.

215
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,000
The word that he used, though, implied the potential of making sense of things,

216
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
and possibly of representing them and making sense of the representations.

217
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:08,000
What's the word? I can't recall it. It wasn't our word.

218
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Now, obviously, Ammon is very brilliant and has a direct relationship with something like the origins of language in humans,

219
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
whether or not he conceives of it as a being.

220
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I conceive of it as an intelligence or an array of intelligences that exist outside of time

221
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and don't require a physical substrate for their existence.

222
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And their collection of these could be understood as a being.

223
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
But this is all very derinean.

224
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm not trying to convince anyone to dot my perspective here.

225
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Though, what Ammon is talking about is a transcendental reunion through the careful study of what he conceives of

226
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:28,000
as a sygenic linguistic substrate, which for him is Greek,

227
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
and which it makes perfect sense to me why he has chosen Greek

228
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
and why he thinks it is either the ultimate or penultimate language one can study,

229
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
though his experience of other languages is not particularly broad.

230
00:49:46,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Because the study of Greek transformed his mind in such a way that language became his companion and he rose above it

231
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:10,000
so that unlike us, rather than being subject to language,

232
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:17,000
language becomes his laboratory and toolbox.

233
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
He asked Danny Jones whether or not Danny coins terms.

234
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
This is a crucial question.

235
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:38,000
On the one hand, the irresponsible profusion of self-coin terms is unhelpful at best and ridiculous at worst.

236
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:52,000
On the other hand, the ongoing failure to coin terms is a sign of linguistic disability, crippling.

237
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:01,000
And he was talking about the propensity of Greek to not merely allow the constant and common coining of terms,

238
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:13,000
but to encourage and reward it, though I'm paraphrasing.

239
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It strikes me that the structure of German, about which I know very little,

240
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:36,000
but seems to be oriented toward complex coining of terms,

241
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
has a similar functionality.

242
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:48,000
There's lots of little parts. You can weave them together in all kinds of new or interesting or useful ways.

243
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And English also has this ability. I fairly regularly coin terms.

244
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:10,000
My recent Facebook friend, Savon Gordon, who's a memestress who calls herself the Queen of Dreams on her memes,

245
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:21,000
she recently had a reel with a picture of her hair where she basically looked like a Medusa.

246
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Her hair was so possibly intentionally distressed, probably by wind,

247
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:44,000
and I refer to that as a herpocalypse. This is an example of, you know, coining words in English.

248
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Or you can see that in this particular coining, Greek is involved.

249
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Probably many of the roots that we, what, the phonemes or the fragments of words

250
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:12,000
that are woven together to form English terms are Greek.

251
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Some of them are Latin.

252
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Probably most of them are Greek and some are borrowed from later languages.

253
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Ah, sorry.

254
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:48,000
The last one's injured. This goose is injured.

255
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
When I began this walk and talk,

256
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:05,000
my initial goal was to talk about the vast library of accessible intelligences that most of us will never taste.

257
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
We see much more today because of two things, right?

258
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:25,000
The ability to fake, to present the appearance of superhuman activity or skill,

259
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:33,000
and the ability to practice and transmit superhuman ability and skill.

260
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Because of YouTube particularly, I guess TikTok now as well.

261
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Lots of contagions are mixed in there. It doesn't just transmit intelligence or training or skillfulness.

262
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:55,000
But by constantly exemplifying what looks to us to be superhuman abilities and skills,

263
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I'm thinking particularly of parkour, certain martial arts skills, musical skills, dancing skills,

264
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:15,000
skills of acrobatics or physicality, conceptual or perspectival skills which are a bit more rare.

265
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:24,000
There's this vast library of exemplars of this in YouTube and now perhaps TikTok.

266
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And this at least potentially makes them contagious.

267
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:39,000
But what I want to actually point out is that these skills are not superhuman.

268
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:47,000
The broad library of intelligences and abilities that we bring to our human birth are mostly inhibited,

269
00:55:47,000 --> 00:56:16,000
shut down, punished or commodified like filtered into representations such as sports or war.

270
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And so most of the intelligences and abilities that we might naturally embody and enact and experience together within for each other

271
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:52,000
are amputated, inhibited or reframed into forms that can be commoditized and thus controlled, bought and sold for purposes that aren't actually human.

272
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
But serve what?

273
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
No, it's not verveki.

274
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:05,000
What Ogie Oglin, I can't remember this guy's actual name, refers to as the replicators which are a branch.

275
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:33,000
This is a concept for the bad human collectives that just keep doing terrifying things and converting vast populations of humans to robots and slaves and things.

276
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And most of us don't actually understand that there's a kind of a link-up that can occur between the mundane physicality of our human common experience and expectation

277
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:04,000
and what we might imagine as the transcendent and or the divine.

278
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:19,000
This is a very familiar concept to me and it's not familiar in the basic conceptual way that it might be familiar to academics.

279
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It's not familiar to me in the way of the difference between someone who has only ever heard about the existence of vast bodies of water and someone who has jumped into them and swam in them,

280
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:44,000
like the difference between someone who's only heard of a lake and someone who is solo-dived in the ocean. This kind of familiarity.

281
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:57,000
There are forces, intelligences, beings in the universe that correspond to the concept of the muses.

282
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:06,000
The Greeks might appear conceptually insane or hyper-religious to us moderns.

283
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:15,000
The actual problem is the other way around. We are idiots about the transcendental, most modern, generally speaking.

284
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:31,000
We either refuse to acknowledge that it's possible or real, or we form bizarre, insane representations which we then subject ourselves and others to in the form of organized religion.

285
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Not that all organized religions are bad, wrong, etc. But the vast majority of them are crippling.

286
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Because the feral intensity of our actual human nature and intelligences exceeds the entire payload of all human spiritual traditions by many orders of magnitude.

287
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And this is what I am trying to talk about today.

288
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:15,000
That potential that we bring to our human birth and the possibility of recovering our capacity to understand and pursue those intelligences,

289
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:26,000
the development and inaction of those intelligences together, with and for each other, with and for the history of future and future of life on earth,

290
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:34,000
with and for the benefit of all beings in all of time.

291
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:49,000
This is an imperative I trust. And there aren't too many that I trust that way.

292
01:00:49,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So, you know, you see examples of humans doing things that look impossible to us.

293
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I don't know, playing 47 notes per, you know, more than a note per second on the guitar, for example.

294
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Which isn't necessarily genius and can be stupid, because beauty and speed are not the same thing.

295
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Hyperfunction isn't the same thing as prodigy, but there's a relationship there that's real.

296
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:49,000
You know, you can see wild examples of people climbing up walls, flipping over in the air, doing all kinds of seemingly impossible monkey-like acrobatics under the rubric of parkour.

297
01:01:49,000 --> 01:02:04,000
You can see someone shatter a stack of bricks, not with a punch, but with a movement of their fingertips that's less than an inch.

298
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:15,000
They have no time in which to accelerate. They go from zero to pure acceleration in a span of less than an inch.

299
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:26,000
All kinds of profound, martial examples of martial skill and effectiveness, some of which are phony.

300
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:33,000
For sure, some of that's phony. But a lot of it isn't. Plenty of it isn't.

301
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:46,000
The capacity for not merely superfunction in our bodies and minds, but hyperfunction, is real and natural to humans.

302
01:02:46,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It's not superhuman. It's human. Or it's subhuman in the sense that it arises from either our animalian basis, our organismal basis, our basis as organisms, or our basis as beings.

303
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And if we imagine those as sort of rings on a cone, that the top of which is the human, then these are subhuman features.

304
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:40,000
And if we imagine them as rings, that the lowest point of the cone, whether the cone goes up or down, is the lowest point as human, then they are more than merely human.

305
01:03:40,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Which I would argue they are. The latter rung of our being is more than the latter rung of our organismal nature, which is more than the latter rung of our animalian nature, more than the rung of our human nature.

306
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:15,000
But it's useful to be able to think in either direction about this, and to not be too biased, because are they actually separate rungs? There's lots of important questions here.

307
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:37,000
But the thing that I want you to understand is that you came to human birth, and every person that you ever loved, and that you ever knew, they came to incarnation endowed with an anciently developed library of seemingly impossible faculties and abilities

308
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:53,000
that mostly get amputated, circumcised, lost, lied about, faked. There's lots of people who think, oh you know, psychism is impossible, Darren Brown proved that.

309
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Because Darren Brown can fake the feats of mentalists and psychics, his presumption is that because I can fake those, all such things are fake. That's not true, and it's not possible.

310
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Telepathy is real. Mind to mind contact is real. Mind to place contact is real. Mind to time contact is real.

311
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:49,000
The ideas that we consider to be our sober defenses against superstition and fakery are just as dangerous as they are protective if they blind us to the veritable existence of anything that can be counter-fitted.

312
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:09,000
And Darren Brown is a professional counter-fitter. So, you know, not surprising. I mean, he has a grudge, right? And his grudge is purposeful and intelligent to a degree. It's just that the degree is not universal.

313
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:29,000
He doesn't want people to be taken advantage of, lied to, shriven of their money, time, belief. So he wants to show them that the entire domain of metaphysical and or even physical skills.

314
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:49,000
You know, he goes to a martial art dojo where the teacher is supposed to be capable of demonstrating what is called the one-inch punch, which I spoke of earlier.

315
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And Darren demonstrates something very similar in effect. But what Darren is doing, Darren Brown that is, is not demonstrating martial skill. Darren has very little if any martial skill.

316
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Darren's skill is a skill at manipulating consciousness of nearby humans. And he's an expert at that. And so what he's actually doing is more or less hypnotic rather than physical.

317
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:50,000
But let me be very clear about this. If a skilled martial artist who could execute this maneuver struck you in the sternum with such a blow, it probably shatter your rib cage. Shatter it. Don't just break your rib.

318
01:07:51,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Humans have abilities. We're living in the lowest possible rung of the ladders that we were born to climb together for each other, for our ancestors, for our progeny, for the future, for life on Earth, for our species.

319
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:35,000
These are noble, heroic imperatives that we come to human birth imbued with, that are stolen, lied about, compromised, sold broken, counterfeited, and sold back to us in every ridiculously addictive form because we're dying of the pain of isolation.

320
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:49,000
We're dying of having no meaningful identity or role. We're dying of loneliness while surrounded by thousands of strangers.

321
01:08:49,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And when I say we, I don't just mean we, I mean me. This is true of my own experience. I can sense the terrifying vacuum of meaningful human experience, identity, opportunity, adventure, relation.

322
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:36,000
And so forth. Moment to moment. And it is witheringly in miserating. That's the word I coined, in miserating.

323
01:09:48,000 --> 01:10:17,000
This pain is the origin and source of our enslavement.

324
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:35,000
And some of us endeavor to break free, like birds chained to a wall.

325
01:10:49,000 --> 01:11:09,000
We want not merely to fly again. We want to free the mothers, the children, the ancestors, the progeny from that faith.

326
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Even if we ourselves will not fly again, we ache for the inaction of the principles from which the concept of justice derives.

327
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:49,000
And that concept is not a concept of the punishment of wrongdoers. The concept of justice is the concept of liberation and resolution of harm.

328
01:11:50,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Institutionally conserved and reenacted forms of harm that torment beings, and particularly living beings and body beings.

329
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:20,000
No one would punish a murderer, harm them, make them pay. I mean this is the most ridiculous idea in the history of human thought. Make them pay.

330
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:47,000
No one would do that if they could simply use the intelligence gathered from some murder to ensure that future murders didn't happen.

331
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:56,000
To make the murder medicine from the murder that actually took place, we would never punish anyone.

332
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:08,000
And if we, in punishing humans for their quote wrongdoing, if in doing that we guarantee the reenaction of the injustice,

333
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:22,000
that is insane, malignant, wrong, horrifying, stupid, inexcusable, unjustifiably catastrophic.

334
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:35,000
We're just going to reiterate catastrophe and waves going forward in time and generations. And this is what our idea, prison-earing, accomplishes.

335
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It's a for-profit slave-naping system run by and for the benefit of the wealthy and the replicators as that Ogie guy is talking about.

336
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:24,000
So part of intelligence is understanding these principles that I've outlined today, but the greater portion is finding ways to implement that understanding

337
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:39,000
that actually accomplish liberation and that grant us the contextual support for recovery operations that we engage in together with and for each other,

338
01:14:39,000 --> 01:15:04,000
that reintroduce our more than merely human natures, imperatives and abilities to our direct experience and celebrate them and support them, recognize them, encourage them.

339
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:29,000
You know, my talk today is an attempt, it's an essay in this direction. And I hope you find it inspiring and useful because even just by having a conversation like this one, we have begun the process I described together.

340
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:49,000
It may be imperfect, it may not solve all the problems, but it calls to mind the potentials and opportunities of our humanity and our origin, our nature as living beings and as more than merely human beings.

341
01:15:50,000 --> 01:16:10,000
And that call is the call that our incarnation originated with, worthy of pursuit, trustworthy beyond all concepts, beyond all language,

342
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:27,000
beyond all skills, a compass in a darkness that grows more tangled in our modern experience with each passing moment.

343
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And, you know, the situation seems hopeless, but it's only hopeless if the scope is too large for us to address. The moment we shrink the scope to me and you and two or three other people,

344
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:57,000
the impossible becomes the accomplished.

345
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I'm so grateful for this opportunity to learn and undergo a kind of an amnesis, un-forgetting, together today.

346
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I'm so grateful to all of you who listen and participate and share this with others, which is very helpful.

347
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:32,000
You know, if you can and you wish to make a little donation, even a one-time donation on my website organelle.org would be very deeply appreciated.

348
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And I look forward to learning together again very soon.

349
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Thank you for joining me.

350
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Key and lock.

351
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:13,000
May your path and life, relationships, streaming and opportunities be beautiful, rich, fulfilling, and exquisite.

352
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Bye-bye for now.
