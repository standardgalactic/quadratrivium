00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello everybody. Welcome. So part of how I learn, I'm sorry to say, is by being intellectually

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,440
impetuous, precocious, and naive. And what that usually turns out to mean, or what that

3
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:45,440
commonly often turns out to mean, is that I'm going to make bold mistakes in my first

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:01:00,120
essays of an idea that will sort of fertilize the garden of my mind if I'm lucky. If I'm

5
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:11,480
unlucky, those bold mistakes become doctrine, dogma, or my pet theory. And that happens too.

6
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:25,120
This is part of the danger of trying to chase insight alone, right? So that I don't have to

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:39,520
fight anyone powerful who's got an objection or a contrary perspective. This is part of why

8
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:51,240
I've been willing to put up with my scientist friend Kevin for 15 years or something, 20 years,

9
00:01:51,240 --> 00:02:01,360
because he only fights me. He nearly never agrees with anything I've thought, believed,

10
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:15,600
perceived, and so forth. And he's very adept in the intellectual confines of argument or debate.

11
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:39,080
I wonder if we'll hear some coyotes because of the siren. Sorry about that devastating

12
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:53,880
oral attack. I suppose I could edit it out, but it seems useful. I'm seeing something really

13
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:03,280
interesting here. Okay, so there's a there's a three pronged pine needle floating in midair,

14
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:17,080
and moving around on the breeze. And the closest branch it could be connected to is probably a

15
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:29,760
minimum of 15 feet away. And the branch it's probably connected to is 20, 25 feet away. Oh shit.

16
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:38,520
Oh yeah, there it is. Wow. Okay, so oh, huh. All right, this is even weirder than I thought.

17
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:53,120
Because the branch it actually appears to be connected to is not above it. That's funny.

18
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,360
Maybe a friend just flew right past my face to wake me up to the fact that it's here.

19
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:11,840
All right, so what's actually going on isn't what is apparent. And this is the problem with ideas.

20
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:22,640
It certainly looked, I'm gonna have to test this, which is sort of frightening because I don't want

21
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:31,400
to change. I want to understand something about the situation without modifying the situation.

22
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:42,120
And this is the problem with knowledge and perspective is that often it is impossible to

23
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,120
determine what is the case without so severely disturbing the case quote unquote,

24
00:04:48,120 --> 00:05:02,160
that we cannot, our first moves wrong foot us for all future moves. So I'm trying to understand

25
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:11,240
this what I'm looking at, which is a triad of dry pine needles floating apparently floating in the

26
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:21,720
atmosphere. And what I'm trying to understand is, and it seems very unlikely that this is the case,

27
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:36,560
but it is possible. Because spiders are crazy, amazing in their abilities to forge what I call

28
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:44,560
anchor strands for webs. And that's what this is is a spider kite. It's an anchor strand kite.

29
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:54,000
So a spider at some point in very recent history has attached a web.

30
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:06,040
And originally, I thought the web that was attached was from the kite up.

31
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:19,080
But I can see that there's a web from the kite sideways. What I can't tell is if there are two

32
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:30,400
webs, because the kite is behaving as if there are two. And I don't really want to disturb it.

33
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:40,240
But I'm going to try to determine the movement of the kite

34
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,880
is so counterintuitive.

35
00:06:47,880 --> 00:07:09,120
I can't understand what is lofting the kite. If the only web is to the side,

36
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:26,800
because when the wind is reduced, the kite should fall. And it does fall some, but not enough.

37
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,480
And so it appears when I'm looking at it just doesn't seem possible, but it is.

38
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:48,080
I don't think there's a second strand attached above it. But the way the kite is flying,

39
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,200
it appears that there would have to be two strands. I don't think there is. I tried to test it.

40
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,800
Again, the problem with something this delicate, well, first of all,

41
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:10,240
it might be safer to test than I thought, because it's most likely that the web strand

42
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:21,120
is not sticky. Ah, okay, I've just figured it out. There are two strands. One is invisible.

43
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:30,720
Okay, that makes sense. Now the behavior of the kite makes sense. I cannot see the second strand,

44
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,080
but I could interfere with it. Wow. So now,

45
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,200
now I really don't understand how the object was formed, because I can understand the spider

46
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,840
attaching. Ah, there's the second strand. I can see it now. But from the opposite angle,

47
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,240
I can see it. Okay, and both of them go to the side. But what I can't understand,

48
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,760
what seems impossible to me, is how the spider got this kite in the middle of what appears to be

49
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:18,400
two strands. Yeah, no idea. It just seems impossible. I can imagine the spider attaching the kite,

50
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:29,360
you know, dumping the strand from a high branch. I have no idea how the kite could be in the middle

51
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:39,760
of two strands. No idea. I'm going to take a picture of this just for kicks, so I'm going to,

52
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:54,960
oh wait, I can take a picture without stopping the recording.

53
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:08,560
Huh, effectively invisible in the photograph.

54
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,960
Very blurry in that one.

55
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:29,120
A little, yeah, useless. All right.

56
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,480
Forgive my throat clearing.

57
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:45,680
Yeah, it seems impossible. I'm looking at it. I'm sure there was a method that produced this

58
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,760
seemingly absurd impossibility.

59
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
And I've seen stuff like this before. Spider kites are amazing.

60
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:04,400
And if you actually look at large webs, particularly those of orb weavers,

61
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,160
and it turns out that this topic is covalent

62
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,240
to the topic I'm going to stumble into with great impetuous ignorance in a little bit,

63
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:34,320
um, if you look at the large webs, particularly of orb weavers,

64
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,320
and you actually try to understand,

65
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,360
it's not too hard to understand how the web is constructed

66
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:55,200
once the anchor strands are in place. But if you try to understand how the anchor strands were forged,

67
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:07,520
whoo, good luck. You're going to have to see it happen or, you know, have an entomologist.

68
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,960
I don't know if there are arachnologists, there probably are, study arachnids.

69
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,720
But yeah, you're going to have to have someone explain it to you.

70
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,920
And until you actually see it happen, if you carefully think about the web and you look at it,

71
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,440
it's going to look impossible to produce many of the anchor strands,

72
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,880
and especially to connect them at tension in the center of the web.

73
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,520
And this turns out to be

74
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:56,000
correlated with the topic that I intend to pursue here, as soon as I manage to effectively

75
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,240
clear my throat, which I will not do in your ear.

76
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,560
Let's see. Okay.

77
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,360
So,

78
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,000
I think before I even get to the topic, I'm going to talk about the web some more.

79
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,080
The world line of an organism

80
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:43,920
can be imagined as the size, shape, spacetime tunnel

81
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,080
that an organism traverses during its lifetime.

82
00:13:50,640 --> 00:14:00,960
Now, it should be obvious that the world lines of other similar organisms

83
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,360
are productive of the world line of a single organism, i.e., a human baby has two parents,

84
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,520
two immediate parents.

85
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:21,920
It's unclear. There's a problem with trying to compute the number of progenitors of a human,

86
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,320
because there's a problem where, and even the common answers to the problem don't actually

87
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,560
solve the problem. As far as I understand it, I'd love to be corrected about that,

88
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,480
because this is something that has bothered me for a long time. It looks like,

89
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,760
as you go backward in time with two ancestors, you know, my dad had two ancestors,

90
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,400
my mom had two ancestors, so that's four. They each had two ancestors, so that's eight.

91
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,200
Sixteen, et cetera. You have the chessboard problem of one grain of sand on each, you know,

92
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:15,200
N plus one grains of rice on each. Is that it? Is it N plus one? No, you double the grains of rice,

93
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:31,440
so it's N to the X, N to the 1, 2, 3, 4 powers as you traverse the chessboard.

94
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:44,240
Long time ago some, it is claimed. Some astute mathematician was offered a reward by a king or

95
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:53,440
queen for having solved the problem, and they requested one grain of rice on the first square

96
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:01,840
of a chessboard, two on the next, four on the next, and so forth. At first glance, this looks

97
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:12,080
like a paltry sum, but if you understand the nature of powers, you realize that on the final

98
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,800
square you'll have, I don't know, more of grains of rice than there are on earth or something,

99
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:31,200
a ridiculously large amount of grain of rice. So organisms have a world line, and for the purposes

100
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:38,000
of our discussion, and I may even be misunderstanding the world line, because I often do misunderstand

101
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,640
complex principles from science, not having had to mathematically validate them myself.

102
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,400
So I can have a naive understanding of things, and it's not uncommon for me to do so.

103
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,760
It is uncommon for me to notice in real time that my understanding is or is likely naive,

104
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:13,360
but, okay, where am I going here? So imagine

105
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:25,360
that an ovum in my mother's womb has a world line, and it is the size and shape of an ovum,

106
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,200
and it is traveling inside my mother's womb, so it's tracing. Imagine that we light it up and we

107
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:39,840
make a tracer backward and forward in time. It appears sometime during or after her embryo

108
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:47,440
genesis, probably after, I would guess. There's a light, and it's the size of an ovum,

109
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:56,800
and it makes a tunnel as it travels through time, and then eventually it meets another light,

110
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,080
the size of a sperm, which has been doing some traveling in my father's testicles,

111
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:10,960
and it meets these two lights that make a tunneled shape, a tunnel of their shape

112
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,320
in time space, right? So wherever my mom goes on the surface of the earth, that changes the tunnel's

113
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,200
trajectories. The earth is spinning, so that changes the trajectories. The earth is orbiting

114
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,920
the sun, so we're going to follow it inside my dad's body on the surface of the earth,

115
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,280
around the surface of the earth's spin, around the earth's orbit of the sun, and then around the sun's

116
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,320
orbit in the galaxy, and then around the galaxy's orbit, orbits, or movements in the universe,

117
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:52,400
and you'll get exactly one tunnel, sperm size shaped, and ovum size shaped, and then these two

118
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:02,400
meet, and my world line begins there. So at first I am the size of an ovum with an embedded sperm head

119
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:14,160
in it, and then it becomes a multicellular blastocyst, and so forth, and becomes Darren.

120
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,880
So first I'm baby-shaped, and my world line is baby-shaped and sized, and then as I get older,

121
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,200
it gets bigger and more complex, more numbers of cells, and actually each of those cells has a

122
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,280
world line, each of the bacteria in me, each of the viruses, so I'm kind of a galaxy of world lines

123
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:41,360
if we're taking my components. Okay, so why am I saying all this? Because the spider is insanely

124
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:56,960
brilliant. What the spider does with its own body, with no, no, with no artificial technology,

125
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:06,800
the spider extends its world line so that in time space the world line of the spider is always

126
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:20,880
extended by any web it is presently occupying or connected to, and that means that the world line

127
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:31,680
the world line of a spider has a secondary element, the web, and the web is literally

128
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:41,280
at least where the web is not. Spiders do all kinds of things with webs, they don't just make

129
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,040
they don't just make the webs the capture webs, they also make various kinds of travel webs,

130
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:59,920
and they probably make and discard webs as they're attempting to forge a capture web.

131
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,640
All right, so

132
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,560
the world line of a spider

133
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,600
has two components at minimum,

134
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,960
the spider and the web. Now notice that what the web does is it literally filters time space

135
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,800
to capture the world lines of other insects

136
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,400
which it then consumes.

137
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,920
It probably doesn't consume all of the insects that intersect with its web,

138
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:13,520
but the spider has two world lines, the spider-shaped one extended by the web-shaped one.

139
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,440
And that's pretty astonishing.

140
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,680
Okay, so here comes the more complicated thing.

141
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,520
The spider web

142
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:46,320
is an object with an organismal origin.

143
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,040
There's no chance you will encounter one

144
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:07,120
that has neither an organismal origin nor a mechanical origin.

145
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,040
And a mechanical origin in the way that I'm going to use this word

146
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,720
has an organismal origin because it means something built robots to build spider webs.

147
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,880
Now I differ with many scientists,

148
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,160
particularly Lex Fridman,

149
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,880
in that

150
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,080
I have a limited definition of the word machine.

151
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:13,120
And because I haven't had to refine it in careful argument, it's probably fairly clumsy.

152
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,360
But it goes something like

153
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,160
a non-organic tool or device forged by humans.

154
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:41,280
Many scientists, particularly physicists and neuroscientists,

155
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
I think they're making a monumental category error

156
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,160
when they claim

157
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,560
that organisms and biologies are machines, that neurons are machines.

158
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Now I understand something of how they come to that,

159
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:15,680
but the humans have a problem in which we transfer, we, devastatingly ignorantly,

160
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,480
we transfer metaphors from technology back onto organisms.

161
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:32,560
Thus we say, for example, your heart is a pump, your lungs are bellows.

162
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,160
Both of these things are impossible, formally impossible.

163
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,200
You will not have ideas without your heart, right?

164
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,360
There will be no arguments, no science, no religion, no nothing.

165
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,360
There is no pump that produces such effects in time space.

166
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:59,360
There is no pump that causes ideas, although

167
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,960
large language models, some might argue, I think we're getting close, Darren, with LLMs.

168
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,840
But LLMs are built by humans, right?

169
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:28,240
So the humans exist in the causal chain of origination necessary to LLMs.

170
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,160
So LLMs don't just arise out of the nature of time space, you have to have,

171
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,920
apparently, you have to have humans on earth so far as we know.

172
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,080
All right, so

173
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:56,640
when I imagine organisms, when I think of organisms, I think of

174
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:10,320
unimaginable complexity, single cell, to simulate it properly at, say, the level of the atom,

175
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,440
to fully simulate it, would require much more than all the computation humans have ever done,

176
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:27,520
would require something like 400 million years of the fastest computer we have pinned

177
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,400
at its top operating capacity. The Fugaku, I think, is the name of that computer.

178
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,240
And again, I'd like to be corrected if I've got this wrong.

179
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,600
I think accurately simulating the, oh, by the way, that's accurately simulating

180
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:54,960
the activity of a cell over one second. Okay, so you're talking about

181
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,360
truly monumental in actions of intelligence and physical complexity.

182
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,480
And as we attempt to understand how best to simulate a cell,

183
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,720
our knowledge of the cell's complexity is increasing very rapidly. So

184
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,640
the thing that's increasing more rapidly

185
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,800
is the complexity we're facing, not our capacity to simulate it.

186
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,920
So when I think of organisms,

187
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:52,080
I think of living beings, we could call them systems, but I prefer to call them relationships,

188
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,680
or relational hyperstructures or biorelational hyperstructures. And by hyperstructures, I mean

189
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,200
a multi-dimensional structure that entangles and complexifies temporalities,

190
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
not just one temporality, webs of temporality.

191
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,600
So that is nothing like a machine. In fact, that might, if we were going to attempt to

192
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:33,760
define the opposite of a machine, organisms and minds would be likely candidates because

193
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:43,360
organisms, so far as we understand them, contribute to and sustain negentropic

194
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:53,040
relationships on the surface of living planets, whereas machines dump death into that system

195
00:29:53,040 --> 00:30:00,800
in the form of entropy. So machines offload entropy into living systems, living systems

196
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:09,600
levitate, in a sense. If entropy is gravity, organisms are,

197
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,520
can be imagined as anti-gravity.

198
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:26,800
They do something that should be impossible, or that seems impossible at first glance,

199
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,360
and maybe there are biologists who can explain this in such a way as to satisfy

200
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,560
my troubled mind about this matter. Then correct me.

201
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,880
I haven't seen evidence of negentropy in machines,

202
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,920
and on any planet where those begin to show up, where you have an organism complex enough to

203
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:02,640
produce mechanical objects. It looks to me like, unless that organism is vastly more intelligent

204
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,880
than humans, in terms of knowing what not to do with technology, you will get a dead world there

205
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,680
right quick, geologically speaking, a few thousand years at most.

206
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:27,600
So, unlike Lex Fridman and his ilk, who I respect and admire, and I want his voice at the table,

207
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,760
I just don't agree, and I love his podcasts. In fact, the reason I'm making this recording

208
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,640
is due to one of them. It's due to his podcast with Lee Cronin and Sarah Walker.

209
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,480
Who are producing theoretical children if they have not produced physical children.

210
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,960
I can't tell if they're a couple or not, and I haven't done the research to figure it out,

211
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,800
but listening to them part of me is just like, oh please let these two humans

212
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,400
mate and produce offspring. I've rarely felt that, though I did feel it with

213
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:14,080
Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner. They would have produced an offspring capable of just laying

214
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,920
waste to human consciousness with humor. It would have been like the atomic bomb of comedians.

215
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:33,680
So, Lex seems to think that if you get a complex enough machine, it's alive,

216
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:43,760
and if you build a robot, that's your baby. Thus, he projects his own essence into his

217
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:53,520
mechanical creations in a way that he defines as lifelike enough to qualify as life.

218
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:02,640
I think this is a ridiculous misapprehension of the nature of organisms, but again,

219
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm excited. I would love to sit down and talk about this with him. Never happen. I'm a nobody.

220
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:30,000
Lex is famous. All right, so let me explain partly why I don't think machines

221
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:39,760
have the same mode of world line that organisms have.

222
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:52,320
It is that they cannot inherit or participate in directly the world line complexity of origination,

223
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:06,560
relation, heredity, and lineage that the simplest organism has more of than all the numbers you

224
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:14,720
could ever make. The simplest organism has an infinite historical relational web

225
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:26,160
of trillions of endless amounts of numbers of transformations and relationships per

226
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,680
instant, whatever interval you want, billionth of a second.

227
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:46,080
And so, in a sense, the organism's historical body is transcendentally vast and intimate,

228
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:59,040
and the transactions that the organism, that that body has participated in,

229
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,000
are monumentally vast and supportive generally of nearly all other organisms.

230
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:33,200
Machines, on the other hand, by existing end the world lines of organisms.

231
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,520
Many, many organisms must die to support the existence of any machine, at least around here.

232
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,120
And so machines look like, to me,

233
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:58,560
a sort of deadly plague for organisms, generally speaking. They look like the opposite of life.

234
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,960
They put an end to organismal lineages. Any automobile is a perfect example of this

235
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,640
that will kill nearly everything it touches, and many things it never touches. In the past,

236
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,240
and in the future. How does it kill things in the past by ending the lineages of living beings

237
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:25,520
today? That, effectively, can be understood to travel back in time and destroy the entire lineage

238
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:33,040
of relationships that produce and exist as, say, a duck run over by a car.

239
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,120
All right, so where am I going here?

240
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Now, Lex seems to believe that what I will call simulacra are

241
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:15,680
as vital, as potent, as alive as organisms, particularly as we approach the churning limit

242
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,480
of our incapacity to distinguish them.

243
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:33,040
So, if I simulate a philodendron, and you can't tell the difference between that philodendron

244
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,680
and an actual philodendron, a living one, it inherits the property alive.

245
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:53,280
This is the argument for touring tests in artificial cognitive systems,

246
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:01,760
and I never bought it. I'm sure that Lex could table some very fierce objections to my objections.

247
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,320
I don't know what they are yet.

248
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:15,680
It has never seemed to me that if you can't tell the difference, they're the same thing. Sure,

249
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,680
they're the same thing in terms of the lexical category we are likely to use to refer to them,

250
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:32,960
and yes, if I'm looking at the plants I am walking past, and 87% of them are simulations,

251
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:40,240
and I am unaware of that, then they will seem to me to be plants, but if I discover,

252
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,080
okay, then it comes down to

253
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,280
is there any way to determine the distinction? Is there any way to notice the distinction,

254
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,040
to experimentally observe the distinction between a simulation and an organism?

255
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,240
And I will argue that I don't believe it's possible to produce simulations as complex as organisms

256
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,040
at all. There may be exceptions to this, and I'm open to changing my mind.

257
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:25,120
But to me, and one of the things I like about the topic that I'm going to start to blather on about

258
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:35,440
here is that it looks like we may have found a way to measure,

259
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:51,760
to reliably determine the developmental complexity of anything we may observe or interact with.

260
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:05,440
And this is an incredible thing. Now, it may turn out, this is early days for this theory,

261
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,320
it may turn out that the theory is falsifiable, or it may turn out that the theory becomes falsified,

262
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:20,960
is what I meant. It's incredibly bold, but of course, like any good scientist,

263
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,480
Lee Cronin and his teams, and Sarah Walker, and so forth,

264
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,760
who I imagine to be among the parents of assembly theory,

265
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,760
like any good scientist, if they're wrong,

266
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:51,840
and the theory is formally falsified somehow, we'll get smarter. So,

267
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,720
build the boat, float the boat, if it sinks, okay, we'll make better boats thereafter,

268
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,160
because of what we learned from this one that sank. But

269
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,960
the arguments and data, as I understand, the arguments and the arrangement,

270
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:16,880
arrangements of data that comprise assembly theory presently look

271
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:25,920
provocatively convincing. And this is where I'm going to get into trouble, and being naive and stupid,

272
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,760
because I've only just, I've only accidentally stumbled onto this topic

273
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,600
over the past few weeks. I've listened to a couple of long interviews with Lee Cronin.

274
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:53,200
I'm not mathematically sophisticated enough to understand it the way a scientist understands it.

275
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,720
I believe their paper on this theory

276
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:12,240
was published against all odds, right? I think it was published in nature.

277
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:24,160
And I heard the story of its publication, and I work in that field. I work in the field of

278
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,800
editing biomedical manuscripts for publication in what are referred to as high impact journals,

279
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:48,080
such as Nature Cell, so forth. So, let me see if I can encapsulate, meaningfully,

280
00:42:49,040 --> 00:43:05,760
what I imagine to be the core positions of assembly theory is something like this.

281
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:22,960
Instead of proposing a new physics, assembly theory originating,

282
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:38,080
Lee Cronin, I believe is a chemist, assembly theory posits a new definition of objects.

283
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:48,480
And so, instead of positing that point particles, electrons, photons, etc., are fundamental,

284
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,960
it posits that objects are fundamental and provides a definition of objects.

285
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,000
By the way, I'm not reading this. I should be.

286
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:11,440
It provides a definition of objects based on their, on decomposing them and determining

287
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:20,960
the index of complexity required to produce the objects.

288
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:33,680
And this produces models such as causal graphs

289
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:43,680
that are empirical measurements of

290
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:53,760
historically, of timelines, of world lines, of objects,

291
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,400
that are determinative

292
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,040
and produce a metric for the complexity of any given object, say a molecule,

293
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,520
or an organism, or a machine.

294
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:25,200
And this discovery is absolutely mind-blowing.

295
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:39,120
The number of technologies and ways of knowing that are likely to emerge

296
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:50,720
quickly, if this theory is further validated, obviously it's fairly well validated to appear in nature,

297
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,720
are staggering.

298
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,640
But the thing that I find particularly surprising about it is that it will give us

299
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:22,080
an empirical measure of various features of organisms

300
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,240
that I argue it will give me a way to prove that machines can't participate.

301
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,200
In

302
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,840
how to put it.

303
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,080
It is as if there is a living water inside the organisms that is made of their origin

304
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:00,880
and lineage relationships that is carried forward in time and comprises a dimension of its own.

305
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,080
Not only do machines not participate in that specific dimension, they tend to tear it apart

306
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,800
and replace it with something that's dead inside, in my view.

307
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,280
And, you know, am I an ideologue about this?

308
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,120
Partly.

309
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,760
I certainly want to learn and be convinced otherwise, if

310
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,800
if that's the direction toward greater insight and intelligence.

311
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,760
I fiercely doubt it.

312
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,160
I am a biofile, not a technophile.

313
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,320
If you wanted to rip the entire history of life on earth to shreds,

314
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,960
all you have to do is give humans machines.

315
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,960
They don't have societies intelligent enough to survive that.

316
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,200
I would liken it to

317
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:23,760
finding a, okay this is a very abstract analogy, but imagine I have a two and a half year old male infant.

318
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,880
I abuse it in a variety of ways.

319
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,840
This is no, not suggesting we abuse infants here,

320
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,800
but I've used the infant in a variety of ways that make it very angry.

321
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,400
Stop feeding it, give it no attention, yell at it, whatever.

322
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,840
And then once it's thoroughly spun up,

323
00:48:51,920 --> 00:49:01,280
I give it a thermos with no lid, and the thermos contains, I don't know,

324
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,160
molten steel, but it's so well insulated you can't tell it's hot on the outside.

325
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,240
And then I just give the infant the thermos and leave.

326
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,280
What is going to happen is going to be really bad for that infant.

327
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:25,840
And similarly, giving humans any kind of technology, this goes to my argument that

328
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,360
actually ethical scientists would nearly never publish.

329
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,400
Well that's not going to help the worm.

330
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm not sure what to do about that poor creature.

331
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:55,600
Yeah, actually ethical scientists would nearly never publish because

332
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:04,400
there are no intelligent systems of humans competitive enough

333
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:11,760
to prevail against the lethally oriented organizations of humans

334
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:21,680
that will certainly end life on earth or, at the very least, produce an extinction event

335
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,080
of staggering scope. Some will argue, yes, extinction events are good.

336
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:36,640
By extinguishing vast rays of organisms previously, we ourselves arose.

337
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,800
Okay, great, but I'm actually concerned about the agently conserved ecologies.

338
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,840
Those things are rare.

339
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:54,080
And there's also a timeline. Just like a human being, a planet has a lifespan,

340
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:01,360
and as it gets nearer to the probable end of its lifespan,

341
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,560
the sudden effusive generation of new forms becomes less likely,

342
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,120
and the ability to sustain those forms over time becomes less likely.

343
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,960
In a sense, it looks to me like the earth is bio-evolutionarily old enough

344
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,760
that it has cancer, and the cancer on the earth is the appearance of machines.

345
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:35,920
Right, these are tumors. They are highly structured modes of time-space artificially

346
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,040
produced that kill everything so that they can be sustained and reproduced.

347
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,680
There's something similar in human cognition that I call thrips.

348
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,840
So I would argue that human cognition has become elderly in the sense that

349
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,320
it's no longer producing.

350
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:10,480
It produces far more artifacted structure than it does useful intelligent novelty

351
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,840
and relational novelty.

352
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:23,280
Now, assembly theory gives us a variety of metrics and perspectives

353
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,440
that would allow us to determine, and by the way, Cronin himself says,

354
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,080
I certainly am suffering from the hammer-nail problem.

355
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,040
Got a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

356
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,760
Vis-a-vis assembly theory.

357
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:54,400
And naturally so, because I've never seen a model that could give us the ability

358
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:10,800
to empirically determine so many, like literally to observe that, which was previously unobservable.

359
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,680
It's almost like assembly theory is a kind of a cognitive lamp that sheds light

360
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:25,840
on features of the universe that we have previously understood to exist,

361
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:32,880
but had no way to formalize. That's incredible.

362
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:47,120
So I'm going to try to make a future recording about this in which I am vastly more capable

363
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,400
of reiterating some of the root concepts

364
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,400
associated with assembly theory. And I have to say that

365
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:12,880
I've been a, what, a scientophile. I've loved science since childhood because

366
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,800
it looked like one of the ways of knowing

367
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,360
that the humans propagate that is relatively likely to produce

368
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,840
intelligent understanding, behavior, societies, and so forth. Turns out, not the case.

369
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,960
At least not in my lifetime. Turns out, science is the way of knowing most likely to produce

370
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:49,200
absolute devastation on earth. And by absolute, I mean the capacity to snuff the biosphere,

371
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,200
shut it off like a fucking light switch. And everyone says, oh, there's no way to do that.

372
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:05,680
They're wrong. I could show them five ways to do it now. Once you have a certain array of technologies,

373
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:19,120
you will have the capacity to combine them in relatively accessible to single humans or

374
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,720
small group ways. This is what Daniel Schmockenberger is on about with,

375
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:33,840
let's call it, multi-polar threats. He's got some other nomenclature that's also very useful,

376
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:44,480
race to the bottom. So yeah, life on, you know, the earth is very similar to a cell

377
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:55,040
in certain respects. And its robust resilience is absolutely dependent on

378
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:06,160
the continuation of the organs that produce the possibility of homeostasis

379
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:14,080
in the atmosphere and environment. Much like a cell, if you lies the membrane,

380
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:20,560
you penetrate the membrane of the cell in the right kind of way, the membrane collapses,

381
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:28,320
that planet will die. You'll end up with something not dissimilar to Mars. Now, some will argue that

382
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,600
the continuous existence of liquid water on the surface

383
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:47,760
is sufficient to guarantee the continuance of organismal complexification on earth.

384
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:48,960
Could be right.

385
00:56:53,120 --> 00:57:00,240
But for myself, I'm bonded with the anciently conserved ecologies in my heart, mind, and spirit.

386
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,880
Science turns out to be the way of knowing that will allow humans to dispose of those,

387
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:15,440
and in a sense causes them to dispose of them by continuously producing new technologies

388
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,560
that, in factively,

389
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:38,640
in other words, the continuously penetrate new dimensions of the organs of the biosphere

390
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,440
and offload entropy into them.

391
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:49,280
This doesn't mean I'm anti-science.

392
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,760
Science is one of the most reliable ways of knowing that we have.

393
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,960
However, science is also heavily compromised

394
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:14,640
by malignant imperatives

395
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:29,200
that propagate like a kind of mold in human culture.

396
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,080
And then those imperatives capture ways of knowing

397
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,600
and weaponize them for the sake of profit, power, or

398
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:53,840
decimation, obliterating things, crushing the opponent zero-sum games.

399
00:58:53,920 --> 00:59:03,600
So science is still half noble, or a tenth noble,

400
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:13,600
but most of what science will actually produce is likely to further human

401
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:21,440
technological development, which looks to me lethal to both humans and the history and future

402
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,840
of life on earth. And whether or not it completely obliterates life on earth

403
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:35,760
sort of doesn't matter, right? If I murder your entire family and one of your children

404
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,160
manages somehow to survive,

405
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:53,920
this doesn't validate my murder or the murder of the entire family.

406
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,880
I guess there was some Russian royal family that was essentially

407
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,240
captured up, taken somewhere and just executed. I can't remember who the Romanovs may be.

408
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:12,160
And the fact that some janitor

409
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:23,840
survived in no way reduces the atrocity index of the slaughter of the family

410
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:29,040
and their children and everybody. And I think it's funny that we, it's natural,

411
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,280
but it's also peculiar that we pretend that, well, it's relatively okay to kill the adults.

412
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,840
They, they had some life, just don't kill the children and keep some women around.

413
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:46,640
That's in, you know, that kind of moral relativism doesn't fly well with me. I think all of the

414
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:56,320
beings, all of the adults, arch still children too. There's very few, if any,

415
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:12,240
statuses that ameliorate the moral or ethical imperatives that orbit do not kill

416
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,840
and especially do not murder, do not slaughter.

417
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
So back to assembly theory.

418
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:37,360
So there are two particular forms of data that, and by the way, I deeply encourage you to listen

419
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:47,600
to Lee Cronin describing the origins and publication of the assembly theory paper.

420
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,280
I may be able to produce a link in the description later.

421
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:02,560
But the two primary forms of data that emerge that I, that I understand to some degree at this point

422
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:12,560
are what's called the assembly index, which is a measure of the necessary extant complexity

423
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:22,560
required for an object to become possible in the universe. Now that, by the way, Cronin says that

424
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:34,560
time turns out to be fundamental to anything relating to analyzing objects. And I agree with him

425
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:42,560
that at least through the lens of assembly theory and a number of lenses familiar and preferable to me,

426
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:48,560
time is something far different from tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.

427
01:02:52,800 --> 01:03:04,160
In fact, organisms and their relationships create modes of time. I refer to these as

428
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:10,480
temporal hyper, biorelational hyper structures or biotemporal hyper structures. And when idiots,

429
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:21,440
or when people make idiotic statements, and I've heard both Neil deGrasse Tyson

430
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:30,960
and Sabine Hossenfelder, I'm not sure if I got her last name right,

431
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:39,040
make bold and idiotic claims such as,

432
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:48,640
there's no reason for aliens to travel, you know, millions of light years, thousands of light years

433
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:58,080
to visit the earth because humans are boring. That is the epitome,

434
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:08,320
hi, nice to see you. That is the epitome of egoic anthropocentric stupidity,

435
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:12,480
in my view. And maybe they're stirring the pot, right? Maybe they're trying to,

436
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:19,040
they're just trying to produce trigger bait. But the earth

437
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:30,800
is a vast library of biorelational hyper structures. These must be incredibly rare

438
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:46,960
in time space by volume, even if they are common in number, right? Even if there are billions

439
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:55,760
of living worlds as complex as ours, as stable as ours, stable enough to produce hands,

440
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:02,640
eyes, wings, tentacles, minds, so forth, embodied minds.

441
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:14,960
Those things are not merely interesting. They are producing modes of time space that if you,

442
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,480
it's like looking for diamonds or looking for gold, right? Walk all over the place,

443
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,720
you'll find nearly no gold. In the entire history of me walking around on the earth,

444
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:37,760
the only diamonds I've seen are on women's fingers, generally, or men's. Or unfortunately,

445
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:43,200
in the latter part of my life, inside people's teeth, come on people. Are you guys nuts?

446
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:55,760
Apparently. So yeah, living worlds produce forms of biotemporal complexity

447
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:04,160
that are unimaginably uncommon in time space, even if there are lots of them. And each one of them

448
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:14,800
will have incredibly unique features. So for shame, Tyson, you are acting the public idiot here

449
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:24,880
in an anthropocentric and egoic way that is truly embarrassing, not just to you, but to the idea

450
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:33,440
that you're a scientist. And similarly, Sabine, what the hell are you thinking? You think the humans

451
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,920
are the only reason to visit earth? I mean, as a human, are you only interested in the humans?

452
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:47,920
The fuck are you thinking? And again, maybe these people are just trying to produce trigger bait.

453
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,960
They certainly succeeded in my case. Because honestly,

454
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:59,600
if I was capable of publicly slapping them in the face for such a comment,

455
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:05,840
I might be willing to descend to that.

456
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:17,680
Yeah, I find that just ridiculous. And it does stir me up if I'm willing to be stirred up that way.

457
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:24,640
So the two concepts in assembly theory are the assembly index of an object,

458
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:38,400
which is an empirical measure of, it's like a graph, I guess, or there's actually a second concept,

459
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:46,240
which is the causal graph. And I think I sort of understand the assembly index

460
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:59,440
as a measure of the complexity necessary in the temporal historical context of the universe

461
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:15,680
to produce for an object to be constructed somehow. And then the causal graph is a bit more obscure

462
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,920
Let me see if I can find the definition for that.

463
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,480
I suppose the causal graph is a way of encoding

464
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:41,360
propositions about the paths of origination of an object. Now again, assembly theory is very new.

465
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:49,280
A lot of scientists are quite upset about its existence.

466
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:05,200
I mean, there's a vast population of haters already for this theory, because it,

467
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:12,240
in some senses, if properly validated,

468
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:25,600
it might comprise a super science, something that steals the foundations

469
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:33,600
from many other branches of research. It just captures those foundations.

470
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:42,240
And it's very early days. There remains a great deal of work to do.

471
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,840
However, one problem with

472
01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:02,240
sir, your dog, it's having trouble. It has, yeah, there you go.

473
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,480
Yeah, it was just walking funny because it was trying to

474
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:24,000
So whether or not assembly theory is validated, it's already producing

475
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:28,800
uncommonly useful results.

476
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,720
And in listening to cronin,

477
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:51,040
I've spent some time listening to intelligent humans, and particularly intelligent males.

478
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,080
I guess just because the media puts more of them in front of me, generally speaking.

479
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:10,560
However, Sarah Walker is a wonderful example of an absolutely brilliant intellectual female.

480
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,920
I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to use explicit gender terms in 2024.

481
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:24,240
I may, I may end up canceled or beheaded for having done so.

482
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:35,120
But yeah, Lee is one of the most intelligent minds I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.

483
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,200
This doesn't mean that I agree with everything he says or believes.

484
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:44,160
And in fact, one of the reasons I find him intelligent is you will very commonly hear him say,

485
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:51,040
I've just changed my mind about this. This is something I've nearly never heard out of the

486
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:59,920
mouths of anyone. And even in the interview with Lex Fridman, where he and Sarah Walker,

487
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,360
you know, the interview is ostensibly about aliens. There's, I don't know,

488
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,640
like eight minutes of talk about aliens in the interview, and it's four hours long,

489
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:19,120
which is awesome. As most of you know, I'm down with long form. Let's do it long form, you know.

490
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:26,480
Let's have the foreplay for hours, and then, you know, all the other stuff, and then the meal,

491
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:33,760
and then the bath, and then, you know, the dreaming, and then, yeah, everything. Let's have it all.

492
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:42,800
Of course, I'm not getting any of that stuff. That's all pure fantasy at this,

493
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:51,520
in my present circumstances. And has long been that way. Maybe that's why I'm,

494
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,360
maybe that's why I have changed my perspective. But my point was just that,

495
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:06,480
yeah, I can see if you can give Lee an argument that allows him to visualize, particularly

496
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:14,480
to visualize experiments that can be done to determine, qualitatively, quantitatively,

497
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:27,600
empirically, ideologically, the validity of an argument, or the power of an argument,

498
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:34,800
the conclusiveness of an argument. He will immediately change his mind if he can see

499
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:42,080
and understand the structure. And I've rarely seen this quality. I'm not sure I have it.

500
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:53,120
I am very, I'm very likely to be committed to my pet theories. And I encounter so few

501
01:13:54,240 --> 01:14:05,760
intelligent people to explore with that it's uncommon for me to

502
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:16,400
be presented with something I find.

503
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:38,400
Wow, coughing child, death knell. The child will probably survive.

504
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,960
But who else will?

505
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:54,640
Yeah, I just don't, I don't encounter anyone intelligent enough, or motivated to push against

506
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:04,400
commonly. There are, there are a few such people in my circle.

507
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,400
Hmm.

508
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:24,720
The most profound tree that I know is in this little part of the garden.

509
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,920
I'm going to pause for a moment. I hope I will return.

510
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:48,640
So I've noticed that some one, I can't recall the guy's name, just saw it briefly,

511
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:59,760
has published an essay on medium called The Eight Fallacies of Assembly Theory.

512
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,840
Definitely people are going to be highly motivated to attack this thing,

513
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:09,360
which is probably good. I mean, I think Cronin himself and Sarah Walker would,

514
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:20,320
and they have other associates, Sharma at all. You can see their team on the primary paper.

515
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:37,600
So the thing is going to undergo a radical evolutionary process by furious objection.

516
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:43,920
People are going to be very highly motivated to attack this thing, primarily because

517
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:52,880
if it turns out to be valid or useful, which it seems extremely likely

518
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,920
to be profoundly useful in the sense that

519
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:10,240
it gives us ways to detect the existence of stuff that we've never been able to see before, like

520
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,760
it's not merely a new language.

521
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:29,520
It's a new method of considering the nature of identity, what things are.

522
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,920
And this is incredibly provocative and profound.

523
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:51,920
I mean, literally my mind is so blown by what I've heard from Cronin

524
01:17:51,920 --> 01:18:02,320
that I mean, one analogy would be

525
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:10,720
if

526
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:22,720
so in some ways, as someone who has reason to suspect that I've had

527
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:33,040
long-term contact over some interval of my life with a non-human intelligence of extremely exotic

528
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:39,840
and profound nature and ability. It's not just similar to someone who says,

529
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:52,080
you know, not only did one day out in the field at night, my family and I encountered

530
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,160
what appeared to us to be a vehicle from time space.

531
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:06,000
But they took me with them in

532
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:17,440
their vehicle and they taught me some of their ways of knowing

533
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:23,360
right over many months and showed me

534
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:34,400
how they perceive the universe, organisms, time space, all these things. So in a sense,

535
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,120
compared to the minds of common others around me,

536
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:53,120
my mind is a bit like a UFO landing in their backyard

537
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,800
because I'm attempting to convey some of the things that I, some of the perspectives and

538
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:07,040
orientations that I have acquired over my lifetime, but particularly during my contact

539
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:12,880
experience. And there's lots of different ways to conceive of that experience other than

540
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:18,160
the contact with a non-human intelligence, though I would argue that most of what's

541
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:24,240
going on is precisely that because nature is a non-human intelligence of unimaginable sophistication.

542
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:32,640
You know, a library of such intelligences that upscale form a unity. And by the way,

543
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:36,320
it looks like a assembly theory might allow,

544
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,760
might endow the possibility of proving empirically

545
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:56,080
that the earth and the biosphere comprise a unity, an accessible to humans' unity.

546
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:06,240
And many other things that are important, philosophically, ethically, morally,

547
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:15,520
and intellectually to me, perhaps even spiritually. I will admit that I associate my

548
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:21,280
biofilia, my adoration of living beings and their relationships and origins,

549
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:28,320
that does feel to me like a spiritual faculty,

550
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:41,120
or an expression of my soul, of the nature of my soul, which I imagine is a much more

551
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:48,560
complex entity than is commonly supposed. Yeah, that thing's got a lot of different

552
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:54,320
features depending on how and why we may be referring to it in language or making models

553
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:02,640
in language concepts and so on. I'm going to pause for a bit because I'm coming to a place

554
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:11,520
of a lot of noise. With luck, I will return shortly. So I hope in the future to be able to produce

555
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,800
a concise

556
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,440
description of assembly theory

557
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,280
and its primary propositions.

558
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:41,280
But it looks like we may get a grasp on an entirely new form of knowledge

559
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:58,240
with the power to produce otherwise impossible insights about a broad array of features of

560
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:06,720
biology and particularly some of the most confusing problems

561
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,400
in science is concerned with origin of life.

562
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:24,720
I have recently been listening to some debates on this topic and they are profoundly contentious

563
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,040
primarily because

564
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,120
the common models

565
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,720
in play in biology are ridiculous

566
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:46,160
and avoid nearly all of the fundamental questions necessary

567
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:52,240
to produce reasonable scientific arguments.

568
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,080
So assembly theory may give us

569
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:13,040
both a foundation for reasonable arguments and a path to evaluate them in the laboratory.

570
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:13,760
Right?

571
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:24,720
Cronin has a variety of radical and I think trustworthy ideas

572
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,040
about what we might do

573
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:37,280
to

574
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:48,160
produce both the precursors and perhaps actual life in the lab.

575
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:58,560
Again for my view, Lee if he's correct and his team and Sarah and her team

576
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:06,880
or their teams are giving the humans again something very likely to produce

577
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,920
incredibly lethal technologies.

578
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,000
Scientists often

579
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:23,440
inhabit the role of the villain in Frederick Brown's story The Weapon

580
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:36,480
in which a journalist comes to visit a scientist who is about to give the humans

581
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:48,320
something similarly deadly to nuclear weapons. The journalist argues against this.

582
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:59,520
The scientist just says, you know, it's not my job to determine whether or not something

583
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:05,520
should be done. My job is to do what can be done. I can do this. I'm going to do it.

584
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:15,120
It turns out that the scientist has a developmentally

585
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,840
inhibited child.

586
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,840
I'm not sure what the right nomenclature for that is these days.

587
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:42,400
A child who is 12 that has the mental age of that might be associated with a three-year-old

588
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:48,320
and the journalist manages to give the child a loaded gun

589
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:57,360
surreptitiously which the scientist later finds him with in his bed.

590
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:11,600
It's a powerful refutation of the argument. We should do what we can. Whatever can be done

591
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:13,680
should be done.

592
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,320
No, absolutely it should not be done. There are all kinds of things we can't do that we must

593
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:30,240
never do. In fact, it turns out that much of what is productive and

594
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:40,720
supportive and crucial to what I mean when I use the word intelligence,

595
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:51,200
much of that is prohibitive. It's what must not be done for it to continue to be possible

596
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:53,920
for us to be intelligent

597
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:04,320
or to exist at all. Obviously, if you're not existing, you can't be intelligent anymore.

598
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:17,680
I hope to return with a more educated perspective on assembly theory, but I want to encourage my

599
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:31,840
listeners to explore it because honestly, it looks like a discovery with the potential

600
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:41,840
to have more impact than relativity did or at least a discovery of a similar degree of impact.

601
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:53,600
If it isn't defeated, it will change the face of science as far as I can see

602
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,560
from my current understandings of it.

603
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:07,120
So for example, there's a degree of demonstrable complexity in a system

604
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:24,800
that is demonstrative of the activity, interference, or origination by an intelligent being or system.

605
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:28,640
In a sense,

606
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:36,800
here we might find proof of God, but we might also be able to just look

607
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:53,120
at nearly anything in the universe and look, God is in quotes. I think it's my perspective that

608
01:29:53,680 --> 01:30:03,200
time space itself is, while not being fundamental, something productive of time space,

609
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:14,240
it is the result of a transcendent,

610
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:25,360
a layered array of transcendences in nature, in existence.

611
01:30:44,240 --> 01:31:02,240
So assembly theory may give us the ability to empirically determine

612
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:10,720
whether it is possible

613
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:19,760
for most of what exists or any specific element

614
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:36,320
to have originated without the interference or creative engagement

615
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,200
of some intelligence or transcendence.

616
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:48,400
Now I may be misunderstanding that, but from what I can tell from what I heard,

617
01:31:49,360 --> 01:32:01,280
there's a specific sort of cutoff point in the assembly index or the causal graph of an object

618
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:08,400
that is determinate, empirically determinate of whether or not it could

619
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:15,760
have come into existence without being purposefully or

620
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:32,720
or purposefully or tangentially resulting from purposeful activity.

621
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:40,880
And there may be some overlap here with other ideas. For example,

622
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:50,720
Cronin sneers at Scheldrake's morphogenesis, and yet there seems to be some

623
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:59,840
conceptual overlap. It may be very minimal, but there seems to be some conceptual overlap

624
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:05,120
between assembly theory and Scheldrake's concepts to me.

625
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:15,520
Because it may well turn out, for example, that in a given possibility space,

626
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:26,880
once you assemble the first salt crystal locally, it now becomes easy to, in Cronin's language,

627
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:38,720
teleport the properties to other objects. And that resembles the results of

628
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,040
Scheldrake's theory of morphogenesis.

629
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:49,360
So there's much more to learn here. I'm going to be spending some time digesting

630
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:56,400
more about assembly theory, and I encourage those of you who are interested to explore it.

631
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:01,840
It looks either it's going to get defeated completely, in which case it will produce no

632
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:08,720
useful results, which seems impossible to me, by the way, or it will get partially defeated in that

633
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:25,760
it is not, its scope will undergo radical limitation, or we have a new way of understanding

634
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:35,200
objects, identity, interactions, and historical development of such matters.

635
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:42,160
And it looks pretty likely that that's what's actually going to happen so far. So

636
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:50,000
thank you all for joining me. I look forward to learning and growing and seeing better together.

637
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:56,000
Again, sometime in the very near future, may your ways and lives be beautiful,

638
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:05,040
blessed, insightful, playful, and joyful. Bye-bye for now.
