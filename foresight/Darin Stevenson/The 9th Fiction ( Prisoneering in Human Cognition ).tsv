0	6000	Hello everybody. Welcome.
10000	24000	Those of you who are familiar with my work know that I'm not really busy or interested in blowing my own horn and etc.
24000	40000	But what I hope that you'll find here on my channel are some living mirrors, some doorways to the origins of our nature, intelligence, and potential
40000	69000	that will unlock some cages that we've all been stuck in, that our ancestors were trapped in, that every human being that ever drew breath hoped to find a key to a vector that would jailbreak
70000	77000	the bullshit systems that are eating our planet history and future.
77000	88000	And if that's part of your interest, well strap in because we're going to go to the sky together right now.
88000	91000	Yeah, guys got it right.
91000	109000	We are trained to make a variety of fundamental mistakes and from childhood onward, by our parents and peers, by the people who are supposed to be educating us,
109000	129000	by the people who are wearing the costumes of our liberators, of messiahs, of noble warriors, of extreme altruists.
129000	133000	They are chaining our feet to the floor.
133000	145000	They are cutting off our wings and stapling them to the fucking chalkboards in the one place that we are supposed to be able to acquire the keys.
145000	147000	Schools.
147000	149000	Universities.
149000	151000	What the hell is meant by university?
151000	157000	It literally is supposed to be the city of the universe.
157000	180000	The place where all of the intelligences in time space come together to sing and speak and show and remind us to resurrect our divine memories of our origins, natures and potentials.
180000	184000	And what do we get instead, prison bars?
184000	198000	We are trained to reiterate in thought, expectation, speculation and evaluation a variety of catastrophic errors.
198000	210000	But if you make any one of them, you'll build bars every time you make a move and if you make three, you will be a slave.
210000	215000	So I want to talk about some of these errors.
215000	218000	It's a little windy here today.
218000	220000	I've got my mic buffer on.
220000	225000	We should be in good shape.
225000	236000	I guess we'll find out on the far side of this arc.
236000	252000	So one of the most profound of these errors is that you're merely human.
252000	254000	Don't expect too much of me.
254000	257000	I'm only human after all.
257000	268000	Well, maybe really clear about what being human actually looks like.
268000	297000	If you took the magical, supernormal powers of every physicalized intelligence on Earth, the octopus, the whale, the dolphin, the bat, the praying mantis, the crane, the rattlesnake, the electric eel, the turtle, the crocodile, the mouse, the mole, the eagle, the hawk, the kestrel.
298000	326000	If you unified all those beings, all of the beings, the forests, the coral reefs, the nudibranchs, the plankton, if you unified all the intelligences and forms and abilities of those beings, and then you mated that with the angels, the devas, the jinn, the daimons, the gods.
327000	330000	That's what you were born as.
330000	333000	There's nothing mere about your humanity.
333000	355000	There never was, there never will be, except that you are convinced of your fundamental impoverishment according to principles that have nothing to do with who and what and how you came to be incarnate here on Earth.
355000	373000	So one of the first mistakes is that you're only human, and if you don't believe me, watch the hundreds of thousands, the millions of people who escape that bond and directly show you the impossible.
373000	402000	The five-year-old 280 note per minute shredding guitar player from Korea, the ballerinas, the runners, swimmers, the athletes, the dancers, the singers, the occasional scientists, the mathematicians.
404000	410000	The seers, the healers, the real ones, not the mimics.
413000	430000	Watch the dogs and the cats, the dragonflies, because they'll give you hints at the vast terrain of the more than merely human you came here to be and become.
431000	444000	That little seemingly weak, seemingly delicate body you have is capable of things as yet unimagined by human beings, let alone achieved.
444000	458000	And that will always be the case because the actual scope of our potential nature origin and the urgent imperatives we bring to human birth is infinite, is a layered array of infinities.
458000	475000	And when you see someone doing something that appears superhuman, what you're seeing is merely a hint at that depth, a hint to imagine what an actual statement would look like is nearly impossible for us.
476000	491000	An actual expression of that infinite potential could move the planet in a moment, could move human history in an instant. That's your potential.
492000	496000	However divorced we may feel or think ourselves to be from it.
496000	512000	So the first common thing we're taught is a series of limitations that are cognitive, intellectual, spiritual, physical, ideological and relational, that have nothing to do with our nature.
512000	526000	They have to do with an agenda, a program, a process, an array of protocols that have long dominated human culture and experience, and particularly human collectivity.
527000	550000	These protocols render us into helpless slaves, eager for any distraction from the agonies we feel at the impoverishments we cannot understand the origins or the opposites of, and those opposites are our birthrights.
551000	561000	They are not our birthrights in the sense that someone's supposed to defend you having them, although that would be fabulous.
561000	581000	Now there's something very different. They are the innate necessities of our human nature and our more than human nature, potential, urgency, ache, desire.
582000	598000	And we get sold counterfeits, sex, drugs, rock and roll, violence, commerce, commodification, objectification, representations, video games.
598000	624000	We get sold video games, and you don't need computers to run these. They were running them on humans back when the conquistadors ripped and shredded the American continent, the South American continent, and later the colonizing forces of Europe landed here in obliterated wholesale.
628000	634000	The native indigenous populations here.
634000	649000	Those conquistadors were infected with the disease before they brought it here and reinstanced it, and we are subject to those same fucking deletions and impoverishments here today.
650000	669000	We are a self-colonizing nightmare of new ways to colonize the population per second and to stack up representations of value in banks, representations of power in corporations and governments in the military industrial complex.
670000	680000	We frack the souls of our children to build monuments to despair.
681000	685000	These we worship.
685000	690000	I don't know who we is.
690000	703000	Perhaps the we I mean here is the absentee we of our possible intentional collectivity.
703000	715000	The absence that appears as a presence, which is one of the most devastating ploys, and one of the most terrifying features of our human experience and lives.
715000	721000	It's literally what we see in the horror films.
721000	726000	We see absences appearing as presences.
726000	731000	This is what drives our cultures.
731000	733000	We could call them that and we shouldn't.
733000	736000	We should just call them diseases.
736000	745000	The military industrial complex, our political systems, our legal systems, and our corporations.
745000	748000	So this is one of the first lies that you are merely human.
748000	758000	The second lie that you're taught is a lie of transference.
758000	777000	And let me frame this lethal fiction so that you can recognize it in your own consciousness, behavior, and the ideation and desperation of your fellow humans all around you.
777000	790000	There's a comforting continuity to what we call physical reality, which I'm going to suppose is about one percent of what's actually going on.
790000	795000	And it's the fact that your shoes will probably be where you left them last night.
795000	799000	The silverware doesn't rearrange itself in the drawer.
799000	804000	The ice cubes are still frozen when you take them out of the refrigerator.
804000	810000	The money in the bank mostly stays there unless stolen.
810000	823000	That tree you saw on your walking route yesterday is there again today unless some idiotic arborist in a desperate effort to justify their pay
823000	833000	ripped it from the earth and chopped it up into, well, you know, sawdust or...
834000	844000	something similar, which happens a lot here where I walk in the park.
844000	853000	That continuity, that reliable unchanging, because of how we are in time, it's unchanging, right?
853000	856000	The stone is still the stone tomorrow. The tree is still there.
856000	868000	We believe we feel most of our lives that we are immortal even though we are aware of the possibility of death and we may have encounters with death.
868000	885000	It's our relationship to temporality that convinces us that the compelling continuity of physical objects in space and their organizations is the most trustworthy fact, absolutely reliable,
886000	891000	not ambiguous.
891000	903000	We don't have to watch over the little stone, you know, the boulder, the mountain. They will be there every day.
903000	909000	And that brings us to kind of comfort because humans have these drivers.
909000	918000	We can be understood to have these drivers orienting our awareness and concern, three of them.
930000	934000	Ambiguity, vigilance, prediction.
935000	944000	Increases in ambiguity, spin up our vigilance. We're constantly concerned about prediction.
944000	954000	This is why we live in dead boxes because any reduction in ambiguity releases us from vigilance.
955000	974000	And thus, we turn from prediction to opportunism, which we certainly prefer to the burdens that prediction places on us, particularly predictions about negative future events.
975000	985000	Events that are undesirable, painful, impoverishing, injuring, isolating, so forth.
985000	1000000	So these three drivers underlie human concern and awareness, how we forge our awareness, what we forge it for, how we direct it in consciousness.
1001000	1014000	And the fiction here is that the staggering predictability of physical reality, objects in space,
1014000	1040000	should be transferred onto the rest of existence so that we presume that the structured continuity of physical space is the prototype of everything else.
1040000	1047000	Everything else is just like that structured continuity and should be understood that way.
1047000	1055000	This is what leads to materialistic models in science.
1059000	1069000	It's what leads to physicalist reductionism in philosophic thought.
1069000	1084000	The transfer of the expectation of structured continuity from physical reality to all other aspects of existence.
1084000	1096000	Now think carefully about this error because it's very subtle and largely invisible to us unless we concern ourselves with it.
1096000	1116000	Unless we float it on the waters of thought, it will remain invisible and we will just make the presumptions that, for example, my friend Joe is always my friend Joe, that I know Joe, that I know who Joe is.
1116000	1130000	And you can see what's going on here because if I claim to know who my friend Joe is, part of the claim I'm making is that I'm not subject to ambiguity as regards Joe.
1130000	1140000	I know who Joe is. I can predict how Joe will likely respond to a question or situation.
1140000	1153000	I have properly evaluated Joe due to our long association. Joe is a stable, continuous structure in existence.
1153000	1159000	Nothing like this is or was ever or could be true.
1160000	1168000	Ancient peoples were aware of this problem.
1168000	1187000	They had discovered that the capacity for descriptive or denotative language was fraught with prison-earing perils that would obliterate our relationships and humanity, turn us into slaves and prisoners, if we simply obeyed their structure.
1187000	1207000	So they learned to not do that. They learned to preserve awareness, potential opportunity, creativity, play, transformation, wonder, integrity, honor, respect, awe.
1207000	1224000	They preserved these above all the structured comforts of representational cognition and labeling language.
1224000	1229000	They knew their lives and cultures depended on it.
1229000	1255000	And when they met the colonizers, they thought, they expected, they predicted that these highly intelligent, apparently technologically advanced humans would necessarily understand and enact the same principles that trusted them.
1259000	1276000	Hmm.
1276000	1280000	How tragic.
1280000	1304000	None of us would think that our, you know, presuming that our parents loved us and were loving and kind, that our parents had agendas that would destroy us, ruin our spirits, wreck the many forms of flight we are capable of, flight into the outer space of ordinary humanity.
1304000	1313000	Hmm. That's very interesting.
1313000	1335000	These two women are directing their rowboat with separate oars, whereas nearly everyone else, one person, rose with both oars at once so that the boat goes fairly straight.
1335000	1342000	I like their intelligence. I like the daring of their experiment.
1342000	1349000	So we transfer the expectation of physical continuity onto identity.
1349000	1378000	And you can see in the strange and partly lethal backwaters of identity politics and gender politics a nascent awareness of the dangers of presuming the continuity
1378000	1384000	or predictability of gender or identity.
1384000	1413000	The problem is, with that, is it should remain actually fluid and once you militarize that domain, you're going to suffer ironic, what, collapses, right, and misunderstandings and prosecutions and indictments and all of this really dangerous distraction from liberation.
1413000	1426000	So the first lethal fiction is that you're merely human. This doesn't mean that you get to just make shit up and become like a woo goddess.
1426000	1435000	The people who walk around saying that they're kings and queens because they have a male or a female body or they are goddesses, you know, or whatever.
1436000	1455000	Without access to the more than merely human domains of our nature is dependent on various kinds of integrity and humility.
1455000	1482000	If you are arrogant and you celebrate arrogance and pump up, inflate your personal identity and your ego, the universe will grind you up and spit out the little bits of tooth and bone that remain with very few exceptions.
1482000	1493000	So I personally, there's a lot of wind here right now, this could be some noise, you know, I have the mic buffer on so bear with me.
1493000	1505000	You have no patience for this kind of nonsense. Myself, if you find it attractive or interesting, well see if it serves you.
1505000	1528000	It's the opposite of what I'm talking about. Integrity means honesty. And yes, we are vastly more than human, but to that more is in service of the history and future of all beings.
1528000	1543000	It's not in service to the preservation of Darren's name or my individual prosperity or wealth.
1543000	1572000	We can see in our cultures another terrifying fiction, which is that the goal is the fulfillment of individual egoic personal desires and liberations from cultural structures via catastrophic wealth.
1573000	1589000	That's a game, that's a vampiric game where the death and suffering of billions of others builds up fortunes in individual and corporate bank accounts.
1590000	1610000	The fiction there is that it's the personal identity and individual fulfillment of a single human being that is the most valuable thing, the righteous thing, the thing you're supposed to do,
1610000	1619000	the thing that if you don't do someone else will, the race to the bottom, perverse incentives, all of this.
1620000	1639000	That leads to dead planets and nightmares, tyrants and false demigods, Bezos, Musk, Epstein, Maxwell,
1639000	1659000	the US military industrial complex, Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, the swarming list of lethal vampiric nightmares just keeps exploding into new malignant mutations,
1660000	1664000	each one more powerful and accelerated than the last.
1669000	1691000	It's cancer protocol, but the fiction is that the endless unfulfillability of individual identity and power is righteous, appropriate and true.
1691000	1693000	This is the opposite of what I'm saying.
1693000	1714000	Real fulfillment has its root in a kind of divine equanimity, not the concept of equality, not lip service.
1715000	1726000	And equalities isn't even the right idea, it's flowing transcendental mutuality.
1726000	1750000	Fame is so often a devastating and miserable outcome of the developmental potentials of a human being.
1751000	1760000	And many of the famous have painfully come to understand this at absolutely terrifying prices.
1763000	1772000	I have an essay called The Factories of Emptiness about this on my Medium page.
1772000	1782000	There's a lot of cheering up on top of the strawberry hill here.
1782000	1788000	So yeah, that's one of the fictions that personal fulfillment.
1789000	1806000	Now look, fundamentally there's no problem with lift your boat and bring the tide that raises all the boats around you.
1806000	1816000	If it actually raises them and if that commitment doesn't become compromised as it becomes more successful,
1817000	1826000	we can see in historically Google's mandate don't be evil became the opposite of their mandate.
1826000	1836000	And presently you have a slavering, drooling malignancy at the top of the food chain
1836000	1844000	and just obliterating the history and future of humanity and nature and so forth.
1844000	1863000	While pretending to a greatness that can't be had by villains, yet can be mimicked.
1863000	1873000	The fourth fiction that we are trapped on a backwards planet called Earth.
1873000	1879000	The humans are certainly backwards. Our cultures are insane. Nightmarish monsters.
1879000	1887000	They're not human. We'll get to that shortly as the fifth fiction.
1887000	1894000	But what I want you to understand is that this is all the worlds, all of the intelligences in time space,
1894000	1901000	meaning in the future and in every place in the universe are accessible from here.
1901000	1912000	This is a transceiver, the forms you see around you, of the organisms, the microorganisms, the viruses, all these things.
1912000	1922000	The plants, the forests, the hyper structures of organismal synergy that we refer to with the term ecologies.
1922000	1932000	These are instancings of the forms and modes of cooperative transcendence throughout time space.
1932000	1938000	Everything you could possibly imagine or want is directly accessible from right here,
1938000	1948000	your body, right where you're sitting. Nothing requires travel.
1948000	1960000	And travel can quickly become ironic and, you know, productive of the opposite of what travel hopes for.
1960000	1964000	The gurus and yogis know what I am saying.
1964000	1974000	We imagine that when Buddha says, oh, I've remembered, I've had the anamnesis of my million previous lifetimes,
1974000	1988000	we presume that what he may have meant was a linear anamnesis backward in time.
1988000	2001000	It occurs to no one, nearly no one, that what he meant was something more like all these lives here, all these lives alive now,
2001000	2008000	all these lives that have been previously alive. These are my spirit, they are my mind, they are my body.
2008000	2021000	They are my mother, they are my father, they are my children, they are my dreaming, they are my love.
2021000	2028000	What's actually going on here is, first of all, incomplete.
2028000	2040000	So the language is wrong. There isn't anything actually going on because the idea that there are things that are actually the case is a result of that first fiction.
2040000	2050000	The transfer of the continuity of physical objects in space to all other domains of being. It's not true.
2050000	2065000	Much of what is going on is not a state. It's an array of transforming potential synergistically producing the appearance of a stable situation.
2065000	2074000	That appearance is false. It is another of the fictions, the appearance of a stable situation, not true.
2074000	2083000	Deceptive, slave-making nonsense in consciousness. Useful for very pragmatic concerns and purposes.
2083000	2093000	I want to build a bed out of wood. Useful. Stable state, mine. I want to shoot a bullet and kill my neighbor. Useful.
2093000	2108000	I don't want that, but if somebody has this desire, right? Useful. Useful for war, useful for commerce, useful for allopathic medicine.
2108000	2121000	The kind we use doctors and hospitals to purvey. Useful for mechanistic science, engineering, computation, so forth.
2121000	2142000	Lethal to our actual potentials in origin when implemented by dissociated insane processes that have captured our collectivity and expectation.
2142000	2150000	So this is all the world. When a child is born here, it is just as if you gave them a UFO, right?
2150000	2161000	It's just like the story of Superman where Carl L, knowing that his world is about to be destroyed by earthquakes due to transformations in the local and stellar environment,
2161000	2172000	puts his child, their child, into a spacecraft and sends it to Earth to grow and be born here. That is the story of every human child on this world.
2172000	2186000	We come from space-time. This planet is all the world. When a child is born here, what they will traverse in existence is very similar to...
2186000	2203000	It's not similar. It's the hyperstasis. It's the superposition over what would happen in an actual spaceship sent to another planet that was inhabited by something, right?
2203000	2214000	This world is all the worlds. Your travel here is travel in space-time. It appears local. It isn't local.
2214000	2223000	There's nothing local about it. Or rather, the fragment of it which is reliably local is, again, perhaps... It's less than 1%.
2223000	2233000	It's very reliable, that less than 1%. As far as expectation, ambiguity, and prediction goes, seems like it's made of concrete, that 1%.
2233000	2247000	It's super reliable, but wildly incomplete. And so, too, are the natures and potentials of our human lives which appear to be individual yet or not.
2247000	2259000	They are for the sake of all beings. We incarnate for the sake of all beings, as well as our own sake.
2259000	2275000	We come here on heroic missions that are quickly forgotten as we are indoctrinated in modernity's languages and in actions of enculturation.
2275000	2285000	So, yeah, this is the fourth fiction. This is all the worlds. A lifetime here is a transit through space-time,
2285000	2295000	encountering many other worlds, many other universes, becoming other worlds and universes, together, within for each other, and the history and future of all beings.
2295000	2307000	And the sake of their liberation from pain and suffering and impoverishment. It doesn't look that way on the surface. It looks like the opposite.
2307000	2315000	We come here to participate in pain, suffering, enslavement, and impoverishment of ourselves and others.
2315000	2322000	We torture the animals, we buy meat at the grocery store, all of these things. They are bad. Of course, they are bad.
2322000	2328000	For those of us that live in cities, they are sort of necessities, so the city starts the problem.
2328000	2338000	You can see that the problem begins at the collective level and is transmitted into the personal level, order, or register, if you will.
2338000	2350000	There's going to be some wind for a minute while I wander around this. Maybe I'll pause and reflect on the fifth fiction.
2350000	2366000	Okay, the fifth fiction is that aggregates of human collectives are people. That the government is a person, that the corporations are persons.
2366000	2375000	There was a catastrophic data breach at AT&T recently, and I read nonsense language in the media.
2375000	2387000	The privacy of our clients is our fundamental concern. We're filled with regret and so forth.
2387000	2400000	We heard similar nonsense from Boeing, whose catastrophic commercial grifting and cheating resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people.
2400000	2415000	We hear the same nonsense from ExxonMobil when, you know, some pipeline bursts and vast portions of the ocean are obliterated by poison.
2415000	2431000	We hear this nonsense constantly. Trump pretends to be a human being with a political identity when, in fact, it's just a fucking parasite.
2431000	2435000	It's a highly advanced parasite.
2435000	2443000	And others will say, well, Biden's even worse. Okay, right. I doubt it, but it's, you know, it doesn't really matter.
2443000	2454000	The point is, fictional humans aren't humans. Corporations can't have emotions. They don't have regret. They don't have compassion. They don't have altruism.
2454000	2460000	Small groups of humans can express altruistic gestures as collectives.
2460000	2467000	Small groups of humans can be human until they're captured by commerce or power in the market.
2467000	2473000	And then it's basically just straight up monsters. Lying, right?
2473000	2484000	But what I want to be really clear about is that representations of human collectivity that are dead inside cannot have emotions.
2484000	2495000	And when they say we regret, they're just fucking lying. It's impossible for Google to regret something, right?
2495000	2503000	It's impossible for them to feel shame. They don't have emotions.
2503000	2511000	When they say they're expressing emotions, they are lying, straight up lying. There's no such thing as that.
2511000	2515000	Corporations are not people. They don't have rights. They can't be imprisoned.
2515000	2528000	There's no real structure to shut them down when they behave omnisidally or catastrophically or viciously, or just profiteeringly, right?
2528000	2535000	I mean, everybody's just going to say, like, look, this is a war over profit. As long as we win the war, whatever you can get away with goes.
2535000	2539000	And damn the graveyards of children. Who cares?
2539000	2545000	Do you see the same kinds of thing going on in the countries that are at war right now?
2545000	2554000	They don't care about human beings at all. They have some principle or idea in mind, some protocol that they're enacting,
2554000	2563000	as they slaughter children and women and fathers and grandfathers and grandmothers and whole lineages of human history, just obliterating them.
2563000	2569000	They think they have an argument in favor of this? What possible argument could a human being have for that? None.
2569000	2574000	If they were human, they could not do that.
2574000	2589000	So the idea that our collectives are intelligently oriented or humane or human or trustworthy or worthy of our service or attention or authorization is bullshit.
2589000	2600000	The fifth fiction.
2600000	2606000	Now, there are many more fictions.
2606000	2609000	They all have to do with limitations.
2609000	2617000	That you're not telepathic. That you are telepathic. Both are fictions.
2617000	2624000	The actual path between them is intimacy, not declaration.
2624000	2627000	Intimacy.
2627000	2636000	Sensitive mutual synergy for noble and amnoetic, un-forgetting purposes to remember together.
2636000	2647000	To rediscover the potentials and natures of our origins and intelligences, our transcendent aspects.
2647000	2656000	The beyond of the human that we came here to bring into physical reality.
2656000	2677000	To catalyze, to impregnate, to fertilize, to potentiate here on Earth.
2677000	2683000	There are many more fictions.
2683000	2709000	Now, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take the fictions I presented here and invert them in your consciousness, evaluation, thought, behavior, relationships, experiments, arts, creativity, remembering, dreaming, adoring, awakening, experience.
2709000	2718000	If you know the falsehoods, you can forge the keys. And if you know two or three of them, you can forge a very powerful key.
2718000	2724000	I've given you five here today. There are many more. We will continue to explore them together.
2724000	2743000	We were born to un-forget the ways and beauty and shining holy origins of our nature, potentials, and the missions that we incarnate to pursue together.
2743000	2763000	Let us not forget them. Let us never counterfeit them. Let us correct wherever we begin to forge biases or declarative errors.
2763000	2776000	Let us not know but learn. Let us not tell but see together for each other.
2776000	2805000	In any situation where we have the agreement to see better rather than to defend the books of our previous thought, concern, belief, and bias, wherever we shall agree to see better together for the sake of each other in our world, we will succeed.
2805000	2816000	Our fiction is that we are alone in the universe. We are not alone here on earth, but we are nothing like alone in the universe.
2816000	2823000	Our people were born in intimate symbiotic relationship with non-human intelligences.
2823000	2838000	Those here around us on earth are perhaps first those in the sky that may have actually forged our forms, because we are certainly not the result of merely natural mechanical evolution on earth.
2838000	2841000	No chance of that.
2841000	2850000	The sixth fiction is that we are alone. And the seventh is that you are alone.
2850000	2863000	The universe is filled with anciently astonishing transcendent minds, and they participate directly in the formation of living worlds.
2863000	2869000	Without them, you would not be able to understand my language. You would not have anything like a mind.
2869000	2877000	In order to have a mind, you have to be touching the basis of the transcendent origin of consciousness.
2877000	2881000	And that's a link that could never be broken. Never.
2881000	2889000	It might perhaps be briefly interrupted. If it were interrupted for long, everything that you understand as you would permanently be gone.
2889000	2891000	And I don't think that's even possible.
2891000	2901000	So, the sixth fiction is that humans are alone. The seventh is that you are alone. There's no chance of that.
2901000	2911000	The eighth is that we're the dominant form of life on earth. We are certainly the most dangerous and lethal form of life on earth.
2911000	2930000	And in the sense of being omniscidally dissociated from lived relation with nature, if that's what dominance means, then we're dominant in that sense.
2930000	2945000	And we are dominant in the sense that we can destroy everything here without too much trouble.
2945000	2959000	But we are not the dominant form of life. The dominant form of life is probably cells, bacteria, protozoa, single-celled animals, protists, and so forth.
2959000	2967000	And in terms of number, the dominant form of life is probably viruses.
2967000	2979000	So these are the fictions I will outline today. I hope you find them useful and medicinal.
2979000	2985000	Insightful and helpful. Inspiring.
2985000	2996000	When learning to see them, we can begin to forge their opposites in thought, concern, consciousness, relation, and behavior.
2996000	3004000	And that direction lies the hope of the future of our species and world.
3004000	3009000	I'm so grateful to have this time together. Thank you for joining me.
3009000	3022000	Take a moment to like or share or ask a question in the comments. Please support my work if you find it helpful or amusing, inspiring.
3022000	3034000	I look forward to learning together again very soon. May your ways and lives and dreams and relations be beautiful and profound.
3034000	3036000	Bye-bye for now.
