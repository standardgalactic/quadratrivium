00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everybody. Welcome.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I've been listening to

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Danny Jones

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
interviewing Neil from

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nossom Performance. I can't recall his last name at the moment.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's like, Sendiac. Sendlak.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Something like this. Fairly interesting.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And this is obviously one of the things

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
that's going on with Danny's podcast at the moment, Concrete,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
is that clearly he's exploring the

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
world around Amen

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hillman.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Neil has a lot of interesting historical

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
perspective and information. Neil is an

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
autodidact. He was not educated like me.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He's a self-educating person. He follows his passions

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and his interests. And he became interested in these

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
topics through what he called

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
studying his way out of Christianity, which is a very interesting

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
thing to say.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There's a lot of good information.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Neil is very supportive of Amen's

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
classicism,

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
his Greek scholarship.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
One of the things that Neil says is that most of the people that are attacking

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Amen's

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
perspectives, I will call them.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Just basically attack it from the place of, we'll know

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the agreed upon knowledge,

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
right? The, let's call it,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
consensus.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
By the way, that's basically just like saying with

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
the numbers, with the census.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And this is the adpopulus,

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
historical fallacy. Well, most people think, who gives a flying

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
poop storm what most people think?

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's be really clear. If we go with generalities

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and generalizations, we're only going to miss

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
everything important.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Because what will be overlooked is everything that

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
opposes popular consensus.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And in our situation with the moderns,

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the educational level of the common people,

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
if we,

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
how would I put this? If we adulterate

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the pool with

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the entire scope

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
of the numbers, we're going to find

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and we got to include people who are so old their memory doesn't

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
work yet. We also have to include children and stuff who have

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
no formal education speak of or not much

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
yet. So if we

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
dilute the numbers with the common

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
people, what you get is basically just stupidity.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Like bald

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
inveterate ignorance.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Which you can see very commonly in the United States

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
in our political situation. You have two species

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
of catastrophic stupidity, you know,

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
assembling golems in public to war against each other

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
for the sake of what? Who has nothing to do with running a country,

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll put it that way. It has a lot to do with lining pockets

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
sustaining lineages of socio-political

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
economic war, prison,

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you know, power, back room power

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
exchanges.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The currying of favor and favor trading

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and so on, which is the opposite of what a democracy

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
should be about.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
In any case, one of the things that was bothering me is that

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
both Neil and Danny

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
with all due respect, Danny is

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
catastrophically naive about anything relating

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
to spirituality. I'm pretty sure

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
he's an atheist and

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
it's, you know, Danny asks

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Neil if he's religious and he just says anything but.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So Neil is also

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
hopefully my wind buffer is going to work here. I did test it a bit.

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So Neil is also

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
what? I'm not going to say he's an atheist.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
As far as I can tell, he's anti-metaphysical.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He doesn't believe there's anything like souls or spirits or gods

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
or diamonds or angels or anything.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And, you know, I'm reminded

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
of experts on fishing

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
who've never held a rod.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And this analogy turns out to be really important here in all kinds of ways.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
They've never seen a fish. They live in the

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
desert. They don't believe in fishes. Fishes are a

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
story that crazy people tell.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And the crazy people are so insane

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that these desert dwellers, and these aren't like the

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Bedouins who actually have wisdom and stuff. These are idiots.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
These are people who live in a world of their own suppositions.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No experience of the things that they speak of. This is what I was talking about in my

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
recording about knowledge and writing and the problem that

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
that produces. It also produces amazing

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
possibilities of learning and the exchange of

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the transfer of knowledge on a broader scope than person to person

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
by song and oral tradition and transfer. That's true.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It does do that, but it comes with very lethal dangers.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Historically the humans tend to ignore the dangers of their new technologies

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and then what happens is

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
the structures of power,

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
the under structure,

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the sort of malignant under structures

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
of power and wealth

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and rape and torture and lying and

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
not the good kind of lying, not the aurea.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No, no, the kind

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
of lying that leads to the immiseration of

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
thousands or millions of people over epochs of time, that kind

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
of lying. This all gets supported by this process.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What we have here are people, I can't really speak much about

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Danny Jones, and it's not my intent to insult him

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
or to be disrespectful

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
but it's clear just from listening to him

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
he sounds like an 11 year old kid

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
knowing absolutely nothing about the topic

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and look, he's interviewed a good, I don't know what his numbers are

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
but a good probably 500 or 1000 people

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
very deep minds, very rich

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in intelligence. Strangely

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
his own intellect appears

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
largely immune to these intelligences

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and I find it tragic

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
this is the problem with the claim

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
of knowledge, these people are talking

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't care what they believe and they're welcome to believe

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
whatever they like or disbelieve whatever they like

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
they're talking about things they have no experience of

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
just like people in the desert who make up stories and say

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
there's these people in the west

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
and they say that you can go to the end of the world and if you go there you will see the great water

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that fills the whole horizon, those people are insane

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
it's not possible for there to be great waters like that

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
there's no chance of it being true

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
water as far as you can see to the horizon

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
all the way around you, those people are doing, those are drunkards

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and silly people, they're just making shit up

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
which is effectively what they're saying

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
they're saying Neil studies

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
the origins of religion

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and he's an interesting cat

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and he has a lot of name based

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
date based, place based, he's got this sort of

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
like you see on those detective shows where you, there's a wall

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
where all of the sort of major players and situations

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and the timeline is there and there's a web of red threads

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
between all the stuff, Neil's mind is a bit like this

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
which is super cool, I mean for all it's worth

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
in terms of trying to understand

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
classicism

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
what happened in the ancient world, how did, where did we get

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
did the Masoretic text come before the Greek

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Septuagint or vice versa and why and so forth

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Neil's defending Amin primarily by saying that

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
his detractors cite

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
consensus, well the consensus is obviously that

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Masoretic text precedes the Greek, but when you look at the actual numbers

165
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
at least

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
from some of the people that Neil has been interviewing, some of whom are

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
lifelong scholars of these matters, so not trivial

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
idiots, you know, who, these aren't political theorists

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
who, I think, you know, nope, it's nothing like that

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
these are people who have spent their entire lifetime studying

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
in the archives and in universities and all around the world

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
some of them are probably even in the Vatican libraries

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
which must be catastrophically astonishing

174
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
um

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
many of these people think

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
that we should ask questions

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
about the texts

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and their origins, so he's defending some of what

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Amin is saying and also by saying

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
that the people who are trying, you know, by saying that the people who are trying to

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
refute Amin are not citing much

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
they're really just saying well the consensus has long been

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
particularly if you see on YouTube some ridiculously

184
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
titled video, Amin Hillman debunked

185
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
well what a load of bullshit that is, there's no debunking of Amin

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
first of all you can't debunk a human being, let's just be really clear, Amin Hillman exists

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
so, you know, the text is already

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
stupidifyingly

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
pitifully titled, just insane

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
you can't debunk a human being, Amin Hillman debunked

191
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
what are you debunking, you're debunking your own intelligence in language

192
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
so what you can debunk is a claim

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
not a human being, let's be really clear about that

194
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
that little 10 minute video, can't recall

195
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
don't even care to recall, the name of the guy who

196
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
obviously a friend of Dan McClellands who

197
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
has his panties in a bunch about Hillman

198
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and I would argue doesn't even understand, has no chance of understanding

199
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
what Hillman is doing because what Hillman is doing

200
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
isn't history of religion

201
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
it's related, it's related

202
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and it has an influence in that domain

203
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
but what Hillman is doing is

204
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
magical, it's not scholarly

205
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
there's features of it that are academic and scholarly, he's drawing on his

206
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
education as a classicist and his fascinations

207
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
particularly with ancient Greek

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Galen, known as others

209
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
everywhere there's these machines

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
even in the park, the gardens

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
driving machines around, in any case

212
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
what Hillman is doing

213
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
is initiatory

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
he's time traveling, it's like he's opening up

215
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
a window to a lost world

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
inside himself, he's opening up this window, this portal

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
if you will, and he's transporting us back

218
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
he's giving us a

219
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
there must be a word for this where

220
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
where you are in time is flipped around

221
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
in exchange for another place in time

222
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that's what Hillman is up to

223
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
in his

224
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
paramaniacal

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
dissertations

226
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and the actual origins

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
of what's in the Bible, particularly the New Testament

228
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
but not merely that

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
and

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
you know

231
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Hillman's been accused of various kinds of nefarious activities

232
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know

233
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
what the verity of those activities might be

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
basically

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
he was specifically accused apparently by some

236
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
feature of the Catholic church

237
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
of summoning demons

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
opening portals

239
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
he's definitely opening portals

240
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
he's trying to understand

241
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
he's trying to understand

242
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
he's trying to understand

243
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
what the origins of the often absurdly

244
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
ridiculous things we believe in modernity

245
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
he's trying to understand

246
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
the history of these situations

247
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and when he uses the word history

248
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
he doesn't mean a record of what happened

249
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
he means to inquire of those with actual knowledge

250
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
intimate knowledge

251
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
the kind of knowledge you have of your lover's mouth when you kiss them

252
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
that kind of knowledge

253
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
the kind of knowledge you have of a fruit when you eat it

254
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
direct, somatic, visceral

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
spiritual, originary experience

256
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
not thinking, not opinions

257
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
not ideas

258
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
and he doesn't give a flying fuck about consensus

259
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
nothing does not care

260
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
in fact he will blatantly declare

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
that this consensus thing

262
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
is completely delusional

263
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
nothing there at all

264
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
he often yells, he will yell out

265
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
everything you think

266
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
all those thoughts you have, all those ideas, all those stuff you've been taught

267
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
all of that nonsense

268
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and then he'll go off camera and you'll hear spanking sounds

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
at least

270
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
now look

271
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
nobody has to authorize

272
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Hillman, right? you don't have to bow to him

273
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
he's not running around saying worship me, I am the truth and the light

274
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
what he's saying is if you want a taste

275
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
of the ancient world that's much more like

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
what was almost certainly going on than what you've been told

277
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
we will go together

278
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
using the ancient greek as a vehicle of travel

279
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
travel in what? travel

280
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
in pneumaticon

281
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
in the freens

282
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in the strands

283
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
the threads, the tributaries

284
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
of our own origins, our minds, our consciousness

285
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
our awareness, our souls

286
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
the spectral body, the soma pneumaticon of the greeks

287
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
he will spin that up

288
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and take us far beyond

289
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
anything we've ever been exposed to

290
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
for those who want to go

291
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
it's an opt-in thing

292
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
he's not telling the world what to believe or the scholars

293
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
but he will openly laugh at them

294
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and, you know, piss in their faces

295
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
happily, joyfully, playfully

296
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
what they've been trained to think

297
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
they're doing the same

298
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
kind of thing that they like to accuse him of

299
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
they're very selectively picking certain senses

300
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
of certain words that match up not with history

301
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
not with the consensus of primary sources

302
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
which consensus Hillman may well

303
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
theorize. No, they are doing the same thing

304
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
they're excluding what they don't want to hear

305
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
why did Hillman have to exclude all references to recreational drugs from his dissertation

306
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
when the use of drugs by the Romans

307
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
was probably the primary focus of his PhD dissertation

308
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
why was he told to exclude these

309
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
because it was said by the gatekeepers

310
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
of the institution the Romans would not do this

311
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
what? What? The Romans were doing this

312
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
of course they were doing this, we do this, every people who have ever lived

313
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
have done this

314
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and what is this? We use intoxicants

315
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
and sometimes psychedelics and other sedatives

316
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and other things

317
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
but if you experience anesthesia in the surgery

318
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
this is what he's talking about

319
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
so

320
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
his detractors are doing the same thing

321
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
they're promoting specific

322
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
senses of words in Greek

323
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
and or Hebrew

324
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and they are ignoring

325
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
the senses that don't agree with their pre-existing narratives and biases

326
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
many of which are ridiculously

327
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
it's the right word, McDonaldized

328
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
right? Jack in the Bible

329
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
eyesed

330
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
so

331
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
frankly I think it's weird

332
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
when people like Danny

333
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
opine on religious topics

334
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
or metaphysical topics

335
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't know his whole history, I don't pay a lot of attention to him

336
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
but if he has any direct experience of metaphysical

337
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
the world outside what you are thinking with your representational cognition

338
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
which let's face it is 99% of the universe

339
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
point 999

340
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
basically everything isn't what you like to think

341
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
is the truth of reality

342
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
that which is, we might call it, all that is

343
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
and Danny's over there trying to think his way through that

344
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
good luck Dan, you're using the fingernail

345
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
of your pinky for something that needs to become

346
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
the palm of your hand and replace your representational

347
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
cognition for you to understand it

348
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
they're literally arguing about people being possessed

349
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and laughing about it, him and Neil, neither of whom apparently believe

350
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
in possession which I think is hilarious because

351
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
clearly, Amen

352
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
it seems very clear to me and I'd love to ask him questions

353
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
about this but if Amen himself has not experienced

354
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
various kinds of possession particularly by his muse

355
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
the

356
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
dead girl he talks about when he says he has a cheat

357
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
in the sacred

358
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
the podcast by quote

359
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
speaks, unquote, when he talks about

360
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
this dead girl who resurrects the ancients before

361
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
him one by one so that he may inquire directly of

362
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
them, if he's not experiencing something resembling

363
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
possession I'd love to know what it is that he is

364
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
experiencing and these two

365
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
young men who know nothing of what they're talking about

366
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
apparently and by the way, you know, you can disbelieve

367
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
something to such a degree that it either kills

368
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
you or blinds you, right, in the same way that you can believe something

369
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
to such a degree that it kills you or blinds you, you can disbelieve that food is nourishing

370
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and die of intonation, right, you can disbelieve that you need

371
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
water, you don't need water, dead, you know

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
34 days later, if not sooner

373
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
you can say, there's no objective evidence for love, that's just something

374
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
people made up to amuse themselves, okay, you won't

375
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
have any experience of love, there are certain features of being

376
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
human and I would argue that many if not most of the features

377
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
of being human are like this, where if you

378
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
decide that they don't exist, you become incapable

379
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
of participating in them, right, and

380
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
unless something comes and overwhelms

381
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
your

382
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
your blatant ignorance

383
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
your, it's a word I'm looking for that I can't quite find

384
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
unless something comes and just overwhelms

385
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
you, right, and takes you over, which by the way is pretty much

386
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
and I'm not recommending the use of psychedelic drugs here, but that's what happens when one does

387
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
psychedelic drugs, you don't either nothing happens

388
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
which is what happened to me the first eight or nine times

389
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I smoked weed, nothing, nothing happened, similarly

390
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
my friend Alan Steinfeld when we were talking the other day, he was like, you know the first

391
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
time I looked at a television it was just incoherent, I couldn't tell what the hell

392
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
that was or what was going on there, and he's right

393
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
it's because the form of our cognition

394
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
this idea that

395
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
the crazy people have

396
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
that what your mind reveals to you is what exists

397
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and what it doesn't reveal doesn't exist

398
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
that is impossible, there's no chance of that being true, because what

399
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
actually happens is that the mind reforges its own

400
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
anatomy

401
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
in order to reveal or occlude

402
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
features of potential, relation, history, future, possibility

403
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
and if the mind has never taken on a particular form

404
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
before, it doesn't know what to do

405
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
with the information, and so it may generate

406
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
literally it may just knock you out

407
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I've had direct experience of this with things that other people

408
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
think are completely ordinary and happen all the time

409
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
your first experience of eating food with your mouth

410
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
that wasn't just milk was probably like this

411
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
your first experience of standing up was like this

412
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
my first experiences of relation

413
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
erotic relation with women in my teens

414
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I go like this, that it was like going to another universe

415
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
so this idea that you're the arbiter of identity

416
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
function, situation, circumstance, and you just declare

417
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
what's happening and what's isn't

418
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
you can go ahead and play the game of

419
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
consciousness that way, Neil, Danny, go ahead, be my guest

420
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
you're going to miss out on most of what it means to be human

421
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and from your weird little isolated

422
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
castle, or your dungeon of naivete

423
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
you're going to make ex-cathedra declarations that you think

424
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
other people are just either having us on

425
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
or they're good actors, I mean this is what the left hemisphere would say about everything

426
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
that it doesn't originate, grip, control

427
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and also anything that would threaten

428
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
its supremacy and consciousness, and by the left hemisphere what do I really mean? I don't mean

429
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
the left cerebral

430
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
hemisphere, what I mean is certain

431
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
features that we know

432
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
have an intimate relation with that hemisphere from having done experiments

433
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
with stroke victims and from having done the water test

434
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
where we anesthetize one of the

435
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
hemispheres and we ask the person questions and we can talk to them later about their

436
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
experiences and so forth, we know that

437
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
there are faculties

438
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
from which, okay, there are faculties

439
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
that representational cognition relies fundamentally upon

440
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and these faculties are tyrannical, you can see them

441
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
in actual tyrants, you can see them all spun up in people like

442
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Mr. Trump and other

443
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
tyrannical nightmarish folks from history

444
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
who probably need not be named here

445
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
so there's this aspect

446
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
again it's like the fingernail on your pinky or the

447
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
tip of your pinky screaming at the rest of the hand

448
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
you don't exist, I have never seen a ghost

449
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
who such thing as possession, I mean that's the hilarious irony

450
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
is these people who say there's no such thing as possession, okay really?

451
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
because you are possessed by an array of faculties

452
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
that are declaring that and you are unaware of your possession

453
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and think that what you have is

454
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
the antithesis or opposite of possession

455
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
when there's no chance that's true, no chance

456
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
when there's 10 miles thick

457
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
you're possessed by a tiny little array of your cognitive faculties

458
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
a little tiny island, an archipelago in consciousness

459
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and that archipelago is saying many things that's not from around here

460
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
doesn't exist, those other islands have ocean, stuff like that

461
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
it's not there, there is no boatman

462
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
boats are a fantasy dreaming thing

463
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
something very close to me last night was arguing fiercely

464
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
that romantic love was just an invention made up by poets

465
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
that everyone decided was a good idea afterwards, he's not entirely wrong

466
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
but neither is he correct

467
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
because the mind can reforge

468
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
its anatomy and under some circumstances

469
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
that can be

470
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
not exactly forced

471
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
but very forcefully catalyzed

472
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and so this is really important to understand

473
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
if you are a person like Danny or Neil who thinks they know things

474
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
about what it means to be human, what's real and what's not real

475
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
you don't, you're wrong

476
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
you're using the point

477
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
of using one book in a library or one

478
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
angle of a sphere

479
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
to determine what is true real good, veritable, trustworthy

480
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
and so forth, you know Alan Steinfeld who I recently did

481
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
a beginning interview with

482
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
spoke about his first experience with a trans channel

483
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
and he said in the interview

484
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
you know I met this man

485
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and I thought

486
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
okay either A, he is psychotic

487
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
B, he's a really really

488
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
good actor

489
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
or C, and this is the voice of the left hemisphere

490
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
incredible doubt and skepticism

491
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

492
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
he said maybe like 12 times

493
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe

494
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
there's something going on here that I don't understand

495
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
and then later Alan was, Alan is a very intelligent

496
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
well educated person

497
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and then so

498
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
a performance where this

499
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
actually I can't remember if it's, I think it's a woman who is the channel

500
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and she channels an ancient warrior

501
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
his name is something like

502
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
something like this, I can't, it was very, this channel is very famous

503
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
one of the first trans channels

504
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
he was at a performance

505
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
the channel picked him out of the audience, pointed him

506
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
very reluctantly, so I said you mean me?

507
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
you talking to me? and then the channel said yes, in very elaborate

508
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
ancient pre-shakesperean

509
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
English, I said yes my beloved you

510
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and Alan had a full

511
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
on suddenly, very rapidly, the whole tabloid changed

512
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
he said that the theater filled with a kind of

513
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
paraphrasing here, like a glowing mist and he rose

514
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
kind of out of his body and they embraced and he had this experience

515
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
unlike anything he'd ever had before and you know you can argue

516
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
whatever you like, ah, hypnosis, blah, blah, blah, I wasn't there, I didn't see

517
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
that, ah, it's just hearsay, go ahead, be my guest

518
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
you can argue the same thing about the flavor of food

519
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
you're not seeing red, that's just blah, blah, blah

520
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
make up any noises you like, you can make all the face noises you want

521
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and you can have all of the critical left hemispheric

522
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
refutations, be my guest, you're welcome to have them

523
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
you're wrong, you're just dead wrong, you're missing

524
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
the thing you're using to determine what is real

525
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
is only useful in a very, very tiny

526
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
scope of human

527
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
experience, nature, being

528
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
thought, awareness, consciousness, all these

529
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
things, very tiny scope, it's very useful if you want to tell

530
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
is that pot hot or cold, very useful there

531
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
you know, how many coins are in my pocket, very useful there

532
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
beyond

533
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
this applicable scope, those faculties

534
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
are lethal to understanding

535
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
they crucify it, they basically just rip out its organs

536
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and spray them on the wall, so if you think

537
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
that you know what's going on based on your rationality, you not only

538
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
don't know what's going on, you're like a bird that thinks

539
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
only this one feather on my wing

540
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
or in this case my right wing

541
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
because birds are similarly lateralized to us

542
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
only this one feather can I trust, which guess what that means

543
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
that means that you will never fly

544
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and you're a bird, you're born to be sky born

545
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
you're born for the wind to just

546
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
lift you up into the atmosphere

547
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
into the sunlight, into dance with the clouds

548
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
this is what you're born for and you're really focused on this

549
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
one feather, you're like, well I've never seen anything incline me to believe

550
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
blah, blah, blah, blah, okay

551
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
good luck and everybody's, you know, lots of us start out there

552
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
the problem is some of us finish there

553
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
and I have my own biases and perspectives

554
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I too can, I've experienced delusion

555
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I've also experienced manic insight

556
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
mantic insight

557
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
paranoia, grandiose, yes, yes, I've had these experiences

558
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and of course we want to be protected

559
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
from them, we don't want to

560
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
we don't want our buffers so permeable

561
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
that anything gets in and that's part of why

562
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
rationality reigns

563
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
supreme is because we're really afraid of the

564
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
contagion of madness, okay, I get it, but there's other approaches

565
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
that allow us to explore

566
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
our nature, our origin, our intelligences

567
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
our creativity, our participatory

568
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
transcendence

569
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and this is very crucial that we have these experiences

570
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
so we need a buffer

571
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
against, you know, having the membrane

572
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
completely ruined

573
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
by nonsense, which is conceivable

574
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
but we still need a

575
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
trustworthy and worthy array of incitements

576
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
maps, teachers

577
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
mentors, and perhaps daimons

578
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
to lead us

579
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
out of the prison-eering cage

580
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
of mere rationality

581
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
that's it for now, more soon, thank you for joining me

582
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
may your paths be beautiful and your relationships

583
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
loving and your dreams amazing

584
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
bye bye for now
