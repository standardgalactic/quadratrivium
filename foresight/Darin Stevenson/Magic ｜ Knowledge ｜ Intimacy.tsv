0	10200	Hello everybody. Welcome. I have just
10200	15160	reattached my wind buffer to my wired
15160	22560	Apple headset, microphones, or
22560	27240	microphone. It's not particularly windy,
27240	30880	but I'm sort of pleased with the simple
30880	34120	solution of wrapping a cotton ball
34120	41360	around the mic and securing it with a
41360	44440	... there's probably a formal name for
44440	48120	these objects, but a bread wire. Right?
48120	63760	Those little wires that sometimes close
63760	70680	the bread package. Hmm. A lot of contrails
70680	77400	in the sky today. I suppose there are
77400	80220	people who suspect that every time they
80220	85480	see a contrail, they're seeing what
85480	93240	chemtrails. Pretty sure most of those
93240	96720	contrails are just vapor caused by vapor.
96720	102600	The engines heat the air, makes a vapor
102600	107200	trail. There might be occasionally, and
107200	111440	some places, some things that aren't
111440	116560	contrails, but I strongly suspect that
116560	118960	people who spent their lives watching
118960	124400	aircraft and contrails would alert us.
124400	130880	I know this is a very controversial
130880	134640	topic that borders on the conspiratorial
134640	139200	but there are other strange problems
139200	145920	like, I guess, maybe my objection isn't as
145920	147440	strong as I once thought. This often
147440	149280	turns out to be the case, but one of my
149280	152840	simple objections was if somebody's
152840	154600	spreading some kind of chemistry in the
154600	157480	atmosphere itself and they're doing that
157480	159200	on purpose, it's going to affect them
159200	160640	and their children and their children's
160640	163200	children and so forth. I suppose it could
163280	165800	be that they don't have any children and
165800	168480	they don't care. This is strange. This is
168480	172400	the second bit of a carcass that I've
172400	176520	seen today and it's interesting because
176520	178920	I almost never see bits of carcass and I
178920	181440	walk here every day. Is it just that
181440	184520	today I'm noticing what I don't notice?
184520	189080	Or is today a bit of carcass day? I just
189080	191960	don't know. They're rather disgusting.
191960	197560	Little chunks of fleshy, bloody, gristle
197560	202920	and fur and things. Certainly
202920	209640	unappetizing. I don't necessarily have
209640	215040	a plan for this talk today. We'll see
215040	218240	where it goes. I was thinking about
218400	224200	some things. Various kinds of magical
224200	231320	intent. The transactional kind where you
231320	237160	trade something often or sometimes this
237160	239600	is apparently whatever is referred to
239600	244640	by one's soul for some boon or benefit
244640	247280	in the short term. It seems like a
247280	250200	wildly stupid idea to me. Hopefully I
250200	252160	haven't accidentally done that myself.
252160	264320	And the kind where you employ. Wow, what is that sound?
264320	271760	Oh, it's a bird. Oh, it's a baby bird. It's a
271760	278120	feed me sound. Oh, okay. There are two
278120	284040	fundamental principles of something
284040	288720	resembling our idea of magic, which
288720	293840	let's face it. It's get or accomplish
293840	297240	something without physically having to
297240	301200	do the thing or, you know, chase the
301200	305400	thing or something. Something like this.
306960	316760	So in traditional Blackfoot knowledge,
317960	321280	the language is problematical because
321280	325520	what magic means in English is a broad
325520	329280	array of things. Or actually, magic doesn't
329280	332280	mean anything in any language. It's just
332280	335440	a word. What actually happens with words
335440	338040	is that we use them to mean things to
338040	340720	each other in actual conversations,
340720	345320	unless we're not having conversations
345320	349560	and we're just saying things. And this
349560	351560	becomes very confusing very quickly
351560	356080	because then the presumption that words
356080	361040	have meanings begins to pervade. We have
361040	364360	to interpret the gap. What gap? The gap of
364360	367920	no relationship, no no pre-existing
367920	371560	context, random context, and so forth.
371560	375520	There are ways in which that situation
375520	378920	can become useful for us, but only if we
378920	381720	deal with it very insightfully,
382000	384720	intelligently.
387280	390800	And what do I mean? I mean,
394400	399800	the randomization of language is a kind
399800	403200	of a paramagical substrate.
404200	408400	What am I trying to mean by magic? Well,
408400	412080	I'm not trying to mean illusionist's
412080	416680	tricks. Fascinating though they are.
416680	422200	And I'm not trying to mean the mere
422200	425920	manipulation of the vulnerabilities
425920	429920	in human thought and consciousness.
432480	437720	I'm trying to mean something more like
437720	441560	perhaps what people usually very naively
441560	445120	mean with the word manifesting.
445120	449200	An idea that I fundamentally mistrust,
449200	451920	or maybe it's just the language that I mistrust,
451920	455960	or maybe I'm ill-informed, which isn't
455960	460680	as rare as I might like to be.
460680	465160	Yes, I'm not, as my listeners know,
465160	470800	a big fan of the secret, or the various cults
470800	474920	that derive their central premises
474920	478040	from such ideas.
478040	484360	At the same time, there is something to
484360	488360	a kind of envisioning or dreaming of the future
488360	491160	that is very powerful.
492160	497160	The question is, is it as trivially silly?
497160	501160	Like what happens when you make that idea
501160	506160	explicit is one of the questions. Because
510160	514160	there's a fundamental difference
514160	518160	between peripheral vision and foveal vision.
518160	523160	Between explicit identity
523160	528160	and potential identities.
528160	533160	And in that blur, there's something transcendentally
533160	536160	momentous and powerful.
536160	541160	But if we make the blur explicit,
541160	545160	irony often results.
545160	549160	Meaning direct contradiction with
549160	555160	stated purposes, goals, hopes, desires, intentions,
555160	559160	cautions, and so forth.
559160	564160	And so perhaps what actually bothers me about
564160	569160	the manifesting cults is that they're taking something
569160	574160	that I suspect properly belongs to the peripheral
574160	578160	and making it foveal.
578160	582160	Your foveal vision is the center vision.
582160	586160	It's what you use when you look at something.
586160	590160	It's your peripherals what you use when you spread your gaze
590160	594160	and take in the whole.
594160	598160	And as some of you know, that if you gaze at the night sky
598160	603160	when you look at stars you can see the stars visible to your foveal vision.
604160	608160	When you look toward them,
611160	615160	I'm getting a little wet there.
615160	619160	If you spread your gaze you will see stars
619160	624160	that will literally disappear if you look at them.
624160	628160	And this is kind of what my concern is
628160	633160	as well as a sort of ideological trivialization
633160	638160	of destiny, dreaming, visioneering.
645160	648160	Yes, yes, yes.
648160	652160	Ascent of the herbs. Beautiful.
652160	657160	So yeah I'm getting somewhere near
657160	661160	what sticks in my craw.
661160	665160	And the weird thing about this problem for me
665160	669160	is that by explicitly pointing
669160	673160	at what sticks in my craw,
673160	677160	this is part of the problem with thinking and part of the problem with language.
677160	681160	Once I think I have a sense of what might be going on
681160	685160	I tend to become kind of clingy about that.
685160	689160	And in that clinginess,
689160	693160	well, you know, it's not always
693160	697160	conflicted but it's often produces
697160	701160	significant conflict.
701160	705160	Sage flower, scent, yum.
709160	713160	In Blackfoot the two principles are
713160	717160	similitude and contagion.
717160	721160	And they mix together, they mate, they bond,
721160	725160	they form very powerful abilities
725160	729160	you might call them, as well as faculties.
737160	741160	I'm not going to lecture about that today.
743160	747160	These two principles are also
747160	751160	found in other magical traditions
751160	755160	such as
755160	759160	voodoo, hoodoo,
759160	763160	various
763160	767160	witching ways.
773160	777160	And perhaps also
777160	781160	shamanism. Resemblance
781160	785160	is a way to understand similitude.
785160	789160	And similitude is a very sophisticated word
789160	793160	that my friend Ryan First Diver uses.
793160	797160	Contagion is fairly obvious.
803160	807160	In a way,
807160	811160	to refer to something
811160	815160	directly in consciousness
815160	819160	can often be a bit of a trap for us.
819160	823160	Whereas to suggest it
823160	827160	is much more powerful and in a sense magical
827160	831160	by which I mean transcendentally potent
831160	835160	historically
835160	839160	women, females,
839160	843160	are masters of
843160	847160	indirect communication.
847160	851160	Suggestion,
851160	855160	entranced
855160	859160	which places consciousness into a sort of
859160	863160	a flow state that can then be
863160	867160	directed
879160	883160	or shaped, or both, redirected
883160	887160	so forth.
887160	891160	Yesterday at this spot there was a young woman
891160	895160	sitting on a log up above me
895160	899160	and she was practicing
899160	903160	playing a particular kind of flute
903160	907160	that appeared to be made of wood or possibly bamboo.
907160	911160	I sat down, you know,
911160	915160	without gazing directly at her because once again
915160	919160	suggestion produces problems.
919160	923160	Or, you know, it's occasionally appropriate.
923160	927160	But usually if we're paying direct attention to something
927160	931160	it's often that we have the desire to capture, possess, or manipulate it.
931160	935160	And nobody really wants to be captured, possessed, or manipulated.
935160	939160	There's that explicitness in
939160	943160	language again, of course sometimes we do.
943160	947160	Sometimes we partly want that.
947160	951160	Or an aspect of us desires this while other aspects of us flee from it.
951160	955160	This is the stormy cloud
955160	959160	of what it's like to be human.
963160	967160	I've made it
967160	971160	to the high view.
973160	977160	And there's that thing that looks a bit like Warden Cliff Tower
977160	981160	but is actually
985160	989160	the emergency public broadcasting
989160	993160	speakers.
1003160	1007160	The peripheral and the foveal.
1015160	1019160	You know, dreaming consciousness largely corresponds
1019160	1023160	to the former, waking consciousness to the latter.
1023160	1027160	Without being
1027160	1031160	explicit, allow me to suggest that in the daytime
1031160	1035160	in bright sunlight
1035160	1039160	the sunlight declares the color and identity
1039160	1043160	of objects and situations. What they are doing is obvious.
1043160	1047160	It's explicit, relatively explicit.
1047160	1051160	Whereas the moonlight, if it's there, or even the total darkness
1051160	1055160	in total darkness it's pure
1055160	1059160	suggestivity.
1059160	1063160	If you don't know where anything is, you can tap your way along the path with a stick
1063160	1067160	if you're lucky, or skillful, or have practiced that.
1067160	1071160	If you're very witchy, you can run
1071160	1075160	in the darkness.
1075160	1079160	I've never known someone who can do that. I can usually
1079160	1083160	perambulate. I've heard of people who can run in pitch darkness.
1083160	1087160	Having practiced a kind of a
1087160	1091160	way that is natural to humans and animals, but
1091160	1095160	rarely
1099160	1103160	siren.
1103160	1107160	Terrible noise.
1107160	1111160	Dominates the entire oral sphere.
1117160	1121160	Thankfully most situations
1121160	1125160	are highly temporary.
1125160	1129160	The moonlight suggests
1129160	1133160	rather than declares identities, and thus
1133160	1137160	pareidolia.
1137160	1141160	I need to look up exactly how to pronounce that word.
1141160	1145160	But the imaginative
1145160	1149160	experience of shapes and faces
1149160	1153160	in, for example, the whorling
1153160	1157160	bark of trees, or the
1157160	1161160	texture of the surface of the trail,
1161160	1165160	or the clump of bushes that just happens to be
1165160	1169160	in a shape that looks like a raccoon, and you can't
1169160	1173160	at first tell it isn't.
1173160	1177160	This dichotomy between suggestion and declaration
1177160	1181160	is very profound.
1181160	1185160	And similarly in dreaming, because in dreaming
1185160	1189160	things, beings, and situations
1189160	1193160	we may later decide, oh, that was my brother,
1193160	1197160	that was our house, that was this, that was that. But in the actual
1197160	1201160	dreaming experience, it's not really like that.
1201160	1205160	It's just a house that's quite different from mine
1205160	1209160	can be my house. My sister can be a man.
1209160	1213160	All kinds of strange
1213160	1217160	amalgams
1217160	1221160	of possible and actual
1221160	1225160	form, identity, function, behavior,
1225160	1229160	ensue.
1229160	1233160	Usually when
1233160	1237160	I don't know, when those jays are making that noise, there's often
1237160	1241160	a raptor in your mind, but maybe not.
1241160	1245160	It doesn't sound as chiding. It sounds more like
1245160	1249160	here I am, here I am, I'm over here.
1249160	1253160	Well though, that looks like a raptor tree to me.
1253160	1257160	That's a stellar's jay.
1257160	1261160	Making the calls. See, there's that thing
1261160	1265160	right of explicit categorical identity.
1265160	1269160	See, there's that thing right of explicit
1269160	1273160	categorical identity.
1273160	1277160	See, there's that thing right of explicit categorical identity.
1277160	1281160	So there are kinds of magic
1281160	1285160	that don't really require
1285160	1289160	trades.
1289160	1293160	They're not transactional.
1293160	1297160	And by magic, in this case, I mean
1297160	1301160	the curation
1301160	1305160	of time, space, and relationships
1305160	1309160	in the hope of producing
1309160	1313160	the resemblance of desired
1313160	1317160	situations, transformations,
1317160	1321160	relationships.
1321160	1325160	Without manipulating them directly physically,
1325160	1329160	although some kinds of physical activities, such as
1329160	1333160	ceremony and or ritual, whether they are formal or informal
1333160	1337160	may be involved.
1337160	1341160	You know, one can envision
1341160	1345160	very formally by deciding I'm going to sit
1345160	1349160	in this place which is powerful
1349160	1353160	and envision.
1353160	1357160	But then, you know, think about, okay,
1357160	1361160	so when you go to sleep,
1361160	1365160	dreaming tends, for many of us,
1365160	1369160	some of the time, to resemble breathing.
1369160	1373160	It just happens. It happens, it's as if it happens
1373160	1377160	to us and also within us.
1377160	1381160	Now one can then form intentions
1381160	1385160	around dreaming, for example, the intention to dream about a specific thing
1385160	1389160	or the intention to the request
1389160	1393160	that the dreaming aspect helps us better understand
1393160	1397160	the situation or experience the transformation
1397160	1401160	of some kind or gain what we think of as information
1401160	1405160	about something that's otherwise difficult to know about
1405160	1409160	as if the dreaming mind has powers that are
1409160	1413160	irracular and transcendentally seeing and I think it does.
1413160	1417160	The dreaming mind is an array of faculties
1417160	1421160	but also some things we might think of as functions
1421160	1425160	meaning it does stuff,
1425160	1429160	important stuff, regenerating the organs,
1429160	1433160	cleansing the metabolism, transforming the energetic
1433160	1437160	situation in the body,
1437160	1441160	what we might think of as spiritual energies or soul energies
1441160	1445160	or life energies or electromagnetic,
1445160	1449160	subtle electromagnetic stuff.
1449160	1453160	All of these things the dreaming mind is naturally skillful with
1453160	1457160	and it does its job much like our heart and lungs do
1457160	1461160	without much instruction but it can also be
1461160	1465160	instructed or skillfully developed much like our breathing
1465160	1469160	perhaps like our heart rate, certainly like our habits of thought.
1469160	1473160	So we can
1473160	1477160	have the formal intention
1477160	1481160	to vision-ear futures.
1493160	1497160	And there's what I remember when I was younger
1497160	1501160	the informally vision-earing futures
1501160	1505160	and they many of them came to fruition
1505160	1509160	but there was a mix, right? Like I formally wanted to play the guitar
1509160	1513160	I formally wanted to be a graphic designer
1513160	1517160	I formally wanted to publish texts
1517160	1521160	I formally wanted to be a good
1521160	1525160	fisherman even though I don't really eat fish
1525160	1529160	I formally wanted
1529160	1533160	to have a nest like Robert Wagner's
1533160	1537160	that one sort of came true which I think is
1537160	1541160	ridiculous although now I'm old and it doesn't matter
1541160	1545160	much.
1545160	1549160	I formally wanted to be a secret agent
1549160	1553160	I also informally wanted
1553160	1557160	I'm not sure why I have such a
1557160	1561160	antipathy toward the formalization
1561160	1565160	of certain kinds of things perhaps I'm not really concerned
1565160	1569160	about their formalization I'm concerned about the way that
1569160	1573160	cults utilize formalizations
1573160	1577160	of principles and
1577160	1581160	wisdom
1581160	1585160	to capture
1585160	1589160	and
1589160	1593160	abuse people
1593160	1597160	to disempower and blind them
1597160	1601160	by giving them the wrapping paper
1601160	1605160	instead of the gift
1605160	1609160	hmm
1609160	1613160	yeah I don't like that
1613160	1617160	although sometimes it can be very helpful
1617160	1621160	and this is hard to understand at first glance
1621160	1625160	we'd like to have societies and situations that are so fundamentally enlightened
1625160	1629160	that we just climb the ladder together beautifully and successfully
1629160	1633160	toward self development, mutual development, insight
1633160	1637160	skillfulness, awareness, wonder, awe, play, joy
1637160	1641160	humor, eros, all these things
1641160	1645160	we just climb the ladder together and
1645160	1649160	are constantly lifting each other above positions previous
1649160	1653160	or at least into harmonious balance
1653160	1657160	where health and vitality and rejuvenation
1657160	1661160	and resurrection
1661160	1665160	are natural
1665160	1669160	features of the situation right of course we all hope for this but
1669160	1673160	in our actual situation sometimes we may
1673160	1677160	it may be useful to fail
1677160	1681160	talked about this before
1681160	1685160	imagine a situation where
1685160	1689160	everything you do succeeds the first time
1689160	1693160	and so it requires very little effort and there's
1693160	1697160	it's going to be extremely difficult to improve
1697160	1701160	to experience a gain in skillfulness or ability
1701160	1705160	or function
1705160	1709160	in order for that to happen there has to be the possibility of
1709160	1713160	making mistakes
1713160	1717160	and perhaps of pain and suffering
1717160	1721160	confusion, ignorance, all these things
1721160	1725160	so it can be very useful at least in theory
1725160	1729160	to
1729160	1733160	to
1733160	1737160	to
1737160	1741160	to become
1741160	1745160	enamored
1745160	1749160	of a cult
1749160	1753160	I have
1753160	1757160	before
1757160	1761160	and you know
1761160	1765160	we join the cult, we are enchanted by it
1765160	1769160	it's very compelling because suddenly we have
1769160	1773160	belonging, we have an experience of belonging that can be otherwise quite difficult
1773160	1777160	to
1777160	1781160	in our modern
1781160	1785160	common modern situations worst common denominator
1785160	1789160	talk here but in our common modern situations it can be very difficult
1789160	1793160	to find a coherent groups that are doing something amazing
1793160	1797160	and beautiful to belong with and so
1797160	1801160	this is part of why even though education
1801160	1805160	is kind of a disaster it's also very
1805160	1809160	wouldn't necessarily just want to get rid of schools
1809160	1813160	clearly one might want to
1813160	1817160	what
1817160	1821160	mediate you know
1821160	1825160	positively mediate and transform
1825160	1829160	the existing institutions
1829160	1833160	but the schools are very important because they give young people
1833160	1837160	and the teachers and others
1837160	1841160	the experience
1841160	1845160	of belonging together
1845160	1849160	and so to the cults and so to
1849160	1853160	the various
1853160	1857160	pedals on the strange flower of fandom
1857160	1861160	musical groups
1861160	1865160	films, sports teams
1865160	1869160	also the
1869160	1873160	usually lethally in more ways than one motivated
1877160	1881160	military
1881160	1885160	cohorts and such
1895160	1899160	belonging
1907160	1911160	belonging
1911160	1915160	and obviously we get all kinds of pandering around this
1915160	1919160	social media
1919160	1923160	panders to this desire
1923160	1927160	to belong and delivers
1927160	1931160	largely
1931160	1935160	counterfeit representations
1935160	1939160	we steal the
1939160	1943160	the real thing is stolen, ground up
1943160	1947160	compromised
1947160	1951160	essentially destroyed
1951160	1955160	and
1955160	1959160	we are sold a broad array
1959160	1963160	of ever less rich
1963160	1967160	and powerful counterfeits
1971160	1975160	this is the common thing
1975160	1979160	that happens a lot in our
1979160	1983160	society
1983160	1987160	now when we come together with and for each other
1987160	1991160	and we forge intentional social
1991160	1995160	contexts and cohorts
1995160	1999160	pods if you will like a dolphin pod
1999160	2003160	or a primate pod or a whale pod
2003160	2007160	then we have both a kind of natural
2007160	2011160	to these gambits and the capacity to lift each other out of them
2011160	2015160	or even to manipulate them from within
2015160	2019160	this is the rather covert
2019160	2023160	version of
2023160	2027160	the possibilities
2027160	2031160	of our human
2031160	2035160	sociality
2035160	2039160	and this can be done
2039160	2043160	in various different kinds of ways
2043160	2047160	it can be done
2047160	2051160	in rather serious ways
2051160	2055160	and it can also be done in more or less playful
2055160	2059160	or game like ways
2059160	2063160	and these two can actually merge so that you can have
2063160	2067160	playful games
2067160	2071160	that actually transform
2071160	2075160	or ameliorate the
2075160	2079160	humanity and ear sats community
2079160	2083160	spirituality
2083160	2087160	that is so pervasive in our modern
2087160	2091160	experience it's not the only thing going on
2091160	2095160	alone when we're isolated it may seem like
2095160	2099160	the entire context is just violations
2099160	2103160	and this is what leads people to
2103160	2107160	terror, agony, self harm, suicide
2107160	2111160	what we think of as madness
2111160	2115160	madness is a fairly natural result of the constant exposure
2115160	2119160	to the kinds of double triple quadruple
2119160	2123160	you know myriad sorts of binds
2123160	2127160	right where
2127160	2131160	that emerge in our experience
2131160	2135160	of the broad
2135160	2139160	array of competing anti-cultures
2139160	2143160	anti-nations, anti-societies
2143160	2147160	corporations that dominate
2147160	2151160	our modern experience
2151160	2155160	and concern
2155160	2159160	and they are terrible but they're not the only thing going on
2159160	2163160	and in order to you know it's not just that we discover what's going on
2163160	2167160	when we begin to form intentional communal groups
2167160	2171160	even if it's only for a short period of time see this is the key
2171160	2175160	we can get escape velocity immediately
2175160	2179160	in a small group with a shared intention to do so
2179160	2183160	and we can sustain that over time
2183160	2187160	and give it a heartbeat and that can even reproduce
2187160	2191160	other little groups that bubble
2191160	2195160	and prosper even in
2195160	2199160	the counterfeit
2199160	2203160	nightmares
2203160	2207160	from and perhaps against
2207160	2211160	and out of the
2211160	2215160	desire to
2215160	2219160	transcend
2219160	2223160	these troubling situations
2223160	2227160	so there are forms of
2227160	2231160	magic that don't require
2231160	2235160	or soul-selling and so forth
2235160	2239160	but are very powerful and some of them are profoundly virtuous
2239160	2243160	they are not
2243160	2247160	composed for the sake of vengeance
2247160	2251160	this is very dangerous motivation generally speaking leads to
2251160	2255160	a lot of trouble in almost every case
2255160	2259160	they are not war machines
2259160	2263160	primarily for personal gain
2263160	2267160	they may not be entirely selfless
2267160	2271160	though they can be composed under such circumstances
2275160	2279160	but they are resistant to capture
2279160	2283160	yeah
2287160	2291160	by selfish manipulative
2291160	2295160	or war-like motivations
2301160	2305160	and they can also be profoundly
2305160	2309160	protective
2309160	2313160	healing
2313160	2317160	calming
2317160	2321160	nurturing nourishing
2321160	2325160	and these forms arise
2325160	2329160	from an ache that I suspect we all come
2329160	2333160	to human incarnation with
2333160	2337160	the
2345160	2349160	it's an ache for the positive
2349160	2353160	version of justice which is the dissolution
2353160	2357160	of injustices and their replacements with virtues
2357160	2361160	now again if once either of these ideas become highly explicit
2361160	2365160	there's going to be a lot of trouble
2365160	2369160	most of the time
2369160	2373160	if you're explicitly concerned with virtue
2373160	2377160	this tends to produce irony
2377160	2381160	if you're explicitly concerned with harm or vengeance
2381160	2385160	or war you're going to have irony
2391160	2395160	cleansing
2395160	2399160	cleansing
2399160	2403160	bathing
2403160	2407160	smudging
2407160	2411160	um
2411160	2415160	nurturing grounding
2415160	2419160	getting your feet, your bare feet
2419160	2423160	out of the ground
2423160	2427160	surrounding you know
2427160	2431160	going into nature, going into the living waters of the river or the ocean
2431160	2435160	the lake, the stream
2439160	2443160	these are potent and powerful precursors
2443160	2447160	to the formation of the kinds of intentions
2447160	2451160	that naturally become
2451160	2455160	that naturally influence
2455160	2459160	without dictating futures
2459160	2463160	and transformations of situations
2463160	2467160	I was speaking with someone
2467160	2471160	maybe about a week and a half ago
2471160	2475160	and I asked him if he had ever prayed
2475160	2479160	and I don't think I ever really got
2479160	2483160	the impression that something was listening
2483160	2487160	and that's a very rational
2487160	2491160	response, sensible
2491160	2495160	why should we engage in
2495160	2499160	activities whose effectiveness we have no way to determine
2499160	2503160	well you know that's one
2503160	2507160	effective but I wonder if it ever occurred to him
2507160	2511160	that whether or not someone was listening
2511160	2515160	or something was listening
2515160	2519160	the transformational effects
2519160	2523160	could be profound either way
2523160	2527160	they could be profound neither way
2527160	2531160	they could be profound both ways
2531160	2535160	they could be profound even if there was no way to understand
2535160	2539160	how or why they were in fact profound
2539160	2543160	because
2543160	2547160	somehow
2547160	2551160	our behavior
2551160	2555160	transforms our potential
2555160	2559160	and the fact or fiction
2559160	2563160	in many cases
2563160	2567160	either doesn't matter or
2567160	2571160	can be very limiting
2571160	2575160	so yeah
2575160	2579160	these are things to consider
2579160	2583160	I heard once that some president
2583160	2587160	perhaps it was Bush
2587160	2591160	a prayer
2591160	2595160	it's like attempting to study
2595160	2599160	I don't know
2599160	2603160	something that cannot be
2603160	2607160	cannot be detected
2607160	2611160	by the methods we would ordinarily
2611160	2615160	presume I heard this morning of an experiment
2615160	2619160	to establish what's called the Weisman barrier
2619160	2623160	in biology
2623160	2627160	a feature of biology that is certainly wrong
2627160	2631160	and yet has been canon for a very long time
2631160	2635160	in modern, in terms of modern science
2635160	2639160	and the experiment was absurdly stupid
2639160	2643160	and yet everyone supposed that it was one of the greatest biological
2643160	2645160	experiments that had ever been done
2645160	2647160	well perhaps not everyone
2647160	2651160	it was very common to suppose this
2651160	2655160	yeah so had people pray
2655160	2659160	for sick people and so on people who knew them and people who didn't
2659160	2663160	and apparently the study produced
2663160	2667160	the result that the people who were prayed for were actually
2667160	2671160	less likely, slightly less likely to recover
2671160	2675160	than those who were not prayed for
2675160	2679160	experiments
2679160	2683160	and rational thought
2683160	2687160	and science are very powerful tools
2687160	2691160	their scope though is quite limited
2691160	2695160	compared to that which is
2695160	2699160	you could say that which is the case
2699160	2703160	but not that which is
2703160	2707160	their scope is different from reality
2707160	2711160	the scope of rational thought
2711160	2715160	is similar
2715160	2719160	in its limitations to the scope
2719160	2723160	of the physical manipulation of objects
2723160	2727160	I can move hammers all I want
2727160	2731160	much of my experience
2731160	2735160	cannot be reasonably
2735160	2739160	affected, cannot be
2739160	2743160	properly transformed or successfully
2743160	2747160	transformed by my manipulation of hammers
2747160	2751160	and if I should fall under the
2751160	2755160	delusion
2755160	2759160	that my capacity to manipulate hammers
2759160	2763160	is the only way for me
2763160	2767160	to achieve
2771160	2775160	true and valid belief
2775160	2779160	conceptual or procedural
2779160	2783160	insight
2783160	2787160	understanding
2787160	2791160	then I'm going to be in a really bad situation
2791160	2795160	one imagines
2795160	2799160	someone that
2799160	2803160	is a boatwright but specializes
2803160	2807160	in the formation of the
2807160	2811160	skeletal precursors to the hull
2811160	2815160	and they think
2815160	2819160	this is the only important thing the skeletal precursors
2819160	2823160	can't have a hull without these
2823160	2827160	they only build skeletal
2827160	2831160	they only build the frame and the frame doesn't
2831160	2835160	float and they think
2835160	2839160	that they are an expert and that they know everything about boats
2839160	2843160	because they do the most important thing which is produce the frame
2847160	2851160	my presentation of the metaphor was a little
2851160	2855160	sketchy there but I think you get the idea
2855160	2859160	this is similar to the
2859160	2863160	overvaluing of rational frameworks, models, explanations
2863160	2867160	theory, experiment
2867160	2871160	and so on
2871160	2875160	when one does, when we do experiments
2875160	2879160	we
2879160	2883160	try very desperately to evict most of what's going
2883160	2887160	on from the context so that we can control
2893160	2897160	the resulting context
2897160	2901160	and its variables well enough
2915160	2919160	to acquire deterministic knowledge
2919160	2923160	of cause, effect,
2923160	2927160	future transformations
2927160	2931160	and this is a very compelling method
2931160	2935160	but it can also be blinding
2935160	2939160	in tests to determine
2939160	2943160	whether things like telepathy exist
2943160	2947160	they do, I assure you
2947160	2951160	I am as sure of telepathy as I am of breathing
2957160	2961160	very few if any of the experiments
2961160	2965160	took a fundamental feature of telepathy into
2965160	2969160	the experimental context, what is this feature
2969160	2973160	intimacy
2973160	2977160	deep
2977160	2981160	mutual concern and awareness
2981160	2985160	which is naturally
2985160	2989160	productive
2989160	2993160	of various forms of non-ordinary awareness
2993160	2997160	and sensing of the state needs, thought, concern, desires
2997160	3001160	of the other, natural between
3001160	3005160	mothers who adore their
3005160	3009160	young and newborn children
3009160	3013160	though it's not merely a matter of the young and the newborns
3013160	3017160	natural
3017160	3021160	between dogs and cats and their human companions
3021160	3025160	probably other pets, natural between
3025160	3029160	certain insects and humans
3029160	3033160	birds, reptiles even
3033160	3037160	but you know we hear
3037160	3041160	well there's no evidence, nobody's written a paper about that
3041160	3045160	there's nothing in the literature, I remember one day I was here at this lake
3045160	3049160	talking with an ornithologist and I explained that by careful observation
3049160	3053160	I had determined how to sex
3053160	3057160	how to determine the physical gender of geese
3057160	3061160	the snow geese, white cheeks, the Canadian geese
3061160	3065160	Canada geese I think they're called
3065160	3069160	which by the way I'm pretty sure isn't named after the country
3069160	3073160	I think it's named after a man whose last name was Canada
3073160	3077160	I think I heard someone saying this, they might have been
3077160	3081160	having their friend on
3081160	3085160	yeah I explained by careful observation over time because this is a quest I undertook
3085160	3089160	I realized the geese can tell for sure
3093160	3097160	each other's gender by sight
3097160	3101160	and if they can tell we can tell but in the literature
3101160	3105160	it is claimed that it cannot be determined, it can be determined by behavior
3105160	3109160	but not by appearance
3109160	3113160	and I didn't believe that
3113160	3117160	so I went on a quest, it took me a few years, it wasn't until I met
3117160	3121160	an old goose couple, an older couple
3121160	3125160	which is very uncommon in nature because old geese don't survive in nature
3125160	3129160	but in cities they can
3129160	3133160	and then in them the distinctions were
3133160	3137160	highlighted, exaggerated
3137160	3141160	and so I said to this guy, I was like you know
3141160	3145160	there are ways to visually determine the gender of these birds and he got very upset
3145160	3149160	and literally said there's nothing in the literature about that
3149160	3153160	and I was like how about we just look at some birds together
3153160	3157160	and let's see if we can do it, nope, there's no evidence
3157160	3161160	we hear this all the time, there's no evidence of faith
3161160	3165160	healing, no evidence of God, no evidence of angels, demons
3165160	3169160	I would argue that Facebook and Google are pretty strong evidence of demons
3169160	3173160	not to mention
3173160	3177160	many other bizarre features of our modern world
3177160	3181160	so
3199160	3203160	if you decide to not look for evidence or if you decide that
3203160	3207160	previous experiments not done by you
3207160	3211160	explain for all eternity what exists
3211160	3215160	what doesn't, what it doesn't, doesn't do, what it can and cannot do
3215160	3219160	then you have become
3219160	3223160	theory-blinded
3223160	3227160	because in point of fact
3227160	3231160	we speak and think
3231160	3235160	as if
3235160	3239160	that which has previously been established
3239160	3243160	is continuous and permanent
3243160	3247160	when there's no evidence of any permanent thing
3247160	3251160	and continuity is relative
3251160	3255160	it's not concrete, it's relative
3255160	3259160	and the nature of time itself can change, the nature of light can change
3259160	3263160	and the behaviors can change, does change
3263160	3267160	if you're dreaming you're still perceiving
3267160	3271160	so
3271160	3275160	it's very important to be able to distinguish
3275160	3279160	between
3279160	3283160	there might be stuff that's nonsensical in a dangerous way
3283160	3287160	that we should avoid
3287160	3291160	acting it, acting as if it's true
3291160	3295160	on the other hand
3295160	3299160	life and thought, our bodies, our relationships
3299160	3303160	as human beings are fundamentally experimental
3307160	3311160	the fact that there are concrete realities
3311160	3315160	that
3315160	3319160	doesn't mean
3319160	3323160	that all previously known
3323160	3327160	exemplars of fact
3327160	3331160	are the concrete foundation of our existence
3331160	3335160	or our reliable guides to futurity
3341160	3345160	you know what
3345160	3349160	Nassim Nikolas Taleb calls black swans
3349160	3353160	which are previously unknown phenomena
3353160	3357160	happen all the time, the current models of time space and such
3357160	3361160	all come from black swans
3361160	3365160	no one expected that Einstein was going to come along and go like
3365160	3369160	I think this distinction between space and time
3369160	3373160	while it seems very obvious
3373160	3377160	intuitive is wrong
3377160	3381160	and then Arkhani Hamed and others of his ilk came along and said
3381160	3385160	this perspective that
3385160	3389160	time space isn't must be
3389160	3393160	fundamental to all that's going on
3393160	3397160	not only is unlikely but can't be the case
3397160	3401160	black swans
3401160	3405160	come
3405160	3409160	into our awareness
3415160	3419160	and obliterate previously
3419160	3423160	dominant biases
3423160	3427160	and when they do so they are usually liberating
3427160	3431160	we gain new degrees of freedom
3431160	3435160	insight, wonder, play, ability, function
3435160	3439160	so on
3443160	3447160	the findings of science theory and experiment are provisional
3447160	3451160	they will be overturned
3451160	3455160	it's not they might be overturned, they will be overturned
3455160	3459160	and so we should recognize that the terrain ahead
3459160	3463160	isn't the ignorant
3463160	3467160	you know
3471160	3475160	I'm not sure what to say, there's a word I'm looking for
3475160	3479160	the crippling suppositional
3479160	3483160	certitude that oh we've already determined
3483160	3487160	what a goose is
3487160	3491160	and now we know, well I doubt it
3491160	3495160	the fact is we don't know what anything is
3495160	3499160	we have highly provisional toys
3499160	3503160	and when we exchange those for wonder and curiosity
3503160	3507160	passion and insight
3507160	3511160	something inside us begins to die
3511160	3515160	you know what we have mostly
3515160	3519160	as moderns
3519160	3523160	is not knowledge, it's representation
3523160	3527160	and representation in language and concept
3527160	3531160	is
3531160	3535160	deceptively powerful
3535160	3539160	and it is this deception
3539160	3543160	see here is magic
3543160	3547160	here is transcendental influence
3547160	3551160	by which we can be captured and manipulated
3551160	3555160	what we have is something
3555160	3559160	that replaces intimacy with tokens
3559160	3563160	words
3563160	3567160	maps, models, hypotheses
3567160	3571160	because actual knowledge
3571160	3575160	is intimate like kissing
3575160	3579160	and if you experience
3579160	3583160	the inflowing and indwelling of this knowledge
3583160	3587160	it will not be like thinking, it will be like orgasm
3587160	3591160	it will be like kissing
3591160	3595160	it will be like death
3595160	3599160	it will be like birth
3599160	3603160	some of you may notice a radical transformation
3603160	3607160	in the vector of my
3607160	3611160	my illocution
3611160	3615160	but yes, science
3615160	3619160	is powerful
3619160	3623160	but it is not the arbiter
3623160	3627160	of meaning, identity, purpose, value
3627160	3631160	fact
3631160	3635160	truth
3635160	3639160	and we see this kind of
3639160	3643160	refraction away from
3643160	3647160	science in many domains of our
3647160	3651160	modern social experience
3651160	3655160	the problem with that particular refraction is that some of that
3655160	3659160	is a weaponized sigh up
3659160	3663160	nations
3663160	3667160	are experimenting with how to kill each other's populations
3667160	3671160	with information
3671160	3675160	and so we have the mixture of the truth
3675160	3679160	of the danger for example of the covid vaccines
3679160	3683160	with
3683160	3687160	the intent
3687160	3691160	to deceptively harm populations
3691160	3695160	right, the
3695160	3699160	this is very common unfortunately in our modern
3699160	3703160	situation
3703160	3707160	but yes
3725160	3729160	all my father's life he thought he
3729160	3733160	knew what a tree was and then one day at the mirror
3733160	3737160	pool here in this garden where I'm standing
3737160	3741160	I accidentally enchanted him and we sat on this bench
3741160	3745160	where a woman is sitting now and he
3745160	3749160	began to have what might be described as an
3749160	3753160	emergence event and he turned to me
3753160	3757160	and he said we have to leave, I am dying
3757160	3761160	I'm going to become this tree and he was quite
3761160	3765160	he was simultaneously
3765160	3769160	hello
3769160	3773160	nice to see you today
3773160	3777160	he was simultaneously alarmed and ecstatic
3777160	3781160	he had never had an experience like this
3781160	3785160	drugs were not involved he felt he was becoming
3785160	3789160	the tree and I tried to calm
3789160	3793160	him I told him it'll be okay we can leave if we must
3793160	3797160	he said we have to go we have to leave and then a squirrel climbed up his
3797160	3801160	leg and up onto his shoulder and he said see see even the squirrel
3801160	3805160	knows I am a tree this is intimacy
3805160	3809160	and trance can produce
3809160	3813160	the potential for modes of intimacy that
3813160	3817160	I thought must extinguish
3817160	3821160	speech is very similar
3821160	3825160	I was talking with someone the other day about their dreaming experience
3825160	3829160	and gosh who was it
3829160	3833160	whoever it was
3833160	3837160	he said I don't think
3837160	3841160	I remember speaking in a dream and I was wildly
3841160	3845160	surprised I was partially surprised because most of us think
3845160	3849160	it's the keyword we think that we
3849160	3853160	have the experience of having many of us have these
3853160	3857160	memory of an experience resembling conversation in
3857160	3861160	dreaming and that part is true it resembles conversation
3861160	3865160	but as it moves more and more
3865160	3869160	explicitly toward the semblance of speaking
3869160	3873160	the manifold that supports the dreaming is collapsing
3873160	3877160	the intimacy is disappearing
3877160	3881160	one way to end an experience is to speak about it think of
3881160	3885160	two people passionately kissing
3885160	3889160	and one of them then
3889160	3893160	for whatever bizarre
3893160	3897160	reason of dissociative confusion decides that the most
3897160	3901160	important thing in this moment is to say something
3901160	3905160	the speech ends the experience
3905160	3909160	language is deceptively weird in that
3909160	3913160	we think it gives us the power to communicate
3913160	3917160	it does but primarily in the layer of representations
3917160	3921160	which is not the same layer as experience
3921160	3925160	and certainly not the same layer as intimacy
3925160	3929160	where in this mess is science
3929160	3933160	science is
3933160	3937160	in our time at least demonic
3937160	3941160	and when I was a child I wanted to become a scientist because it seemed that these were the people
3941160	3945160	who best knew
3945160	3949160	complete knowledge of things being
3949160	3953160	circumstances, origins, futures and so forth and machines
3953160	3957160	were very fascinating to me because it was as if in my previous
3957160	3961160	incarnations these things didn't exist and now they do
3961160	3965160	and they seemed quite impossible
3965160	3969160	not even the thing like a zipper this is impossible
3969160	3973160	how much more impossible is a thing like a mouse
3973160	3977160	you know humans can compose
3977160	3981160	a zipper they cannot compose a mouse
3989160	3993160	so you see this kind of representational
3993160	3997160	knowledge is extremely dangerous because it evicts us
3997160	4001160	from
4001160	4005160	what I would call transcendent participation
4005160	4009160	and that's where our actual
4009160	4013160	spirit
4013160	4017160	our capacity
4017160	4021160	to forge purposes beautiful, noble and true
4021160	4025160	and to embody and enact them together arises
4025160	4029160	not from knowledge
4029160	4033160	from participatory intimacy
4033160	4037160	you know we
4041160	4045160	because we are embodied humans
4045160	4049160	eventually one way or another
4049160	4053160	most of us
4053160	4057160	the last majority of us have an experience that we call orgasm
4057160	4061160	and for some of us this happens in childhood
4061160	4065160	and for others it's in our teens and for some
4065160	4069160	it might not be even until our adulthood
4069160	4073160	and there are more life phases than those ones
4073160	4077160	as well
4077160	4081160	but there are
4081160	4085160	experiences of intimacy that make what we think of as
4085160	4089160	orgasm seem trivial in comparison
4089160	4093160	and these are four modes of intimacy
4093160	4097160	that's not true
4097160	4101160	no it's true
4101160	4105160	there's a broad array of experiences that are normally
4105160	4109160	well they are very successfully inhibited in us
4109160	4113160	moderns and there's a broad array of
4113160	4117160	modes of cognition the use
4117160	4121160	the reformation or the formation
4121160	4125160	of modes of awareness, consciousness
4125160	4129160	things that resemble thought and so forth
4129160	4133160	that are so different from everything we've ever imagined
4133160	4137160	and yet are natural to our kind of being
4137160	4141160	our form, our humanity, our animality
4141160	4145160	our values, our organismality, our beingness
4149160	4153160	there are
4153160	4157160	modes of intimacy
4157160	4161160	so ecstatic that you would never trade them for an orgasm
4161160	4165160	and this is part of why we hear
4165160	4169160	some mystics singing the praises
4169160	4173160	of
4173160	4177160	what the
4177160	4181160	ascetic path
4181160	4185160	the path of not
4185160	4189160	of non-indulgence
4189160	4193160	the path of chastity or temperance
4193160	4197160	and you know dreaming
4197160	4201160	really is very very profound
4201160	4205160	and in dreaming there can be modes
4205160	4209160	of adoration and eros that are vastly
4209160	4213160	beyond what we are inclined to usually experience while awake or
4213160	4217160	beyond what seems accessible to
4217160	4221160	to us while awake
4221160	4225160	in our life phase, in our development
4225160	4229160	but what I'm trying to get at here is that this thing we call
4229160	4233160	orgasm
4233160	4237160	it is in a sense
4237160	4241160	a
4241160	4245160	there's different ways to say this
4245160	4249160	it's a repercussion
4249160	4253160	of participatory intimacy
4253160	4257160	that can be physically produced
4261160	4265160	and since our first experiences with it
4265160	4269160	are usually catalyzed by physical sensations
4269160	4273160	rhythms
4273160	4277160	rhythmic pulsing, rubbing, so forth
4277160	4281160	we should understand that that is a
4281160	4285160	interstasis, a lesser exemplar of something for which there is
4291160	4295160	a forest of superpositions above that
4295160	4299160	and when I was a child and I was fascinated with science what I didn't realize
4299160	4303160	is that I had no way to understand this
4303160	4307160	although some people tried to say something maybe this is why
4307160	4311160	the problem ensued
4311160	4315160	there didn't seem to be anyone whose knowledge was deeper than
4315160	4319160	the knowledge of scientists
4319160	4323160	but the knowledge of the poets, of the mystics, of the philosophers
4323160	4327160	of the adoring ones
4327160	4331160	this knowledge makes
4331160	4335160	the powers of science
4335160	4339160	shrivel
4339160	4343160	they are still mechanically powerful and may in fact snuff our planet
4343160	4347160	and our people
4347160	4351160	yes they are physically very powerful
4351160	4355160	but where is the intimacy
4355160	4359160	it is that participatory intimacy that we
4359160	4363160	hunger for and when we hope
4363160	4367160	not for justice
4367160	4371160	but for
4371160	4375160	the diminution
4375160	4379160	the
4379160	4383160	transformative composting
4383160	4387160	of injustices
4387160	4391160	it is this participatory
4391160	4395160	intimacy
4395160	4399160	that we know
4399160	4403160	we sense would thereafter
4403160	4407160	obtain
4407160	4411160	and become
4411160	4415160	the water
4415160	4419160	the many forms of waters
4419160	4423160	in which our hearts
4423160	4427160	and histories and futures could then
4427160	4431160	swim
4431160	4435160	we
4435160	4439160	we
4439160	4443160	we poor moderns
4443160	4447160	have named nearly everything and thus evicted
4447160	4451160	all the named
4451160	4455160	features and beings and relationships and situations
4455160	4459160	from much of our experience
4459160	4463160	yeah
4463160	4467160	yeah
4467160	4471160	hmm
4471160	4475160	we have representational
4475160	4479160	knowledge
4479160	4483160	miles deep
4483160	4487160	how tragic for us
4487160	4491160	that is the
4491160	4495160	the alexandrian library of the skeletal remains of what
4495160	4499160	might have been understanding and insight
4499160	4503160	medicinal awareness
4503160	4507160	transformative ecstatic participation
4507160	4511160	magic wonder play
4511160	4515160	all
4515160	4519160	virtue
4523160	4527160	walking in the botanical gardens here
4527160	4531160	even though
4531160	4535160	this is a place curated by
4535160	4539160	my extremely confused at the group level species
4539160	4543160	the living beings here
4543160	4547160	they form a
4547160	4551160	a manifold over
4551160	4555160	the strange
4555160	4559160	dead inside evictions that otherwise prevail
4559160	4563160	as cities and roads
4563160	4567160	shops and buildings and so forth
4567160	4571160	and they are ecstatic
4571160	4575160	and in our way of being in time
4575160	4579160	this ecstasy would flow into and through
4579160	4583160	and around and between
4583160	4587160	all the aspects of our being in such a way as to draw us
4587160	4591160	into transcendent visionary awareness
4591160	4595160	and I don't say this
4595160	4599160	because I know it this isn't knowledge
4599160	4603160	I'm on the verge of experience
4603160	4607160	I'm on the verge of the experience of what I hear
4607160	4611160	suggest
4611160	4615160	we are not distinct
4615160	4619160	in the ways our common thought
4619160	4623160	suppose
4623160	4627160	or create
4627160	4631160	or create
4631160	4635160	and there are games afoot there are missions here so beautiful
4635160	4639160	that the entire history of language and knowledge
4639160	4643160	has nothing to do with them
4643160	4647160	there's no thing you can formally know
4647160	4651160	that's more interesting
4651160	4655160	than the kiss of your beloved
4655160	4659160	of that food grown by your grandmother in her garden
4659160	4663160	on endless afternoons
4663160	4667160	to make the foods
4667160	4671160	the families would consume
4671160	4675160	together
4675160	4679160	mostly in distracted confusion
4679160	4683160	especially once
4683160	4687160	the
4687160	4691160	the invention of televisions began to become dominant
4691160	4695160	and think for a moment of what the television is replacing
4695160	4699160	there's a reason that thing is so compelling
4699160	4703160	was so compelling it's a reason why we have these screens
4703160	4707160	they are counterfeiting something
4707160	4711160	and if you think just a little bit you will see what they are counterfeiting
4711160	4715160	and what it is is something resembling group dreaming, group telepathy
4715160	4719160	group organized, group missioneering
4719160	4723160	organized group anemnesis
4723160	4727160	and this is what we must reach for together if we are to retrieve
4727160	4731160	the faculties
4731160	4735160	the ecstasies
4735160	4739160	the beauty of our origins and natures and potentials
4739160	4743160	and that's a mission I adore
4743160	4747160	and do believe in
4747160	4751160	and if my humble
4751160	4755160	speaking
4755160	4759160	can contribute
4759160	4763160	then I will have lived this day
4763160	4767160	in a way worthy of
4767160	4771160	my ancestors and their dreams
4771160	4775160	my progeny and their dreams
4775160	4779160	which dreams must not
4779160	4783160	be euthanized
4783160	4787160	my thought, language, machine
4787160	4791160	modernity, war, prison-eering, commerce
4791160	4795160	tokenization, representation
4795160	4799160	and conviction
4803160	4807160	there are many ferns here
4807160	4811160	I've always loved the forms of the plants
4811160	4815160	the insects are impossible
4815160	4819160	the organisms on this world are fundamentally
4819160	4823160	impossible
4823160	4827160	the staggering burdens of representational
4827160	4831160	cognition ecstasy would naturally arise
4831160	4835160	because we ourselves are
4835160	4839160	and are surrounded by
4839160	4843160	infinite manifolds of impossibly beautiful wonder
4843160	4847160	organism
4847160	4851160	origin
4851160	4855160	spirit
4855160	4859160	purpose
4859160	4863160	the superposition from which the concept of beauty is derived
4863160	4867160	the living bubble
4867160	4871160	of being, history and future and purpose
4871160	4875160	that naturally
4875160	4879160	in beauties up from the soil
4879160	4883160	I die like trees
4883160	4887160	rain ecstatic
4887160	4891160	originary true vital
4891160	4895160	oh how I adore these organisms
4895160	4899160	how confused I mostly am
4903160	4907160	when deprived
4907160	4911160	of that fundamental participatory intimacy
4915160	4919160	which is true recognition
4919160	4923160	and explosive anemesis
4923160	4927160	thank you for joining me
4927160	4931160	I'm so grateful to have this time
4931160	4935160	take a moment to like
4935160	4939160	or comment or ask a question
4939160	4943160	or share something personal
4943160	4947160	in this way you will
4947160	4951160	help
4951160	4955160	help my humble efforts
4955160	4959160	reach more people
4963160	4967160	may your ways be beautiful
4967160	4971160	your hearts be light and your relationships
4971160	4975160	exquisite
4975160	4979160	thank you for joining me
4979160	4983160	I look forward to learning
4983160	4987160	together again very soon
4987160	4991160	bye bye for now
