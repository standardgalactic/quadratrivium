00:00.000 --> 00:29.960
Hello everybody. Welcome. It is Saturday, 1st of June, 2024, the year when

00:29.960 --> 00:58.680
schizogenic insanity was normalized when understanding became its opposite. Where ignorance and the polarity

00:58.680 --> 01:15.260
of abject opinionated ignorance and the light of the origins of intelligence and insight

01:15.260 --> 01:28.500
flipped over so that the former took the throne of the latter in our cultures and consciousness

01:28.500 --> 01:34.540
and thought and language as I've been seeing many examples of today. And yet there are

01:34.540 --> 01:53.720
bastions of insight and awareness, learning, discovery, growth, self-correction, and the mutual

01:53.720 --> 02:04.240
encompassment of inquiry. Amen Hillman recently said something so right. He's like, you're not

02:04.240 --> 02:10.000
going to believe me, bro, but this word history, it comes from a Greek root that means asking a

02:10.000 --> 02:22.600
question of an oracle, an oracle, the living spirit of insight, divine wisdom embodied in a young

02:22.600 --> 02:37.360
woman in ancient Greece, an oracle. History was a question, not a declaration, not a record of the

02:37.360 --> 03:06.080
authorized version of what had been a dream. I was listening this morning to messages

03:06.640 --> 03:21.200
from my friend, Tim Sanderson, brilliantly embodied, soulful, heartful, more than human being. His

03:21.200 --> 03:31.560
voice is so soft. And, you know, he complains that he was never really an intellectual, never truly an

03:31.560 --> 03:43.920
academic, but was lost instead in the reveries of his fervent imaginings. I was like, the whole, you

03:43.920 --> 03:52.680
know, 78% of the amphitheater of my ancestors stood up in their graves, like, yes, wild cheering ensued.

03:53.680 --> 04:07.760
Though, you know, both paths, the intellect is profound when it's funded by its origins, when it

04:07.760 --> 04:17.440
reveres its origins in dreaming and emotion and passion. And part of that passion is the quest

04:17.440 --> 04:45.320
the quest for the superposition above the concept of justice. If the concept of justice means,

04:45.800 --> 04:57.240
or is taken to mean, is clumsily and crudely taken to mean, a kind of accounting where transgressors

04:57.240 --> 05:08.560
must be called to task and made to pay, because apparently wrongdoing is a banking system. This

05:08.680 --> 05:19.680
sort of insanity, this, this branch on the upside down burning tree of ignorance, flagrantly

05:19.680 --> 05:35.560
masquerading as propriety, purity is perennially horrifying. We see the results today in specific

05:35.560 --> 05:50.320
conflicts, I will not hear name. We see this reenacted, devastating, nonsense masquerading as

05:50.320 --> 05:59.080
justification, wherever that may happen. And it happens in me. I'm familiar with the stink of

05:59.080 --> 06:06.000
this, the fingerprint, the poison, yeah, the poisoned fingerprint of my own thumb at the

06:06.000 --> 06:14.280
beginning of some crime scene where I decide vengeance will be mine. Retribution will be the

06:14.280 --> 06:28.520
spirit of the day, you know. And it's not that there's no place for that. Rather, its place should

06:28.520 --> 06:43.480
be rare at best, at most, and funded by brilliant insight, not regimented ignorance, structured

06:43.480 --> 06:59.600
into rules and laws and things. You know, the quest is for understanding exceptionally profuse

06:59.600 --> 07:10.840
throat clearing, apparently. Honking in the interception. And throwing the children off the

07:10.840 --> 07:22.080
bridge into the river to teach them to swim. Just had to get the little ones in there because,

07:22.080 --> 07:28.720
you know, apparently everyone forgets they're alive or pretends that something else is going on.

07:28.720 --> 07:38.800
Not everyone, but the collectives definitely. Just like children who cares, boom, guns, blow it up.

07:38.800 --> 07:52.760
Destroy those mothers for the sake of some declaration. Bliterate them, blood and gore,

07:52.760 --> 08:03.160
fields of broken bones, chaos. Yeah, if that's the mark of sanity or intelligence among the humans,

08:03.520 --> 08:11.800
then get me off this planet, please. Which, you know, for many sensitive and intelligent children is

08:11.800 --> 08:21.200
the slogan they'd wear on their t-shirt. How could I have been born on a planet where the humans

08:21.200 --> 08:28.200
treat each other like a lawn that just needs a good mowing? And yet, at the same time, there's

08:28.240 --> 08:43.960
clearly some truth behind that delusion. The idea of harrowing that we find in certain

08:43.960 --> 08:54.720
misconstrued biblical texts is nonetheless important. We do actually not eat the chaff of the wheat.

08:55.720 --> 09:04.000
We eat the tender seed inside it and are thus nourished and our generations are rejuvenated by the

09:04.000 --> 09:13.080
magic they're in. Meanwhile, the highly sensitive person sees the box of cream of wheat as cream of

09:13.080 --> 09:22.280
wheat. The screaming of the plants as they're sited in the fields, back when we used to actually have

09:22.320 --> 09:38.960
to manually harvest food for grain. Meanwhile, these people are feeding ducks bread, which, you know,

09:38.960 --> 09:44.120
maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Pretty sure that those straight-up carbs are

09:44.160 --> 09:54.280
poisoned to waterfowl, but these are city waterfowl, so who knows? And why should I trust my own biases

09:54.280 --> 10:02.520
and judgments? The world is complicated. It's like a million spiderwebs intersecting and you try to,

10:02.520 --> 10:12.640
what? Determine the value of the intersections via some combination of emotional valence and rational

10:12.680 --> 10:23.040
thought. Okay. Hopefully the emotional valence is actually there and veritable and not just the

10:23.040 --> 10:28.120
result of doubling down on previous biases and resentments and triggerings and so forth.

10:28.120 --> 10:39.440
The dopamine ratchet, right? The neurochemical ratcheting that we undergo via media and spectacle

10:40.400 --> 10:53.200
Facebook, Twitter. I mean, what a more ironic, you know, the collective mangling of intelligence

10:54.160 --> 11:14.800
of many twits. A crowd of twits. Of course, there are brilliant voices in the morass. There are

11:14.800 --> 11:22.160
those of us who, well, I counted myself among them. Did you see, see what I did there? There are those

11:22.240 --> 11:34.200
of us who courageously and steadfastly hold the line in the cataclysm of ignorance and

11:34.200 --> 11:49.680
opinionation we call social media today. I'm actually trying to understand that one of the

11:49.680 --> 11:59.200
things that became clear to me when I listened to the dulcet tones of my friend Tim this morning

12:00.720 --> 12:05.920
was just how that he doesn't stray from his embodiment when he speaks. And when he says I

12:05.920 --> 12:11.120
couldn't, you know, I appreciated and sort of, he doesn't say I'm putting words in his mouth,

12:11.120 --> 12:18.160
but he meant something that resembles I revered beautiful examples of intellectualism and

12:19.120 --> 12:25.520
in academia, but I couldn't, I couldn't, I'm not, I'm not a library of Alexandria. I'm a dreamer.

12:27.440 --> 12:33.920
And what's so beautiful about that is that comes to mind for me that I take from it is a couple

12:33.920 --> 12:41.280
of things right away, a couple of things immediately. And the first is that the origin of the possibility

12:41.360 --> 12:47.040
of memory and intelligence lies in dreaming dreaming.

12:51.840 --> 12:52.480
It is the

12:55.440 --> 13:04.240
the activity of angels in our minds that tend the gardens of memory so that they

13:05.680 --> 13:09.040
flourish and thrive and blossom and fruit.

13:12.240 --> 13:20.720
That imagination he speaks of is primordially fundamental. And there's no such thing as

13:20.720 --> 13:26.640
intellect without it. So what he's really saying is in my view is I revere

13:30.240 --> 13:39.680
the primordial origins from which the possibilities of intellect spring. I remain true to these.

13:39.680 --> 13:50.080
I adore these. I belong to these, to them, to their spirit, to their action, to their bodies.

13:50.080 --> 14:00.640
I am theirs. They are mine. We are one. And that's profound. Beautiful. I agree. I contrasted myself.

14:00.640 --> 14:10.480
I was like, after singing the praises of his failure to dissociate into his intellect,

14:12.000 --> 14:21.680
I talked about my own weaknesses of such a form where

14:21.680 --> 14:31.920
my intellect is like a UFO and I wake up in the morning and it's glowing there in the center

14:31.920 --> 14:41.600
of the room. And I trace the sigils on the unbroken surface of this egg-shaped sphere.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.320
A door appears with blinding light surrounding it.

14:46.320 --> 14:56.080
It becomes a portal. I step in and, fume, I'm out of my body. I'm in wild, transcendental,

14:56.880 --> 15:09.280
dissociative ecstasies far above my mundane soma, my flesh, my nervous system, my bones,

15:09.280 --> 15:17.120
my organs. And they're like, wait, what just happened here? Darren is already dead?

15:22.560 --> 15:29.840
Because that's sort of what's going on. I'm, in a way, untransported.

15:30.160 --> 15:42.400
I'm in the spirit world before my passing. I'm seeing from after my death back into my life.

15:44.800 --> 15:52.000
And it doesn't require drugs. It just requires ideas and language and my passionate fascination

15:52.000 --> 16:02.320
with focus and my adoration of their mystery and horror and splendor and potential.

16:07.760 --> 16:16.880
In a way, I long ago and without really the use of drugs. In fact, in the most sober

16:17.520 --> 16:29.760
epochs of my life as a young adult and in my 30s, I knew the kisses of the muses.

16:31.600 --> 16:40.240
And I didn't know what to call it, because this is the true state of blissful naivete,

16:40.960 --> 16:52.960
where you haven't been separated from it. It hasn't been taken from you. So you have no way

16:52.960 --> 17:00.880
to refer to it, because there's no need to refer to it. It's not separate, right?

17:01.360 --> 17:11.680
Right? The reference comes after the divorce, after the abstraction, after the loss, after the fall.

17:14.720 --> 17:21.760
I mean, any of us who have sought wisdom, oh my god, what an ironic,

17:22.080 --> 17:32.080
what an ironic situation we will find ourselves in. Any of us who have sought wisdom

17:34.880 --> 17:43.840
and tasted of the nectars of her mouth. Thilo, so kissing, kissing. That saliva,

17:44.800 --> 17:53.600
the trophallaxis, which is the transmission of hormones and nutrients among hymenoptera,

17:54.560 --> 18:00.880
the ants, the bees, the wasps, often between species, not often, sometimes.

18:01.520 --> 18:08.240
Right? Sometimes ants and wasps may exchange trophallactic

18:10.720 --> 18:15.680
nectars, and they call them. There's no word in English.

18:20.080 --> 18:27.120
They are trans-sigenic. They come before the generation of minds. They're primordial,

18:27.120 --> 18:42.880
and there's nectars, elixirs, filters, P-H-I-L, T-R-E-S, I think. They're sometimes spelled, E-R-S.

18:44.720 --> 18:52.160
Yeah, I was having congress with the muses before I understood they existed formally,

18:53.040 --> 19:01.760
before I knew how to speak of it, and they were reforging my mind and my dreaming,

19:03.600 --> 19:14.880
resurrecting them moment to moment in my waking life, in my creative life, in my writing,

19:15.840 --> 19:22.240
and my creative play, my music, literally music,

19:26.640 --> 19:27.440
my quests.

19:32.960 --> 19:38.080
And so, you know, I learned to kind of look down on ceremonial magic,

19:38.160 --> 19:49.920
because there's feral enchantments that seem to me to far exceed the possibilities of structured

19:49.920 --> 19:59.280
representation, ritual, and so forth. And when you have those, you would never trade them for

20:02.560 --> 20:03.920
the bones of the thing.

20:08.960 --> 20:16.320
But these days, that magic is much more rare than it was in my youth. And so,

20:20.160 --> 20:31.520
I know, intimately, the body and wings of my intellect, and

20:31.520 --> 20:42.080
I will gladly depart the graveyard of my waking mind for the skies beyond it.

20:45.600 --> 20:53.120
Though I only fairly recently came to understand I was doing this, it was so natural, my trepidation

20:53.680 --> 21:01.520
of incarnate existence and somato-emotional

21:01.920 --> 21:06.320
hystericity.

21:12.800 --> 21:19.520
Yeah, like a layered archaia, a layered archaia of my

21:19.920 --> 21:31.680
confusions, losses, injuries, sufferings, subjugations, enslavements,

21:34.880 --> 21:43.760
all inflected, inflected with by, with and by the peculiarly weird

21:44.400 --> 21:51.840
perspective from outside the personal, the

21:54.960 --> 22:02.160
bizarre perspective that generates some of the branches on the trees of psychosis, paranoia,

22:03.120 --> 22:13.840
self-criticism, the possibility of social critique, of public critique, of how others

22:13.840 --> 22:25.920
might have seen me, of how the others of myself might direct the cruel illuminations of critical

22:26.000 --> 22:36.880
judgment. And this is part of why I say that is not now and never shall be justice.

22:39.840 --> 22:52.240
Condemnation and justice have nearly nothing in common. For justice, it seems to me, must be

22:52.240 --> 23:03.040
the, now I'm going to get in trouble here because I'm going to make structured language about

23:03.040 --> 23:13.600
something that has to be fluidly transcendent in its natures and in actions. It must have a body

23:14.560 --> 23:17.920
that isn't conceptual, that isn't linguistic.

23:23.200 --> 23:27.280
All right, but I'll dare. I mean, it's the first part of my name, right? Dare in.

23:30.320 --> 23:38.400
Don't get named this. If you want to get born as a human, don't go here. I was actually named

23:38.400 --> 23:46.000
for Bobby Darin, a singer, one of Melodious Voice. And when I was little, I used to sing all the

23:46.000 --> 23:51.120
time and my parents would constantly try to make me stop, but I was actually fairly good at it.

23:53.440 --> 23:58.640
These days, I'm older and unpracticed, but I would love, I used to sing in a choir, singing is really,

23:59.600 --> 24:06.400
that's so funny, a choir. In any case, where I'm going here is that

24:08.720 --> 24:17.600
actual justice uses the problems that emerge in what we might think of as criminal behavior

24:17.600 --> 24:27.520
that we would hold some individual god to account for. Okay, wow. Now, there's sort of at least

24:27.520 --> 24:35.040
two different meanings of account here. One is to explain to us, right? Help us understand

24:35.840 --> 24:43.280
your motivations. That's one kind of an account. But the other kind is we will

24:46.480 --> 24:53.520
debit to you. We will debit your life. We will, we will subtract from you relationships, time,

24:53.520 --> 25:00.240
freedom, as if what we have in our modern societies even slightly resembles freedom.

25:01.040 --> 25:05.040
But it does compared to being in a, you know, a stone box.

25:10.560 --> 25:15.520
So yeah, this debiting, this accounting, which is

25:16.160 --> 25:27.760
the very absence of humanity, intelligence, insight, awareness, justice, truth, the virtues.

25:29.120 --> 25:37.920
It is a catastrophic abeyance of virtue and understanding.

25:37.920 --> 25:43.120
So as I've said many times before,

25:52.960 --> 26:00.160
what we ache for when injustice has taken place is not punishment.

26:01.120 --> 26:15.760
We ache for the subtraction from the world of the forces, ideas, and situations, the traps

26:16.320 --> 26:30.240
that led what we call the perpetrator to enact the quote crime,

26:30.240 --> 26:38.720
unquote. And we've been confused

26:42.160 --> 26:48.480
to desire further poison. We've been poisoned. The poison killed our heart.

26:49.120 --> 26:55.680
And now we want to make a small poison and poison a million hearts. Poison the future,

26:55.680 --> 27:01.680
poison history. Just lay waste

27:04.560 --> 27:12.720
to the origins of our humanity, our souls, virtue, understanding, awareness. What we really want

27:15.360 --> 27:24.480
is the context to be healed so that such crimes become not nearly unnecessary,

27:25.200 --> 27:33.440
but impossible. Right? That's what justice looks like. It looks like using the intelligence we

27:33.440 --> 27:42.880
can derive from the perpetrator as the symptom of something wrong in the water of our communal

27:43.600 --> 27:50.720
identity or failure to establish it, to sustain it, truly.

27:54.080 --> 28:05.200
Wow. These people are making floral reeds. I'm so jealous. It's awesome.

28:06.160 --> 28:15.520
Oh my god, what's the, uh, is this a Greek symbol on the blanket? Sure looks like it.

28:22.960 --> 28:28.000
It's amazing. They're actually being human together. It's fucking awesome. I love this.

28:28.320 --> 28:38.880
By the way, you know, one form of justice is, doesn't concern itself with history at all.

28:39.520 --> 28:46.320
It concerns itself with re-beautifying the present in such a way that the, that the integrity

28:47.120 --> 28:55.280
and profound beauty of the future becomes repossibilized, right? Resurrected from its,

28:55.280 --> 29:02.400
you know, cascade of falling off 19 different cliffs of vengeful stupidity and ignorance.

29:07.280 --> 29:12.960
Yeah, that's what they're doing up there. That's celebration. I don't know the etymology

29:14.000 --> 29:20.320
of the word justice or the word crime or perpetrator or celebration.

29:21.280 --> 29:28.080
Um, I understand alphabetically some things about these words, but I'm not going to, uh,

29:28.080 --> 29:37.600
descend into that labyrinth at the moment. Rather, I will stay in the path. But what those humans up

29:37.600 --> 29:46.080
there are doing with their laughter, amituality and joyful, communality and floral, you know,

29:46.080 --> 29:52.960
breathing each other's, literally their heads, right? They're breathing each other's heads with

29:52.960 --> 30:02.080
flowers. Think about what this actually means, all right? It's very astonishing because on the one

30:02.080 --> 30:12.400
hand they are breathing their heads with magical substances comprised over trillions and trillions

30:12.400 --> 30:22.800
of lifetimes of these plants, without which we would not exist. So these plants are the progenitors.

30:22.800 --> 30:29.920
In a sense, the fairies are, the fairies and the elves are the spirits of these plants and their

30:29.920 --> 30:35.520
relationships and their histories with the land and the mountains and the skies and the waters. Okay?

30:36.480 --> 30:48.480
Um, so they are breathing each other's heads just for a moment in joyful, mutual celebration

30:49.520 --> 30:55.840
and promotion, right? They are raising each other up in the light of the sun on the top of the

30:55.920 --> 31:02.640
Strawberry Hill in San Francisco, the place, you know, named after Francis of Assisi,

31:04.480 --> 31:13.040
who probably actually was amazingly virtuous and brilliant and perhaps even wholly human being,

31:13.040 --> 31:20.560
regardless of, you know, the fact, yeah, has nothing to do with the fact of the association,

31:20.560 --> 31:28.000
the, the cohort, yeah, what, which cohorts we would associate him with and why, right? I mean,

31:28.000 --> 31:35.920
it could have a little to do with it, but yeah, it's just, so yeah, they're up there

31:35.920 --> 31:43.280
breathing each other's heads and drinking wine and celebrating and laughing and loving each other

31:44.240 --> 31:50.320
and being human together. Wow, what a healing moment and notice that it's not

31:50.320 --> 31:57.360
formal, it's not a ritual that they're enacting. It's spontaneous, it's improvised

31:59.120 --> 32:04.160
and, you know, it's probably someone's birthday or maybe someone was just married or maybe someone

32:04.160 --> 32:12.880
had a child or maybe they were just like, hey, you know, it's Saturday, it's Saturn,

32:12.880 --> 32:26.640
it's the day of Saturn, that S, S-T-R, right? Sigma Tau Rho, as Amu would say, yeah, Sigma Tau Rho.

32:27.360 --> 32:37.920
Yeah, so beautiful and inspiring and evocative of memory. They are breathing each other's

32:37.920 --> 32:47.040
foreheads with flowers and one of them knows how to do this in an expert way. They have probably

32:47.040 --> 32:55.680
hemp vines or strings that are being soaked in a liquid to make them especially pliable

32:57.360 --> 33:04.080
and they had just baskets of flowers to weave into the vines. So brilliant.

33:05.760 --> 33:12.960
So one of the kinds of justice is that we go forward from here in remembrance of mutual beauty

33:12.960 --> 33:24.080
and origin. Think about that, right? No historical damnations, indictments, because think about

33:24.080 --> 33:31.440
this. If you have to preserve the history of wrongdoing as you walk forward into life and

33:31.440 --> 33:38.560
the potentials of your more than merely human life, if you have to preserve all those indictments and

33:39.600 --> 33:47.920
you know, equivocate over them and punish them and wow, the problem with that is there are certain

33:47.920 --> 33:56.000
kinds of burden that get heavier by a matter of, you know, geometric expansion, right? Like

33:57.760 --> 34:06.640
exponential, they get exponentially heavier each moment that you continue to preserve them.

34:07.600 --> 34:15.360
And we don't notice this because the urge to preserve them is one of the lethal games that

34:15.360 --> 34:21.840
smuggled into our consciousness along with the process, you know, during the processes of

34:21.840 --> 34:27.680
in-languaging and in-culturation as children. We think that English comes with no baggage.

34:28.560 --> 34:33.360
Nothing like that is even possibly true. The opposite is true. There are, you know,

34:37.520 --> 34:41.200
there are vast warehouses of lethal

34:45.760 --> 34:52.640
tropes, right? Figures of speech, metaphor, simile.

34:59.680 --> 35:07.120
I was trying to think of some, but I'm not, I'm not dwelling in the warehouses at the moment.

35:07.120 --> 35:12.400
I'm dwelling above them, so it's hard for me to dip down and grab exemplars.

35:16.080 --> 35:24.800
All kinds of courtroom mine tropes,

35:27.840 --> 35:34.720
war mine tropes, vengeance tropes, but just think of how

35:35.280 --> 35:41.520
metabolically, energetically, and spiritually expensive it is to preserve harms. And some will

35:41.520 --> 35:50.160
say, well, you can't just ignore them. Okay, maybe, maybe, sometimes. But actually, you can do this

35:50.160 --> 35:56.000
thing that's transcendentally useful, which is not to take offense in the first place.

35:56.800 --> 36:02.240
And if you've noticed you've taken offense, you're going to have to carry that. You sure you want

36:02.240 --> 36:07.360
that? Do you go to the store ever? Did you ever once go to the mall or the grocery store and find

36:07.440 --> 36:13.760
the most disgusting, heaviest thing you could find, right? A box of rotten, dead rat corpses or

36:13.760 --> 36:18.640
something, right? Huge box, weighs like three tons, and you carry that thing home and you drag it

36:18.640 --> 36:24.960
along with you for the rest of your, not once, ever did you do this, right? So why do we do this

36:24.960 --> 36:31.280
psycho-emotionally? Why do we decide to take offense? It's the most expensive thing you could take,

36:32.000 --> 36:35.440
and it grows catastrophically more expensive the longer you preserve it.

36:37.600 --> 36:43.840
And I hear, you know, in the background, the voices of those of us who have suffered actual

36:44.720 --> 36:50.880
indignities and catastrophic harms or rape or, you know, horrifying violence or murder.

36:53.680 --> 36:59.440
I hear their voices saying, what shall we just forget it? No. But what are we going to do with it?

37:00.240 --> 37:03.120
What will we make of it? The fact that I got,

37:04.880 --> 37:10.400
the fact that something that happened to me was horrifyingly bad. I mean, recently something

37:10.400 --> 37:20.000
happened that I definitely took offense to. A doctor, specifically a doctor at Ocean Park Health

37:20.000 --> 37:29.120
Center, Chan, overtly denied that an episode in my medical history ever took place. This didn't

37:29.120 --> 37:39.440
happen. And I was like, first of all, who are you again? It'd be like someone saying, you know,

37:42.320 --> 37:48.080
that a mother didn't give birth to her child or, but she never had a child or something. Not that

37:48.080 --> 37:52.960
my injury is my child. I'm not trying to make that association. I'm just saying that it actually

37:52.960 --> 37:58.400
took place that I was treated for a specific illness by a specific doctor at a specific time.

37:59.120 --> 38:07.680
And she's overtly said, nope, never happened. Can't have happened. There's no such diagnosis,

38:07.680 --> 38:13.840
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I found it very offensive. I wrote her a letter saying, you know,

38:13.840 --> 38:22.160
this is alarming your behavior. I'm not sure that a doctor, I mean, you can see why, you know,

38:22.160 --> 38:32.720
why I was offended. But in this moment as I'm remembering this experience, which I conceive

38:32.720 --> 38:41.120
of as a violation, right, the whole of my identity begins to collapse into something that can be

38:41.120 --> 38:50.560
violated. Is that liberty? Is that virtue? Is that intelligence? Is that insight? Is that truth?

38:53.280 --> 39:00.080
Why would I even take the time to take offense? Now, in some cases,

39:02.400 --> 39:07.840
it's reasonable for us to assert what we today talk about as boundaries.

39:11.440 --> 39:20.160
But if this becomes our fascination, whoa, W-O-E be unto us. If our fascination

39:21.840 --> 39:27.600
and our obsession becomes the maintenance of boundaries in a world of real and imagined

39:27.600 --> 39:33.360
violations, our humanity will collapse into an uninhabitable skeleton of

39:34.000 --> 39:43.120
a doubt, confusion, despair. We must live beyond what happens to us and our possible

39:43.120 --> 39:53.280
interpretations. And we also must speak up when a violation is tangibly real and not just imagined

39:53.280 --> 40:03.280
or a projection. But again, the obsession with, I'm just a magnet for the violation of, you know,

40:03.280 --> 40:13.040
whatever it may be, isn't a livable identity. There's not enough there, inside there, to dwell in it.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
So I certainly recognize

40:22.480 --> 40:23.200
the urge.

40:28.800 --> 40:34.800
In some cases, for something resembling redress of wrongdoing,

40:35.200 --> 40:39.840
but it's a very, very dangerous

40:43.280 --> 40:51.200
balancing game. And most often in modern society, that game becomes malignant quickly.

40:52.320 --> 40:55.040
We have the wrong idea. We think there are individuals.

40:55.520 --> 41:03.360
There's all kinds of ridiculous, pre-existing

41:04.080 --> 41:11.440
conditionality that is nonsensical. And as the result of the terrifying reflections of

41:13.280 --> 41:20.400
isolation, which could be literally understood as meaning, I am so late.

41:21.360 --> 41:28.160
I am behind time. Time is way ahead of me. Relation is way ahead of me. I am alone.

41:29.280 --> 41:34.960
And my cohort is far, it's so far ahead of me that I don't belong to it anymore.

41:36.480 --> 41:45.520
I so late, I on. That I on means a self and also a particle and possibly a particle that

41:45.520 --> 41:55.840
transmits or preserves something in the sense that I am here highlighting creatively.

41:55.840 --> 42:16.480
There's so much for us to learn and recover and celebrate. We should be very careful.

42:17.440 --> 42:22.880
Life is short. Existence is brief. We should make it beautiful together,

42:22.880 --> 42:26.960
within for each other in the history and future of life and our peoples.

42:28.720 --> 42:36.000
Fundamentally, these are one people, one family. It's all there is on this tiny little rock.

42:37.120 --> 42:45.520
It's moist rock floating around in time space. This is our home. This is our body. These are

42:45.520 --> 42:56.080
our people. There's no other people. And the idea of the individual as we ridiculously are

42:56.080 --> 43:04.640
tortured by it today. People are like, oh, he's a fucking communist. No. Like, how many of your

43:04.640 --> 43:11.040
cells in your body are individuals? Let me ask you this. Does it matter at all?

43:11.040 --> 43:30.000
Does their individuality matter at all if the body dies? What are you going to make of their individuality then?

43:41.920 --> 43:56.640
It's funny, the photograph I've just taken will probably become the photo I use

43:56.640 --> 44:10.240
for this recording later.

44:26.960 --> 44:38.800
This idea of individuals and their rights is exemplary of the loss of communal meat,

44:38.800 --> 44:46.000
of the context, of the meaningful context of our humanity over time.

44:46.160 --> 44:57.200
As our context became abstract, representational, commercial, domineering, viral,

44:58.080 --> 45:06.880
frisbee, falsifications of the possibility of communal, meaningful communal experience,

45:06.880 --> 45:14.880
roles, identity, behavior. So one of the things I saw up on top of the mountain

45:15.920 --> 45:20.800
or the little hill, Strawberry Hill, was a reenaction of that possibility.

45:21.600 --> 45:27.840
However brief and ephemeral, not even more powerful for all of its brevity,

45:28.560 --> 45:37.280
even more powerful for its inability to fundamentally change. It's like

45:42.640 --> 45:50.000
it's one droplet in an ocean, but that droplet shines so brightly that the entire ocean is

45:50.000 --> 46:01.200
transformed in its spirit, if not its physical activity. So those droplets matter. That's

46:01.200 --> 46:11.440
what I call real. It's easy to forget this because we look in our modernity and we see

46:11.440 --> 46:24.320
a trillion, I'm going to stop saying my pause phrase, we see a trillion violations.

46:27.200 --> 46:34.560
I'll just pick one, microplastics. Trillion violations per second. What can we do?

46:35.120 --> 46:44.320
Is there even a we to do things? No, there isn't. And if we form a we to do things,

46:46.000 --> 46:50.080
it's going to be like attempting to eat the moon or swallow the ocean, won't it?

46:52.800 --> 46:57.440
And so it seems that the possibility of enacting change is pre-prohibited.

46:58.160 --> 47:04.560
There's no real way. And a number of my friends have spoken to me about this.

47:06.320 --> 47:12.480
I'll mention particularly Sean, who is working with PAWS AI

47:14.880 --> 47:21.280
and express his despair. What can we do? We can't stop it.

47:21.840 --> 47:30.720
And I explained to him the principle that I was orbiting here, which is that

47:31.840 --> 47:39.040
when we live beautiful lives and we witness and speak together for each other for the history

47:39.040 --> 47:46.640
and future of life on our world and of beings of all beings, when this is done with authenticity

47:46.640 --> 48:00.240
and passion and love, that always matters. It's not necessarily that the gods, that the victors

48:00.240 --> 48:04.160
in a situation are favored of the gods as we might imagine.

48:07.680 --> 48:14.720
And there's something above the gods, above the gods. There's something beyond the gods,

48:15.680 --> 48:21.440
that even they must obey. And this is the principle for which they executed Socrates.

48:23.840 --> 48:33.200
But he dared, they used him of atheism because he said something resembling

48:34.720 --> 48:40.160
that even the gods must obey the spirit of truth. Even the gods are subject to this.

48:40.800 --> 48:50.960
And this was the spear point they used for his indictment and prosecution.

48:53.840 --> 48:54.960
He was an oracle.

49:00.560 --> 49:08.400
He was a male oracle. But instead of declaring wisdom, he fomented it.

49:08.400 --> 49:17.200
He fermented it among the people. He would bring them together in the Quora and ferment

49:18.320 --> 49:21.600
the nectar of wisdom from within their hearts and spirits.

49:25.680 --> 49:32.400
And this made him lethal to the fictions that then ruled Athens.

49:32.640 --> 49:42.560
The warmongers, the weapon makers, Plato's parents, Plato's father, his brothers, his family.

49:48.000 --> 49:53.280
We should take these matters gravely with grave seriousness and attend them carefully.

49:53.600 --> 50:04.480
The possibilities of the spirit of democracy, the spirits from which democracy originated,

50:05.680 --> 50:13.120
those possibilities still exist today. Unenacted, overlooked, falsified, counterfeited.

50:15.920 --> 50:22.160
And democracy doesn't just mean the voting of idiots. It's not the idea at all.

50:23.520 --> 50:30.400
It's, I don't actually know what it is, but I can say how I conceive of it, which is the communal

50:31.520 --> 50:38.080
preservation and purification of the context of our relationships, such that it becomes possible

50:39.920 --> 50:46.080
to not merely know what is true and good and do that, but also to avoid

50:46.960 --> 50:54.240
what is lethal and malignant and destroys history in the future and falsifies it and counterfeits

50:54.240 --> 50:59.760
it and sells us the remains of it at ever-increasing prices, destroying the mothers and the children

50:59.760 --> 51:06.560
and the fathers and the ancestors and the progeny. That must be avoided.

51:06.560 --> 51:19.520
So these are my thoughts for the day. I'm grateful to have this opportunity to speak them

51:19.520 --> 51:26.080
and share them with you. I hope you find them inspiring and that you are inspired enough to

51:26.080 --> 51:37.040
become historical, perhaps to learn the ancient Greek and other ancient languages,

51:37.040 --> 51:43.920
but particularly the Greek, and to ask questions of the oracles, to ask the imperative questions that

51:43.920 --> 51:50.480
you brought to your human incarnation and your more than human existence, your more than merely

51:50.480 --> 52:00.960
human existence, that is precious and noble in its essence, that is beautiful in its origin

52:03.520 --> 52:11.760
and transcendental in its natures. May your paths and relations, questions and dreams be blessed.

52:11.760 --> 52:15.040
Alive for now.
