0	6000	Great to see you again, Lee. I'm so happy.
6000	10000	Great to see you again, Darren.
10000	13000	I'm really excited. There's so much to cover.
13000	20000	We'll probably, we'll be sort of continuing along the lines that we established in our previous conversation.
20000	21000	Yeah.
21000	26000	And let's see here. So,
26000	33000	sort of where we left off, we were talking a little bit about
33000	37000	how it's possible.
37000	49000	A process that resembles the caterpillar going into a priceless right where, where, where you can sort of liquefy the structure of history and the self.
49000	54000	And then reforge it, maybe without some of the impediments.
54000	55000	Right.
55000	58000	But it was
58000	62000	perhaps carrying historically and struggling with.
62000	63000	Yeah.
63000	66000	And we can return to therapy.
66000	71000	I just want to sort of bookmark that idea.
71000	82000	But there's a, so there's a, there's a span in your story previously that I'd like to revisit, which is the span between your walk.
82000	86000	And when you begin to
86000	89000	enter
89000	104000	the learning process that I think starts with NLP goes to hypnosis goes to mesmerism and then circles back maybe to the walk and the events during it.
104000	105000	Right. Okay.
105000	106000	Yeah.
106000	116000	Okay. So maybe if you can help prompt me, because I'll be coming up with a lot of a lot of things here, which will be quite free form, but
116000	125000	so we spoke about in the previous interview or conversation, I prefer to put it really that we did.
125000	135000	There was the coast to coast walk that I mentioned and the particular section called the like wake walk, which I, which was particularly important.
135000	148000	That's where I had my, what I'll call my Milky Way experience, where I had the experience of connecting the heavens and the earth through my through my physical body.
148000	154000	It was a very visceral experience.
154000	162000	And after this walk, as I mentioned, returning back to London where I was living at the time.
162000	166000	So like I say, this was around 1990.
166000	178000	I ended up having, I was catapulted into a, into a kind of what they would call in the alchemical tradition kind of like a niggerado state.
178000	191000	So I felt a bit a little bit like everything was disintegrating like, like I've been ripped open and my psychic skin was really raw and bare.
191000	201000	I was able to sense everything around me, the vibrations of all of the people around me.
201000	207000	But in an uncomfortable way, when I returned from doing that walk, which was a very joyous experience.
207000	212000	It was, you know, an incredibly joyous experience doing that walk.
212000	218000	Like I say, returning to the city, returning to London at that time, very, very difficult.
218000	229000	The important thing is, is that during, during that time, like I say, it was almost like entering into a type of depressive state.
229000	239000	But it also felt like I had terrible flu. So it was all, it was almost like a physical state as well.
239000	247000	But as I was coming out of this, I started to come out of this, due to a series of dreams that I started to have.
247000	254000	This is where dreams become really important in this whole scenario we're speaking about.
254000	266000	So I started to have lots of dreams and in, in this, in these dreams, I think I touched on this in the previous part, but I didn't go into great detail.
266000	275000	In these dreams, I, there was a specific hill that was in these dreams.
275000	283000	It was very, very characteristic. So it was the kind of thing that stuck in my head and it was a recurring dream as well.
283000	296000	And from the top of the hill, I looked down the hill and there was some cornfields and there was a river flowing through the cornfields.
296000	308000	And I even could see, because of the dreams, because my encounters with a particular figure in these dreams that I found, there was a boat.
308000	320000	And it was on a river. And this river was within the cornfield that I could see down in the sloping valley in the veil seen from this particular hill.
320000	327000	And inside this boat was a goddess-like figure, a feminine figure.
327000	333000	And every time I got into the boat with her, we would go for a ride.
333000	337000	And every night, we would go a little further.
337000	351000	And this ride down the river was going from the vision of the hill, from the view of the hill looking down, the river flowed left to the left.
351000	361000	So I got into the boat with her and every time I woke up, I felt an immense surge of healing energy.
361000	366000	So this dream, I noticed, was beginning to act as a kind of medicine.
366000	370000	It was healing me every single night, every night that I had the dream.
370000	374000	I was looking forwards to actually being back there again.
374000	378000	And sure enough, every now and again, it kept coming back.
378000	382000	And this dream would just heal me a little bit more.
382000	388000	And this is what got me out of whatever it was I was in at the time.
389000	399000	Do you have any impression about, how did you think about the woman, the boat and the river, but particularly the woman about her identity?
399000	403000	Was it a matter of concern to you?
403000	404000	Weirdly no.
404000	417000	I just knew that she represented some kind of divine feminine force, that she was somehow a personification of nature that I was meeting in this boat.
417000	426000	And that's all that really concerned me.
426000	430000	Can you describe her from your recollection?
430000	435000	I mean, maybe she doesn't have a specific appearance, but what do you recall?
435000	438000	Well, I do recall that she had long hair.
438000	441000	I do recall that she had a long dress.
441000	443000	I think it was white.
443000	450000	If I remember, I don't have full recollection of that.
450000	454000	The Dreaming Mind is a wooden rowing boat, I remember that.
454000	464000	Yeah, the Dreaming Mind isn't as concerned with what we might think of as particulars.
464000	471000	But it was a cornfield, that I find significant, the fact that it was a cornfield.
471000	478000	And this takes place looking down from Nap Hill.
478000	482000	That's right, that's right, but I didn't know it was called Nap Hill.
482000	483000	I see.
483000	493000	Now, I've mentioned this to you obviously in private, but the thing is, is I had no idea who this person was.
493000	497000	I had no idea where this place was.
497000	500000	It was a dream.
500000	510000	But you see, in 1994, in the summer, I think it was the summer of 1994, there was a couple of friends of mine.
510000	515000	I used to work on markets in London.
515000	525000	I used to sell old 50s rock and roll collectible records and 60s psychedelic stuff and things like that.
525000	537000	A couple of my friends there, I got chatting with them on the stall and they just said to me,
537000	542000	they knew I had a van and we had similar interests, we discovered.
542000	548000	And they said, should we take a trip out to the West Country, would you take us?
548000	550000	I said, sure, you know, I'd love to do that.
550000	555000	So we got in the van and went looking for crop circles.
555000	558000	So this is in the summer of 1994.
558000	562000	And whereabouts are you when you're on this journey?
562000	566000	Yeah, you mean in terms of geography?
566000	567000	Where are you going?
567000	577000	Right, OK, so we got in the car in the van and we drove out of London and went over to the area of Avebury,
577000	583000	which is, you know, a really amazing place for those who've never been there.
583000	585000	Look it up.
585000	590000	It's in Wiltshire, which is in the West Country.
590000	597000	And we were looking around for all of these crop circles.
597000	608000	And we found one or two that day around Avebury, around sort of in that vicinity in the fields around.
608000	615000	Drive out of London to Avebury and you find crop circles just out there without even knowing where you're going.
615000	618000	There's no internet, right?
618000	620000	No, there was no internet.
620000	624000	Just venturing out in your van and you come across crop circles.
624000	628000	And I find that kind of surprising, but I'm listening, please continue.
628000	638000	Well, as the story actually goes, is the fact that we actually basically all three of us agreed that all of the crop circles we found that day.
638000	645000	I think it was two or three we saw were kind of just fake.
645000	650000	And it was kind of crop circle season.
650000	652000	Right. OK, I follow.
652000	664000	Yeah, so there were supposedly some around or so they'd heard, which is what spurred them on to want to go and do the, you know, do the trip.
664000	670000	So we went out there and all day we were looking for these things.
670000	676000	We found two or three, like I say, and but we weren't convinced.
676000	687000	They seemed a bit scrappy and a bit kind of, you know, like maybe some teenagers had knocked it up overnight, you know, sort of thing.
687000	690000	So we sort of were everyone was a bit disappointed.
690000	695000	We'd had a great trip out, but everyone was really tired and it was the end of the day.
695000	701000	We'd been traipsing around all day through these fields and cornfields and stuff.
701000	710000	And I just got this thought as a driver thought, oh, how about taking a different route?
710000	718000	Let's let's go just take a random route off and go up through another through another route another way.
718000	722000	Instead of going the main roads home, let's go off some some other way.
722000	731000	So we did this and I didn't really know the area apart from maybe a couple of the main routes around there.
731000	740000	And all of a sudden, like as we were going through all of these open planes.
740000	746000	I suddenly saw the way the road swooped up to the right.
746000	751000	There was a there was a track path coming away from the road.
751000	760000	And as soon as I saw this, I had this immense impetus, this impulse to just stop the car and get out and walk up that track.
760000	762000	So I did.
762000	767000	And of course they were really, really tired and they were they were complaining.
767000	771000	It's like, oh, we've not found anything you've been walking all day.
771000	774000	We're really, really tired.
774000	777000	And we were supposed to be on the way home.
777000	784000	So I said, you can wait here.
784000	787000	And so they did they waited in the van.
787000	790000	And I traipsed on up the track.
790000	798000	And so I got out got out of the van traipsed up the track and went to the top of this track, the top of the hill.
798000	807000	So when I got when I got to the top, I stood there and looked down across the hill.
807000	821000	Lo and behold, I was absolutely transfixed by the fact that what I had in front of me was exactly what I'd seen in my dreams.
821000	825000	At least five years earlier.
825000	830000	So back in, like I say, coming from the coast to coast back in 1990.
830000	836000	So about four or five years earlier, I'd seen this very, very place in my dreams.
836000	839000	You can't ignore that when that happens.
839000	845000	You're there looking at the scene and lo and behold, there is the there is the valley.
845000	854000	There is the river snaking through exactly the same place.
854000	862000	And while this is in my mind right now, I must mention this just in case it's not completed.
862000	869000	It's only about a month ago, I think just before our interview, the last interview we had.
869000	876000	That I met a lady through a mutual friend around here where I live.
877000	888000	And she actually revealed what I understand to be the actual name of this particular goddess that I'd come across.
888000	892000	Okay, this is the thing I was having for a pastime, right?
892000	896000	I sensed to like, she is someone who is she I'm listening at least.
896000	897000	Right.
897000	902000	Now, I feel it's maybe not the right circumstance to reveal that name.
902000	903000	Okay, I understand that.
903000	904000	Yeah.
904000	909000	And such things, there are some things that is important to keep private.
909000	910000	Yeah.
910000	912000	And also to not speak about.
912000	913000	That's right.
913000	914000	And I honor.
914000	918000	And you can feel that viscerally, you can feel, don't speak of it.
918000	919000	Yes, yes, good.
919000	921000	Yes, I honor this and understand.
921000	922000	Yeah.
922000	923000	But please continue.
923000	924000	I'm with you.
924000	933000	In actual fact, all I've mentioned up till this point, including the fact that there was this feminine figure, it was a goddess figure, it was there in the boat.
933000	935000	It was revealed in a dream.
935000	942000	These parts until very recently, I've had, I've had a do not speak about it.
942000	943000	Oh, wow.
943000	944000	Okay.
944000	946000	So what is only now I'm beginning to speak about it.
946000	947000	Wow.
947000	954000	So do you have any sense of what the change what changed that made you feel more comfortable to speak of it?
954000	958000	That's an interesting question.
958000	965000	In my physical body, my body is telling me it's okay to mention it.
965000	967000	It's a visceral sensation.
967000	973000	There's a stop feeling when you know that something is not the time to speak about it.
973000	987000	Yes, it's funny that you say that because, you know, we have this colloquialism in English, what we call the still small voice.
987000	988000	Right.
988000	989000	Right.
989000	996000	And also, I think, though I'm not an expert on this topic, Socrates is Daimon.
996000	997000	Yeah.
997000	1001000	What it primarily did was just say no.
1001000	1002000	Yeah.
1002000	1004000	Didn't tell him what to do.
1004000	1009000	It didn't have, they didn't have conversations, at least not in the records that we have.
1009000	1018000	And one thing that we know about it is it tells him just don't, this is, don't do this, or it might say, you made a mistake.
1018000	1019000	Yeah.
1019000	1020000	Yeah.
1020000	1026000	And so there's this interesting in my own experience with this a couple of times in my life.
1026000	1031000	I heard it tell me it, whatever it is, right.
1031000	1033000	Don't.
1033000	1037000	Just like, no.
1037000	1055000	And not, I've had other experiences of, you know, sort of a Daimonic intelligence or whatever, but I honor that. And I want to just mention that I have a close friend who works with neurodivergent people.
1055000	1056000	Yeah.
1056000	1062000	And her prime, one of her primary areas of expertise is a process called positive disintegration.
1062000	1063000	Okay.
1063000	1068000	And when you were talking about what took place when you returned to London.
1068000	1071000	It has the earmarks of this process.
1071000	1072000	Right.
1072000	1078000	And she talks about it as in, in a variety of senses, but it's, it's, it's quite fascinating.
1079000	1086000	Because she says that it's, it's a, it's a somatic array. It's an array of somatic intelligences.
1086000	1094000	And you talk about feeling that you had the flu, but you also talk about having these extra sensitivities where you can feel people's energy and things like this, right?
1094000	1095000	Yeah, yeah.
1095000	1104000	But it sort of has the earmarks of this process. I recognize from my recent discussion with her a similarity there.
1104000	1108000	Okay. So you've, you've met a woman somewhat recently.
1108000	1116000	She revealed to you, and I presume that when she revealed this, it was resonant. You were like, oh, or how did you feel?
1116000	1133000	Yeah, actually, I was absolutely gobsmacked because the very moment that and the odd thing is the fact that I was describing this specific place also caused a huge reaction and huge
1133000	1141000	explosion for her also, because she said that I can't believe the synchronicity of what you're describing to me.
1141000	1153000	She said it was literally just last night for the very first time that I was earmarking that very place you're telling me about to actually go and visit it.
1153000	1161000	And then she revealed to me the actual name of the, of this particular, of this particular goddess figure.
1161000	1170000	So it was kind of like a mutual, explosive, amazing sort of cross flow of information.
1170000	1176000	And yes, I definitely feel it's not the right time to talk about the name. I'm not saying that.
1176000	1180000	I'm not saying that just the sake of theory, you know, to be serious.
1180000	1194000	This is, this is trivial. What we're doing here is, I mean, it's beautiful and profound for me and, you know, but this is a, this is not the place for, for this kind of
1194000	1202000	I just honor the fact that there's some things we shouldn't speak openly and particularly publicly or even on recordings about.
1202000	1212000	Okay, so I mean, I just have a couple of questions about this. How did you come across this person? How long have you known them? What was the tell me something about that?
1212000	1222000	That's the peculiar thing. I'd never, well, actually, funnily enough, I'd, I'd seen this person a couple of times.
1222000	1235000	And, you know, there'd been an acknowledgement, like I was recognized and so on. But there'd been no interaction. And there's been no interaction since either.
1235000	1245000	It was purely just on this day I was there to meet someone else entirely. And it happened to be one of these talks over a coffee table that ended up sort of spilling out.
1245000	1254000	And oddly, you know, it somehow, probably because of the company I was in, the conversation turned in that direction.
1254000	1268000	And, and just strangely, these hugely important missing fragments of information that I'd been hanging on waiting for these extra pieces to arrive for years.
1268000	1288000	And this very much touches on something central to my own personal attitude towards receiving gnosis or, you know, how it happens with dreams, with actual encounters.
1288000	1297000	Whenever you receive anything what seems to be significant at the time, I take quite a, quite a detached approach to it.
1297000	1306000	I don't let myself get overattached or over excited by anything which seems significant.
1306000	1319000	What I tend to do is I tend to sort of earmark, earmark the events or earmark these things and put them put them on the shelf, so to speak.
1319000	1335000	To let them hang around because I have absolute faith or certainty in one way or another, that these things will be answered or I will understand their true significance, even if I have to wait years for it to happen.
1335000	1343000	And this was a really good example of what I'm saying because I take life as one whole, if you like.
1343000	1364000	So there are things that we can be experiencing now in our esoteric internal experiences, in our dreams, in our personal revelations of any kind, or synchronicities, significant synchronicity, which I have no doubt we will find the answers to.
1365000	1369000	20 years from now.
1369000	1374000	I have full faith in that. There's no rush about this.
1374000	1393000	So it's really interesting to hear you say this because I trust the wisdom of the intelligences in you that have this sense of no need to get super excited about this.
1393000	1405000	Put this on the shelf, let it sort of, I don't know what the word is, be enriched by time or sort of like age, let it age.
1405000	1414000	And then in time, it will become clear. The thing that I find funny about that is I'm completely the opposite and it gets me in trouble.
1414000	1422000	I get super excited, right? And so I can become so excited and enchanted that I get very spun up.
1422000	1428000	And then various things, it doesn't always lead to disaster, but sometimes it does, right?
1428000	1442000	I'm disoriented by the excitement and the enchantment. And when one is disoriented, you know, untoward events may occur.
1442000	1451000	OK, so there's a number of threads here, and I have them fairly well organized in my mind.
1451000	1458000	You mentioned in private conversation earlier, the like wake walk.
1458000	1465000	Why don't you tell the audience a little bit about the definitions of those two terms and what they came to mean for you?
1465000	1474000	Right, OK, so like I said, back in 1990, I undertook the like wake walk, which was part of the coast coast walk.
1474000	1481000	So I'll just recap very, very quickly from what I explained a little bit of in the previous part.
1481000	1491000	No, we did. England's a bit like a hand. The coast coast walk, of course, goes directly from the east to the west coast.
1491000	1494000	Then the starting and ending places, if you don't mind.
1494000	1512000	Yeah, so on the west coast, sorry, on the west coast, which would be, if this was the hand of England, you know, this is Scotland up here, this is Northumbria, and here is the Pennine Ridge running down the middle.
1512000	1517000	The Lake District over on the west is sort of where we started.
1517000	1523000	So it's kind of like from the west coast over to the east coast.
1523000	1530000	Of course, this would be Cornwall, London somewhere over here. The Cornwall is a bit like where the thumb is.
1530000	1540000	So you would travel across starting starting, well, in this instance, I started from the west coast going to the east.
1540000	1543000	Yes, but what is the place where you started the name?
1543000	1546000	So it's Saint B's Head.
1546000	1547000	Great, thank you.
1547000	1562000	Saint B's Head. So going from Saint B's Head, and then going across the Lake District, crossing the Pennine Ridge, which was very peculiar, I've just remembered, I may as well say these things as they're coming into my mind.
1563000	1576000	Crossing the Pennine Ridge, I ended up meeting an old couple on the top of the Pennine watershed, really boggy watershed in mist.
1576000	1582000	A really old couple who were happening to walk this particular stretch of the Pennine Ridge.
1582000	1589000	And so I kind of started chatting to them in the middle of mist, in the middle of nowhere.
1589000	1603000	And I thought, this is interesting, this lady's, I said to the lady, old gent, old lady, I said to the older lady, I said, your accent sounds quite familiar.
1603000	1614000	It sounds like it's from where I grew up, which is a place called Aquarth, which I grew up in as a small child, which is an old oak grove.
1614000	1623000	Originally, it was part of an old druid oak grove up on a moor top.
1623000	1640000	And she said, oh yeah, I come from a place near to Leeds, because don't forget this is, the Pennine Ridge here, it's sort of on the way to, it's almost closer to Manchester, really, at this particular point.
1640000	1651000	So she could have been from anywhere up north, but I said, no, she identified her accent, she said, no, I'm from closer to Pontifract, Wakefield, outside of Leeds.
1651000	1655000	I said, oh, so am I, so am I.
1655000	1661000	She said, well, do you know a place called Aquarth? I said, well, yes, it's the village I grew up in.
1661000	1666000	And she goes, oh, really? She said, well, I lived on Moor Top in Aquarth.
1666000	1671000	I said, well, that's interesting, because I lived on Moor Top in Aquarth as well.
1671000	1677000	And it turned out, she said, oh, well, you know that big house near to the roundabout.
1677000	1681000	There's a, it used to be called, it's now called the Elm Tree Restaurant.
1681000	1685000	Well, that was my house when I was a child.
1685000	1689000	Well, my house is literally joined onto your house.
1689000	1692000	It's part, it's the coach house that belonged to your house.
1692000	1694000	She goes, oh, the coach house.
1694000	1695000	I said, yes.
1695000	1698000	So she was, she was literally my next door neighbour.
1698000	1703000	Her house was literally physically joined onto the house I grew up in.
1703000	1709000	Surely it has occurred to you that this might not be an ordinary couple.
1709000	1713000	It has, while I was actually speaking to you now,
1714000	1719000	it kind of started to dawn upon me.
1719000	1722000	I was beginning to think, I was describing the mist and everything.
1722000	1726000	And I was thinking to myself, hmm.
1726000	1732000	Yeah, because what she's saying in a way is in code, right?
1732000	1735000	In a way that wouldn't necessarily reveal it.
1735000	1741000	She's saying, you and I have been associated our entire lives.
1741000	1742000	Right.
1742000	1746000	Which is the kind of thing that, for example, the moon might say.
1746000	1747000	Yes.
1747000	1748000	Yes.
1748000	1749000	The moon.
1749000	1750000	Yes.
1750000	1752000	And it's very common in.
1752000	1755000	Now I'm not making any claims about what took place with you.
1755000	1756000	Right.
1756000	1757000	Sure.
1757000	1759000	I'm just noticing that.
1759000	1762000	It's common in indigenous stories.
1762000	1767000	For a very elderly couple to appear.
1767000	1768000	Oh, right.
1768000	1770000	And I didn't know this.
1770000	1771000	Yes.
1771000	1772000	Yes.
1772000	1776000	Very, very elderly couple appears and they may appear frail or weak.
1776000	1779000	And they often look quite old.
1779000	1783000	And it's, it's very strange to find an elderly couple out in the middle of
1783000	1785000	wherever you were.
1785000	1788000	Like wandering around in the midst.
1788000	1789000	I mean, yeah.
1789000	1790000	Yeah.
1790000	1792000	Where, what are they doing?
1792000	1795000	Like, I know what you're doing and you're a young guy and you're,
1795000	1797000	you know, you're on a quest.
1797000	1798000	Yeah.
1798000	1801000	And since you're on a quest and you encounter an elderly couple,
1801000	1806000	but in many cases it's not clear to the people at the time.
1806000	1810000	At the elderly couple represent the sun and the moon.
1810000	1812000	But they often do, right?
1812000	1815000	And it's, it's quite often that.
1815000	1820000	The sun may give a gift or the moon may give knowledge.
1820000	1826000	But yeah, it's, I just can't help but notice the strange.
1827000	1829000	Be like, it's not metaphor.
1829000	1832000	There's another word for it that I don't know what it is.
1832000	1837000	But the, the, the shape likeness.
1837000	1839000	In what she's saying.
1839000	1841000	Oh, you go through a series of steps.
1841000	1842000	Right.
1842000	1845000	Oh, you sound like, oh yes, you, you know, do you know this?
1845000	1848000	You know, and then, and then it just traverses to.
1848000	1850000	We've been there the whole time.
1850000	1854000	Like we've been together the whole time in the strange way.
1854000	1855000	Right.
1855000	1857000	Our origins are linked up.
1857000	1858000	Right.
1858000	1859000	So that's very profound.
1859000	1861000	And I'm grateful to hear that story.
1861000	1864000	I'm glad we glad you came across it.
1864000	1865000	Please continue.
1865000	1866000	Yeah.
1866000	1869000	A couple of other things have just dawned on me because you've pointed this out.
1869000	1873000	And that's the wonderful thing about doing these sessions with you is that,
1873000	1878000	you know, all of these new parts of insight suddenly spring up while I'm in the
1878000	1880000	middle of speaking to you.
1880000	1886000	So the Pennine Ridge is quite literally, I mean, it's known as the backbone of
1886000	1887000	England.
1887000	1894000	But what's significant about this from the west to the east is that it's the
1894000	1897000	threshold between them.
1897000	1906000	So this watershed was quite literally the barrier, the physical barrier that
1906000	1909000	divides Yorkshire from Lancashire.
1909000	1914000	So you've heard of the War of the Roses, the red rose and the white rose,
1914000	1917000	but they're quite literally divided by these two sides.
1917000	1922000	And what's what suddenly came upon me is the fact that the old man was from
1922000	1926000	Lancashire and she was from Yorkshire, which was where I was from.
1926000	1935000	So so you literally had a Yorkshire man and a Yorkshire woman and a Lancashire
1935000	1941000	man on this particular threshold between the two halves of the walk.
1941000	1943000	Yeah, this curious sir and curious sir.
1943000	1945000	Yeah, yeah.
1945000	1949000	Yeah.
1949000	1950000	Yeah.
1950000	1951000	Beautiful.
1951000	1952000	Interesting.
1952000	1953000	Interesting.
1953000	1957000	It's wonderful to have these conversations just to document this stuff as well,
1957000	1963000	you know, because this is the thing, you know, when we it's often helpful to have a
1963000	1971000	companion to lead us along and help with the sort of the sequencing, right?
1971000	1975000	But when you begin to recover, I'll just mention this very briefly.
1975000	1981000	So yeah, my roommate recently came to me and said, you know, totally up to you
1981000	1985000	if you want to do this, but let's talk if you want, let's record like a life
1985000	1986000	history thing.
1986000	1990000	Okay, so we started doing this, not for public sharing or anything for like
1990000	1991000	my own use.
1991000	1996000	And, you know, all those things started lighting up because you're, you're
1996000	2001000	resurrecting these moments and they link, they start to link together.
2001000	2005000	And the whole map starts to light up and that brings to mind perspectives you
2005000	2008000	haven't, you know, perhaps you haven't seen before.
2008000	2011000	So let's not get too sidetracked by that.
2011000	2013000	Please, please continue.
2013000	2015000	So you come across the couple.
2015000	2016000	Go ahead.
2016000	2018000	Yeah, yeah, I came across the couple.
2018000	2023000	And it was on this particular threshold area.
2023000	2025000	I mentioned it was a watershed as well.
2025000	2032000	So basically all of the rivers flow, flow down from this place over the
2032000	2034000	Pennine Ridge itself.
2034000	2042000	So, so it's a source of rivers and lakes.
2042000	2044000	So where is I going with this?
2044000	2049000	So after this point, of course, you cross over and then you're going into
2049000	2054000	East Yorkshire, into the East part of the country and into Yorkshire.
2054000	2060000	And then it's from there that you pick up after, after a very small area, I
2060000	2062000	think it's called Appleby, Westmoreland.
2062000	2067000	Remember, we, we walked through a place called Appleby in Westmoreland.
2067000	2069000	And you go through there.
2069000	2071000	That was a very beautiful area.
2071000	2076000	It was almost like a very Edenic, very, very Edenic kind of feel, very lush
2076000	2082000	and green and full of apple blossoms and apple trees.
2082000	2085000	And that was an interesting place as well.
2085000	2092000	Because that had some resonance later, but I won't talk about that now.
2092000	2096000	And then you join on to the beginning of the like wake walk.
2096000	2100000	So I think you mentioned a little earlier, tell everyone about the like
2100000	2102000	and the meanings of the words and how you.
2102000	2103000	Yeah.
2103000	2104000	Yeah.
2104000	2112000	So the like wake walk, like, L, Y, K, E.
2112000	2116000	So the like is the corpse itself.
2116000	2122000	But another interpretation is the double, that which is a like to you,
2122000	2124000	that which is like you.
2124000	2129000	But if you're departed and if you're, if you're departed.
2129000	2137000	So in like in the Egyptian cosmology to call it that you have the cat or the mummy,
2137000	2140000	the mummia, the body, the corpse, the like.
2140000	2149000	And then above that you have the car and the car is like the ghost body.
2149000	2158000	So the more closer to the ghost body, if you like, so it's the habitual body in
2158000	2163000	the herbalistic terminology, they would call it like the nefesh, the animal soul,
2163000	2168000	that which hangs around the body or hangs around the corpse.
2168000	2176000	So if you were, say, for example, the like from the point of view of the nefesh or from the point of view of the car,
2176000	2184000	you would be separated from your physical body but close to it.
2184000	2190000	So the like is your double, your doppelganger in some sense.
2190000	2197000	And the wake is like in Irish, you know, in Irish ceremonies when you have somebody who's passed over,
2197000	2199000	they hold a wake.
2199000	2204000	So the wake is, is the celebration of the person's life.
2204000	2211000	And you usually have a good old knees up, you know, around the grave of the person.
2211000	2214000	It's quite often with the person physically present there in the room.
2214000	2220000	So that's the traditional Irish style of having a wake, celebration of the person's life.
2220000	2223000	Now, this is the like wake walk.
2223000	2225000	It covers 40 miles.
2225000	2231000	And this 40 mile expanse, which 40 miles in itself is obviously heavily symbolic as well,
2231000	2242000	because it's the number 40 is always linked with passengers of moving from one state to another.
2242000	2247000	You have like 40 days and 40 nights in the biblical symbolism.
2247000	2254000	You have quite often in quite a lot of Tibetan Buddhist internal work,
2254000	2265000	they have like 40 day passages through dark, through darkness, or should we say a 40, 40 day and 40 night passage through darkness,
2265000	2270000	just total darkness in some of their works.
2270000	2273000	With five days on either side.
2273000	2274000	Right.
2274000	2280000	As like the lead in, then you have one moon, and then the string out.
2280000	2281000	Yes.
2281000	2282000	Similar.
2282000	2287000	It's like a, it's a, it could be understood as a lifespan, even.
2287000	2288000	I'm with you.
2288000	2289000	Please continue.
2289000	2290000	Yeah.
2290000	2291000	Yeah.
2291000	2293000	I think, I think indeed, indeed.
2293000	2307000	And so the, it was on this particular part of the walk, the, the like wake walk over this 40 mile expanse,
2307000	2321000	which, that's where I saw them, where I had my Milky Way experience, which was incredibly profound, incredibly significant for everything that followed.
2321000	2326000	Say a little bit about the experience again, even though I'm sure you have previously.
2326000	2330000	I did, but I can go a little more into granular detail this time.
2330000	2336000	So, so it was the time of year.
2336000	2337000	Let's see.
2337000	2345000	It was the beginning of August, end of August, beginning of September.
2345000	2352000	And this point in time was deliberately chosen because it wouldn't be too seringly hot.
2352000	2360000	So it was the end of summer coming into, into autumn.
2361000	2373000	So there was the weather was kind of quite temperate, but I do remember the entire walk up to this point had actually been quite, quite bloody hot actually, all through the Lake District and so on,
2373000	2380000	apart from maybe some misty and rainy days halfway through on the Pennine Ridge.
2380000	2389000	So going onto lightweight walk, these incredibly blue, sonic blue sky.
2389000	2396000	But the lightweight walk itself passes through this 40 mile expanse known as Winnie Moore.
2396000	2406000	Now Winnie Moore is actually in Old English means the Wine Red Moore, Winnie Wine Red.
2406000	2408000	So the Wine Red Winnie Moore.
2408000	2410000	So you're passing through the Winnie Moore.
2410000	2414000	So it's a form of abyss.
2414000	2417000	It's a type of abyssal symbolism.
2417000	2428000	And what it actually I've later come to understand, what I've actually come to understand it means is that you're actually passing through the menstruation period of the goddess.
2428000	2430000	Beautiful.
2430000	2435000	Because the track takes you through the track of death.
2435000	2437000	So it's very Scorpio laden.
2437000	2441000	It's very, very scorpionic, Scorpio symbolism, but it's all wine red.
2441000	2443000	It's like a menstruation period.
2443000	2463000	Now this is interesting and it just dawned on me right now as I'm speaking that perhaps this is why and where the goddess symbolism came from that led me out of the dream which is really amazing how that's just dawned on me.
2463000	2473000	So, truly, you know, I mean, some quite revelatory thoughts come to me even while speaking here now.
2473000	2474000	It's so beautiful.
2474000	2476000	This is what I'm hoping for, yes.
2476000	2477000	Yeah.
2477000	2487000	And the actual track is laden with marker points, marker posts.
2487000	2492000	And those marker posts are actually carved.
2492000	2493000	I have a book with me.
2493000	2494000	I'll show you some pictures.
2494000	2497000	I'll try and find some pictures.
2497000	2498000	Yes.
2498000	2508000	The marker posts themselves are ancient pagan standing stones which mark the track.
2508000	2521000	Some of them have been turned into some of them have been turned into crosses were carved into Celtic crosses.
2521000	2523000	Here we go.
2523000	2527000	But quite a few of them are still pagan standing stones.
2527000	2530000	This is, I don't know if you can see.
2530000	2534000	Yes.
2534000	2537000	This face, this face here.
2537000	2548000	And some of them are just many as typical many as so over the 40 mile expanse the way you find your way is by spotting these stones on the hill ridges.
2548000	2551000	As you're walking along the track.
2551000	2561000	And all of the heather, the reason why it's the wine red more is because all of the heather goes sonic purple red.
2561000	2575000	So with the blue sky and the sonic purple red, the weather had been very much like this clear clear blue, sonic purple red and these standing stones marking the way along the way.
2575000	2580000	Some of them are are actually goddess stones as well.
2580000	2585000	One of them is called fat Betty.
2585000	2588000	So.
2588000	2590000	So there we have it.
2590000	2595000	That's actually the destination of where it goes Raven scar.
2595000	2596000	Right.
2596000	2601000	So that's that's the where you actually stop Raven scar.
2601000	2608000	And the actual emblem for the walking for the lightweight hand with a candle inside.
2608000	2618000	Interestingly, I decided to light a candle before I actually started this interview.
2618000	2627000	So, so there you go a little bit more information there for you but it came across to me very much that the wine red more is that is actually the menstruation of the goddess.
2628000	2635000	That's crucially beautiful. We can return to this topic, but I want to keep on the thread that we're on.
2635000	2641000	And I'm trying to carefully track that. So describe a little bit more about the experience.
2641000	2644000	So I'm just going to say something briefly.
2644000	2645000	Sure.
2645000	2656000	There was a phase before my own experience where I used to practice a sort of a Tai Chi Chi gum practice actually, where
2656000	2664000	basically my teacher had taught us to gather up the energy from the earth, bring it up into the body.
2664000	2675000	Distributed up into the sky, right into the universe, and then draw the universal energy back down into our body and down into the earth.
2675000	2685000	And basically just you lean over, you picked up the energy bent over you draw it up into your bodies with an in breath.
2685000	2692000	You, you know, you send it up with an out breath, you draw it back with an in breath, you send it down with an out breath.
2692000	2704000	Yeah, I added to that practice that I was drawing the love of the planet, all together, all the animals all the living places all the histories that love
2704000	2717000	energy, and then, you know, sort of like many branches of a tree, sending that love out into the universe, literally saying like we love you we remember you we adore you.
2717000	2727000	And then the same thing back right we love you we remember you we adore you back into the earth. I used to do this all the time, without having any complex
2727000	2737000	interaction about it right. And when you talked about your experience with a milky way I was reminded of this was practice.
2737000	2738000	Right.
2738000	2746000	So please share whatever comes to mind about the experience.
2746000	2756000	Yeah, so it's been really hot. I remember during that day.
2756000	2780000	And there was a, I put up the tent in the middle of this more, and I chose to put the tent in a field at the side of an in. So it was like a pub an in in the middle of nowhere.
2781000	2793000	And I went into the pub. And in those days I hardly used to drink at all I used to have like lime and soda something like that you know like I wasn't even drinking.
2793000	2817000	I went into the pub and had a couple of these lime and sodas or whatever. And came back out to the tent. And I was shocked to find that after the sun had gone down that there was a there was a light frost on the ground.
2817000	2840000	Because the moors out there were very exposed. And there was a couple of other things I learned at that time as well which taught me some really interesting things to do with the action of the sun upon the earth and interacting with the earth and the waters.
2840000	2853000	Which actually led me to some really, really quite amazing understandings of the the entire process of nature.
2853000	2866000	I was going to use the word, it taught me quite a lot of the secrets of alchemy, but that sounds really that sounds really grandiose, but I don't have to be too afraid of that.
2866000	2877000	It truly did. And, and I'll explain a little more of that later, but that day the frost was on the ground.
2877000	2894000	That evening the frost was on the ground the temperature had dropped quite quite a lot. And because it was so cold, and because the sky was so clear and because there was no light pollution whatsoever.
2894000	2900000	I looked at the frost crunch crunch crunch feet on the floor crunch crunch crunch.
2900000	2911000	So my attention was diverted down by the crunching, and then I lifted my head up. I wanted to just instinctively wanted to know what was right above me.
2911000	2915000	So crunching feet lifted up the head.
2915000	2921000	My my the trajectory of my vision literally caught from the very moment my head was lifted.
2921000	2940000	The whole path of the Milky Way just shot up in front of me and above me all the way behind me and it felt like the entire thing from from right above me right through my feet just like the two things just collided and like like a huge bang.
2940000	2953000	And this intense visceral feeling of absolute connectivity, like an explosion coming from within the core of me reaching out forever.
2953000	2959000	Everything met in that moment.
2959000	2964000	So there was something really really special about it.
2964000	2969000	It was like yoga in the true sense of the word.
2969000	2973000	True Union.
2973000	2977000	So beautiful.
2977000	2984000	Yeah, it was it was it really was touching for some reason to hear the story.
2984000	2987000	Yeah.
2987000	2990000	Please continue.
2990000	2995000	Ever since that time.
2995000	3001000	I've not been able to comprehend anything as separate.
3001000	3003000	What a gift.
3003000	3009000	What a what a healing inversion.
3009000	3013000	It also comes with a great price though it seems.
3013000	3021000	Because the although that's a although that's a huge understanding in and of itself.
3021000	3025000	And like you say could be seen to be a gift.
3025000	3031000	It's it's I think the I think the Buddhist would have called it.
3031000	3037000	You know, it leads to the vision of universal sorrow.
3037000	3053000	In the sense that although you you understand the pure joy that's behind everything you can see and sense and this is what led me to that sorrow when I came back to the city.
3053000	3059000	There was this understanding that everyone is so disconnected from that reality.
3059000	3070000	And that such great pain and suffering results because of the lack of understanding of the connectivity.
3070000	3077000	And I understood that all healing is rooted in bringing people back to that sense of connectivity.
3077000	3088000	Yes, and thus, in some sense, perhaps you will understand I'd be surprised if you didn't what I mean when I say, I'll try.
3088000	3091000	I doubt you'll have any trouble.
3091000	3104000	Many of my closest friends, these are people who I would call bridge bridge souls, right they join, they join to ordinarily disparate.
3104000	3120000	I'm looking at my reflection it's backwards so my miss using the wrong app. But yeah, they join to ordinarily disparate people's places, histories, futures.
3120000	3127000	So for example, one of my friends, Ryan first diver, he's a Blackfoot beaver man.
3127000	3138000	And he's so in the Blackfoot traditional in their in their traditional life, the beaver man is the central ceremonial.
3138000	3144000	All the all the other societies orbit the beaver bundle tradition.
3144000	3151000	And so he's, and he's half, you know, he's half Caucasian to so.
3151000	3162000	So he joins like the colonizers and the Blackfoot people. He also takes care of rattlesnakes there so they are protected there.
3162000	3176000	So he joins the snake people to the to the regular people he's like this bridge between five or six different things I just use him as an example because he's a great example of this, but many of my close friends are like this there.
3176000	3187000	They're the between, right, even when you're telling the story you're saying like the sky came down and the earth, and they, you know, they joined, right.
3187000	3188000	Yeah.
3188000	3194000	So it's a, but say more about.
3194000	3197000	Was it painful for you.
3197000	3199000	In, in what time what respect.
3199000	3201000	Right.
3201000	3217000	You say that you weren't able to see things as separate. And I say that's a gift and you say yes but there's a price. Yes, it seems there is a price and the price have bite in you.
3217000	3225000	It can do it can do because because sometimes, you know, if sometimes you you can't.
3225000	3243000	It's what it's quite, it's quite difficult to sometimes see the disconnection the lack of connectivity I think is the way to put it with with certain individuals that you know it's quite painful to see the lack of connectivity that they actually have.
3243000	3254000	You can, there's nothing you can do the only thing you can do is do things in an incredibly subtle way to help coax people towards this experience or this understanding.
3254000	3265000	So that brings up a topic that I think you'll that I think is relevant here. Yeah, literally, and as it relates to human communication in general.
3265000	3268000	Yes.
3269000	3273000	The common difference between men and women.
3273000	3274000	Yeah.
3274000	3285000	And hypnosis and LP, perhaps mesmerism, but certainly the idea of suggestion, which is something. This is a topic we didn't properly explore previously.
3285000	3290000	One of my bookmarks so I've noticed.
3290000	3294000	I've always tended to emulate girls.
3294000	3304000	When I was in elementary school, they were the high performers, they could do seven things the boys could do to I emulate the girls, right.
3304000	3310000	And I learned very quickly that that was a much faster path to progress.
3310000	3323000	And the women are masters of indirection, generally speaking, right. They can suggest very subtly something. They're very cautious about making direct statements because they can then be held the task board later.
3323000	3329000	And then historically subjected to masculine inquisition.
3329000	3336000	Every like a billion times per lifetime right every woman, right.
3336000	3341000	Masculine in inquisition.
3341000	3343000	You know.
3343000	3346000	So,
3346000	3351000	where am I going with this.
3351000	3354000	I myself have realized.
3354000	3359000	We spoke briefly of this in the last interview, but there are problems with declarative statements.
3359000	3366000	And what you were saying was essentially what you can do has to be very subtle.
3366000	3375000	By which you mean indirect and suggestive rather than the typical masculine thing is just to go like, well, of course you just do this.
3375000	3383000	You just tell them, here's the problem. Here's the solution. Right. The guy, you know, what brings out his toolbox.
3383000	3386000	You know, when and often doesn't.
3386000	3397000	There's no subtlety whatsoever. And there's also no sensitivity to the other person's sort of where they are in the process.
3397000	3403000	What might be appropriate at this moment or in that in the phase of the process that they're in.
3403000	3404000	Yeah. Yeah.
3404000	3406000	So yeah, please.
3406000	3409000	Anything comes to mind about this.
3409000	3412000	Well, once again.
3412000	3424000	I mean, there's two things, obviously there's the therapeutic approaches, there's the actual use of these things for therapy within a therapeutic setting, which is one thing.
3424000	3445000	And then there's the things that we encounter and the things we experience in daily, everyday life in terms of how we what we see around us, the types of interactions you see amongst people, you know, friends that you may have and so on and so on.
3445000	3456000	And just generally, I mean, like you say, you've studied language patterns and so on and so forth.
3456000	3467000	It's amazing how I think I think NLP just to talk about that for a moment that really highlighted.
3468000	3472000	You know, the old saying the map is not the territory.
3472000	3492000	It's kind of what I'm talking about that disconnect that some individuals have between what's going on in their own minds and how they choose to communicate those ideas and such things, simple things as the art of conversation and so on.
3493000	3503000	It seems, I don't know if I'm right or wrong by saying this, but I've noticed a marked increase.
3503000	3520000	I'd be interested in your opinion on this, a marked increase in a kind of almost a fragmentation of the ability to communicate in a meaningful manner, in a way whereby individuals can actually have meaningful conversations,
3520000	3526000	where people have the ability to listen and have the ability to speak and be heard.
3526000	3542000	These, this cross flow, this dance, which seemed to be so much part of everyday life seems to be becoming rarer and rarer, I would say in the last three or four years.
3542000	3546000	And I don't know if that's experiencing this.
3546000	3554000	Yeah, there's some kind of a, you know, my friend was using the phrase positive disintegration.
3554000	3555000	Right.
3555000	3560000	I'm not sure it's positive. There's certainly a disintegration going on.
3560000	3565000	And I would, you know, we can talk about this.
3565000	3567000	I want to be careful to preserve the threads.
3568000	3592000	I, so one of the things I pay attention to is a neologism that occurred to me at the beginning of my experience of whatever it was I experience was where I imagined the network of human minds as an as a place as a physical environment.
3593000	3597000	And I call that the human cognizium.
3597000	3602000	There are cognizia all around us that feed into ours.
3602000	3611000	But the human cognizium is undergoing a series of what look like catastrophic fragmentations to me.
3611000	3612000	Yeah.
3612000	3631000	And that's being reflected in dissonance in human communication, and particularly in our perceptions related. I mean, this is kind of a running joke at the moment, but in our perceptions related to identity.
3631000	3632000	Right.
3632000	3638000	Someone is what something is why it's function.
3638000	3646000	And I was talking with a friend last night, and we often have very playful, revelatory conversations.
3646000	3655000	And I suggested to him that without us knowing it over the past few years, the world is no longer the world.
3655000	3657000	Like it's a completely different thing.
3657000	3660000	Now, it looks the same on the outside.
3660000	3665000	It seems to be, we all think it's the same thing, but it's not that thing anymore. It's a different thing.
3665000	3677000	And so we were sort of playfully, I was suggesting that we could experiment by sending signals to the world, like pinging it, like in a submarine, right?
3677000	3687000	When you ping another submarine, you could ping the world and see what it brings back so that you could get a sense of what whatever it has become or what it is becoming.
3687000	3688000	Yeah.
3688000	3692000	Well, I think that that's to some extent what we're kind of doing now is.
3692000	3693000	Yes, yes.
3693000	3716000	The part of the thing that's certainly driving me on to speak about these things and maybe driving you on to speak about these things is because it feels like an important time to speak of these things in a way where one hopes others are going to be giving us some feedback with
3716000	3718000	regards to what's going on.
3718000	3726000	Yes, drawn into the conversation and fascinated and curious and have a sense of wonder and exploration with us.
3726000	3727000	Absolutely.
3727000	3728000	Yes, yes.
3728000	3735000	As if maybe we are, what, I can't quite find the word.
3735000	3743000	It's strange because in a way you can, I imagine something actually this, I don't know why but it's bringing, it makes me feel tearful.
3743000	3756000	I imagine two magicians, not that I'm claiming to be one or that you claim to be one, but I imagine two magicians playfully getting together on stage.
3756000	3767000	And embodying the curiosity and passion and life paths of the audience without the magicians themselves knowing it, right?
3767000	3778000	And then engaging in this play on the stage that enlightens the magicians as the avatars of the audience, something like this, right?
3778000	3783000	And what a beautiful, what a beautiful, like ecstatic figure.
3783000	3784000	Thank you.
3784000	3785000	Yeah, absolutely.
3785000	3789000	And I feel that we're at a very, very interesting time.
3789000	3812000	Most definitely certainly a very, very interesting time because I think I'm not sure if I remember, if I actually said this to you last time or whether I said it to you in private on another occasion, but I really feel like we're at a really, really important point in terms of this communication we're speaking about.
3812000	3813000	Yes.
3813000	3825000	Communicating ideas. There's something really quite important about this type of work, you know, sharing these things that we're doing right now. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.
3825000	3834000	You know, I'm sure you wouldn't be here either doing what you're doing if you didn't feel this, this same, almost a duty to be speaking.
3834000	3836000	Emergency.
3836000	3843000	Literally, it's an emerge and see, right? It's an emerge and see.
3843000	3844000	Right.
3844000	3845000	Emergency.
3845000	3846000	Yes.
3846000	3847000	Yes.
3847000	3860000	And yes, it is. It does seem very urgent and very, there are many people who are, they are dying inside. They're, they're completely lost, you know, and I'm not entirely free of that myself.
3860000	3861000	Right.
3861000	3870000	I think all of us are to some extent, you know, experiencing the hardships of the age that we're living with it. That's for sure.
3870000	3871000	Yes.
3871000	3884000	I think many would be very, would possibly be foolish to say they're not, but at the same time, I think it's a really, really, a really incredibly hopeful time.
3884000	3895000	There's a time where some, some incredible new points. There's a type of regeneration that seems to be taking place at the moment.
3895000	3906000	And I feel a new opening for these types of explorations in a way that I've never quite seen to this extent before.
3906000	3921000	I really do. I really feel like we're, we're on without claiming to be in any sense, you know, grandiose or an expert on these subjects. I'd just say, very happy to be part of opening the conversation.
3921000	3932000	Yes, I agree. And I don't, I mean, one of the things that I'm learning more about that it's been clear to me as an artist for a long time is that personal identity is kind of a trap.
3932000	3933000	Right.
3933000	3946000	So, the, the, yes, I understand. Obviously, I have some concern about Darren and his life and his whatever, right? His opportunities and so forth.
3946000	3953000	But it's much more fascinating at the layers above Darren and beneath Darren. Yeah, yeah.
3953000	3957000	They're together. Right. Yeah.
3957000	3971000	You know, something very strange is going on. I made a recording recently where I, where I said, I think the recording is just called 2024 is not a year.
3971000	3985000	It's like, there's no more of whatever the hell was going on before has been thrown up into the suspended sort of cloud storm state, and nobody understands what the hell is going on anymore.
3985000	3993000	Or if they do, it's just because they're clinging to the teddy bear of their previous suppositions about the world like desperately.
3993000	4008000	But yeah, it really is something profound because on the one hand, there's all these new opportunities. And on the other hand, there's this catastrophic and agonic, you know, dissolution and pain and death.
4008000	4018000	So yeah, I don't want to use the trope from Shakespeare. So I'll just suggest that without saying it.
4018000	4027000	Okay, so there's so much more. And by the way, how are we doing on time? I'm fine, but I want to I'm okay. I'm okay for for time at the moment as well. Yeah.
4027000	4031000	I think I'm excited to continue.
4031000	4035000	So.
4035000	4039000	Okay, so what happened that night, the frost.
4039000	4043000	You look up the thing the whole thing. Yeah, yeah, as I explained.
4043000	4045000	What was I feeling at that moment?
4045000	4053000	What was I feeling? As I say, just just this incredible, energetic connectivity.
4053000	4060000	And, and I felt like I was touching eternity, quite literally like touching eternity.
4060000	4069000	And that experience, strangely, I had.
4069000	4074000	I kind of discovered how to switch it back on at will.
4074000	4076000	Oh, beautiful.
4076000	4079000	But this came much later.
4079000	4094000	Whenever I did switch it on at will, it reminded me immediately of that moment once again, you know, so like immediate recognition of that experience.
4094000	4106000	So that what I'm referring to is, and this touches on the courses that I do and things like this back here in England, I do them elsewhere occasionally if people ask me as well but
4106000	4109000	they're very important about those.
4109000	4113000	Yeah, yeah, so like I, I do.
4113000	4123000	Every year, I try to do one, maybe two courses in usually they're advertised as mesmerism fascination presence.
4123000	4125000	I mean, this is how you and I connected.
4125000	4126000	Yeah, good.
4126000	4135000	I think I said on part part one of this that it was about about nine years ago or so that we actually first connected but I think it was more than that was
4135000	4146000	I think it was more like 12 actually I started doing I started doing those courses about 12 years ago now.
4146000	4164000	Mesmerism fascination presence so obviously the thing I do sort of every year is hold these courses mesmerism is a for those who don't know is a type of hypnosis is an earlier type of hypnosis more of
4164000	4170000	a nonverbal form of hypnosis.
4170000	4178000	And it was popularized by France on Tom Mesmer, hence the term mesmerism.
4178000	4180000	When was he active.
4180000	4186000	Yeah, so this was sort of in the in the 1700s so mid 1700s.
4187000	4199000	And it was just prior to the French Revolution actually he was around just prior to the French Revolution doing a lot of his work.
4199000	4202000	He was connected with some quite interesting people.
4202000	4212000	I don't know if you know this but he was he had his a thing called the glass almonica, which was an actual instrument.
4212000	4215000	Yes, I know about this instrument.
4215000	4223000	And the classical piece of music Moonlight Sonata was written for this instrument.
4223000	4227000	Yeah, so what this is is it's a series of rings glass.
4227000	4237000	Yeah, it's like a it's like a plate with a with a ring around the edge of the plate to sort of, and these are put on a spindle.
4237000	4240000	And it's a call it's a cone.
4240000	4247000	Yes, perhaps there are either pedals or keys pedals.
4247000	4253000	Yeah, pedals and then and then a little tray of water to dip your fingertips in that you can actually rub on to the.
4253000	4254000	Okay.
4254000	4263000	Yeah, so the spindle spins and you get the sound that's like what you get when you circle a crystal bell or glass.
4263000	4264000	Precisely, precisely.
4264000	4269000	Yes, profoundly non ordinary sound.
4269000	4270000	Absolutely.
4270000	4272000	It's like a harmonic.
4272000	4281000	It's almost like being able to play an instrument that only produces harmonics, which themselves are kind of a magical thing.
4281000	4282000	Absolutely.
4282000	4288000	And so and so like I say Moonlight Sonata was composed with this instrument in mind.
4288000	4301000	And then and then Benjamin Franklin actually gifted this instrument he had one made and gifted it to Mesma.
4301000	4303000	Oh, wow.
4303000	4312000	Yeah, there's one in London actually there's there's a Franklin Museum I think in London and there's an example of it there.
4312000	4313000	I've never seen one.
4313000	4315000	Have you seen one?
4315000	4316000	Yeah, yeah.
4316000	4318000	Like I say, there's actually been one.
4318000	4323000	There's one on display there in London, or there was some years ago.
4323000	4328000	I spent a long, long time since I've seen it, but there was there was actually a model of it.
4328000	4329000	I don't want to branch, but I'm curious.
4329000	4332000	Have you ever been in a place where one is being played?
4332000	4334000	I haven't heard one being played.
4334000	4336000	I have to say no, no.
4336000	4338000	But you have heard recordings of them.
4338000	4339000	Oh, yes, for sure.
4339000	4340000	Me too.
4340000	4346000	I remember this and just being blown away and thinking like I must find a way to have one of these when I first heard it.
4346000	4347000	Yeah.
4347000	4351000	Well, the thing is, is the actual tones themselves.
4351000	4363000	Mesma believed that the tones themselves catapulted the individuals who heard them because of the tones actually activated certain states or trans states in themselves.
4363000	4364000	Yeah.
4364000	4368000	The tones themselves activated some of these states.
4368000	4371000	So, so that's interesting.
4371000	4387000	Yes, I have a sort of peculiar personal sensitivity to anything that produces a non ordinary effect or, you know, like in terms of Stephen King's book like the shining.
4387000	4390000	Certain features are facets of reality.
4390000	4392000	They don't. It's not like a visual shine.
4392000	4395000	There's like a spiritual shine to them.
4395000	4396000	They resonate.
4396000	4397000	They ring.
4397000	4398000	Right.
4398000	4402000	You can tell like, oh, here's one of the hidden keys.
4402000	4403000	Yeah.
4403000	4411000	And two very obvious features of this for me that were apparent in childhood were spiders and they make what they're making of webs.
4411000	4412000	Right.
4412000	4414000	Just watch them make what is going on there.
4414000	4421000	There's some that's you could study just that one thing and it would lead you everywhere you needed to go.
4421000	4422000	Right.
4422000	4426000	It's like a master key to every library hidden in an organism.
4426000	4427000	Yes.
4427000	4435000	And then similarly, another place where a similar key is hidden, a living key is in the praying mantises.
4435000	4436000	Ah, yes.
4436000	4441000	I've noticed you're particularly keen on mantises.
4441000	4443000	But let's not branch too far.
4443000	4447000	So what were met?
4447000	4452000	What were the precursors that led Mesmer to his discoveries?
4452000	4455000	Do you think?
4455000	4456000	Right.
4456000	4457000	Okay.
4457000	4470000	So when Mesmer was, um, I think when Mesmer's career was just beginning, when he was first, he was first introduced to the concept of magnetism from a priest.
4470000	4472000	I forget the name of the priest.
4472000	4474000	Fair enough.
4474000	4483000	Um, but he introduced him the concept of magnetism and he utilised actual magnets.
4483000	4485000	Wow.
4485000	4487000	On different points of the body.
4487000	4489000	Uh-huh.
4489000	4496000	Though some esoteric priests have actually done this and used this therapy in different ways.
4496000	4501000	But of course you and I both know that the power isn't necessarily in the magnets, is it?
4501000	4502000	No.
4502000	4503000	Okay, please continue.
4503000	4504000	Yeah.
4504000	4522000	So Mesmer himself, um, you know, quickly jumped the use of the magnets and, uh, sort of really concentrated more on the natural ability that we all have as individuals.
4522000	4531000	They call it animal magnetism because of the fact that the animal kingdom exhibits this force in abundance.
4531000	4538000	But we humans kind of don't seem to believe we have it, but clearly we do.
4538000	4546000	And certain individuals seem to have had it in historical epochs, perhaps more than others.
4546000	4553000	And there are famous examples of this.
4553000	4567000	And so, you know, some people, they thought of it as charisma or something like this, um, which itself, you know, the word charisma relates to the golden anointing.
4567000	4575000	So, uh, so, so this force is something all individuals have at different levels.
4575000	4578000	So it's a natural ability, natural ability.
4578000	4590000	I would suggest that, um, if you wanted to see a clear example of it that's commonly accessible, the gaze of infants.
4590000	4591000	Oh, yes.
4591000	4592000	Right.
4592000	4593000	Oh, yes, yes, yes.
4593000	4595000	I think they're actually surprised.
4595000	4598000	I think the infants can be surprised when it fails.
4598000	4600000	Right.
4600000	4601000	Right.
4601000	4604000	Because they know, they seem to know that it works.
4604000	4615000	But yes, match gaze with an infant or a very young child, and you will see directly an example of the kind of thing I think you're talking about.
4615000	4621000	And I would also suggest that praying mantises are doing something very similar.
4621000	4622000	Right.
4622000	4629000	There's a reason why a creature this big can terrify a grizzly bear.
4629000	4630000	Right.
4630000	4631000	Right.
4631000	4633000	And then it's screaming for the woods, you know.
4633000	4634000	Right, right.
4634000	4638000	It's not an accident and it's not just a visual display.
4638000	4640000	Yeah.
4640000	4641000	Yeah.
4641000	4642000	Please continue.
4642000	4643000	Yeah, yeah.
4643000	4648000	So, um, so basically, uh, where was I going with this?
4648000	4653000	Well, you said that certain people were clearly more so.
4653000	4657000	Animal magnetism, the humans don't necessarily believe they have it, but we do.
4657000	4663000	And some people either have sort of a greater capacity and or develop it.
4663000	4664000	Right.
4664000	4665000	Yeah.
4665000	4668000	So, so it's something that is, is there in abundance in the animal kingdom.
4668000	4677000	I was talking about the example of snakes on the previous part we were doing, you know, and basically it's not just.
4677000	4684000	Not just the vision, not just the gaze that they exert, but it's also everything else.
4684000	4692000	It's the actual awareness of the physicality of their existence in this present moment.
4692000	4702000	So this is where we link back to the Milky Way experience because the key component is the physical presence.
4702000	4715000	The key component that empowers all of those other techniques is the physical moment by moment awareness of your existence or of each one of our existence.
4715000	4731000	So by contacting that, we generate through the conscious awareness of our physical existence, we generate a kind of a field and we, and we switch it on.
4731000	4752000	And that experience that I had with the heavens and the earth and me sandwiched or hit between them was very much a moment where crunching of the feet, the stars above my head, me between the biting of the chill of the air on what had been a really hot day.
4752000	4753000	Yeah.
4753000	4755000	It's like a rod ringing.
4755000	4756000	Yes.
4756000	4757000	Yes.
4757000	4763000	It's, it's the origin world and the physical earth.
4763000	4764000	Yes.
4764000	4769000	Eating and sort of mating and resonating.
4769000	4770000	Yeah.
4770000	4771000	Yes.
4771000	4772000	Absolutely.
4772000	4773000	Absolutely.
4773000	4775000	So I was talking about the alchemical components of this.
4775000	4786000	And of course the actual earth that I was walking upon at that particular point in the path was pure Pete.
4787000	4797000	So the Moorlands have the blackest Pete I've ever seen in my life.
4797000	4810000	And like I say, even at certain other points like the Pennine Ridge, you'd be walking on the Pete on that particular part of the walk.
4810000	4819000	You'd be walking upon the Pete and the black soil of the Pete, which the Egyptians used to call chem, by the way.
4819000	4821000	So chem, K-H-E-M.
4821000	4823000	Which chemet comes from.
4823000	4825000	Which chemet comes from.
4825000	4836000	So it was the actual residue cast up from the Nile over and over again would bring all of this fertile Pete onto the surface or the silt.
4836000	4841000	So that would be the thing that would give the fertility and bring the fertility to the land.
4841000	4843000	And of course the likewise.
4843000	4848000	Almost like a menstrual exudate of the river.
4848000	4849000	Yes.
4849000	4850000	Yes.
4850000	4851000	Yes.
4851000	4852000	Exactly this.
4852000	4853000	Exactly this.
4853000	4854000	Exactly this.
4854000	4865000	So you have the Nile delta with this, you say, you know, with this exudate coming out and fertilizing all of the land around it.
4865000	4866000	Oh my God.
4866000	4869000	We're starting to get all Egyptian again here.
4869000	4870000	Yeah.
4870000	4873000	We're talking about this fragmentation.
4873000	4881000	And of course the fragmentation and the whole art of healing is to bring back together that which is scattered.
4881000	4890000	So the body of Osiris, of course, represents like all the shamanic myths, you know, the body is scattered to the four winds, so to speak.
4890000	4913000	And Isis was the one that got the separation from the land, turned herself into the hawk, looked down upon the land and discovered the fragments scattered across the land and brought them back together again to actually make the first mummy, which was the resurrection of Osiris from the world of the dead.
4913000	4921000	It strikes me that the Eye of Toth is actually related to the Eye of the Kestrel.
4921000	4922000	Right.
4922000	4923000	Little hawk.
4923000	4925000	The Desert hawk.
4925000	4926000	Right.
4926000	4937000	Which you can't really see it, but this image is an image, a very complex magical image of Kestrel.
4937000	4939000	Inside the frame behind you.
4939000	4940000	Yes.
4940000	4941000	Yes.
4942000	4957000	It also implies rising above the human or even the temporal, right, into the what might, what Oman Hillman calls the aonic life.
4957000	4958000	Right.
4959000	4969000	It's not just outside of location in space. It's outside of location in time. And from there, you can find all the pieces.
4969000	4970000	Yeah.
4970000	4972000	Speak.
4972000	4976000	And again, now here again, we have this concept of the bridge being.
4976000	4977000	Absolutely.
4977000	4993000	The bridge being who becomes sort of a linchpin above all of these fragments, linking them together and then perhaps drawing them back down into a being, a situation, a place, the healing.
4993000	4994000	Please continue.
4994000	4995000	Well, exactly.
4995000	5006000	What are my big questions today was basically, okay, so what is healing anyway, in its truest sense, you know, we can have some
5006000	5018000	fairly simple examples like, oh, you know, you want to heal bad eyesight, you want to heal, I don't know, a throat condition or something like that.
5018000	5021000	We've got these small examples of healing.
5021000	5035000	But of course, the healing we're, we're speaking of really when we're speaking of sacred healing is we're talking about like, it's an overused term, but you know, making something, bringing the holism, bringing the, the bringing
5035000	5039000	something back to a sense of holiness.
5039000	5043000	There is also a feature of an amnesis.
5043000	5044000	You're right.
5044000	5045000	Yes.
5045000	5046000	Forgetting.
5046000	5047000	Yes.
5047000	5052000	No, not everyone knows this, but the word lethal that comes from the River Lefe.
5052000	5053000	Right.
5053000	5072000	Yes, in between our lives. And there's, there's a bunch of sort of narratological arcs around why we here on earth forget our previous incarnations or perhaps embodiments.
5072000	5091000	So yes, there's an unforgettable aspect, because it's weird, you know, it's almost as if in some of us in some features of our lives, we specifically bury some part of us that is fragmented by a situation.
5091000	5095000	And then we enact a drama.
5095000	5101000	Personally, a personal drama, I have done this right, it's embarrassing, but I know I'm aware of it.
5101000	5103000	We humans are sometimes embarrassing.
5103000	5104000	It's true.
5104000	5116000	So I will enact a drama about the part of myself that I dissociated from and hid from.
5116000	5119000	And the drama is very mythic.
5119000	5120000	Yeah.
5120000	5121000	Yeah.
5122000	5125000	In transactional analysis.
5125000	5127000	There's a concept of life scripts.
5127000	5128000	Yeah.
5128000	5138000	Right, which, which are coping mechanisms often established in childhood that are useful, sort of fairy tale ish. Right.
5138000	5150000	But when they are not conscious in our adult lives when when they're no longer really necessary and we have the capacity to negotiate and work with what's actually going on.
5150000	5156000	It's helpful for us to make conscious this life script, this mythic story that we've been playing out.
5156000	5162000	And perhaps rewrite it.
5162000	5163000	Yeah.
5163000	5179000	And the thing is, of course, you know, if we go into the much, much bigger wider, wider picture, you know, I mean, I've said and this leads on to a lot of the things I was going to say about the the hill.
5179000	5192000	I was talking about it all points to and leads to many details, which confirmed for me in various ways.
5192000	5201000	The threads, the connective threads to actually weave me back to my previous incarnations, so to speak.
5201000	5205000	And this is where this becomes really important.
5205000	5225000	And this is where I gain this peace and faith, for want of a better word, of this process that whenever I receive any of these pieces, whenever I receive any of these fragments,
5225000	5236000	I don't worry about chasing them, because I know, I absolutely know that all I have to do is wait.
5236000	5248000	Because there's going to be a time where, like I said with the individual that I met over a coffee table who told me the name I knew with certainty, I wasn't even looking for it.
5248000	5260000	I knew with certainty that this was the name and I knew at that moment that all I have to do is call on that name.
5260000	5266000	And I didn't chase it.
5266000	5277000	And all these little fragments that I've parked on the shelf and just bookmarked them, put them on the shelf and waited.
5277000	5300000	What it is, is it's all the fragments that I know, that as long as I keep myself open to all of these possibilities, that everything that is, that belongs to my trajectory, my journey through time and eternity, is all going to come to me.
5300000	5318000	I don't think the purpose of our current incarnation is necessarily to chase after all of these missing fragments, but they play a really important part and they will come to us anyway.
5318000	5336000	So sometimes I might wake up and be woken up by a repeat, I will be repeating to myself a specific set of words or a specific word.
5336000	5343000	And sometimes it's not even, it's in a language I don't even know what it is.
5343000	5350000	The important thing is, is that I remember it, I write it down and it sticks with me.
5350000	5356000	The other important thing about these things is because they're explained later.
5356000	5365000	And sometimes each one of these phrases and words are like a key that opens up a whole insight into another area.
5365000	5372000	But sometimes it takes five, seven years before I get the next part.
5372000	5379000	So I'm just sharing with you how for me these things work.
5379000	5401000	These little fragments which seem to belong to a, I'm sort of lost for words, but like a kind of fragmenting, fragments of like a weaving tapestry that belongs to many other incarnations that have existed from times before.
5401000	5409000	So there's a, there's a, what a figure that perhaps might be useful or helpful here.
5409000	5412000	Yeah, call it the starry blanket.
5412000	5423000	And one can imagine that over time, many lives, they are sewing in a sense in the sense of like needlework.
5423000	5432000	They're sewing a sort of a celestial blanket with acts of beauty and intelligence and courage and rescue and healing.
5432000	5438000	And that our souls are actually drawn from stars in this blanket. Many of them, right?
5438000	5447000	So our soul isn't one thing. It's like a set of connections between historical beings and places and moments and such.
5447000	5451000	And then as we live, we are adding to this blanket, right?
5451000	5460000	And it might seem fragmentary from down here where the star and that star and the moon and that planet and so forth.
5460000	5463000	But from up there, it's not fragmentary.
5463000	5464000	No, no.
5464000	5469000	It's fragmentary because of our relationship with linear time, I think primarily.
5469000	5475000	That's right. That's right. Absolutely right. Yeah, because of our relationship with linear time.
5475000	5478000	This is the thing that you doubt.
5478000	5479000	Yes, yes.
5479000	5481000	You learn to doubt, right?
5481000	5492000	And that's why you're not concerned with urgencies when you find the fragment, you place it on the shelf, you know linear time is an illusion.
5492000	5493000	That's it.
5493000	5501000	So over you'll you will traverse the illusion of linear time and the integration will naturally.
5501000	5507000	That's it. That's it. I couldn't I couldn't have put it better myself.
5507000	5521000	But you've put into words what I kind of viscerally feel because it is a feeling, you know, it's a feeling that there is no need to, you know, there is no need to be too concerned.
5521000	5533000	About it. Although like we said earlier, there is a certain there is a feeling of a sense of urgency right now in in some of the things we're discussing and communicating and sharing.
5533000	5537000	I understand your point of view on that.
5537000	5543000	But for me personally, in relation to these experiences.
5543000	5560000	It comes across to me personally in very much a way where it's like, right, okay, okay, I'm just getting another little, little bit of confirmation of my want of a better word.
5560000	5569000	My connection with eternity.
5569000	5579000	I mean, connection is not essentially, it's more your identity as in eternity.
5579000	5587000	Yeah, yeah, like you and eternity are the same thing, even though there's the Milky Way, and there's Lee.
5587000	5589000	It's true for all of us.
5589000	5608000	Yes, it is. But you and it's so profound because when, like, in our conversation now, you have to disparate sort of wanderers right and they both had these long paths but when they come together there's this profound
5608000	5613000	conversation.
5613000	5618000	Which is a kind of a musical composition.
5618000	5634000	The language, the spoken language of which is in a sense the least important thing, even though it's the, it's, it's the glass harmonica of our souls, sort of resonating back and forth.
5634000	5635000	Yes, yes.
5635000	5643000	I want to return to something you were speaking about earlier unless there's something urgently in that you need to share right now.
5643000	5645000	No, no, please, please go ahead.
5645000	5650000	Okay, so what is the gaze.
5650000	5656000	Yeah, we've been taught and I'm sure you'll, you'll have some things to add here but I want to introduce this topic.
5656000	5672000	We've been taught that that what we see is passive, right, that our eyes are receptors for light, that all that's happening in vision is that we receive the reflected light of things around us and the brain organizes that into a
5672000	5685000	sort of a picture in consciousness right it flips it over on the back the retina we know we have the scientific explanation of the mechanics of human vision.
5685000	5688000	So for most of human history.
5688000	5694000	None of that was what was being understood the Greeks were absolutely aware.
5694000	5706000	And I can't explain the complexities of their awareness and understanding of this fact, but that that the eyes project.
5707000	5709000	Participatory.
5709000	5727000	Just as in just as when you speak, my ear rings, and I hear something very similar is happening with vision it is kind of a, a speaking of energies into the world, which then press and touch in their various intentional ways.
5727000	5746000	The power, or the cloud, or the ball, and then this returns the, the, the, the sort of resonance of how we reached out to touch, and the purposes for which we reached out to touch affect the world, and this effect returns to us as vision.
5746000	5755000	Now, yes, say one more thing before I hand this over to you because I'm desperately curious about what you think about these things.
5755000	5767000	I've had the experience of waking up in my bed, looking around my room, seeing how things are laid out my girlfriend next to me on the bed, the shape of her hair on the pillow and so forth.
5767000	5772000	And then realizing that my eyes are closed.
5772000	5784000	Yeah, yeah, and opening my eyes and having nothing effectively changed except a feature of the feeling of the origin of the seeing.
5784000	5785000	Yes, yes.
5785000	5790000	So it's very clear to me that it is possible to see without eyes.
5790000	5791000	Yes.
5791000	5794000	Now, I'll hand this over to you and whatever.
5794000	5795000	Yeah, I'd love to get it.
5795000	5796000	Yes, yes.
5796000	5805000	Well, if we refer back to part one of the conversation we had last time, we were talking about the sun, you know, and we were talking about where is the sun.
5805000	5808000	You know, we can point to it in the sky and all of this sort of stuff.
5808000	5810000	And yeah, there's the sun and the rest of it.
5810000	5818000	But like we were talking about seeing the sun in dreams, feeling the sun upon your skin in dreams and so on.
5818000	5820000	And where is the sun in a dream?
5820000	5823000	You know, it's like, where is it?
5823000	5825000	Where is the sun you actually see?
5825000	5826000	Where is it?
5826000	5828000	You know, where is it?
5828000	5838000	Also, the whole notion of the heliocentric theory and the geocentric theory, you know, is the Earth in the center?
5838000	5841000	Does one go around the other or is it the other going around the other?
5841000	5844000	Well, yes, both are true.
5844000	5848000	And so we're back to that old quandary again.
5848000	5857000	And what you've just been describing is I'll bring your attention to a very strong symbol that many may be aware of or may have seen.
5857000	5862000	And that's the image of some of the images of Akhenaten.
5862000	5878000	So you have that famous image of Akhenaten, sometimes with the Arten itself, the sun, his version of Ra, or the solar god, the Arten, with its various rays with hands on the end.
5878000	5881000	Each ray has got a hand on the end.
5881000	5884000	Oh yes, yes, yes, the sun and then the rays.
5884000	5885000	The rays with hands.
5885000	5886000	The rays with hands.
5886000	5888000	The ray has like a hand.
5888000	5889000	Hand on the end, yeah.
5889000	5891000	It's sort of like this or something, right?
5891000	5894000	If I remember correctly.
5894000	5895000	Yeah, that's right.
5895000	5905000	So it's a sun with a splay of different rays and each ray has got a hand on the end of each ray.
5905000	5921000	And sometimes you see, I've seen images of Akhenaten and Nefertiti with rays coming, literally coming out of their eyes, like similar, you know, like rays jutting out of their eyes.
5921000	5934000	So this touches on a lot of the things you're speaking about in regards to
5934000	5940000	Is the manifest and does the manifestation come from within out?
5940000	5953000	Is it that light which reaches out into space only forms images when it has something, you know, when it has something to bounce off.
5953000	5962000	In the same way as the sun sends out rays to say, for example, the moon and the moon gives the reflection of the light.
5962000	5977000	Everything we see from the old perspective, you were mentioning the Greeks, but also the Egyptians, there was this notion that everything that was projected from within out, so to speak.
5977000	5978000	You have an image here.
5978000	5979000	Yes.
5979000	5980000	That's it.
5980000	5983000	Of Nefertiti and Akhenaten.
5983000	5997000	And the, yeah, so you have the the art in with all of the rays coming out and you can't see it too well but on the ends of those rays, you have each one of the rays has got a hand on the end.
5997000	6000000	Yeah, and she's got a child in her lap.
6000000	6001000	That's right.
6001000	6002000	Yeah.
6002000	6003000	That's right.
6003000	6005000	Very peculiar.
6005000	6006000	Yes.
6006000	6008000	Very profound.
6008000	6010000	Absolutely.
6011000	6014000	Okay, so I didn't mean to interrupt.
6014000	6021000	So with the gaze itself, all of these things you're talking about come into play.
6021000	6036000	The gaze is not a, if the one who is practicing can truly step inside this, this way that you've just described, this particular perspective, for one's better word.
6036000	6049000	If the practitioner can step inside that and then experience that, then there is the opportunity for that to take place.
6049000	6052000	Oh, there's so much here.
6052000	6056000	The recipient would be the passive one.
6056000	6062000	Yes, but it's also resembles the relation where, okay, this is just something that's occurring to me.
6062000	6073000	If the practitioner becomes the point of origin, not the sun as hypostasis, but the origin of why there is a sun.
6073000	6074000	Right.
6074000	6075000	Right.
6075000	6083000	And then the patient, so to speak, becomes sort of like the earth or something illumined.
6083000	6084000	Or the moon.
6084000	6085000	Yes, exactly.
6085000	6086000	Precisely.
6086000	6088000	Illumined by that.
6088000	6099000	And so this ancient, originary role, not a play, but a role embodiment.
6099000	6100000	Yeah.
6100000	6101000	Right.
6101000	6105000	Sort of naturally and in a way, magnetically.
6105000	6106000	Yes.
6106000	6107000	Yes.
6107000	6109000	Because of the ancientness of these roles.
6109000	6110000	Yes.
6110000	6112000	Please continue.
6112000	6113000	Well, yes.
6113000	6120000	I mean, what you were saying about, you know, one being literally like a sun, the other being like a moon.
6120000	6128000	You literally create that polarity between the practitioner and the subject.
6128000	6132000	There has to be that polarity created.
6132000	6140000	And it has to be something which is done in a very, I keep using the word in a very visceral manner.
6140000	6162000	So when an animal is exuding this force, like a snake, for example, or a lion or something like this or some other beast, it's actually, it's actually doing it usually with the intention of it being almost like it's going to catch its prey, so to speak.
6162000	6169000	It has to find a way to, in a sense.
6169000	6170000	I'm trying.
6170000	6183000	I'm not very, very good at finding words today, but in a sense, it literally plummets that the recipient into a complete trance just for a moment often.
6183000	6195000	And it's that, that state that the recipient falls into that the hunter, so to speak, uses to its advantage.
6195000	6198000	Okay, I want to say a few things here briefly.
6199000	6213000	In nature, those of us who are sensitive to sentience, consciousness, awareness, intelligence, particularly, we'll see different forms of intelligences embodied in nature.
6213000	6225000	For example, in the eyes of a cow, it's not the same as looking in the eyes of a raccoon, or it's not the same as looking in the eye of a praying mantis, it's not the same as looking in the eye of a cat.
6225000	6244000	The snake's eye is a very particular thing, but one of the best examples of what you're talking about is utilized, because it's really obviously a human can easily see it on film, is what a cuttlefish does when it is hypnotizing a shrimp.
6245000	6266000	I see pulses of colorful light traversing the skin of the cuttlefish in an increasing frequency, and you see the shrimp actually start to just sort of float off and then, you know, and then when he grabs it, right?
6266000	6271000	For the praying mantis, what it does is this kind of thing.
6271000	6277000	It will weave slowly, and then very rapidly, and then strike.
6277000	6279000	That's it, just like a snake.
6279000	6281000	It's very similar.
6281000	6284000	There are forms of martial art that are not the similar.
6284000	6285000	That's right.
6285000	6291000	In martial art, the goal is to hide the, it's to hide the build up, right?
6291000	6294000	You don't want the build up to be seen.
6294000	6297000	So the build up becomes internal.
6297000	6298000	Right, right.
6298000	6300000	Like you say, visceral.
6300000	6301000	Please continue.
6301000	6302000	Yeah, this is right.
6302000	6314000	And when the individual is practicing with fascination techniques, the gaze techniques, it's very subtle.
6314000	6325000	This is something, obviously, if I was working with someone directly and teaching them, teaching them exactly how to do this, there is a certain way to do it.
6325000	6330000	And so often you have to demonstrate it on the person you're trying to teach, of course.
6330000	6336000	You know, you have to demonstrate it directly to them so that they actually grasp what it is you're actually doing.
6336000	6347000	Once they've been on the sort of recipient end of it, then it's my job to actually get that individual to replicate that effectively.
6347000	6362000	So I would then coach that individual into how to actually replicate that properly and teach them all the little tips on what to look for, precisely what to look for, to know that it's being done properly.
6362000	6368000	And that's the important thing, is teaching them exactly what to look for.
6368000	6375000	Because there are certain signs that it's being done properly.
6375000	6376000	Yes.
6376000	6378000	Unmistakable, you might say.
6378000	6379000	Uh-huh.
6379000	6385000	It's different from hypnosis, but there are signs also in the client in hypnosis.
6385000	6386000	Yes.
6386000	6388000	Yes, this is very true.
6389000	6392000	Often you can see the pulse in someone's neck.
6392000	6394000	You can see it slow.
6394000	6397000	You can see the relaxation of the facial muscles.
6397000	6401000	You can detect the shoulders may drop slightly.
6401000	6403000	The breathing changes.
6403000	6410000	These are hard to see over a camera, but when you're in person with someone, they're relatively easy to see.
6410000	6419000	I'm sure there are different signs for the success of mesmerism, but there's another principle I want to speak briefly about here.
6419000	6438000	And before I continue, I just want to say, I think that sometimes when people are listening to me speaking, they may have the impression that I'm reading from the book of what I already know.
6439000	6441000	Right.
6441000	6447000	Because this is what it is common for us to think when people speak.
6447000	6453000	They, that they are saying things they already know.
6453000	6455000	They have known before.
6455000	6460000	And in our conversation, much of what is taking place is not that.
6460000	6465000	It is something very strange is happening where.
6465000	6467000	My awareness.
6467000	6472000	It feels like is touching a nonverbal mirror in you.
6472000	6473000	Right.
6473000	6477000	And I'm able to somehow coalesce.
6477000	6483000	It's like the thing we were talking about with, with seeing, I can less the reflection.
6483000	6490000	And then I can begin to articulate what I am feeling or seeing, which is not something I have known before.
6490000	6492000	Or articulated before.
6492000	6494000	Right before.
6494000	6497000	So this is what is so beautiful and exciting.
6497000	6500000	Part of what is so beautiful or exciting for me.
6500000	6503000	As well as the an amnoetic.
6503000	6509000	Reweaving of histories and, and potentials and seeing.
6509000	6512000	The thing I wanted to mention is that.
6512000	6515000	Again, my friend Ryan first diver who.
6515000	6527000	You know, certainly doesn't consider himself a magician, but the path of a black foot ceremonial person is involved with something.
6527000	6529000	They don't have the concept for magic.
6529000	6531000	There's lots of words in English.
6531000	6533000	They don't even have a concept for it.
6533000	6536000	And their treatment of identity is so different.
6536000	6541000	From ours, that the idea of concrete identity basically doesn't exist.
6541000	6545000	So you see a person, it's not necessarily that person.
6545000	6546000	Right.
6546000	6549000	They don't just presume, oh, it's that person.
6549000	6555000	Because you could be coming from the sun, or you could be coming from the land, or you could be coming from another tribe.
6555000	6562000	So your identity is in how you relate rather than in your visage and, you know, your name badge or whatever.
6562000	6564000	As it is in the West.
6564000	6565000	Right.
6565000	6571000	We just know we think, oh, that's Joe, you know, I was taught to not think that way.
6571000	6576000	And during my experience, I was taught to very carefully.
6576000	6582000	Participatorially establish our identities together rather than presume them.
6582000	6588000	But there's two principles that I think are relevant, perhaps to hypnosis and maybe mesmerism.
6588000	6591000	And one is similitude, the resemblance.
6591000	6592000	Right.
6592000	6594000	Resembling.
6594000	6600000	When you say like, I get them to emulate me.
6600000	6601000	Right.
6601000	6603000	That's the similitude principle.
6603000	6604000	Right.
6604000	6617000	Well, there is, it can never be truly emulated because it's such an infinitely variable and minuscule actual thing that takes place.
6617000	6625000	But yes, you're on the right track and it's definitely there is definitely a similitude and.
6625000	6627000	And there is something.
6627000	6629000	It's something you can replicate.
6629000	6639000	Yeah, it's not emulation that leads to success. It's emulation that gives that maybe communicates the form and then the form has to be embodied.
6639000	6641000	Yes, yes.
6641000	6644000	I think that that is successful or not.
6644000	6650000	But then the other principle is I think is quite trippy is contagion.
6650000	6653000	I'm going to actually use the word transmission, actually.
6653000	6654000	Fair enough.
6654000	6673000	Because because there's the principle of transmission is something that's very real when you're working with the type of thing that I'm talking about, because it's something which is, which is coursing through you.
6673000	6682000	It's almost connecting to a field of connecting to a field of information that exists out there beyond us.
6682000	6700000	So if it's coming through me, and I know how to actually, and I successfully or, you know, enable this to be transmitted to the individual that I'm working with, then it's by the very nature of this energetic field starting to connect.
6700000	6716000	One will connect to that continuum, which links through all of my own experiences somehow, and it actually is transmitted to the individual who, who I'm working with.
6716000	6729000	Yes, so when you say this continuum, so to speak, it's almost as if not just your history, but the lineages that feed in your history.
6729000	6747000	Yes, go into the other person and as a seed sort of and begin to light up and expand. And I'm not trying to couch our discussion in terms of concepts from, for example, traditional Blackfoot ceremony, but crucially in their way of life.
6747000	6760000	They have this concept that is more primordial than the other two that I was just using, which are similitude and contagion. And obviously those are English words.
6760000	6762000	It's transfer.
6763000	6788000	You know, in English, we might call it initiation, but it's much more intimate than this. It's literally both something being placed into you, and also you being drawn into a lineage history that you now become a family member of, so to speak.
6789000	6809000	So we can bring this analogy to say, for example, when somebody is in certain types of tradition where you have, say, for example, the laying on of hands as an actual transmission, it's similar to this.
6809000	6822000	There is something that is transmitted through time from lots of different individuals who have existed physically, but maybe don't exist physically anymore.
6822000	6829000	However, they're present in you at the moment that you transmit to the next person.
6829000	6830000	Yes.
6830000	6853000	And you, in the future, when you're no longer this incarnate in the normal sense, will be transmitted through your, you know, the connection you had, you have added to that continuum of energy, amplified it in some measure, and then that's added to what's passed down to the future generations.
6853000	6854000	Yes.
6854000	6870000	So there is a type of transmission that we're speaking of here. And initiation, as you say, it's all, these are all relevant terms, maybe not always satisfactory words, but, you know, they don't have the same idea.
6870000	6875000	I think the concepts are easily understood. I just want to share a couple of other things briefly.
6875000	6889000	When I began to study Tai Chi, I studied it before with it with a teacher and then I lost my form and there's a whole adventure behind that, but I found these five older men who were practicing every morning and maybe end to teach me.
6889000	6890000	Yeah.
6890000	6902000	And I was very passionate about this, right? And pretty soon, within about three months, about three months in, I started having dreams. I had three or four of them.
6902000	6914000	In which a group of older Asian men would come and they would just straight up tell me, you know, we've heard that, you know, we've heard about you and we're here to check you out.
6914000	6915000	Yeah.
6915000	6931000	Want to see, like, who are you? You know, what are you for real? You know, either kind of person we would want to join the family, you know, this kind of thing. And thankfully, in those cases, it worked out well for me.
6931000	6942000	There was a similar thing that happened when I experienced a transfer from Blackfoot culture where, and it was much more profound and like primordial.
6942000	6959000	And there were, there were like hundreds of men, warriors and bound ceremonial elders and stuff that came. There was this quest. There were all these amazing features that were nothing like a regular dream.
6959000	6960000	Right.
6961000	6976000	Very obviously, something's going on here. So I just, I just wanted to share that because it might help people to understand what is meant by joining a lineage or being introduced or having a transmission.
6976000	6983000	Right. It really is to become a part of a lineage and a family.
6983000	7002000	And to be checked out, right? To be sort of, you know, tested. Like, are you, are you for real? You want to sell this? What do you want? You know, actually, often there's a question when you meet a non-ordinary being or intelligence, they may praise you, right?
7002000	7010000	They'll sort of, they may sort of build you up and say, oh yeah, you're really cool. We like you, blah, blah, blah. And so we're going to give you a gift. And what do you want?
7011000	7018000	Sorry, because they're really trying to figure out, are you, are you selfish?
7018000	7019000	Yeah, right.
7019000	7026000	Right. Are you selfish? It's really kind of the question. And by the way, that question leads to a ladder of other questions.
7026000	7027000	Yes.
7027000	7033000	That's the first question, right? I think. But yes, please continue.
7033000	7037000	And how are we doing? How are we doing on time? How are you?
7037000	7045000	I think I can do maybe, maybe about another 10 minutes or something like that, more or less, on this occasion.
7045000	7062000	So, I'm just trying to work out where we were because, so really, to me, all I'm trying to find a way to sort of conclude it on this, on this occasion.
7062000	7063000	So,
7063000	7066000	Yeah, I mean, we can have, we can hopefully we'll have further explanation.
7066000	7075000	Yeah, well, well, you know, like I say, when, when I've got the ability to make it coincide with everything I've got going on here, I'm very, very happy to do that.
7075000	7076000	As a mile.
7076000	7077000	Yes.
7077000	7088000	Yeah, great. So, so to sort of try and pull this together at the moment, it's more a thing of like, you know, where is all of this going?
7088000	7094000	You know, what, what is all of this giving to us?
7094000	7101000	You know, it seems as if there is a, there is a question hanging.
7101000	7104000	We experience these things.
7104000	7112000	I'm sure there are many, many, many others similar to ourselves who've been having these experiences.
7112000	7121000	And it's been feeding into the work that we're doing and reflecting itself back in the work that we're doing.
7121000	7139000	Certainly, we can, we can very likely even identify what we believe our roles and our duty is in this incarnation with regards to how we pass this onto people and what you what utility it has as well.
7139000	7145000	You know, for the benefit of others.
7145000	7155000	But there is a big question which is hanging there all the time and that that is where is this all ultimately leading to.
7155000	7167000	You know, this is this is the question for me, or at least the question which I'm going to leave hanging in the air, perhaps.
7167000	7176000	Now, of course, it would probably be foolish for us to to conclusively answer anything of the kind.
7176000	7186000	We've touched on that previously, you know, sometimes there's no point in, you know, it's not right to kill the to kill that question.
7186000	7195000	But it's certainly something which is worth putting out there.
7195000	7200000	Even if it's for our own personal work.
7200000	7203000	In our conversations so far.
7203000	7205000	We have run.
7205000	7213000	We have sounded bells along a trajectory, right.
7213000	7218000	And those those ringing notes.
7218000	7222000	They naturally coalesce over time.
7222000	7237000	In the same way that you were speaking about the recovered fragments and how it's not you allow them to be sort of preserved without constant attention and inquiry.
7237000	7239000	Yeah, exactly. Yes.
7239000	7255000	And also the concept of suggestion and indirect communication is very profound. So for me, our conversation sounds these notes that ring in the between of our conversations, and I'm sure we'll ring in the audience.
7255000	7262000	In a very, very generative and fertilizing way like that.
7262000	7277000	Like the Pete, like, like the menstruational, you know, intensity of the blue sky and the sonic purple, the red purple.
7277000	7283000	Yeah, I have so much faith in you and your way and your path.
7283000	7294000	You as a being who who has a noble purpose. You know, you have great charisma, but you're not like a personality.
7294000	7299000	You know, in the way of someone who's self aggrandizing.
7299000	7306000	And so I'm just so grateful for this opportunity to learn and see with you every time we may have it.
7306000	7324000	Yeah, and Darren, similarly with with yourself, you know, you the way you the way you lay things out in terms of your own summaries and descriptions are incredibly, incredibly illuminating on the spot, you know, for me.
7324000	7337000	It's not even like I'm sure maybe if I listen to this interview in the future, I'll have further revelations but in the midst of actually being here talking about these things.
7337000	7351000	There's been a great deal of actual living, you know, things kickstarting like coming to life in my own understanding right there on the spot as as we saw earlier today.
7351000	7369000	And that in itself, you know, is is incredibly inspiring and there's something about the way that you're presenting these things to me or reflecting them back to me in some instances, which is incredibly illuminating for me.
7369000	7376000	So it's it's there's something very fruitful about the way I feel we're we're interacting on these matters.
7376000	7386000	It's profoundly the same for me it's almost as if the light of my history and awareness and the light of your history and awareness, they meet somewhere.
7386000	7395000	And then there's, there's like, there's like a group of figures who speak back to us from the the the intersection. Right.
7395000	7400000	It's so beautiful. And I'm just so grateful and humbled.
7400000	7425000	Me too. Me too. And I'm also curiously aware of the fact that there is something I feel there's something in in your own experiences and background and in and in mine that somehow relates to something beyond us, which we've not quite yet been able to quite fathom or grasp
7425000	7432000	but there's a it feels like there's a reason why this connection came together. So absolutely.
7432000	7436000	So healing for me. Yeah, inspiring.
7436000	7447000	And it's so insightful. I've seen I've learned so much. I mean, it sounds like I'm talking and blah, blah, blah. I get it. But I've learned so much.
7447000	7462000	Every time we come together and it really is humbling because it's not like a what is it's not like it's about what Darren knows or anything like that something very magical, sort of mysterious and alive.
7462000	7466000	And I just want to honor that and you and your work.
7466000	7470000	I'm so grateful and I can't wait for the next time.
7470000	7486000	Well, well, hopefully, when you're when you're over here in the UK, I mean, I'm, you know, we I don't think we can miss the chance to try to, you know, to pull that together to meet up and and do something.
7486000	7491000	Go to some of these sacred sites around.
7491000	7498000	I just want to extend the invitation you ever want to come here you've got a spot, you know, I don't know have you ever been to California.
7498000	7509000	You've never been. Well, actually, I think when I was 10 years old, I did, but that was when I was 10 years old, I, it was actually Florida, not California now.
7509000	7515000	Sorry, just like, well, we'll talk about the soft line, but I'm there.
7515000	7524000	And yeah, I'm just so excited and thank you so much, Lee. It's brilliant to have a chance to speak with you and learn together so.
7524000	7526000	Absolutely.
7526000	7530000	Our next adventure. Absolutely. Yes. Yes.
7530000	7532000	May your path be blessed and beautiful.
7532000	7537000	Yours too, sir.
7537000	7542000	Bye bye for now.
