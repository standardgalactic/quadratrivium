0	6000	Hello everybody. Welcome.
6000	12000	I especially want to thank those of you who are new to my channel
12000	15000	for giving me a little bit of attention.
15000	20000	I work pretty hard to produce quality content.
20000	27000	I'm not here to blow my own horn or parade around like I'm something special.
27000	31000	What I'm interested in is learning how to see better together,
31000	37000	trying to understand what the actual potentials of our human nature are,
37000	42000	how those were lost, how we might recover them together.
42000	46000	So this is what you're going to find me exploring.
46000	55000	And some of the older material, you're going to see like a radical difference
55000	64000	in the depth and the level of inspiration in some of my older material
64000	73000	because back in the days when I was younger and the experiences that forged my mind were more fresh,
73000	78000	there's some very profound stuff back there.
78000	81000	You'll find a little bit of mania back there too,
81000	86000	but if you don't find a little bit of mania,
86000	93000	you're probably looking in the wrong place because our actual nature as human beings
93000	99000	is so staggering that if exposure to it doesn't light you up,
99000	106000	you're probably mostly dead inside or you've just been turned into some kind of a conceptual
106000	118000	and sensorial zombie by the ceaseless impoverishments of our common anti-cultures
118000	125000	and ridiculous domineering paradigms.
125000	130000	So yeah, I encourage you to do the archaeology,
130000	139000	go back in time, especially to the historical epoch in my channel
139000	145000	where you'll see the same image, looks sort of like a little satellite, right?
145000	150000	And there's some kind of a code word.
150000	156000	Those are the early days and some of that stuff I think you'll find very,
156000	165000	at least at the very least entertaining, if not astonishing and inspiring.
165000	168000	So yeah, I'm so glad to have some new subscribers.
168000	175000	I think a lot of that is probably due to my...
175000	181000	some of it's due to interviews with Lee Gerard Barlow
181000	185000	who I'm going to be doing another interview with on this coming Wednesday.
185000	188000	Super excited about that.
188000	193000	And then also Alan Steinfeld and Henrietta Weeks
193000	205000	who I should be having another interview with on Monday or Tuesday of the coming week.
205000	213000	I'm working on getting some other interview subjects which I'll keep quiet for the moment.
213000	221000	I also think some of the new people are here because of my discussion of Amon Hillman
221000	226000	who is certainly a maniac, but a rather interesting one.
226000	233000	I've got an essay about him coming out shortly on my medium channel.
233000	235000	You can find me there.
235000	242000	If you just look for Darren Stevenson on medium.
242000	245000	I think my channel is called At Organel.
245000	251000	I've got that if I remember that correctly.
251000	258000	So yeah, please take a moment to ask a question.
258000	266000	If you do in fact like the content, like it, share it.
266000	270000	Anything that helps me grow my audience is very powerful
270000	277000	and its ability to empower me to continue this work.
277000	284000	And I'm profoundly thankful to my Patreon supporters.
284000	287000	If you want to throw me a dollar every month, that means a lot
287000	293000	because if there's a few of you that do that, that adds up quickly.
293000	297000	So you know, that's $12 a year.
297000	301000	I also have a PayPal account.
301000	304000	You can make a direct donation if you care to.
304000	309000	I very rarely solicit patronage,
309000	316000	but it's extremely helpful for me.
316000	321000	Even though, you know, what I actually earn from patronage
321000	327000	is about these days around $140 a month, pretty minimal.
327000	336000	And I pay out some patronage to others whose work is important to me as well.
336000	340000	So yeah, take a moment, ask a question, share an experience,
340000	344000	an insight, share your thoughts.
344000	349000	Like or you know, hell dislike the video.
349000	352000	Share it, whatever you feel comfortable doing.
352000	355000	Grateful that you're all here.
355000	358000	And then I'm still vertical after all these years.
358000	372000	I can walk around and still physically able, body, and somewhat able-minded.
372000	381000	I've been listening over the past couple of days to
381000	386000	something I very rarely pay any attention to, Joe Rogan.
386000	392000	But I was curious to see his interview with David Grush,
392000	398000	former top-level intelligence officer with the United States military,
398000	400000	whistleblower on the topic of UFOs.
400000	403000	I learned quite a bit.
403000	410000	You know, I've been following Grush since approximately May of last year.
410000	415000	And I've written a long essay on the history of the UFO phenomenon
415000	418000	in the United States. It's on my medium channel.
418000	422000	There's actually a couple essays of related topic there.
422000	426000	I've been following UFOs since I was six or seven years old.
426000	433000	So you're talking, you know, late 60s, late 1960s.
433000	437000	Long before this was a cult phenomenon.
437000	445000	I've always had a bit of the, perhaps both the stigma and the shining
445000	453000	of the non-ordinary about it.
453000	459000	Yeah, when I was a kid, I read Chariots of the Gods by Von Donnecken.
459000	462000	I was fascinated by Egyptology.
462000	466000	I read the Egyptian Book of the Dead when I was 11.
466000	469000	I was a voracious reader as a child.
469000	473000	I don't know if I'm, if I still qualify because I'm not doing a lot of reading these days,
473000	482000	but I have a huge library and an active bookshelf.
482000	486000	So I've been fascinated by this since I was a child.
486000	491000	I think the inspiration of my fascination is relatively simple.
491000	496000	There must be actually intelligent other beings in the universe.
496000	504000	And those of you who know my work know that I very commonly argue
504000	508000	that there's actually intelligent other beings all around us.
508000	512000	Because their mode doesn't match ours,
512000	516000	our species generally doesn't recognize them in sciences.
516000	519000	Only kind of starting.
519000	523000	Not that science is one thing, it's not.
523000	528000	But there are people within science who are well aware
528000	533000	that we are surrounded not merely by intelligences, but by transcendentions.
533000	541000	This doesn't have language or models to talk about it yet.
541000	548000	So, yeah, I think, you know, if what we mean by intelligence is builds machines,
548000	557000	then we're the only one around here, the only local one here that seems to be doing this.
557000	560000	Apparently, we are apparently the only local one.
560000	569000	That's a pretty dumb idea of intelligence because without the complex necessary social intelligence,
569000	573000	the capacity to build machines will get everything dead right quick.
573000	581000	So, it doesn't look like intelligence to me that looks like a specific mode of cognition
581000	588000	that's extremely dangerous and not actually intelligent at all.
588000	593000	Any species that offloads their evolutionary momentum into machine building
593000	597000	is going to snuff themselves and their environment in short order.
597000	599000	So that just doesn't look intelligent to me.
599000	607000	And I longed to meet other beings who were actually intelligent,
607000	613000	partly because I believed that the universe would produce such beings
613000	619000	and partly because they might give us the keys to save our world.
619000	628000	And if not, our world, at least our minds.
628000	633000	Now, I have a variety of topics on my mind today and I'm not sure which of them I'm going to get to.
633000	642000	I'm going to start here.
642000	644000	I'm going to bookmark a couple things.
644000	648000	So, frame collapse, I'm going to call frame collapse,
648000	658000	and multiple worlds but not the physics theory.
658000	666000	So, I've been listening to Joe Rogan's interviews over the past couple days,
666000	677000	first with David Grush, who I think is a person of high integrity and true patriotic spirit.
677000	685000	And what I mean by true patriotic spirit is a very rare kind of thing.
685000	699000	Believes in the origins and purposes that underlie our nation's formative urgencies
699000	714000	and is willing to risk everything to preserve, protect, and develop those.
714000	720000	There are probably far better urgencies.
720000	725000	We're running a nation on an operating system written in the 1700s.
725000	728000	We think we're intelligent, that's not intelligent.
728000	736000	And in fact, at the level of we, the level of our collectives, our species is idiotic,
736000	747000	catastrophically ignorant, easily captured and mismotivated,
747000	761000	inclined to continue with devastatingly stupid orientations, activities, agendas, and so forth.
761000	770000	So, there's very little intelligence about the dominant features of human beings in our time.
770000	772000	Human beings as a group.
772000	777000	Individual humans, it's easy to find shining examples of brilliance.
777000	781000	Collectives vary uncommon, why is this so?
781000	798000	This is a question we should deeply preserve, pursue, and I suggest transform.
798000	801000	So, the Grush interview was quite interesting.
801000	805000	I learned a number of new things.
805000	811000	I've probably heard six interviews with him, maybe seven.
811000	816000	People may say whatever they like about him.
816000	820000	Personally, I consider him a modern hero.
820000	831000	He is certainly the flag bearer, the ring bearer of the movement for disclosure in our time.
831000	838000	Disclosure being the revelation of what our government, quote unquote,
838000	845000	I mean, that's presuming it even belongs to us, which is sort of a ridiculous supposition.
845000	849000	It's not our government, it's a government.
849000	858000	It's a government that is associated with us, but has its entirely own, it should be very obvious,
858000	867000	existence, agendas, motivations in there, not ours.
867000	873000	So, yeah, I mean, that should come as a revelation.
873000	875000	The American government is not ours.
875000	878000	It's not going to become ours.
878000	889000	It's a separate entity, a dumpster fire of competing, highly aggressive, well defended thrips,
889000	895000	which are dead inside processes that capture groups of humans,
895000	899000	and deploy them for the furtherance of non-human agendas.
899000	903000	By non-human agendas, I don't mean alien agendas.
903000	921000	I mean agendas born in the absence of our humanity in the collective behavioral cognition of our species.
921000	936000	Three of the very lethal modes of this are commerce, war, and ideology.
936000	940000	So, yeah, this is not our government.
940000	945000	This is the government associated with where we live.
945000	948000	It was never really our government.
949000	951000	When we were born, it wasn't ours.
951000	953000	When we will die, it won't be ours.
953000	955000	It won't belong to our children.
955000	957000	It didn't belong to our ancestors.
957000	959000	You should understand this very clearly.
959000	961000	The idea that we have a government is insane.
961000	964000	It's no chance of that being true.
964000	976000	That's a lethal fiction that we operate under the ages of daily to our grave detriment.
976000	980000	But Grush came forward and said,
980000	990000	this government here has and has long had direct knowledge of non-human intelligences in time space,
990000	999000	visiting Earth with objects, material objects, things that we would call technology.
999000	1012000	We have recovered or have been given instances of these technologies including things we would call vehicles.
1012000	1021000	There are a number, at least 10 and possibly as many as 30 vehicles.
1021000	1028000	There are a broad array of objects of a semi or metatechnological nature
1028000	1032000	that this government is and has long been in possession of.
1032000	1035000	There is intelligence about this matter.
1035000	1041000	This government is in possession of, and there is no oversight.
1041000	1050000	In other words, you have a breakaway civilization inside this government that is no longer merely human.
1050000	1056000	They are no longer modern humans, they are not us.
1056000	1063000	What I mean by a breakaway civilization is a civilization in possession of artifacts and or technologies
1063000	1069000	that are advanced so far beyond anything we can even conceive of
1069000	1073000	that they qualify as a different species.
1073000	1086000	If you could imagine a group of humans capable with computers and capable of using them during, say, the Civil War era.
1086000	1089000	This is what we are talking about.
1089000	1099000	Same physical species, not the same technological species.
1099000	1105000	Now, Grush isn't saying there is a breakaway civilization, but let's be clear.
1105000	1116000	These topics are classified above, at levels above, weapons of mass destruction, nuclear power, nuclear weapons and so forth.
1116000	1121000	This is the most secret of secret things.
1121000	1126000	And the reason that it is the most secret of secret things is fairly simple.
1126000	1136000	It comprises the holy grail of asymmetric advantage over any conceivable terrestrial enemy.
1136000	1149000	And strangely, ironically, lethally and devastatingly, at the group level, our species is absolutely married
1149000	1160000	to war, commerce, prison nearing, ideology and self-devastation.
1160000	1171000	At the individual level, nothing like that is going on.
1171000	1185000	At the collective level, the kind of animal that we are is absolutely captivated by what I call thrisps,
1185000	1196000	which are essentially artifacts that form in our group, in the dimension of human group cognition.
1196000	1211000	When that dimension of group identity, relation, memory, commitment, orientation, purpose is evacuated.
1211000	1220000	When we depart from that, thrisps are the result.
1220000	1235000	You could imagine something like cancer, you could imagine something like the difference between the untouched Amazon rainforest
1235000	1240000	and dead cities.
1240000	1246000	Imagine cities that just build themselves with robots, they're dead inside, there's nothing in there.
1246000	1248000	It's a good analogy for a thrisps, right?
1248000	1259000	So the dead cities eat the living rainforest and just self-replicate lethal dead structure,
1259000	1265000	whose primary purpose is simply the production of further dead structure.
1265000	1275000	In this case, rather than in the Amazon rainforest, it's in the network of minds comprised by human beings
1275000	1287000	and the other living networks that we humans draw our origin, purpose, spirit and dreaming from,
1287000	1294000	which would be all the living beings of Earth and in fact, beings far beyond the Earth,
1294000	1302000	beings who are not merely material.
1302000	1307000	So Grush, you know, was being persecuted.
1307000	1327000	He was tasked with determining if such black projects exist that are oriented to hide and reverse engineer retrieved non-human technologies.
1327000	1332000	He discovered that there were in fact such black projects.
1332000	1343000	And then he started being persecuted, not surprisingly, and threatened and so forth.
1343000	1365000	So he went directly to the Inspector General of the intelligence community and, you know, dumped data about the history of this situation.
1373000	1391000	Mainly so that he could be in some way protected from reprisal, but also because what's going on is illegal, right?
1391000	1399000	It's a violation of the concept of the constitutional government, democracy, so forth.
1399000	1418000	Because what we apparently have here, or what exists here, whether we have it or not, is a relatively modest group of humans within the U.S. military
1419000	1439000	that are operating without oversight and are essentially stealing funds from other projects and then hiding that extortion.
1439000	1460000	So, you know, this has been going on now for, well, look, people have been trying to bring this to light for probably more than 50 years in our nation, in this nation,
1461000	1479000	and mostly failing and suffering, murder, threat, derision, the obliteration of their social or personal or vocational identities, histories, potentials and so forth.
1479000	1490000	So Grush, you know, in some ways he's Frodo, right, in the Lord of the Rings, right? He's the ring-bearer.
1490000	1497000	He's the one on whose shoulders this has landed, and I really don't care what anyone has to say.
1497000	1517000	There's no way this guy was motivated by self-interest. If he was motivated by self-interest, he would maintain his clearances and continue to ascend the essentially endless ladder of privilege and pay in top branches of the United States military.
1517000	1528000	Are you kidding me? Like, you know, someone thinks like, oh, he's trying to make money or there's no money in this for him.
1528000	1546000	He's trying to stay alive, trying to keep his family alive, and he's trying to reveal in a way that can't be rolled back a series of catastrophic agendas and situations.
1546000	1565000	Within the government of the United States, in the closed stacks, so to speak, of the libraries of our government.
1565000	1588000	So, you know, that was an interesting interview. I knew most of what Grush spoke of there, and he's limited in what he can speak of because he has to have, he has to have a thing called dobser clearance and he has to have, he has to completely, perfectly fail to violate that.
1588000	1604000	So, he can say what he has been authorized. No, he can say what he hasn't been forbidden from saying, but if he veers much from that, they're going to come for him.
1604000	1632000	And there's a lot of people hoping that he's going to do that, right? Because they're just, they just want him to veer a tiny bit from the way he crosses one of those tees or dots one of those eyes in what he's sharing, and they'll arrest him, or silence him, or revoke his clearances, or, you know, whatever, whatever steps can be taken
1632000	1649000	at the official, logistical, and legal level to get that, to get that guy off the playing board. He's a big thorn in the sight of many.
1662000	1689000	So then, today I was listening to Rogan interviewing George Knapp, who's, you know, been at this for, what is this? You know, he's been a pro disclosure, someone working for disclosure for like 36 years, long, long time.
1689000	1718000	And also Jeremy Corbell, who is a little more recent in his commitment to the mission. And again, what's, you know, what's the mission? It's, it's layered, right?
1718000	1735000	Layer one, tell human beings we're not alone. We know for a fact that we're not alone in the universe. There's no chance of that being true. And we've known this for a long, long time.
1735000	1762000	There are other intelligences. It's not entirely clear that they're merely biological the way we are. I am also aware that there are other forms of intelligence. There are field intelligences that are probably the origin of our minds, without which we wouldn't have consciousness or anything like it.
1762000	1786000	And there seems to be a ladder of forms of intelligence, each of which contribute something to both the ladder and the orders above and below them.
1786000	1815000	So for example, around here, the plants and the microorganisms are profoundly advanced intelligences, physicalizations, platforms, if you will.
1817000	1837000	They contribute up and down scale to the possibility of the existence of our minds, the minds of animals.
1838000	1857000	We think, who knows what we think? At the collective level, we're relatively stupid because we are easily captured by ideological, what, inhibitions, nonsense?
1857000	1883000	So like reductionism and materialism have dominated our species at the collective level for a very long time. Well, a long modern time, I don't know. A couple, three, four hundred years or something maybe?
1887000	1898000	And those two ideologies are blinding, stupefying and mechanizing.
1917000	1939000	You can imagine, bless you. You can imagine some sort of comic book scenario, right, where like a human lives in a caged off area or in a box, and outside it there are trillions of forms and modes of other intelligences.
1939000	1951000	But in its backyard, it only sees, you know, a few examples of other beings that it can convince itself aren't intelligent because they don't make machines.
1951000	1969000	Let me just be really clear about something. Any cell in your body outperforms the entire history and future of human forged machines three billion times per second.
1970000	1984000	There's nothing, there's no need for anything resembling machines. None. Nature is billions of light years beyond anything resembling the necessity of mechanization.
1987000	1993000	All of the things we think we need machines for, we don't need machines for those things.
1993000	2002000	And since we're developing only machines, we've lost access to the meta technologies that are implicit in nature.
2004000	2013000	And these include the ability to travel anywhere instantaneously, to not merely touch other minds telepathically but forge networks of them.
2014000	2030000	Anything you can, instantaneous healing, probably resurrection of the dead, anything you can possibly imagine with the exception of war or the need for commerce or prisons or anything like this.
2030000	2057000	The actual situation that we're in bears no resemblance to our common suppositions and the ideologies that dominate our common layer of thought, supposition, expectation, cosmology, science, so forth.
2061000	2078000	If you're alone, you're going to need machines. If you belong to the families, the time space is the standing wave body for you will never need a machine.
2079000	2082000	And so some people say, well, why are there UFOs and so forth?
2082000	2096000	Yeah, well, you might not need machines. That doesn't mean you'll never forge them. There's a difference, though, between...
2109000	2129000	The difference between intelligences that forge machines and intelligences that are dominated by them is that the latter are quickly snuffed by their own, by the results of their own defection from life.
2130000	2143000	It's not a problem to forge the occasional machine. Having a couple of automobiles isn't a big deal. Having billions of them competing with the anciently preserved ecologies of our world, that's a deadly deal.
2144000	2171000	So there are, you know, throughout time space, biological and parabiological peoples who do forge something, at least vaguely resembling machines, presuming that the things that we have, the things in the possession of our government,
2172000	2185000	are that kind of thing, right, or a machine. And, you know, probably part of the reason why our government has been unable to properly reverse engineer these things is that they're not merely machines.
2186000	2192000	They involve principles that we have no analog for.
2195000	2207000	They are, you know, if they are piloted, they're not piloted mechanically. Most likely they're piloted by consciousness.
2207000	2220000	So now you need, so in order for our government to do anything with these, we need humans who have the capacity to touch objects with consciousness and manipulate them that way.
2220000	2233000	They don't have levers and wheels and things inside them. Many of them are probably single objects, right, have no parts. There's no parts. They might have features, but not parts.
2237000	2250000	So today I was listening to Corbel and Knapp talk about kind of the history and a bit more in depth from outside of Grush's experience, what's been going on with him.
2250000	2255000	And that's been quite fascinating. I learned a lot from that conversation.
2255000	2284000	This is some downstream intelligence, you know, from after the time when our, this government forged some documentation and, you can call this, some legal structure around the topic for fiscal 2024
2284000	2302000	appropriation of military budgets. There's legislature, legislation that, wow, there's some other intelligence right there.
2302000	2329000	There's legislation that orbits the disclosure of these situations and that authorizes Congress and the House to go after factions within this government and within the private commercial sector that have been involved in this situation.
2330000	2341000	It sort of gives them a sort of truth and reconciliation. I'm not talking about the halo video game level. Of course I kind of am.
2341000	2355000	Where, you know, come forward, let us know, we'll relieve you of responsibility. Don't let us know, we'll come for you kind of thing.
2355000	2367000	So that was gutted. My understanding is that the legislation was gutted to some degree. And there are particular people in the government.
2367000	2393000	The gentleman whose donors include Raytheon, Lockheed, Boeing, et cetera, and whose district includes Wright Patterson Air Force Base, which is historically infamous in this fiasco.
2393000	2411000	I can't recall their names at the moment. Not too hard to find them. There's a couple of people that have shut down the public hearings and so forth, a couple of what senators or congressmen, these guys are idiots, they are.
2411000	2427000	There are people with historical records of catastrophic misdeeds. They're shills, they're straight up shills. So that's been going on since last year.
2427000	2443000	There have been some hearings, at least two. One major one where Grush, David Fraver, and another ace fighter pilot, and another pilot what, Ryan Graves maybe?
2443000	2457000	I'm not trying to remember all the names at the moment where these folks all testified about this matter.
2457000	2475000	And to the degree that it would become futurally impossible to make ridiculous claims like there's nothing there, these are not cases, these are just crazy people, which this is what's been going on to hide the phenomena on purpose.
2475000	2490000	They lit up crazy people on purpose and then pointed at them and laughed publicly for the past 50 years to produce a smokescreen about the topic in the public eye.
2490000	2505000	So the first layer is to reveal to the public that we're not alone. We're not the only game in town, in time, in space, even around here. We're not. We never have been.
2505000	2523000	And this is the second layer is that this has long been being hidden primarily because it's, like I said, the holy grail of asymmetric war advantage or asymmetric commercial advantage or asymmetric slavery, enslaving advantage.
2523000	2545000	And at the group level are completely disoriented species captured by thrips, highly motivated in these three areas, enslave, imprison, slaughter, commit on the side, kill everything you can, turn that into products, stack up representations of that value in banks,
2545000	2569000	concentrate the value in 0.02% of the living human population for one lifetime, burn down the future, obliterate the historical past, lie like there's no tomorrow, rape the children, burn the mothers, just like demons, straight up demons.
2570000	2580000	So yeah, these are the motivating forces that are arrayed against us. And people are concerned about which president wins? Well, of course, there is some concern. There's good reasons for that concern.
2580000	2608000	But at this point, at this late point, you know, if this is kind of a ridiculous analogy, but if human civilization, if we metaphorically analogize human civilization as the construction and preservation of the giant double penis with no testicles,
2609000	2627000	that used to dwell in New York, right, between towers, then what's going on right now is that the charges have been detonated inside the structure of the building. The charges have been detonated.
2628000	2640000	The things are falling, you know, the planes have crashed, the charges detonated, the things are falling, and we're arguing about, you know, who gets to stand on the top floor while the thing collapses.
2640000	2654000	It's catastrophic disorientation of our human potential and nature, history and future.
2655000	2672000	Watching the sick leaf sewage rich froth bubbling on the surface of our present moment in human history is terrifying and demoralizing for all of us.
2673000	2680000	We are not our families, our histories, our lineages.
2680000	2693000	And when I say those words, I mean the living places we arose in and for.
2694000	2713000	Our families include the sky, the moon, the sun, the mountain, the forest, the river, the desert, the ocean, the animals, the plants, the insects, all of the water creatures.
2713000	2732000	These are our families. They are being put to the torch in our lifetimes for the sake of disorientations too absurd to imagine, let alone pursue.
2733000	2741000	And yet this is where quote we unquote are now.
2741000	2747000	And it seems that we are incapable.
2747000	2752000	Hi.
2752000	2762000	That seeming is wrong. It's not true. It seems that we are incapable of forming anything that could. We don't need to fight against what's happening. That's one misconception.
2762000	2772000	Any kind of war is going to lead to more war. The planet and we are too delicate at this point for war.
2772000	2785000	So this is one of the other layers, right? The third layer is the lie that there's a government that represents us. It doesn't. Never did.
2785000	2794000	Let me be really clear. We have been alive for X number of years. The government is older than us. It's a structured array of lethal fictions we inherited.
2794000	2806000	Birth. It's bullshit. It's deadly. The fact that you have the better version of cancer than the other people on the planet that will not fucking help you. Ever.
2806000	2814000	If we're to have anything resembling our humanity, we have to forge something worth living in and for together.
2814000	2835000	And this will not be a set of structured agreements. It will be a set of relational prodigies, ways of playing at being human together that are so beautiful, restorative, medicinal, developmentally profound and amazing that no one's willing to be left out.
2835000	2855000	That direction is open. That door is open. Everything in the history and future of life on this world wants the humans to become uncaptured.
2855000	2872000	So there are ways of starting on a small scale, three to five people, that quickly become extremely effective and profound and contagious and don't involve war.
2872000	2891000	That's where hope, that's one of the directions in which hope is alive for this planet.
2891000	2910000	Alright, so, let's see here. By the way, that little vocal move that I made there was, that's my father's voice. It's not mine.
2910000	2925000	It's my dad. My dad's voice. That was one of his vocal idiosyncrasies. I just recognized it playing in me.
2925000	2947000	You know, we think we are individuals. It's insane. What I am is like, imagine a billion threadlines of history and relation from every part of nature in the sky and these billion threadlines have a kind of a bubbling forefront, a wavefront in time space.
2947000	2964000	That's what I am. I'm not Darren. I'm not merely human. That's what we are and if we don't have access to that because of some fiction where I think I'm Darren or Darren's important or any of that kind of thing, it's not that I'm not.
2964000	2990000	It's that letting the aspect of me that thinks that's important drive the car is insane because there's, you know, nine billion forms of intelligence supporting me that if I would just let them synthesize and symphonize together, if I would just let them orchestrate,
2990000	3010000	there's no chance logic can outperform that. There's no chance rationality, conceptual thought, even what we think of as mathematics. There's no chance of those useful artifacts outperforming their origins.
3010000	3037000	If their origins are free to fuse and synergize and see and learn and grow and amnese together, to unforgettable together. You know, there is something weird going on here on earth, which I don't think is universal, which is a kind of a forgetting.
3041000	3061000	Metaphorized in the Greek myth of the river Lethe in which we are dipped between lives so that we forget all that came before. An amnesis is the reversal of that tragedy in us.
3061000	3090000	You know, some portion of the question surrounding the existence of what we think of as UFOs and alien life, probably a good portion of that question has to do with our own origin as a species because let's be really clear.
3092000	3110000	I'm not an expert, but listening to many experts, the chances that we evolved here on earth by mere mechanical accident as reductionist materialism supposes.
3110000	3123000	In my view, the chance of that 0.0000001 or less. And you know, roll the dice. How many times do you have to roll the dice to come up with that?
3123000	3129000	Well, trillions and trillions and trillions of times and finally you get that result.
3134000	3144000	Yeah, there's no chance that we just evolved mechanically. Do humans look like a natural result of evolutionary processes on earth to you? Is that what we look like to you?
3144000	3173000	Because look around. There's precisely one representational cognitive on this planet. One. There's exactly one animal capable of completely defecting from all relationships into mechanisms.
3174000	3201000	Into commodity, into war. Into attacking the reflection of its absence in the mirror of biorelational progeny. That's a weird fucking accident. Something went horribly sideways for that to occur.
3205000	3223000	I have precisely zero suspicion that humans evolved without the direct intervention, influence or engineering of other intelligences.
3224000	3238000	And indeed, you know, our religions directly or indirectly and as insane as many of them are, and I don't mean insane in the good way. I mean insane in the broken way.
3239000	3260000	Most of them, if they don't directly say that this is what has taken place, they imply something similar. That we were intentionally engineered. We were made.
3261000	3280000	And there appear to be a number of stories that's very specifically, at least if we listen to Maniacs, half brilliant Maniacs like Randall Carlson,
3281000	3296000	that specifically detail something that sounds an awful lot like the careful genetic evolution, genetic engineering of our species.
3297000	3309000	In what? Sumerian tablets, which I guess there are many thousands.
3309000	3318000	Now, I'm not using those as evidence. I think you can just look at the situation, right, here on Earth.
3319000	3328000	Look around at the rest of nature and look at us. Do we look like the same thing? Because we don't, to me, I mean, when I see automobiles, I'm seeing something that doesn't belong in nature at all.
3328000	3336000	And, you know, there are people who will say, well, you know, nature is really weird, like anything, you know, it's the encompassing supercontainer.
3336000	3346000	So anything that appears in nature is natural. Yes, from one perspective, that's absolutely true, from a conceptual perspective, nature is the supercontainer for all that is.
3346000	3352000	So it's the same thing saying everything. So you can't, from that perspective, there's nothing that's unnatural.
3352000	3370000	But from the perspective of biorelational intelligence, there's nothing that I can understand about nature that on a living planet would produce
3370000	3378000	omnicidal maniacs like modern homo sapiens, machines.
3378000	3391000	And this is a question I've chased for a long time. Okay, so our, you know, is what, we have this word, the word is artificial.
3391000	3397000	And what we mean by that usually, we can mean different things with it, depending on who's talking and where.
3397000	3400000	Words don't have meanings, we use them to mean things to each other.
3400000	3407000	But what is generally meant is human engineered.
3407000	3424000	And this word we use to divide, to distinguish between what a world without humans would naturally produce
3425000	3434000	and what humans, as we know ourselves, produce. Artificial.
3434000	3449000	So it looks to me like our species is a strange example of defection from nature that I want to highlight and emphasize and pay very careful attention to.
3449000	3458000	Because the history and future of life on earth may very well depend on making this specific distinction.
3458000	3476000	Our ability to make this distinction intelligently with awareness, understanding, insight, recognition of the face of origin, face of living beings.
3476000	3483000	And the difference between that face and the face of our species at the group level.
3483000	3497000	Because that's a staggering difference. It's the difference between sunrise and the detonation of a nuclear weapon.
3497000	3504000	If you can't see that difference, my God, what can you see? You are blind.
3504000	3514000	You are blind in a way that will just generate further blindnesses in order to justify the blindnesses that have gone, you know, unopposed thus far.
3527000	3535000	That sound is the opposite of omnicidal fury.
3539000	3555000	That's the sound, not of speech, but of anciently originating and conserved intelligence, transcendence, origin.
3557000	3562000	So beautiful. So true.
3570000	3578000	Absolutely authentic. That's a signal whose content you can absolutely trust.
3578000	3583000	And whose content may be so profound.
3583000	3588000	Who knows what's in there, right? Who knows what's in that signal?
3588000	3602000	That's a signal towards transcendence. That's a signal towards the resurrection of the possibilities of intelligence.
3602000	3612000	There's no defection. There's no deception. There's no agenda.
3616000	3622000	Ma'am, I think you dropped one of your bags back there. Certainly.
3623000	3647000	You see, when I began to speak with the older woman, in the beginning of my speech, she had to go through a series of phases, communication phases, where she evaluated signal for a variety of features, right?
3647000	3656000	Is the signal deceptive? Is the signal predatory? Is the signal opportunistic?
3656000	3665000	And as I was speaking, she was doing these evaluations. I could see her doing them. She did not meet my eyes.
3665000	3680000	This is what is known as signal intelligence. And it's fundamental to having minds that have boundaries, right?
3680000	3684000	It's fundamental to us and themism.
3684000	3698000	So she had to go through a cascade of evaluations. And after the first ones I mentioned, then came things like, is the signal useful? Is it intelligent?
3699000	3715000	Is it operationally coherent? Does it matter? Is it important? Is it significant, right? Significant. All these things.
3715000	3723000	Now, this is what's going on every time we speak or encounter information. We're doing the same cascade.
3723000	3737000	The problem is that the orienting gatekeeping intelligences or features, what I would call sentinels in consciousness, can be captured. They can be overwhelmed.
3737000	3746000	And social media is made of the tactics that overwhelm these sentinels. So is commercial media.
3746000	3767000	Even private media has to compete, right? So people like Banksy employ coding strategies that produce the desire to replicate the signal.
3776000	3796000	NAP in the interview with Rogan.
3796000	3821000	Actually, I'm going to go back to Grush. Grush was talking about his specialization in forms of intelligence and technological weaponized technology that fall under the ages of cyber war.
3821000	3843000	And what he was saying was that part of the current landscape or the landscape when this was current for him was something we could call attribution obfuscation, right?
3844000	3857000	So an event occurs, let's say you obliterate the power grid of a nation, right?
3857000	3874000	That's a tactically effective, that's a tactically asymmetric effective military advantage.
3875000	3892000	But another part of the, if your goal is to fuck people up or kill them or obliterate the coherence of their structured relationships, then there's other layers, right?
3892000	3904000	Like you can obfuscate who did it or you can plant evidence that makes it look like it came from so-and-so when actually it came from thus and such.
3904000	3915000	And you can also, there's all kinds of sort of signal intelligence aspects of war.
3915000	3935000	And I mean you can, one can easily cause an enemy to obliterate themselves for you with the right kinds of obfuscation technology and attribution error.
3936000	3948000	I'm not going to detail a variety of scenarios to you, but imagine that the United States, you know, thinks that Russia has launched nukes at it.
3948000	3952000	In fact, there are no nukes flying.
3952000	3960000	The U.S. responds as though nukes are flying and ends up gone.
3960000	3975000	I mean that's a really crudely modeled toy of a situation where you take down large portions of the United States.
3975000	3977000	Yeah, let's look at a better one.
3977000	3989000	Say you can take down immediately large portions of the United States energy grid and then attribute it to a foreign actor
3989000	3993000	that had no involvement, you can take out both enemies at the same time, right?
3993000	3997000	The United States will take out, try to take out their perceived enemy.
3997000	4007000	Meanwhile, that perceived enemy had no knowledge or functional relationship to the event and so forth.
4007000	4015000	These are sigint, the weaponization of sigint and identity and conflict, right?
4015000	4018000	Weaponizing identity and conflict.
4021000	4025000	So, we've come a long way here.
4025000	4035000	I think what Gresh was talking about in his concerns about cyber war was that the United States is developing technologies that are uncontrollably powerful,
4036000	4043000	particularly with the advent of what we're referring to as artificial intelligence.
4043000	4053000	And so are other nations and that's going to lead to a race to the bottom of weaponized computational technologies.
4054000	4066000	Rogan seems to think we are a meat caterpillar engineered to produce a mechanical butterfly.
4069000	4082000	I got to say like Rogan's cosmological speculations are among the least interesting things I've ever had them as fortunate of listening to.
4083000	4090000	Even if they are relatively sophisticated just because of his position, right?
4090000	4094000	His position is integrative, right?
4094000	4106000	He's standing over a vast array of intelligent and amazing and insightful human beings.
4106000	4109000	He's the lynchpin that links all those together.
4109000	4112000	So that's a highly privileged position.
4112000	4119000	And actually an intelligent person would go for a position like that very intentionally,
4120000	4132000	not entirely dissimilar to Alan Steinfeld's position in the UFO paranormal, non-ordinary, near-death, shamanism, so forth, communities.
4133000	4141000	That's the sign of a very advanced intelligence to get into the between of all those minds.
4144000	4150000	So before I'm about to come to a place where there's a lot more noise, unfortunately,
4150000	4158000	but I'm going to talk briefly about the ideas that were in my mind when I first began this recording.
4162000	4170000	So many of you have heard the term synchronicity and it's hard to know exactly what this means.
4170000	4178000	Once again, we use terms to mean things to each other rather than them just having a meaning as we might otherwise suppose.
4178000	4182000	Outside of a meaningful conversation, terms don't have much of a meaning.
4182000	4186000	They just have denotations, right?
4187000	4208000	But synchronicity is commonly taken to mean something resembling a meaningful or benevolent or dangerous array, a cascade of what we would think of as coincidences.
4209000	4232000	The other afternoon, I was in my basement and I was thinking about a text I had sent three days ago to a friend in which it was clear we had the tempo of the communication had been broken.
4233000	4242000	So we were texting back and forth every few minutes and then I texted him and nothing came back.
4242000	4251000	So two or three days later, I was in my basement and I was taking out the garbage and I thought for a moment I brought to mind the sequence of that conversation.
4251000	4255000	When I went back up the stairs and looked at my phone, he had responded.
4256000	4259000	And that's not a mere coincidence.
4259000	4275000	That's what I would call an incident of communicative telepathy, which I've had enough experiences of to know what that feels like, what it looks like, and the difference between that.
4276000	4283000	One of my frenemies likes to say, yeah, you just think it's telepathy because you're not counting the times it failed.
4283000	4286000	Well, here's the number of times it failed, never.
4286000	4297000	Because the thing that he's calling a failure doesn't look the same or feel the same as the thing that actually succeeds.
4297000	4305000	But yeah, imagine that you're driving through a city and every time you come to light it's green for like half an hour.
4305000	4308000	There's an example.
4308000	4315000	Now it's possible that you just happen to be in the right place at the right time, but not over 50 stop lights.
4315000	4317000	Not likely.
4318000	4326000	So synchronicity usually is used to mean a sequence of non-ordinary coincidences.
4326000	4352000	And often there is something like this that happens around the event horizon of a non-ordinary, the emergence of non-ordinary awareness, intelligence.
4357000	4362000	Or experience in a human or a small group of them.
4362000	4364000	Sometimes a large group.
4364000	4367000	Mostly a small group though.
4372000	4377000	And there's a related phenomenon that we don't usually talk about.
4377000	4403000	Someone said, for example, to me this morning that my posts on Facebook had often, they felt, had often had a peculiar resonance with what was going on in their life at the, you know, around the time that they found that they encountered these posts.
4408000	4413000	And this brought to mind something I discovered fairly recently.
4413000	4415000	I was probably aware of the principle before.
4415000	4418000	I didn't have any reasonable way to talk about it.
4418000	4420000	So here's how it works.
4420000	4446000	If you set up, and this is what can breed madness, mania, paranoia, megalomania, grandiosity, schizogenic, perfusion of conceptual linkages of symbols in experience, but it can also read insight.
4447000	4452000	The others are more common, but insight is possible.
4452000	4472000	So what it is, is if you set up in consciousness a set of symbols or persons or situations that you're constantly paying attention to in such a way that it feels like, or may indeed be true,
4473000	4490000	that your future, or your well-being, or the well-being of your family or loved ones, depends upon changes, having a clear understanding of changes in these person situations and so forth.
4490000	4502000	We all do this. We set up these sort of monuments in consciousness that our lives and minds orbit.
4502000	4515000	When we do that, we're setting the character of the frame.
4533000	4540000	Sometimes we can allow the character of the frame to be set for us by external symbols, for example.
4540000	4546000	I just walked past a book kiosk in my neighborhood.
4546000	4554000	Now suppose that I took the titles of those books as precognitively predictive of what I should pay attention to in consciousness.
4555000	4563000	So I'm going to replace whatever framing I might have previously had with the titles of those books, and then I'm going to proceed through the rest of my day.
4563000	4572000	Perhaps I could go back and read those titles right now, just to give you an example.
4573000	4577000	I think I don't need to. I can do something simpler.
4577000	4593000	I'm going to take the sequence of letters and symbols on this license plate, 8ZHY640, and the one that follows it, 8RXZ199.
4593000	4597000	Now if I keep reading the license plates, what's going to happen?
4597000	4601000	I'm going to notice correspondences.
4601000	4616000	And even if I don't replace the ones I have, like I have some, right?
4616000	4618000	Is my heart doing okay?
4618000	4619000	How's my house?
4619000	4621000	About my roommate.
4621000	4634000	Otherwise known as Let's Talk UFOs on Reddit, who I love.
4634000	4637000	My bank accounts.
4637000	4642000	The people with whom I'm in fairly regular contact.
4642000	4649000	The one or two people who either depend on me or I depend on...
4649000	4653000	Those beings are all significant.
4653000	4658000	We call them anchors in my consciousness, right?
4658000	4666000	So if you replace those anchors with something, or you add a new anchor and it becomes very interesting to you,
4666000	4672000	perhaps a love interest, or someone you're afraid of, right?
4672000	4675000	Someone you feel is...
4675000	4687000	Somebody who someone has a reason to feel is conspiring to harm them.
4687000	4696000	Perhaps physically, relationally, vocationally, or especially magically.
4696000	4703000	You can see that what tends to happen is if you set up the frame,
4703000	4710000	then reality warps in consciousness toward the things you've set up as anchors, right?
4710000	4715000	So this produces the semblance of synchronicity.
4715000	4718000	And it's not actually that there isn't any.
4718000	4723000	It's just that it's not necessarily particularly non-ordinary.
4723000	4730000	Consciousness orients itself with anchors.
4730000	4736000	This is well known in NLP, right? Neurolinguistic programming.
4736000	4739000	Hypnosis circles. Magicians know this.
4739000	4750000	Illusionists know it. Darren Brown is a brilliant provocateur who utilizes this to astonish ordinary humans
4750000	4755000	and to manipulate them.
4755000	4760000	It must be a very lonely and perhaps grandiose life,
4760000	4765000	although I don't know what Darren Brown's life is like.
4765000	4767000	It's very difficult for me to imagine.
4767000	4774000	I do know, or at least I have heard, that the castle that he owns
4774000	4781000	has many instances of...
4781000	4784000	What's that stuff called?
4784000	4789000	What is that stuff called?
4789000	4798000	Not stuffed animals, but preserved, carefully embalmed creatures.
4798000	4807000	Yeah, the word almost came to me.
4807000	4811000	A book has just arrived. Do I take this as significant?
4811000	4816000	It's Paul L. Ward's Selected Writings,
4816000	4823000	which I found the book cover for in my room but could not locate the volume for.
4823000	4832000	Yeah, I can't. My hippocampus is failing to find the word.
4832000	4835000	It's on the edge of my tongue. I'm sure it'll come to me.
4835000	4851000	So, we create the anchors that our sentinels, our watchers, pay attention to,
4851000	4857000	and then we interpret reality according to transformations in the field
4857000	4862000	in between the anchors.
4862000	4867000	So, this is likely to look metaphysically significant.
4867000	4872000	If somebody's, for example, if someone is paying inordinate attention to my posts
4872000	4877000	and the time and the day on which they occur,
4877000	4881000	it's very likely that there will be two effects.
4881000	4888000	One, an interpretive effect where they will feel that I'm precognitive
4888000	4892000	or in some way influencing their situation.
4892000	4898000	And the second one, more like the latter, that I may be predictively aware
4898000	4906000	or actively, magically, so to speak, transforming their situation.
4906000	4913000	And this is what I want to highlight is frame collapse.
4913000	4917000	So, we should be aware both, we should be aware, okay.
4917000	4919000	This is a power for those of us who understand it.
4919000	4921000	It's not a power to manipulate other human beings.
4921000	4923000	That's a malignant use of power.
4923000	4927000	It's a power to transform situations if we understand it clearly.
4927000	4931000	It's a power to transform our own minds, our futures, our destinies,
4931000	4934000	our memories, our dreaming, our relationships.
4934000	4939000	It's this kind of a power.
4939000	4942000	So, we should, but it's also a danger, right?
4942000	4947000	It's a danger in that we may think we're having metaphysical insight
4947000	4951000	or experience when actually what is happening is our consciousness
4951000	4960000	is responding to the peculiar way we have set up.
4960000	4962000	That's interesting.
4962000	4964000	That's familiar to me.
4964000	4966000	I wonder if this book is around.
4966000	4981000	The peculiar way we have set up the anchors in concern, right?
4981000	4988000	In interest and in awareness.
4988000	4990000	Yeah, that's okay.
4990000	4996000	It's a little bit old, but it's all right with me.
4996000	5001000	I have my Paul L. Ward book that I have long had the cover to
5001000	5005000	but can't find the book for.
5005000	5008000	By the way, I love me some Paul L. Ward.
5008000	5013000	Of course, in translation, I guess.
5013000	5015000	All right, so pay attention to the possibilities,
5015000	5018000	not nearly a frame collapse, but a frame establishment.
5018000	5020000	If we can select really good anchors,
5020000	5023000	we're going to get a completely different mode of awareness,
5023000	5028000	possibilities of learning intelligence, sensitivity,
5028000	5031000	possibilities of fulfilling the purposes for which we established
5031000	5033000	sentinels in the first place,
5033000	5035000	especially if we do this together, right?
5035000	5038000	Because these potentials are radically magnified
5038000	5045000	in even small groups of highly motivated,
5045000	5048000	highly relationally motivated individual,
5048000	5052000	quote, individual humans.
5052000	5056000	And then I'm just going to touch on the second topic,
5056000	5059000	the multiple world topic before I wrap up for today.
5059000	5063000	So yes, of course, there's this multiple world theory
5063000	5065000	in physics, whatever, who cares.
5065000	5067000	I doubt it.
5067000	5069000	I very, very much doubt it.
5069000	5075000	I think that theory will either be overturned
5075000	5078000	or be shown to have been extremely partial.
5078000	5081000	In other words, what you get are tiny, little,
5081000	5086000	para-candidate universes, most of which never persist
5086000	5089000	or only partially emerge.
5089000	5092000	But I think the theory is a misunderstanding
5092000	5097000	of something fundamental about nature and time-space.
5097000	5102000	I strongly suspect that anyway.
5102000	5105000	So yeah, what I want to talk about is different.
5105000	5113000	What I want to talk about is that there are billions of worlds right here.
5113000	5120000	We think the world matches up with our usually extremely limited
5120000	5124000	experience and awareness of it.
5124000	5127000	We think we know what the world is, what humans are,
5127000	5129000	what's being done, what isn't being done,
5129000	5131000	who's doing it, who isn't doing it,
5131000	5134000	what's possible what isn't, what's historically accurate what isn't,
5134000	5137000	what's futurially accessible what isn't.
5137000	5142000	All these things we think we know them based on the incredibly narrow
5142000	5146000	little slice of reality that we get exposed to, most of us,
5146000	5151000	and some of us have realized through experiment and so forth
5151000	5154000	that, wow, if we step outside that slice,
5154000	5159000	things get really astonishingly diverse and interesting.
5159000	5163000	So for example, I have never traveled.
5163000	5169000	My little slice of reality is super tiny as far as my human stuff goes.
5169000	5173000	Nature, a bit different than most humans.
5173000	5176000	Time-space, different from most humans,
5176000	5182000	because I've had contact with non-human intelligences.
5182000	5185000	And very, very few humans who claim that have had anything resembling
5185000	5188000	coherent contact with NHI.
5188000	5193000	But my little slice of life, if I were to determine what the world is,
5193000	5198000	based on what media reaches me and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
5198000	5203000	I'd be thinking about the world from the perspective of less than,
5203000	5206000	I don't know, a millionth of a percent of it.
5206000	5212000	So what I want to make clear is that what's actually going on,
5212000	5216000	the world is billions of worlds.
5216000	5222000	There are worlds of human life so far beyond anything you've ever imagined
5222000	5227000	that they might as well be other universes and they're all around us.
5228000	5232000	Ordinarily what limits us to some degree,
5232000	5242000	the two primary limiting factors in our world are proximity and wealth.
5242000	5244000	Wealth doesn't totally liberate you.
5244000	5248000	In fact, it can trap you in many ways if you start out with it especially.
5249000	5258000	But a close friend has lived a life of not entire impoverishment,
5258000	5260000	but relative poverty.
5260000	5267000	And he lives in a place where it seems like his prospects are very limited.
5267000	5271000	Recent events have demonstrated to him that they might be far less limited
5271000	5275000	than he'd ever imagined and that there might even be a couple of avenues
5275000	5282000	to what could qualify as spaceflight for him in terms of his lived experience
5282000	5284000	of being human on Earth.
5284000	5288000	So what I'm trying to get at is like there are groups of people
5288000	5293000	and people who are so profoundly advanced and fascinating and alive,
5293000	5296000	intelligent and confusing, brilliant and so forth,
5296000	5300000	that are nothing like what we think the world is like.
5300000	5302000	This is a world of a billion worlds.
5302000	5306000	People who travel eventually get some kind of a taste of this.
5306000	5307000	I have never done that.
5307000	5310000	I know from having been above,
5310000	5317000	I know from having what the overview effect that space travelers have experienced,
5317000	5321000	which happened to William Shatner and many of the astronauts, right?
5321000	5326000	They see, oh my God, this is a tiny little droplet of water and a vast immensity.
5326000	5329000	Unimaginable.
5330000	5336000	So what I want you to understand is do not ever think that your capacities are limited
5336000	5340000	to what you've experienced thus far.
5340000	5345000	If you can achieve, find a way to achieve meaningful coherent escape velocity
5345000	5349000	from the tiny little slice of life that you've become habituated to
5349000	5355000	and that is familiar to you and may feel safe even if it's miserable,
5355000	5361000	outside that there is a billion universes right here on this planet.
5361000	5364000	The continents are different worlds.
5364000	5366000	Think about history, right?
5366000	5372000	Think about what was going on in what we call Peru when Egypt was thriving.
5372000	5374000	What was going on in China when Egypt was thriving?
5374000	5379000	What was going on in Antarctica before it was frozen?
5380000	5387000	There are many worlds right here and there are billions of unique human worlds.
5387000	5393000	Indeed, every little shop or home that you enter is like a womb or a universe.
5393000	5398000	It's unique, it's profound, it's a completely different way of life.
5398000	5404000	So I may pursue this topic further in upcoming recordings.
5404000	5418000	I'm only giving it a provisional sort of tale and glance before I wrap up here for today.
5418000	5421000	But as always, I'm so grateful to have this time with you.
5421000	5424000	So thankful for those of you who pay attention to my recordings
5424000	5429000	and particularly those of you who support them, like them, share them,
5429000	5432000	ask questions, leave comments and so forth since that's...
5432000	5439000	If you're getting some value here, remember that I don't allow advertising,
5439000	5442000	which would be really ironic if I did, so I can't.
5442000	5443000	There's no way.
5443000	5446000	So it's your support that I depend on.
5446000	5449000	I'm just so grateful to have this time together.
5449000	5456000	I'm really looking forward to our next adventures in awareness,
5456000	5463000	and amnesis, and mutual wonder.
5463000	5465000	Thank you for joining me.
5465000	5470000	I look forward to learning together again very soon.
5470000	5477000	May your ways be blessed and beautiful, and may your dreams be profound and rich
5477000	5481000	as your relationships live for now.
