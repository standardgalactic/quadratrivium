0	7920	hello everybody if I had realized that I might be motivated to make a
7920	14400	recording while I was out walking today I would have brought something to screen
14400	24200	the wind and usually a cotton ball or even some facial tissue wrapped around
24520	31120	the mic with a rubber band something like this it's enough it works it works
31120	37560	fine for my recording setup
40480	47840	yeah I'm not going to talk about that all right so what is on my mind first of
47840	59800	all I am where am I I am at a lake it is very windy and no shame for any of you
59800	66080	who decide this is too much wind noise for you but those of you who are bold
66080	73280	can accompany me in this strange adventure where I am risking my life
73280	82720	primarily from widowmaker tree falls to get a little exercise on Sunday in the
82720	92360	midst of some really interestingly stormy weather lots of wind gusts
92360	107000	occasional bouts of serious rain but not the long slow calm kind of rain that is
107000	115760	often well less threatening when the minute when the wind picks up the
115760	127000	primary threat seems to be trees falling and where I live there's a lot of sand
127000	135800	actually that's ridiculous let me be more clear as I understand it most of
135800	150160	Golden Gate Park is a giant sand dune with some complex aquifers underneath it
150160	160240	so I guess long ago the humans imported a bunch of topsoil so to speak and spread
160240	173480	it all around and one of my friends well actually no longer my friend what ex
173480	182000	communicated me for let's see I had a tiny bit of a sniffle and I was outside in
182000	191560	the gardens without a mask on or no I had a mask on actually but as I wasn't
192600	203960	severely quarantining I guess my friend decided I was a bad man turned out that
203960	214400	it was less than tiny allergies that I was experiencing not even a cold and I
214400	222640	certainly wasn't getting in anyone's face so yes she once remarked you know
222640	229120	there's so many non-native trees here and they just don't form deep roots and I
229240	245480	thought I mean especially now it's very obvious to me that she having the status that we would
245480	253800	associate with a person of color particularly whose ancestry comes from India might have
253800	264680	been making a psychological right right a displacement or a projection in metaphor
264680	271720	without knowing it because what I saw we see a lot of trees fall here in fact I'm
271720	278600	looking at five or six that fell recently right now yeah there's a bunch of them wow
279200	290680	I mean it's you know it's literally dangerous to be out in weather this windy the secondary
290680	301560	danger for pedestrians is stuff going in your eye or being impaled on your umbrella but anyway
301560	316040	back to the tree things so my friend who excommunicated me is a docent at the botanical
316040	325640	gardens I think still and I would be surprised if she did not understand that you're talking
325640	332920	about a maximum of two or three feet in most places of topsoil sometimes less and then just
332920	347880	saying right so when trees fall over I don't think it's because they're non-native right they fall
347960	358040	over they don't form complex root systems not because they're not native but because it's pretty
358040	373720	hard to do in sand right so yeah part of the it's funny part of the the trail here has been
373960	377000	cordoned off
381320	388760	yeah I guess there's also being hit in the head by things that fall that aren't branches for
388760	394360	example pine cones and stuff or little pieces of branches that could wipe you out as a human
395960	401160	it doesn't take a lot of weight coming from the sky you know 20 30 feet above your head
401560	412600	to hurt you or even kill you especially if you're not wearing a hard hat so yeah lots of risk
412600	424520	what's the f side well a couple of things one who as one gets older you start to have to pick
425480	430680	more or less explicitly between something resembling
432840	437960	more adventure or something resembling more safety and the more safety line
439800	447160	is devastating in a bunch of ways because although you could handle maybe you could handle
447880	454680	box life um without too much trouble a while ago when you start getting older
456040	463080	the comfort of box life begins to become rattle into the comfort of the grave so to speak
464200	466760	metaphorically and so
467640	468140	so
471240	479320	one necessarily chooses and it's a choice that you make each day now it's similar with
480520	485960	our minds do we adventure or do we stay in familiar terrain
486200	495320	um and why and what what turns out to happen is it's a bit like exercise
496760	500920	if you don't if you don't keep it up
505320	511640	it tends to oh wow there's a little yeah see I just saw a branch fall that
512600	516680	could have definitely hurt someone thankfully it was um
518920	526680	slowish oh wow I just heard another one yeah it's like I'm out here and it's it's like I'm
526680	532200	hearing gunshots right except they're not gunshots they're tree breaks
534840	541320	so it's probably good that trail was cordoned off because I might have been stupid enough to go
541400	553000	up there and I can tell from here basically it's a bunch of cypress trees and these things naturally
553000	564680	produce um I think it's mostly cypress and they naturally produce these long slender branches
564680	573800	that are prone especially when water soaked to just snap off right it might be some kind of
574520	580600	you know evolutionary benefit or something maybe maybe those branches both fertilize the ground as
580600	589720	they as they fall apart or um bring other organisms or root possibly or maybe there's no
590680	598520	you know obvious benefit if we're doing what we might imagine is Darwinian accounting
604760	612840	which brings me to a variety of topics I've long held to switch to the topic of house cats
613480	620840	that house cats are basically they can be understood from a variety of interesting perspectives
620840	629080	including that they are effectively ambient psychedelic organisms meaning that if you begin
629080	638840	to bond your mind with the mind of a provocatively intelligent house cat rather than a really lazy
638840	644520	one but even the lazy ones or it's like they're smoking opium or something all the time um
645400	655560	or rather they don't need to smoke anything uh the Cheshire cat in Alice in Wonderland is sort of an
655560	670280	example of someone who has noticed the strangeness of the cats but I have long held that um
672680	682040	in terms of intelligence and non-human intelligence and alien like not alien is in bad alien is in
686200	695240	family member from another origin right more like that um yeah the house cats those are
696680	700040	like the square root of an octopus is a house cat you know
702680	711000	and maybe if you you know house cat to the second or third power equals praying mantis or
711080	719720	something like this and you know you can flip it around um the the the intelligence of the
719720	730040	ambush predators is very unique and profound um and the intelligence of a house cat which is a
730040	738120	really peculiar an animal with a very peculiar history um developmental history very peculiar
738600	748680	and trippy because it goes from being a wild alpha predator to being a half domesticated
748680	758200	beta like you know delta predator or something that effectively causes its primary symbiont
758280	772520	right um captures a food source in humans trippy right very strange very unexpected um from some
772520	787800	perspectives now of course the natural contrast to a house cat is the dog um similar similar
787800	801560	developmental history uh and look um cats aren't not pack animals they just uh you
801560	815800	know lions at least um have what we call prides in english groups and are there other
815800	826200	examples i don't know there are probably examples of couplings and friendships but not
827400	832840	primary necessary groups i just don't know enough about the feeling animals to know
835640	842760	but there's at least one example of uh where they form you know cohorts and pods
843720	853720	and i imagine young lions and perhaps mountain lions and so forth may certainly when they're young
853720	860280	right they um travel and hunt and play with their siblings who knows if there's inter
861960	871720	interfamily activity of that kind i was talking to my friend uh jay the other night
873400	880520	actually was last night and we were talking about this this topic and i love to wax uh
880520	887880	enthusiastic about the intelligences of the ambush predators because they are in a sense
888040	905560	like if you want security and um familiarity dogs work beautifully right those are the solar
906280	912440	animal essentially of the pair and look there are solar cats and there are lunar dogs but
912440	925080	fundamentally um the dog is the solar animal uh daytime predator right um although not entirely
925080	933160	you got coyotes and wolves that are nocturnal um maybe i had that wrong actually uh nighttime
933160	940680	predator nocturnal and similarly cats also nocturnal but perhaps more so than dogs
941640	947400	um tend to sleep all day stay up all night left to their own devices probably
949480	953160	i don't know what they would do in their natural situations because i don't see those
953160	957320	animals in those situations but i do think of dogs as solar
959880	963160	not explicitly and not only and cats as
963160	969640	though now there's going to be some serious wind
971960	979240	so we were talking about this the other night and okay what was the topic all right the topic
979240	982520	was actually pretty deep it was
983320	996280	a topic that i've spoken of some recently but even since then the insight has been enriched
997560	1004200	it's the topic of what happens when something captures the nervous system of an animal
1005560	1008440	and there's lots of stuff that capture our nervous system
1009400	1018920	um a simple example of this is that you know it's the pavlovian thing right if we smell
1018920	1024680	something delicious in fact i'm just i'm merely thinking of something delicious and my mouth is
1024680	1034040	starting to water but if i smell something delicious much more so so that's an example where
1034600	1046600	where you can see that i have no control i have no mental control over
1046760	1049160	so
1056840	1061160	gale force winds just short of hurricane speed
1063880	1067320	i have no control over whether my mouth waters or not that i know of
1067400	1074760	of might be able to influence it with nlp or hypnosis or something but i have no
1077720	1086280	my salvation and similarly if i hear one of those gunshot branch cracks and it's loud
1086280	1088440	enough and near enough probably y'all jump
1093480	1099000	when you see corvids at least around here
1105240	1106760	approaching food on the ground
1107480	1116520	they will often sort of hop toward it and leap backwards
1119080	1123880	i was thinking a lot about that particular behavior the other day after observing it because
1125000	1126360	trying to understand
1129880	1133640	one thing i can imagine now which it didn't occur to me before
1134360	1144680	i mean it's not crazy it's natural it's just different from the very safe norm
1145400	1150920	that usually applies and the difference is profound enough that i am well aware i could
1150920	1157640	be killed it's not very likely but it's probably 50 times more likely than it was yesterday
1158040	1161160	all right so
1167160	1171240	the thing that occurs to me now and i couldn't figure it out before but now it seems relatively
1171240	1178760	obvious snakes eat birds and one of the best ways to catch bird
1179480	1186360	would be to hang out near the corpse of an animal right
1188920	1195640	you're an ambush predator you have that that feline intelligence that praying mantis intelligence
1195640	1202200	that octopus intelligence the jumping spider intelligence right you have this
1202520	1211480	trap setting capable capable of setting a trap intelligence praying mantis is straight
1211480	1220200	upset traps on flowers right just no doubt about it you see them do it all the time
1221400	1223240	so i wouldn't ambush predators
1228360	1230120	and since corvids eat meat
1232920	1237800	they eat other stuff too they eat seeds and bugs and worms and stuff it depends on the birds and where they are
1243400	1244360	since they eat meat
1250360	1256520	what might happen is a snake might or other ambush predator possibly not sure what a bobcat maybe
1257240	1264920	what else would eat birds i don't think i mean coyotes eat birds but they also eat dead things
1266680	1272600	snakes don't usually i don't know of any snakes that eat corpses
1275080	1283800	now you can teach cage snakes to eat dead mice i don't know if they eat dead mice in the wild
1283800	1290440	not clear to me it seems pragmatically effective that they should i just don't know
1293080	1303000	but yeah i can imagine snake hangs out near bird food of any kind right dead things seed piles you
1303000	1313320	name it and just waits for birds and waits close enough that when the bird gets to the food item
1314680	1320920	it's within striking distance of the snake so that would explain
1322360	1330120	evolutionarily how the peck jumped back like it's literally like that that
1332840	1339080	that song that has the lyrics jump back jack in it the bird like goes forward and then leaves
1339160	1345240	backward it may do that a few times and after like two or three times it'll it may just fly
1345240	1351160	off and leave the food alone that does happen i've seen it but what's going on there isn't that the
1351160	1358600	bird is thinking i'm scared i think what's going on is that the bird's nervous system has been
1358600	1368280	captured by something like an evolutionarily developed and look the thing may not be genetic
1368280	1376760	there's got to be nine other ways of influencing organisms that aren't merely genes and most of
1376760	1380760	those ways might we would argue would would necessarily have some effect on genomes because
1380760	1389000	they they become selection variables in that theory and we're going to get some weird stuff
1389000	1394520	about that in a minute um so they might have they might have selective
1396680	1398920	functions so to speak or effect
1401560	1406920	but yeah what i think is going on is that the organism's nervous system has been captured
1407800	1414280	and like a goose that sees a ball rolled a few feet from its nest during a certain season
1414680	1420280	and it will go the goose will crane its neck at least this is what i've heard
1421160	1426520	crane its neck from research crane its neck go toward the ball and roll the ball back into
1426520	1432200	the nest whether or not there's a ball there anymore at all and you know whether or not it
1432200	1436360	much resembles an egg so you can see that
1440360	1448760	there are these protocols you know in the age of computers we would be likely to call them programs
1449400	1453560	because we're just reaching around for some metaphor but it's a
1453800	1460600	historically physically structured vulnerability to capture
1462840	1467800	when an organism detects high heat suddenly it recoils
1470920	1477160	it may recoil from other things water food that may not be safe or smells wrong
1477880	1484920	um you know one kid on the bus uh disgorges his breakfast on the floor
1485640	1492600	now you pretty soon have what a oh this could be good just siren
1494280	1497960	we might get a demonstration of this effect let's see
1497960	1508040	uh yeah pretty soon you've got you know
1511720	1520520	sudden unexpected public vomitorium on the bus right because once two more kids
1520520	1526520	follow suit and they're certainly not doing that on purpose right they're not trying to do that
1526600	1529080	they don't want to do that they can't help it
1532520	1537560	so uh
1541560	1544920	we didn't get the example i wanted so um
1548200	1552440	you can see that there's a structured response
1552680	1560920	um that's probably ordinarily rather than being activated
1563560	1565960	we can think of it both ways and we probably should
1567400	1573560	rather than being activated by stimuli it could also just be ordinarily inhibited
1574440	1580920	and under some circumstances that inhibition collapses and the coyote howls
1581880	1587240	in concert with the approach of a siren not because it wants to
1588120	1594280	not because i mean possibly it's in pain it is possible we don't know and it's reasonable to
1594280	1608520	imagine it might be um when you present uh wildly exaggerated stimuli to an extremely sensitive
1609320	1613320	organisms
1618600	1627960	to a hypersensitive organism right if a wasp can detect one molecule of a substance within
1627960	1634040	a two-mile range within a two-mile circle as i understand it some wasps are capable of that
1634040	1640760	degree of sensitivity if you subject them to for example
1643240	1648600	some kind of human perfume laundry soap for example laundry soap stench
1650840	1657880	could be physically painful to them so we don't know whether the siren is physically painful
1658760	1661720	but we do know that it resembles other coyotes calling
1662680	1672520	and so when the dogs howl in the coyotes um howl at the siren there's a good chance that
1672520	1679000	they're just being triggered right their body is howling not their mind and
1681640	1689560	um you know we hear people talk about sensory experiences like the hair stood up on the back
1689640	1696760	of my neck um i got goosebumps and obviously goosebumps are a thing that happens when we're
1696760	1706920	cold too but uh there are certain physiological transformations uh heart palpitates right we
1706920	1713160	like i don't know if we like it i think we like it because we're our most of our experience is
1713160	1723480	kind of deadened but we like horror movies sometimes or we may like um scary rides because they
1726280	1733080	deprive us of the control we might ordinarily have over our body's sensations
1734840	1739800	or the selection of sensations right actively selecting sensations
1740520	1750040	um and subject us to extraordinary forces and sensations
1755160	1756440	so we too can be triggered
1758440	1764680	um it would be interesting to see the library of programs so to speak they're not actually
1764680	1771560	programs i don't think but to see like the library of a single creature now obviously if you
1771560	1776760	observe a single creature very closely over time and you observe many of them many of their kind
1776760	1789000	quote unquote you will begin to understand something of the library uh so praying mantises for example
1789000	1801640	will they have a complex striking uh behavior it's a pray capture behavior but they can use
1801640	1809720	it like a punch as well and they have a complex uh threat display where their body transforms
1810440	1821240	you know into a creature oriented to both fight and shock uh a possibly predatory animal creature
1829320	1835320	so we were talking about the peculiarities obviously right like social media is weaponizing
1835400	1847160	this against us it one could say it is studying in a sense human activity and then producing
1847960	1858280	hopeful monsters that capture it amplify it um and make it contagious that's one of the dumbest
1858280	1865240	uses of technology that anyone could imagine i mean it's almost as dumb as just throwing bricks
1865240	1873320	at people's heads the problem here is that they can't see the brick right it has the same effect
1873960	1879320	in that they get dumber every time they're subjected to it most of them some of them
1879320	1885560	have a good buffer some of the humans um but yeah they get dumber every time like
1886280	1889880	every iteration makes them dumber and
1895480	1903880	the problem there is really dangerous because anything that reduces your awareness or sensitivity
1904280	1915720	over time is prone to create a situation where you can't you won't be able to perceive what you've
1915720	1923720	lost and this is part of the problem with ordinary human aging one might argue that social media
1923720	1931560	ages certain aspects of us um precipitously and invisibly
1933960	1940440	since our bodies don't age in response though i think actually internally they do we don't notice
1941720	1946760	anything that affects the thing you notice with right creates a really good
1947720	1959400	a really effective process that hides its own it hides its own progress and it hides the damage it
1959400	1970600	does it naturally does this so we want to have awareness when we approach technologies or media
1976760	1982600	we want to have awareness of what's getting compromised how quickly how deeply
1985640	1991160	and how can we if it if it becomes necessary for some reason that we interact with the technology
1991160	1998680	anyway or if we want to we want to have the intelligence necessary to make determinations
1999640	2009480	about what that curve of harm looks like to whatever degree we are able and then adjust
2009480	2014920	our behavior accordingly so as to preserve the assets that would otherwise be lost
2014920	2028200	now you can see that the pros for example when they approach a food source on the ground
2029000	2039240	start to go at it and then jump back they're testing to see if anything moves nearby the food
2039880	2045400	during that process and if it does they will become aware that the food is a trap
2047320	2058360	now obviously also once humans became tool makers of some kind they probably made bird traps too
2059320	2067800	of various kinds and so the bird is trying to check whether you know probably a
2069560	2074760	whether there's a organismal trap and b whether there's a physical trap even though it may not
2075320	2080440	its body probably isn't a complexly differentiating between those two things
2080600	2088440	all right so triggering
2096760	2104840	I think even likely for an organism to take advantage of programs that are normally
2105080	2108760	let's not call them programs let's call them abilities
2110200	2112680	for or what do I want to call them
2118120	2118920	abilities
2125320	2127800	each organism seems to uniquely develop
2131560	2131960	of
2135400	2140280	yeah this is this starts to run into problems between the difference between language and
2140280	2145400	description and what animals and organisms actually are and are doing are being
2152120	2159960	so imagine a broad spectrum of unique forms of sensitivity and or intelligence
2160680	2173240	that naturally result in super effective like meta effective
2176840	2178360	relational or physical
2181960	2186760	skills one can imagine that it might be possible for an organism to
2187480	2191880	especially for humans for example because we have a lot we have a great deal of luxury
2191880	2198680	compared to most animals in consciously determining our developmental spectrum spectra
2204920	2211480	so the humans we probably have access to
2211880	2217640	to at least probably thousands of potentially developable
2219000	2226280	abilities that result when enacted in something resembling either relational or physical
2226280	2233000	super function or both and one tends to lead to the other right because for example
2233800	2241000	brilliant athletes who become known for their athleticism
2243320	2252360	acquire relational benefits what we call fame which radically increases both there
2254040	2259640	the opportunity space for reproduction but also for just enjoyment
2260440	2267640	unfortunately at the same time because of how strange the humans are in modernity and maybe forever
2269720	2280040	that will also attract enemies opponents undesirable possibly obsessive attention from other humans
2281720	2284280	and maybe under some circumstances from the sky itself
2289880	2298760	so my friend and I were talking about cats and she said something resembling you know
2301000	2307000	well i was talking about how cats can be triggered right if they and that sometimes house cats
2308920	2318040	dogs you can see dogs doing behaviors displaying behaviors that and i guess i'm anthropomorphizing
2318120	2321640	bit that may be natural for humans or at least some humans
2325080	2330200	you know when a dog makes a silly mistake a silly physical mistake or like
2331720	2338760	it misses the bite or it slides chasing the ball it crashes into the wall or
2339880	2344040	and by the way that's you can see triggering right there because the dog ordinarily does
2344040	2349080	not crash into things but under circumstances where it becomes hyper focused on the ball
2350040	2356120	it will crash in many dogs will just crash into walls or other nearby objects
2356120	2363320	so
2367560	2377400	i have seen okay we're in gale force winskin dogs appear to exhibit emotions that resemble shame
2378360	2385080	and or embarrassment i'm granting that that's my interpretation
2387080	2389080	after cert after being witnessed
2392840	2397080	they seem to be aware of observation in a way not dissimilar to how we are
2399240	2404600	if i suddenly step on the side of my foot for example and begin to stumble because i missed
2404600	2411880	step the first problem is the pain in my ankle but the second problem is did anybody see me
2412520	2418920	you know i will quickly glance around to see if i have been seen to have failed at something
2418920	2429960	as simple as taking a step right so i was i was explaining that it was my experience when i began
2429960	2437080	to learn more about cats because my girlfriend had a pair and certainly i encountered them many
2437080	2442360	times before but i think this pair of cats was the pair i was most intimate with him
2442360	2454760	throughout my life to memorialize them mexicat and panther which who was her son
2455240	2465880	mexicat was a very hyper intelligent sensitive loving soft mother cat very fluffy furry white
2466600	2471240	found in the desert with a piece of her tail missing as a kitten i think if i remember right
2471800	2476040	and panther was one of her children big black fluffy
2476040	2486040	cat and panther would when we were playing occasionally and i've seen other cats do this
2487480	2496280	very few of them won't be triggered if you accept the gambit so this is this is a gambit in animal
2496280	2507400	chess called cat belly when dogs give you their belly it may or may not be submissive but it's
2508280	2516120	they're they're showing their vulnerability because their primary powers as an animal
2516120	2521080	are
2525160	2532520	the primary powers are like a spear in a dog they lunge and penetrate
2535720	2545400	the cat is different it can lunge but it normally attacks with paws because those are razor sharp
2546120	2552600	and grippy and once it gets a grip then it can penetrate usually the neck of a creature often
2552600	2561640	the neck with jaws both animals have bone breaking jaw power the cats is less because it's smaller
2561640	2569720	the house cat anyway um but what what she was saying i was saying that basically sometimes
2569800	2578120	i would pet panther and he would you know roll over on his back and this seemed to be an invitation
2578120	2587240	for you know some gentle aware belly petting um gentle and aware both because you know this is
2587240	2596680	an animal's vulnerable underside and previous experience had taught me that under certain conditions
2597640	2605400	cats become triggered and when they are triggered they may bite unintentionally
2606360	2612920	and usually they can manage the force so that it's not really bad it's still painful
2614600	2621400	and they also can there's some word for this it's not worry that's what a dog does it's
2622360	2630040	some kind of shredding thing they basically um grasp with their front paws and may claw with them
2630680	2637080	and then shred or gash with their rear paws and so what would happen is i'd be petting panther
2638280	2645720	we'd be having like a love session and you know he really he really enjoys that but then sometimes
2645720	2652680	he would get triggered and capture my hand bite it and try to rip at it with his back claws and then
2654280	2666440	he would he would sort of snap out of it and display signs of that i interpreted as sadness
2667000	2677160	shame embarrassment i didn't mean to do that this kind of thing and uh it took me a long time to
2677160	2686360	understand what was going on i certainly didn't understand to the degree that i you know in any
2686360	2693080	thing that resembles what i'm saying now i was unconsciously aware but not cognitively and
2693080	2699800	conceptually aware of what was going on i didn't have a model but i did learn very quickly that
2701080	2707720	when cats show you their belly it's either one of two things usually going on either they really
2707720	2715720	will enjoy the intimacy and danger of allowing it effectively a god right an animal that is
2715720	2721160	unimaginably powerful full compared to you um you can kill a cat probably just by crushing
2721160	2728520	its rib cage in your single in the grip of one hand right you can kill it if you wanted to kill
2728520	2735160	a cat hopefully you don't um it would take very little effort on your part to destroy the animal
2736920	2742600	physically and there's very little the cat could do about it so and the cat may not know your
2742600	2750200	physical strength but it probably suspects it from examining you so when the cat rolls over either
2751400	2761160	um it has learned to inhibit the triggering that is likely to happen when you approach
2761160	2769960	its belly with your hand and begin stroking it um and so it just enjoys the ecstatic feeling
2771160	2779640	of being vulnerable like being loved where one is most vulnerable so to speak
2779640	2787320	in human language um but other cats and again look the cat rolls over and displays its belly
2788120	2793480	so something's going on there but it's not necessarily my friend was saying a display of
2793480	2805240	submission or you know because when the cat is on its back all 20 of its face knife footraisers
2806120	2809160	are accessible and the bite and so now
2817080	2821400	it can grip with its fore paws bite
2824440	2825960	and shred with its hind legs
2826680	2837400	and this is a for for many animals I suspect this is a disemboweling move right it opens up
2839240	2842280	first of all just opens up gashes on the animal if you're a large cat
2843480	2845400	if you're a small cat it still messes them up
2848840	2854040	so yeah we had a big laugh because she was like the cat rolls over and people think it's a submission
2854120	2859960	move because they've been watching dogs or something it may or may not be partly submissive
2861240	2865480	but basically the cat now has full access to all of its weapons
2868760	2873400	it's almost like the cat is saying like the cat is daring you
2874360	2882520	right do you want to put your hand in the chainsaw
2884200	2889320	it's like a Tasmanian devil in loony tunes I just rips things apart
2893400	2895800	so I thought that was hilarious hilarious take on
2896760	2902040	cats but if you want non-ordinary experience
2905480	2910040	if you're someone who seeks that the best place to seek it is in
2912680	2918600	devoted contact with the living place with specific animals and birds
2919080	2926200	you know it doesn't matter whether plants have spirits or plants have minds
2927000	2931720	they are organisms and we are organisms and we are organisms from the same world
2932600	2939080	so in one set of categories that makes us the same thing the same being
2939960	2947080	we are that that tree is me outside my body I am the tree outside its trunk
2949560	2957000	and I'm not saying this is a fact but it is categorically true before even we are organisms
2957000	2966680	we are beings so it goes like the concentric circles go like mystery universe then beings
2966680	2974200	and organisms and earth organisms and then you know on down the line to animals human animals
2974200	2982200	and that's just what if what if our category tree is missing three important elements and I would
2982200	2994200	argue it is so that we can't even see them in language there's no way to detect them in concepts
2995160	3000200	because we have no placeholder for them in our categorical libraries
3000200	3007560	and I think actually this is a huge problem for all humans
3012600	3016280	but particularly for we who speak English because our category tree
3018200	3026680	is it's almost like it was hit by a shotgun or something it's missing big chunks of crucially
3026680	3038440	important placeholders shelves containers so forth that would draw our attention to
3039880	3048040	modes of existence that we no longer have a placeholder for and so since we don't most of those modes
3048040	3061240	get they get exported to the supernatural the psychic the superstitious the religious but
3061240	3068840	they shouldn't they don't need to be the actual situation is so weird that it's weirder than all
3068840	3075720	of supernatural speculation it's weirder than all religious speculation it's weirder than all of science
3076680	3085320	so none of those should become the authorities of identity those are conceptual frameworks
3086520	3095080	right you might argue one might reasonably argue that humans are particularly vulnerable
3095320	3108120	to structured reactions that are not necessarily physical but are similarly involuntary and our
3108120	3122120	conceptual right what would be an example well weirdly I was listening to the most enlightening
3123080	3130280	podcast last night on I think a philosopher called Dugan that it is in thought that it is
3130280	3140760	thought or Durgan that it is thought influenced influences Putin's policy dramatically
3140760	3149880	and for the first time I heard
3152520	3158840	powerful criticisms of the concept of liberal being liberal
3163080	3165320	so yes where was I going all right
3171640	3180920	examples of such cognitive traps are the Christian belief that everybody who doesn't accept Jesus
3180920	3196680	is going to hell and that there's a Satan now similarly the doctrinal liberal belief
3197080	3208040	once it becomes doctrine once you have to either be liberal or fascist the liberal belief that
3208040	3218120	you get to invent your identity you get to invent your gender you are free to completely dispose
3218200	3225160	of all conventions and anyone who doesn't dispose of these conventions is evil
3226680	3230280	particularly if they do not dispose of them in the way that you dispose of them
3230920	3239480	now you have sectarian liberality right and this can become extremely dangerous virulent
3240440	3243400	and compelling for humans we
3246360	3255720	adopt programs from not tradition but traditional language and the traditional
3255720	3261960	presuppositions about identity meaning and value also which games are played
3262920	3273960	that are imported when we learn a modern language particularly in my case I can speak
3275400	3280440	only telling me about English okay
3281320	3283960	hmm so
3287000	3289400	wow that's interesting
3295720	3301160	I've walked around the lake I think I'm on my third circuit
3302840	3306920	I'm sure you heard that sound that sound was the sound of a spear
3307880	3315320	falling from a cypress into the ground a foot from me it was pointed straight down
3316600	3323560	it was pointy on the end it stuck into the ground and it had a cone on it it was small but
3326520	3331960	had I been struck by that likely I'd have been injured possibly seriously
3332200	3340760	so it's probably time to stop the adventure but I'm not going to just yet
3341560	3348040	because the sun has come back out and there's a break in the rain and it's a good time to
3349880	3355000	stretch my legs I think of course I could walk in safer places
3355720	3356520	um
3359320	3362760	that startled me so I branched in thought
3367720	3372840	yes so the humans are vulnerable okay when we learn a language like English a bunch of
3372840	3378280	games are imported like courtroom mind or war mine or mine and yours or us and them
3379160	3382280	now us and them exist in most languages and conceptual frameworks
3383240	3388440	uh but the way the particular character of the English the modern the colonial
3389320	3391800	the neocolonial the pericolonial
3396120	3401960	you know what that is it's probably crashing crashing trees it's tree branches snapping yeah
3403400	3409160	scary yeah be careful uh there I've seen branches fall on the path it's very very windy
3409720	3415640	they can kill you I'm not saying don't walk I'm out here walking too but just be aware because
3417640	3425400	it is yeah yeah but I almost got hit a moment ago by like a spear that's stuck in the ground
3425400	3431400	and it was like a foot from me so be you know be aware those those cypresses they naturally
3431400	3441560	drop large branches so on that side you're at risk around this side not so much yeah okay my pleasure
3453480	3457400	yeah there were some gunshot branch cracks
3462120	3476600	all right I keep getting distracted but thanks for bearing with me those of you who have hopefully
3476600	3483160	I'll give you some uh some juicy morsels here um all right so
3483800	3484300	so
3486200	3494440	complex array of what I would call malware comes packaged with English and it's not
3496120	3498520	actually it's not in the language
3503000	3506200	per se the malware isn't necessarily in the language
3506840	3518520	the malware is packaged in metaphors models of identity meaning value relation function
3519320	3521320	um
3525560	3537160	efficacy and basically good and evil that come from the cultural or anti-cultural right the malware
3537160	3539560	traditions that
3546200	3554360	influenced how we tend to utilize the language together particularly today and over say the
3554360	3562920	past two three hundred years um the malware package that's attached to languages evolves
3563000	3568760	over time along with the language it's not clear that the languages contain malware rather it's
3568760	3578680	the suppositions underlying their deployment and particularly their deployment um beyond
3579400	3587240	the personal like the person-to-person environment in the larger social and
3587400	3593880	and disease riddled you know um cultural
3596200	3598680	dumpster fire that is you know modernity
3609880	3612600	back into the gusty winds but not too dangerous here
3613480	3616840	so there's no trees likely to drop a branch on me near me
3618920	3619720	all right so
3623320	3632760	recently I've been listening to people like David Berlinsky and actually there's a primary
3633640	3637800	author whose name I can't remember but also
3638360	3647640	um a man whose name I'm going to mispronounce David Gilertner and if you want to find one of the
3647640	3664440	things I listen to um just search on mathematics and Darwin and okay so Darwin's book was called
3664520	3672520	The Origin of Species it is by it is you know he was the Einstein in a sense of biology
3675000	3685320	in that he gave us a map that appeared to be valid and explanatory for a broad range of
3685320	3693480	uh observable phenomena um and doctrinally
3696040	3708360	it is canon to oppose it in any way is to earn broad denigration attack insult
3709160	3715880	and this is unfortunate because science should never be about doctrine
3716920	3723960	science should be about discovery and logical rational thought
3725400	3731320	it should not cater to biases or presuppositions in fact it shouldn't cater to anything
3731320	3739080	but the facts and an ever-improving description of the relationships between them that we observe
3740280	3744680	obviously this involves explanatory manifolds
3747080	3750760	so intuition and suppositions about identity function
3751400	3756920	distinction and and you know the scientific method is fundamentally dissective
3757640	3761320	so it tends to break things down into parts and then examine relationships
3761320	3764920	that by itself can be an error but um
3768440	3777560	nearly every biologist believes well maybe that's not true many many modern biologists believe that
3778520	3790040	that the book entitled the origin of species
3792360	3795960	does in fact tell us how species arose
3798440	3805240	and so is generally accepted as an origin of life argument tells us how we got species from
3806200	3814600	the origin you know organisms now it doesn't make any I don't I don't actually know the
3814600	3822600	book well my doubt explains about origin of life because that's still quite mysterious
3825720	3829640	even though the mechanical physicalist
3829720	3837960	eliminative materialist version is either soup you got a complex soup on earth that
3837960	3846840	eventually produced cells or you know RNA and then there's some you know leap from RNA
3847720	3855400	to cells and DNA and bacteria and protists and archaea and so forth
3861720	3865480	but nobody knows how you get from chemistry to life
3866840	3871560	there are precisely zero successful models of this
3871800	3879800	uh lots of people have speculations some of those speculation the belief is generally
3880760	3887240	and what is taught is that life is the mechanical result of the combination of chemicals
3887240	3888840	and forces on earth
3889560	3890200	um
3894520	3903640	and a number of scientists who are not trying to import god into biology
3905240	3914280	are making the claim for intelligent design by falsifying something resembling
3915160	3917320	Darwin's blind watchmaker claim
3920280	3927720	i.e okay so the one of the old proofs of the existence of god was the unimaginable complexity
3927720	3936440	of organisms now our human experience of that complexity and our cognition about it has changed
3936520	3940360	quite a bit over many years
3942920	3947560	particularly since Darwin and has been influenced by a bunch of doctrinal garbage
3948280	3953000	that really has nothing to do with it but a long time ago someone possibly bacon
3954040	3957800	argued maybe it was Francis Bacon i don't i can't remember
3959400	3963480	argued that the existence of organisms proves the existence of god because
3964280	3973480	if you were walking along a if you were walking along a path in the forest
3974760	3978600	and you look down and you saw for example
3981080	3985560	i'm going to use a sort of weird example um a colander
3986360	3987160	right
3989800	3991640	uh or a knife
3993880	3999080	i'm using a very simple physical object a knife you would not presume
4001000	4005800	be very unlikely for you to presume that the knife had been produced by the accidental combination
4006440	4007800	of substance and forces
4008120	4012040	there are certain kinds of objects
4013880	4020040	that naturally to our intuition imply a mind was involved in creating them
4022280	4031800	and fundamentally these objects can be said and in some cases blatantly obviously do
4032680	4035160	they can be said to encode information
4038200	4039000	so for example
4041320	4050120	dna is a digital data storage and propagation machine if we think in those terms i don't
4050120	4056200	but i'll use the language common to biologists of my day they tend to think as the they think
4056200	4061720	they think of cells and organisms as machines which i think is hilarious i get what they mean
4061960	4069160	um they don't mean diesel engine they mean
4072280	4077720	a structured process that causes the transformation combination and distinction
4078840	4082040	of various substances and structures over time
4082200	4088440	i mean something resembling that
4090680	4097000	i don't think of them as machines but we'll use the language so where was i the machines
4102040	4104360	there are precise precisely zero
4105640	4107480	instances we know of
4107960	4113560	of where complex ordered information was produced without a mind
4117640	4119160	the biologists are presuming
4121480	4129880	unjustifiably that the cell is such an arrangement there is no evidence for that in fact
4130760	4133640	if we do the math these scientists argue
4134360	4139800	um i think one of the guys wrote a book that might be called darwin's delusion
4141000	4143000	and by the way what they're saying is effectively this
4146280	4153000	darwin got the theory right for downstream transformations of genomes mutations
4154360	4161720	changing parts of an animal from you know a bat wing to a bird wing or something
4161720	4170440	right um mutations that don't wipe out the organism and we'll get to an interesting feature
4170440	4183400	of that in a minute so the the scientists that are questioning this and look we don't have any
4183400	4191240	good arguments for origin of life panspermia is a change of arena right that's a rhetorical fallacy
4191720	4198600	you just move the you move the question elsewhere without supplying any useful further information
4198600	4208280	about it right um because you have the same problem with panspermia that you have with
4208280	4214040	origin of life on earth if life traveled here from elsewhere it had to begin somehow
4215880	4220440	and so it either began on a planet like ours or it began in an interstellar space or
4221240	4226840	it began somewhere maybe something we don't even understand you know again
4230600	4235640	the origin of life could be so profound that the concepts we presently rely on
4235880	4237880	uh
4241320	4242360	are insufficient
4243720	4249960	all right um though the scientists rarely argue this
4253160	4258840	so what they're saying so first of all we have no good explanation for the origin of life
4259800	4267240	many biologists believe that it's essentially a mechanical accident there's no evidence for
4267240	4273960	the involvement of an intelligence uh the east scientists believe that there's no evidence for
4273960	4284040	the accident in fact they cite mathematical analyses of for example the probability of
4284040	4287880	accidentally producing what
4293160	4296360	a useful protein i think is the example they gave
4301480	4311240	i can't recall if they were examining for you know an amino acid or what specific
4311320	4320120	um biochemical element they were they were speaking of but i think what they said
4322200	4328600	is that the chances of producing a useful protein by accident okay the search space is
4330280	4336680	something like one in ten to the seventy and that's just one protein we're not talking about
4336680	4343720	you accidentally produced an organism um that resembles the probability of being able to locate
4344680	4354280	a single point particle say uh proton single proton in a search space nine like as large as
4354280	4361160	nine of our universe as we presently understand it the chances of you might as well call it
4361480	4366120	imp or linsky says if you want to say it's impossible i'm on your side if you want to say
4366120	4371160	it's improbable i'm on your side but let's be clear it's monumentally probable
4373560	4379640	and you know something i've argued for probably almost 20 years is that the complexity of the cell
4381160	4386120	radically defies anything any explanation that the humans can come up with at all
4387080	4392040	and this has turned out to be prophetic in that every 10 years or so
4393480	4400520	the complex as the complexity as the apparent complexity of the cell expands
4401720	4410680	for our science perhaps sometimes geometrically the possibility of explaining it recedes with every
4410680	4418280	expansion um and it recedes at a similar pace right it's like you thought you knew what was
4418280	4425000	going on you now found out there were 10 trillion variables you weren't including your chance of
4425000	4439080	explaining that mostly just disappears into infinity you know in my perspective uh i think our
4439080	4449240	physical theories are insufficient to explain biological phenomena and their origins and their
4449240	4459480	meanings and almost certainly their purposes which of which reproduction is not you know in the
4459480	4477080	physicalist lexicon that's the crucial thing to do but there's probably 900 other things they're
4477080	4485720	doing and there's certainly 15 of those that are nothing like what we suppose if you actually observe
4485720	4491480	organisms with an open mind you're going to discover something that generally defies description
4493160	4498840	it's not there for description for the purpose of humans describing it there's nothing to do
4502040	4509480	okay what the heck is this it's an artificial rock i don't understand oh i see it's a rat trap
4509480	4518680	wow it's a rat trap that looks like a rock wow humans are crazy
4521320	4526760	hmm i think i should visit my friend the tree
4526760	4530040	so
4535400	4545240	the scientists are in question here are very upset that textbook biology and the
4545800	4558200	the broad scale supposition of mechanical accident his origin for life a proposition for which not
4558200	4571640	only is there no evidence or nearly none um if we run some of the analytic math so that we come to
4572200	4581000	understand what the actual probabilities we we should be looking at are at this phase in our
4581000	4593720	understanding the math points in the direction that unless unless something really strange here
4593720	4602680	happened unless you hit the lottery you know unless you won the lottery 9 000 times in a row
4602680	4611880	like you you won almost every time you played there's no chance of producing not not never mind
4611880	4622360	organisms just RNA DNA the complex protein synthesis apparatus of cells all of these things
4622360	4630920	or not no chance but an unimaginably almost infinitely unimaginably small chance literally
4630920	4638680	you know zero with a bit you know i don't know 5 000 decimal points after it and then a one
4639160	4649640	so uh i looked up the author um
4651560	4658040	although perhaps burlinski has collaborated with him stefan mire they have some essays and books
4658040	4667560	the deniable darwin darwin's doubt and i suspect they also make arguments that darwin himself doubted
4668680	4673800	that his theory was any explanation for the emergence of organisms on earth or
4674680	4678200	for the poorly defined idea of species
4685160	4691080	so it turns out that the origin of life arguments that are doctrinal are mostly nonsense
4691240	4699160	uh it's not that they're that it's entirely impossible that the emergence of life on earth
4699160	4708280	was a purely mechanical accident it's we have the actual problem you know minus uh the supposition
4708280	4716040	of god in the original argument that if you find something finely articulated and what could be
4716120	4722760	more finely articulated than a blue j it makes i mean just at at the level of its cells
4724120	4734120	its 900 magnitudes of complexity beyond any machine we've ever built a single cell
4734680	4735180	so
4737000	4743160	staggers the the computational complexity of the entire history of humans doing math
4748520	4755240	and it does that over the temporal space of like 10 seconds or maybe even one and we're talking
4755240	4760760	a single cell so you have a cell either hyper structure like a blue j or a raccoon
4761560	4762840	you're looking at something that
4766280	4775480	is pure science fiction there's no chance of something that sophisticated and agentive
4777480	4783800	was produced by accident at least not in any way that we can presently propose
4783800	4796040	is when we find in nature extremely complex objects invariably they are the produce of
4796040	4805880	minds with zero known exceptions so it's it's sort of the opposite of the problem we have
4806440	4815880	with um sorry i'm getting battered by the weather um it's the opposite of the problem we have
4816920	4822520	with the technical probability of there being life on other planets technically
4827640	4833560	due to how statistics and probability function if you have only a single
4835880	4844680	example of something you have no chance of determining the probability therefore the
4844680	4859000	probability is stated as zero so until probabilistically according to how we use statistics and probability
4859160	4867240	um there is zero probability of life on other worlds because it's unknown you have no data
4867880	4874120	with no data you can't produce a probabilistic estimate there are other ways to estimate the
4874120	4883400	probability intuitively we are very unlikely to believe that in a universe as vast as ours
4884120	4889400	this is the only planet with life that life we would have to believe that life
4890200	4896440	cannot spread from solar system to solar system or that there are no mechanisms for that transfer
4896440	4902280	to take place because if there were especially if there were fast methods
4902920	4915480	um something possibly sheldrake's morphogenic fields might represent
4917880	4925240	a sort of layer in in the universe or in time space in which once you manage to get an organism
4925240	4933080	on one world somewhere in time it's now vastly easier to get it on another one
4935400	4942520	um i doubt any of these scientists are fans of sheldrake meaning burlinski,
4942680	4944280	alertner and mire
4950760	4957800	but what i'm what i'm getting at is it could be that there are features of the everything
4959960	4969000	and i prefer that term or really the every one thing way all nests there are features of the
4969000	4978440	grand unity that we don't know anything about and could easily i think could reasonably possibly
4978440	4986520	set up a network between planets where information is transferred either at incredible speed or
4986520	4995160	instantaneously there might be forms of fields capable of doing this but this is my argument not
4995160	5004920	there's um what is their argument so their argument is that if you take the entire biospace
5006280	5013000	of organisms that we believe have ever existed on earth this includes you know bacteria viruses
5013000	5018200	the whole thing everything that number is something like 10 to the 40
5022280	5023720	if you then
5026040	5034040	divide the search space 10 to the 70 by the number of chances you have to produce say one useful protein
5037800	5040680	you're left with i don't know 10 to the 30 or something
5043400	5050760	um which is effectively no chance it means that over the history of life on earth there wasn't
5050760	5060120	time to accidentally assemble a useful protein uh unless something was going on that we don't
5060120	5071720	understand right and this inclines them to believe that that the explanation of intentional
5073160	5083080	terraforming or biospace was vastly vastly more probable than this was a mechanical accident
5083800	5089400	you got some chemistry together you got some forces together
5090920	5099720	out pops organisms that make unimaginably complex proteins and you know rna dna mrna
5100840	5108280	all of these things right uh that stuff just pops up you know on a roulette wheel right you
5108280	5119880	just keep spinning the wheel long enough out comes archaea so yeah wildly unlikely
5122840	5135160	whatever darwin showed us it wasn't how species originated a really good grasp on
5138600	5140600	certain features of of biology
5144040	5153080	mutation selection all this but nothing for how species arise right how do you get a different
5153080	5164600	animal from a prototype we don't know and it's very unlikely to be accidental so it turns out
5164600	5174280	there's another problem which is something like the incredible amount of wind and rain pounding
5174280	5182520	into my face at the moment no i'm kidding there's another problem with where the kinds of mutations
5182520	5189800	that would give you a different animal from a prototype animal have to happen early in
5189800	5199560	blastogenesis i might have that wrong but they have to happen fairly early
5201960	5211720	in the process of producing an organism from oocytes right from from egg and sperm and so forth
5212520	5222360	um although uh the language is more complex than what i'm when i'm presenting here i'm not
5222360	5229960	sure a sperm is a i think there's a different word for the sperm uh so you have to produce
5229960	5237160	a mutation early in the process to get a different animal and if you produce mutations early in the
5237160	5245400	process what you get is a dead animal like if you make any mistake early in the process
5246920	5253080	it's invariably fatal so if you get an early mutation
5255240	5264680	they said like someone said it was probably um an alert I think he said you know you have like
5265320	5272120	19 tails or way too many organs that don't fit inside the animal or you leave out like it doesn't
5272120	5279080	make blood right something fundamental goes sideways and the only way to get different animals
5279960	5288280	that we know of that we can imagine is mutations early in the in the process of generating the animal
5289160	5299240	um again those mutations tend to be fatal so you can't use mutations early in the process
5300520	5307000	and late in the process later in the process doesn't produce different animals it produces
5307000	5313880	different traits so effectively if i understood their argument there's no space
5314120	5321480	in the developmental arc of an organism that we can understand
5324440	5331160	that would allow a mutation to produce a new animal so how do you get stuff like the Cambrian
5331160	5343160	explosion it looks like on earth we have something rather than um gradual meticulous evolution of
5343880	5354920	animals which i think was long held to be the likely case we have sudden like pulses
5358280	5367240	of unexpected diversification blossoming of myriad species myriad different organisms
5368200	5380760	and that certainly isn't explained by anything we have no idea how you get i mean i have some
5381320	5390200	propositions about this i would argue that um it's probably it could be helpful very helpful
5391160	5399560	to look at the organisms of earth as a single organism an organism that naturally diverges from
5401800	5407720	its origins or naturally enacts its original
5407880	5421000	uh what naturally enacts its original endowments and propensities by diversifying
5424520	5433320	that leaves me challenged to the same problem that any biologist be challenged with which is
5433960	5437240	explain the the mechanism that produces the diversification
5440280	5445560	we have no explanation so we go back to the problem of you find a wristwatch
5446360	5450840	all right you find something as complex as a wristwatch and by the way let's be very clear
5451880	5460840	a cell is i don't know 10 to the 900 times more complex than a wristwatch so you find one of those
5463720	5471400	you know imagine i don't know imagine you're walking around on a
5473640	5474680	on a new planet
5477320	5485880	and you find what i don't even know a hyper computer the size of a pinhead
5486840	5496120	you discover that there's these little pinhead like crystals on the ground when you examine them
5496120	5502360	you determine that they're hyper computers they can warp time you can do all kinds of impossible things
5505320	5512040	and you decide oh the universe must just have accidentally produced these
5515880	5523560	that like the possibility of accidental production of an organism is so much more remote
5529000	5532280	than the accidental production over wristwatch
5534840	5539160	there's no chance there's no way we could understand
5539560	5547720	how such complexity could be accidentally produced in the time frame we suppose now
5551080	5558280	if you know it's not even clear that the universe has been around long enough to do that not not
5558280	5566520	clear enough to me um given our estimates of its age and presuming that what we're thinking about
5566520	5571720	is time is even relevant at the scale of the universe which it may not be could be totally
5571720	5578280	some other property that governs that and possibly most likely one we have no concept for
5585080	5589720	all right so what else what other problems so many problems
5590520	5590920	um
5594120	5600200	there are still people who believe and do science around the supposition
5601240	5607480	that it's a mechanical accident and it's reproducible we can figure out how to produce the
5607480	5618280	mechanical accident in the lab and thus produce life forms from forces and substances
5627240	5632120	the hubris implicit in the
5632360	5635560	um suppositions
5638440	5639720	of the materialists
5642680	5643720	and those who
5648440	5649640	unjustifiably
5652280	5659000	presume that no intelligences were involved in the production of the intelligence with
5659000	5669240	which they examine the question all right it's an accidental you know it's an epiphenomenon right
5671640	5678760	of the nature of time space planets and stars all right they just accidentally produce these
5678760	5688040	minds there's nothing mind like in them there's nothing metamind like there's nothing transcendent
5688040	5699000	in them and it's an entirely mechanical process unguided by anything all right it's just not
5699000	5710280	the only thing that guides it are in some way the forces uh which would be you know chemical
5710280	5717400	bonding properties chemical transformation properties gravity electromagnetism strong
5717400	5725400	force the league force etc etc seems unlikely to me so that's been a fascinating i never really
5725400	5735560	believed that to be honest um i never supposed i didn't trust the doctrines
5738120	5747000	i can sense dark doctrines and sort of smell the stink of them in various branches of science
5747000	5761560	and philosophy and i tend to be uh i let's just say i have great antipathy for them
5764280	5767960	in my own view there are a variety of intelligences
5770280	5776600	i don't merely suppose that intelligences were involved in the composition of organisms i take
5776600	5785640	the claim much further it seems very likely to me that something beyond intelligence was involved
5787560	5794520	probably in the construction of time space because you have a similar problem there
5795640	5803880	right which is the fine-tuning problem and it's a huge problem now there is one way to
5806920	5814840	sort of what's the right word there's one way to account for the fine-tuning problem
5814840	5827240	that's a little strange but interesting to mention it is that you have a sort of a popcorn machine
5827240	5834840	right but instead of producing popped kernels of corn it produces universes and most of those
5834840	5850440	universes are not viable the forces don't interact quote unquote properly or in such a way as to
5855000	5860680	what what is meant by viable is achieves extent in time
5861640	5865640	so
5867080	5873640	you keep bubbling these universes up from some universe progenitor field okay
5875400	5886680	and the non viable universes mostly quickly dissolve and only the viable universes persist
5887640	5895640	so you will naturally if you find yourself anywhere if you find yourself at all you will find yourself
5895640	5901320	in a persistent universe otherwise you won't have a self to find or find with
5903160	5909560	and this is sometimes offered as an explanatory
5909880	5910920	uh
5914680	5917160	unexplanatory prosthesis
5919800	5920120	for
5926520	5930760	for the strangely perfect you know the goldilocks universe
5932280	5936600	and the goldilocks solar system both right because you have to have both you can't have a
5936600	5942760	goldilocks universe i mean you can't have a goldilocks solar system in a non goldilocks universe so
5946760	5954760	in this model something just keeps producing nascent universes and some of those turn out
5954760	5959480	to be viable and you will only have minds and bodies and organisms in those that do
5960280	5967800	therefore that you know sort of explains the uh the existence of the fine tuning problem
5968520	5973240	what was myers objection to that it was kind of brilliant i know he was using someone else's
5973240	5988520	objection i wonder if i can recall it i don't think i can but yeah i find this fascinating and
5988520	5997160	brilliant because these are serious scientists they are not theists um even though one of them
5997160	6004200	might be religious maybe a couple of them are i'm not sure um but they're not attempting to
6004200	6011560	import god right they're not trying to sneak god past your scientific nose they're saying look
6012280	6018920	the complexity we're discovering here cannot have been produced there's not enough time to have
6018920	6030680	produced even some of its more basic features in terms of the age of the earth now i could see
6030680	6039720	that someone could say produce the features off world somewhere import them to the earth and
6039720	6044840	then things go along fine i can imagine that line of argument but you you you may have the
6044840	6051000	same problem elsewhere what's the actual lifespan of a planet presuming that that's that life only
6051000	6056680	occurs on planets which is something i don't presume since i don't know where life originates
6056680	6063400	i i tend to be open minded and speculative about that but yeah we've got a huge problem with the
6063400	6068920	origin of life on earth in modern science the problem is steeped in doctrine the doctrine
6068920	6076920	makes no sense never made sense similar to the move to evacuate the universe of meaningful
6076920	6082360	intelligences right because we were we were science was so busy trying to get rid of god
6083000	6089160	that it threw everything away and just decided no it's all it's all just mechanics dude there's no
6089160	6098760	there's no evidence of any kind of um there's no evidence of any kind of intelligence version
6098920	6109480	of what we used to call the ether which probably got replaced by the the the
6111880	6120120	the propensity of time space to curve around mass to become curved at at at complex structure
6121720	6126040	and now more than like there may be forces that we don't know about too right i mean i'm
6126120	6132120	quite sure there must be constants and forces that we haven't discovered that might naturally
6133080	6137000	mechanically produce life but we can't argue for the existence of those until we have some
6137000	6144440	evidence of them and we can't make arguments that this the complexity we're seeing just plopped out of
6145880	6152200	a roulette wheel there's no real chance of that being true as far as i can see
6153160	6159560	so i am now home and safe and alive i am grateful for all of you who have
