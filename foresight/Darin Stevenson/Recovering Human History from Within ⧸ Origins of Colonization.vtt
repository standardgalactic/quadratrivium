00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello everybody. Welcome.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm very grateful to all of you who pay attention to my posts.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
And especially those of you who like or share them.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
And particularly my patrons.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Few though they are.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
You make a lot of light in my life and

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
help me to have the freedom to keep doing

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
this work. This joyful creativity.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
This explorations.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
So I'm really grateful.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Particularly to my longtime supporter H.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
And my new supporter C.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
And you know if you have a little

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
something that you can spare each month.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
One, two bucks. It's fine.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Whatever you've got.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
That will help me keep producing this content.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Keeping it real.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
On the internet.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Circa 2024.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
So for this year is that 2024 isn't

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
a year. The last year we will ever have

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
as human beings around here for the foreseeable future

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
was 2023.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
And this dumpster fire of insanity that we are presently

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
experiencing is actually not

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
a year at all. In fact

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
you know your mileage may vary.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm pretty sure that things aren't things anymore.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
All that stuff we used to think we knew what that was or what was going on

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
or what would happen next or who was

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
who or all of that knowledge thing and knowing stuff.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
That's all gone.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Mushroom cloud of over the

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
horizon of identity.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
And in some ways that's wonderful.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Because a lot of the whatness

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
and the isness and all that

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
was broken. But in other ways

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
we don't have any kind of

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
ship that we can ride in together because we really never forged a

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
we in the first place except on very small

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
scales.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
And we didn't go around building ships

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
and you know by that I just mean

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
a trustworthy

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
vehicle

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
of purposeive

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
orientation together.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Almost all of the

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
potentials of our communal

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
relationships and behavior

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
has been

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
thoroughly

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
recursively recolonized

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
by the

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
thrisplike dead inside infinitely

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
hungry processes

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
that establish themselves

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
in the human cognisium, the network of human minds.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
If we don't do

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
the necessary bonding

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
If we don't do the necessary engineering

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
of our relationships

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
with history, the sky, nature, the living places

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
the plants, animals and insects, the ancestors

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
are dreaming.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
And what I will loosely refer to is the angels

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
the non-human intelligences

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
the accessible non-human

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
intelligences above the human cognisium.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
That have been lost to us

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
lost to our direct

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
contact and experience for so long

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
even though most of us probably

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
were born

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
with these relationships intact

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
and they may have stayed intact briefly during our

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
earliest phases of our human

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
incarnation, childhood, inconsistency and stuff.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
But that stuff gets

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
well, what does it get?

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
It rarely survives

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
the processes of in-languaging and in-culturation

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
which our parents and peers

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
impose on us believing that to be

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
some wonderful

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
inheritance.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
And the problem there is that it could be.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
If it were rich and veritable

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
and ancient and true

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
the processes of in-languaging and in-culturation would not

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
be so violent

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
so dissociative

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
malignly dissociative

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
so isolating, so terrifying

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
so confusing

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
but unfortunately

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
as moderns

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
with very few exceptions I mean the world

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
let's be clear about something when I make very general statements about the

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
humans I'm making a bad mistake

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
and it's one that I've pointed out many times. I am

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
making a mistake I would call generalizing

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
the worst common denominator over the manifold.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
So the manifold is all the different living places and humans

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
presently alive on earth

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
and the generalization is that they're all modern.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Well a lot of them aren't and

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
each of the cohorts we might

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
explore or contact

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
their actual relationship with rather than just thinking about them

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
and this is the problem with abstract thought

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
we can dissociatively pretend to be in relationships we don't have

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
and then from there

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
we can evaluate the resulting abstractions

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
and this obliterates our intelligence

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
it's like a snuff film of the possibilities of

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
or relating with

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
the children

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
little children are painting and their paintings are amazing

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
so beautiful and colorful

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
and see in those little children

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
all of this worst common denominator stuff is not yet

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
established. They are still

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
alive inside

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
and there are many exceptions

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
beautiful exceptions

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
to this worst common denominator

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
evaluative behavior

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
misbehavior

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
that I'm concerned about

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
and we should celebrate

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
and recognize the exceptions

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
yes the bell curve, yes the averages

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
and yes they're

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
devastating because

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
their defection, the capacity to

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
defect from our humanity

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
to colonize and recolonize

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
to devastate

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
to

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm looking for a neologism here

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
what it means to cause

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
to viciously impose forgetting

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
to amnese

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
it's funny

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
the terrible weapons

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
of colonization

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
and this word gets overused

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
these days for all kinds of things

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
but what I'm talking about is when

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
the possibility of human

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
of coherent human relation, intelligence

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
conservation of ancestral

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
land, places, living places

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
intimate symbiosis

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
of humans with the earth

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
and the waters and the sky

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
which is rarely

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
approaches perfection

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
and these places

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
actually became coherent and beautiful

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
and was sustained over time

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
and colonization is sort of

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
I remember

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
a bad cartoon

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
maybe from the early 80s called Godzilla meets Bambi

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
and then suddenly boom there's a footprint

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
and Bambi's smushed in the bottom of that footprint

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
and that's

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
that's a cartoonish

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
image

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
but the forces of

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
colonization rose

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
in peoples

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
and cohorts in societies and nations

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
that were

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
self-colonizing

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
and this is part of the problem that is overlooked

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
when we blame

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
history

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
on bad people

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
and particularly when we take the convenient

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
exit door and think

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
oh yeah it's patriarchy

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
it's those males

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
who are dominating things

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
slapping them with their generative organ

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
crushing them

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
and while that's not untrue

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
the secret

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
origins of these problems are

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
preserved against our discovery

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
of our convenient

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
indictments

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
because if we want to understand how it might be possible

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
for us in our time and our children's time

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
to establish actually coherent

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
intelligent human societies worthy of survival

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
never mind capable of self-sustainment

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
but virtuously beautiful

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
in spirit and purpose and behavior

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
then we're going to need a much better array of toys

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
array of perspectival toys with which to examine

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
what led to the problems we face today

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
and you know the common

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
common

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
the common figurines

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
that we like to

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
that are often selected for

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
admonition and

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
enlightenment and

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
elevation in our awareness

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
to the status of culprits

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
our

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
monotheism

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
patriarchy

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
commerce

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
commodity commerce

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
class

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
hierarchical class dichotomies

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
the

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
the one percent

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
the wealthy

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
the kings and queens particularly

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
in various phases of the development of Europe

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
and the Middle East

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
I don't know

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
I don't know

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
you know personally I'm not well educated enough

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
historically to understand

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
the real birthplaces of

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
the colonizing

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
countries

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
I love the cadences of

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
German it's wonderful to hear people enthusiastically speaking German

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
as they walk past me

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
and you know we might think oh what synchronicity

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
yeah go ahead think what you like

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
but try to understand that what I'm saying is

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
we don't have the formula yet

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
that stuff we're exchanging around

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
like a new kind of poison

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
in the atmosphere of what we have ironically called social

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
justice

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
is not the elixir

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
nor is it the intoxicant that will give us insight

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
if you want insight

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
we're going to have to authentically go back

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
not merely into the history of our species

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
but very carefully into the history of our own lives

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
your life my life our childhood

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
the transitions

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
the phases of colonization

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
that we ourselves underwent as little children

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
that our parents underwent

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
that our grandparents underwent because

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
I

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
I would like you to

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
suspect with me

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
that not only

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
is the key to the cage hidden

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
you know the keys to the cages

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
not only is it hidden in our

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
in the arc of our developmental experience individually and collectively

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
uniquely keys in each one of us

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
we've been secreted

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
obscured occulted

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
but something even stranger

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
is real and accessible to us

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
which is that through a process

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
that resembles something we don't have a good word for

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
and I'm disinclined to forge

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
a convenient neologism here

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
because I want a really good one

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
so I'll describe instead of label

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
in the same way that

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
geologists look at the

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
strata the layers

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
in places where they have been laid bare to

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
access on the land

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
the only really good example

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
I have at hand easily accessible is the Grand Canyon

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
a place where a furrow has been dug

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
by a river into

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
the physical body of geologic time

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
and so the strata

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
are laid bare and I guess the other

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
more destructive and I think

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
confusing way to try to get at this information

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
or these recordings if you will these memories

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
is with core samples

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
carefully

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
drill a tube

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
of earth and stone and ice and stuff

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
in a sequence going down

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
and then you can lay them out in a linear fashion

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
and examine the record but what I'm trying to say

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
what I'm implying here is that

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
and similarly

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
with the origin of life

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
in the branch of sciences where

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
where we look in the various strata for

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
I'd love to know the etymology

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
of this word right now

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
we look for evidence of the previously existing

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
phases of life and development

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
that we imagine took place linearly

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
because we are

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
addicted to

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
one thing mind we are addicted to linear perspectives

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
we don't have to be we can break out of that one of the things we need to

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
we need the experience of being liberated from

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
so there are these strata

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
in the stone in the earth

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
that are like memorial

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
dreaming traces in a way

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
and what I'm suggesting is that in each one of us

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
and in our cohorts in our cultures

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
in our ethnicities in our ancestors in our progeny

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
there's a layered

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
richness of interiority that actually contains

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
the entire history of our species

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
there's a way of doing

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
a kind of archaeology

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
that isn't

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
merely objective

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
isn't merely empirical

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
that is partly magical

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
or partly transcendental

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
and when you hear stories for example

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
of

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
either accidental enlightenment

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
where you have some young child who at six just starts

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
sitting still and won't move and has to be fed

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
and some good who comes and says

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
this one has gone beyond and when you hear stories of intentional enlightenment

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
where quote unquote right where someone

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
very committed to the meditation path

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
mostly you will hear similar stories

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
where in fact what I'm speaking about

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
surfaces in consciousness

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
thus we hear the Buddha saying

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
something I don't know what the Buddha actually said

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
but we hear stories that the Buddha said

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
I have been billions of lives

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
I have been all of the beings in a way

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
this might be translated as

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
past lives

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
I strongly suspect that the actual situation

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
is much weirder than past lives

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
and is not

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
linear in the ways we would imagine

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
so that for example

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
imagine

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
just as an example that you are

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
alive locally to your consciousness right now

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
but

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
like a constellation

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
in the sky imagine for example

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
the big dipper as seen from earth

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
those stars

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
the shape of the big dipper

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
is seen

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
from a point in space

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
now I would like to know

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
the names of those stars

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
and how distant in space time they are from each other

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
because let's be clear if you saw it from another angle outside of it

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
it would not form a dipper

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
some of the stars might be invisible

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
or there might be other stars that were visible

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
in the arrangement

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
the illusion

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
it's not actually an illusion is it

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
the figuration of the big dipper

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
is we experience it because of

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
where we are looking from in time space

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
and so to us it's a little bit as if

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
there's a dot to dot drawing

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
there which over time has

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
undergone semantic degradation

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
so that we think of it as a ladle cup

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
because I promise you

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
long ago they were not thinking that's a ladle cup

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
they probably didn't think that

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
what was seen in the sky

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
resembled objects

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
appliances or tools

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
that would be a very unlikely

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
derivation I think

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
so we should take that seriously the unlikeliness of such a derivation

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
I mean hilariously a couple nights ago I woke up from

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
dreaming to give you a sort of related example

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
and I don't really know what was going on

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
and it was sort of hilarious

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
but not merely funny

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
I got the impression

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
of my refrigerator

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
I hopefully I'll come back to this later because I want to stay on point here but

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
I got the impression of my refrigerator it's a white refrigerator

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
vinyl surfaced

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
many refrigerators and it was

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
deified it was like this

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
angelic choirs and rays of divine light

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
coming off the refrigerator

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
which is a very ridiculous seeming to my rational mind anyway

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
completely ridiculous and even to my

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
the Luddite in me that abhors machines

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
it doesn't merely abhore machines

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
I don't merely abhore them I recognize that

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
coupled with the insensate

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
war and prison hearing

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
monsters that have captured and

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
colonized and are recolonizing our existing societies

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
and nations and populations and so forth those things are

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
death sign

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
those are the flags of a coming apocalypse and not just

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
an ever coming apocalypse right an apocalypse is happening now has been happening

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
for a good depending on how you want to count it

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
thousand years but much more so in the past 500

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
and much more so in the past one and so forth

30:12.000 --> 30:16.000
a sort of title a tide a heartbeat of doom

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
where the humans just are ripping the foundations

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
of their own minds to shreds in terms of

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
the origins of the possibility of intelligence and

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
consciousness in the anciently conserved ecologies of the

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
planet which are the most precious thing around here

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
not us our origins the womb this planetary

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
womb that ever renews itself

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
and hopefully doesn't really need to be

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
penetrated in order to be fertilized right light

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
the divine virginal penetration

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
of light sunlight and time spaces

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
the water of time space penetrated by sunlight

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
coupled with the physical hypostasis of these

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
primordial more than merely beings

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
generates life here

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
and it is truly holy but as I was saying those stars in the

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
sky they are not

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
coherently related to one another

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
except by the angle of our perspective they don't

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
belong to some family of local

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
anatomy

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
local stellar anatomy I don't think I suspect they're wildly

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
distant from each other and would be seen completely

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
differently from another distant angle

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
say if we drew a circle around them

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
if we circled actually if we made a sphere

32:00.000 --> 32:04.000
around the big dipper at the same distance

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
from which our perspective arises

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
we made a sphere then we just traveled to different perspectives on that sphere

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
very different things would emerge to our perspective and what I'm trying to say

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
is that imagine that although your sort of spirit

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
or soul however you want to think about it

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
and there's much better ways to think about it than a spirit or soul

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
your

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
your the localization that you think of as yourself

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
is probably similar to that big dipper

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
imagine that there are many many

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
beings we could start with a small number to make it easy

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
there's 12 just for kicks

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
and a couple of those beings are living in the Pleistus

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
the earliest time of the humans

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
and not all those beings are human but we're going to pretend they are for a minute

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
and they're living in all different times

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
and places of the earth

33:12.000 --> 33:16.000
we're going to keep them on earth for the moment though that's not actually necessary either

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
so there's beings all throughout

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
the historical phases of the humans

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
and let's say half of them are before you and half of them are after you

33:28.000 --> 33:32.000
so six before you and then you in the middle that you're the 13th one so to speak

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
and then there's six after you in the future

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
and those beings are all simultaneously existing

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
the Eunus, the me, the meanness, Darren, hopefully not the meanness

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
but the meanness

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
you perceive

33:52.000 --> 33:56.000
yourself as localized in this

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
temporal spatial manifold of relationships

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
when actually you're a constellation of beings

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
with a nucleus much like

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
what we think of as the solar system

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
and sometimes you're the sun

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
in that family

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
sometimes you're

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
Saturn, it's funny we have this system where we

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
establish your relationship between each of the planets and everyone thinks oh that's a bunch of hokey

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
well those people who think that are very confused but also the people

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
who reify the system

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
of astrology are just as confused

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
because it's neither false nor fact

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
both of those extremes lose

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
the fragrance of insight

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
that is accessible to us as human beings

35:00.000 --> 35:04.000
once things become explicit and we start trying to say what is a fact

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
and unless we're in a very limited

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
sort of cone of purpose of orientation

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
and behavior there are

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
applicable there's an applicable scope

35:20.000 --> 35:24.000
to what we think of as empiricism but let's be really clear

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
what the moderns mostly do with empiricism is kill

35:28.000 --> 35:32.000
I use that to kill stuff now remember my friend

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
Fernanda

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
from Brazil

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
she wanted to become a marine biologist until she discovered that what that meant was collecting

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
living creatures from the sea and killing them

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
taking them apart, studying the bits

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
of course there are other ways to do it but the classes that she was taking

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
she was magically in love with the sea creatures

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
as I am

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
until she discovered what empiricism is about

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
and what we do with it which is really the wrong thing

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
and you can see again here the terrifying

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
jagged pointy fingerprint of colonization

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
this is what I mean by colonization I don't mean

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
necessarily bad people mostly men

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
are the execution body of colonization because

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
historically primarily at least in the large

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
cohorts men were the

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
disposable soldier class

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
and there's so much, wow there's so much here

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
to look at

36:52.000 --> 36:56.000
so yeah men were the inaction body

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
and

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
sometimes men, often perhaps men

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
were the

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
what, the infected

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
disassociated

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
orienteering

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
measureers, rulers

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
measures of value

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
measures of

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
history and futurity

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
and what will we make

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
of this potential of our lives and moment

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
of our cooperative potential

37:48.000 --> 37:52.000
one of my new friends

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
Roger T. who I'm not sure how to pronounce his last name is why I'm not

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
doing it

38:00.000 --> 38:04.000
who has this brilliant

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
sort of matrilineally communicated from his

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
wife method of alignment

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
producing alignment in human cohorts particularly in business but not

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
not necessarily merely in business

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
apex cooperators

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
it's a brilliant phrase, I'm not sure if he coined that phrase

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
or who coined it

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
but so yeah it looks like it was men and I'm not denying that there's a problem

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
with

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
I'm gonna make a joke here

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
with having the external three part flower downstairs

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
historically

38:52.000 --> 38:56.000
but this measuring and what

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
the problem is that the males who perpetrated

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
and executed

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
iterations of recursive colonization

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
were first themselves colonized

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
this is the actual, this is the thing we need to see

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
and we know, we have some

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
we, I don't even know who I mean by we, let's just say that

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
culturally and sociologically we are, we have become aware as

39:28.000 --> 39:32.000
moderns that

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
many of the people

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
who perpetrate violence

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
and subjugation

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
and murder and rape

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
and violation

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
were themselves subjected

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
to these

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
deprivations and impoverishments and terrors

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
in their developmental

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
arcs

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
and it's not clear

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
to me anyway

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
that in a coherent

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
or small scale

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
coherent human family,

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
tribe, culture

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
it's probably extremely uncommon

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
that these behaviors emerge

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
and some will say things like, well we've seen behavior like this in primates

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
okay

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
but did you see primates before humans invaded the jungle

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
and before

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
what is the human effect on the context in which the primates are developing

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
what is the effect

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
of the humans on, of the human behavior in the world

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
on the primate population

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
these features of that which exists are connected

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
they're not merely

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
we would ordinarily think rationally

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
that if the monkeys are in a jungle

41:32.000 --> 41:36.000
in Africa where there are no humans, presuming there was such a jungle

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
that humans are somewhere else doing things like making war and going insane together

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
killing up everything that moves and most of what doesn't

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
it wouldn't affect the primates until

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
and unless the humans showed up in the jungle

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
because we presume that there's no way to communicate

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
the malignancy

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
from the humans to the primates unless they're proximal

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
because there's always a dimension

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
of the context where everything's proximal

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
the planet is a unified

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
manifold of historical

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
relational, futorial

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
what

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
transmissions, communication

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
so whenever I hear people saying

42:36.000 --> 42:40.000
oh it's just natural for humans to be, I don't believe it

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
I don't believe that at all

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
it's conceivable

42:48.000 --> 42:52.000
but what it looks more like to me is an infection most of the time

42:52.000 --> 42:56.000
and maybe I prefer to see it this way, maybe I'm biased

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
Graeber and his writing companion in the dawn of everything

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
push back against the idea that humans

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
have been

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
catastrophically misbehaving toward each other

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
in life in general for thousands of years and it's the law of the

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
land and so forth, that myth needs to come down

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
I just don't trust it at all

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
but what I'm trying to get at is that the origins of the problems we face

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
not in the men, it's not merely patriarchy

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
and what has happened that's terrifying is that

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
the features

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
of our humanity

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
that are vulnerable to colonization

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
have been being colonized by something

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
and we can think of this something in a variety of different ways

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
for eons

44:00.000 --> 44:04.000
and these colonizing

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
contagions

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
these colonizing pathological processes

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
oh wow here's the dog man

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
with so many dogs and yet he can keep them

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
all coherent

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
so

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
huh

44:36.000 --> 44:48.000
an

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
huh

44:52.000 --> 45:02.360
a chat with him at some point. Because he's really profoundly skillful at managing a large

45:02.360 --> 45:18.560
group of unrelated dogs. Nearly certain those dogs don't come from one family, one household.

45:18.560 --> 45:26.040
So we have to look carefully into the history, the histories, and not just the written histories,

45:26.040 --> 45:37.680
the histories that are submerged within us. It's my direct experience that not just the

45:37.680 --> 45:42.880
history of life on earth and not just the history of the humans, but the history of

45:42.880 --> 45:49.840
what we think of as the universe and the history of its origins, the origin places and origin beings

45:49.840 --> 46:02.200
is encoded in the strata of our being. And this is recoverable to us when so ever and to whatever

46:02.200 --> 46:13.200
degree we may agree to recover it, to seek it, to quest for it, to inquire as Amen Hillman,

46:13.200 --> 46:32.160
the half mad prophet, tells us he in his linguistic neuromorphosis tells us that the ancient language

46:32.160 --> 46:47.240
is, are actually doorways into other, into lost potentials of our humanity. And for the moment,

46:47.240 --> 46:54.480
at least, I'm not a big fan, what does that even mean? I have a large fan in my hand and I keep

46:54.480 --> 47:15.080
waiting it. No, I find his playful and hilarious and terrifying, manic, manistic, prophetic, genius,

47:15.680 --> 47:26.040
inspiring and nourishing and propelling. But one of the things he says is that, and I may have this

47:26.040 --> 47:35.200
wrong, but he's saying something like the original idea that becomes in our time the word history,

47:35.200 --> 47:53.440
actually comes from bringing a question to the probably adolescent symbols at the oracle places

47:53.440 --> 48:04.000
in the ancient world. And he's talking specifically about places in Europe and what we think of now

48:04.000 --> 48:16.520
maybe as the Middle East and Greece and so forth. Greece primarily, but also it's surrounding like

48:16.520 --> 48:24.880
the Empire, I guess. I don't know where all the symbols were. I don't know where we have records

48:24.880 --> 48:30.080
of them being, but what he was saying is that this idea of history, it's not stories about what

48:30.160 --> 48:42.960
happened, it's to become pregnant with the urgency of a question and pursue that question beyond

48:44.960 --> 48:56.800
our common inclinations to answer it, to declare some, oh, here's what happened. No, no. It's to become

48:57.680 --> 49:05.120
the re-happening, the living an amnesis of the question. And this is the kind of potential we

49:05.120 --> 49:15.520
are born to experience the exultation of. And there's nearly no one like Amen.

49:18.000 --> 49:25.440
Other biblical scholars or classicists may criticize him and say things like, oh, he's taking a specific

49:25.520 --> 49:32.560
sense of a specific word and he's promoting it to the primordial sense over all instances of this

49:32.560 --> 49:45.520
word in such a way as to twist the perspective to produce the truly bizarre narrative that he wants us

49:45.520 --> 49:56.960
to swallow about ancient Greece, the origins of Christianity, Christos, the Medusa, Medea,

49:58.240 --> 50:00.240
medicine, all these things.

50:00.640 --> 50:11.280
And hilariously, some of those critics, Dan McClellan among them,

50:14.160 --> 50:19.680
might be technically, linguistically,

50:22.960 --> 50:27.760
and perhaps even cognitively quote unquote correct, they're missing the point.

50:28.720 --> 50:29.680
I'm missing the point.

50:32.800 --> 50:40.720
Amen's unique and, you know, intoxicated.

50:44.080 --> 50:53.840
The elixir that Amen is making is sygenic, generative of mind states, otherwise inaccessible.

50:54.000 --> 51:02.320
And they're looking at something, it's just like people who've only seen airplanes or jet aircraft,

51:02.320 --> 51:09.200
which are made for war or passenger or cargo, transit, they're looking at,

51:10.480 --> 51:15.280
basically they're looking at a UFO, they're looking at something from outside. It wasn't even made by

51:15.280 --> 51:22.000
humans. And it doesn't do the things that the human made aircraft do at all. It has no concern

51:22.000 --> 51:28.800
about those things. It's concerned with transporting us to insight and re-establishing

51:28.800 --> 51:39.600
anciently lost relationships and correcting nonsensical histories that for us have become prisons

51:41.600 --> 51:44.320
of ignorance and blindness.

51:52.720 --> 51:53.760
A time will tell

51:58.160 --> 52:05.040
whether the elixir of Amen's performative, and I don't mean that in the derogatory modern

52:06.480 --> 52:14.720
critical sense at all, the elixirs of Amen's performances are truly generative

52:14.720 --> 52:21.840
of an amnesis and re-membering.

52:25.680 --> 52:38.960
However, personally I find them profound and brilliant in an admittedly iconoclastic and provocative way.

52:44.720 --> 52:51.280
So let's see if I can recover my threads here.

52:59.120 --> 53:08.160
The colonized colonizers, the re-colonization. So now what's going on in modernly, okay,

53:08.800 --> 53:16.640
we have the rise of the internet, which starts out looking pretty virtuous. It resembles in

53:17.920 --> 53:26.640
potential the Agora of ancient Greece, where Socrates and other philosophers,

53:26.640 --> 53:35.120
Rhapsodes and Sophists perhaps, gathered the common people day to day to pursue wisdom and

53:35.120 --> 53:48.080
insight, but also to pursue convincing condemnation, indictment, judgment, opinionaring.

53:52.800 --> 53:59.280
And the internet began this way, but it was colonized, and it colonized us.

54:00.240 --> 54:08.880
And what was it colonized by? It was colonized by forces that advertise themselves as protectors.

54:10.080 --> 54:20.560
The NSA, the National Security Administration, the ridiculous enforcement arms of the government

54:20.640 --> 54:32.880
that rose in the wake of 9-11, as if 9-11 were produced specifically to generate those recursively

54:34.800 --> 54:45.280
colonizing lethal organizations, and to create a future of panopticon-like

54:45.760 --> 54:57.120
surveillance that would collapse not merely the possibility of a free society, whatever that

54:57.120 --> 55:03.280
might mean, whatever it's possible for that to mean, but it would turn our own homes and

55:03.280 --> 55:08.320
relationships into prisons, weapons that we could be threatened with.

55:09.280 --> 55:18.080
And then with the rise of social media, which again in the beginning was a way to bring people

55:18.080 --> 55:25.360
together and to celebrate our potentials for intelligence and creativity and insight and

55:25.360 --> 55:34.240
play, quickly again became colonized by corporate agendas, driven primarily by two forces,

55:34.480 --> 55:46.720
advertising the absolute, I mean, one of the most malignant demons of our modern world,

55:48.880 --> 55:56.160
and governmental surveillance of citizens, these twin,

55:56.400 --> 56:06.960
cyclopean, I mean, that's probably insulting the cyclops, but yeah, these monsters,

56:07.600 --> 56:17.360
straight-up monsters that will eat our lives, minds, and children and sell the bones to the highest

56:17.360 --> 56:25.440
bidder. So you can see this recursive, iterative, recolonization

56:28.000 --> 56:37.680
of our relationships, our interiority, our thought, our dreaming, our bodies, our metabolism,

56:38.320 --> 56:49.280
right? And it's as if it's a layered, it's a layered antithesis to an amnesis. It's a layered,

56:50.720 --> 57:00.400
like an acid that just eats the foundations of memory and produces structured skeletal remains

57:01.360 --> 57:14.560
that are commoditized and turned into the fuel for future iterations of new forms of recolonization.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.920
You know, it's easy to distract us with indictments

57:26.640 --> 57:30.480
that make little sense.

57:34.160 --> 57:46.400
If we're actually concerned about the injustice of the histories of colonization, slavery, misogyny,

57:46.960 --> 57:47.760
misanthropy,

57:53.520 --> 58:04.320
misbiorelation, abiotic, omniside, then we need not so much to indict and prosecute the histories.

58:04.880 --> 58:10.160
We need to understand the origins and we must establish coherent vessels

58:11.120 --> 58:25.280
for our communal development, education, an amnesis, healing, enrichment,

58:29.440 --> 58:33.600
and something, you know, what does decolonization mean?

58:34.320 --> 58:38.560
But we can imagine, it means something like, well, you know, when the children have lice,

58:38.560 --> 58:47.520
you put medicine in their hair. No, we need to do the opposite of, well, both things, maybe.

58:48.240 --> 58:56.240
We need a very enlightened idea and direction for any such project, and it must be self,

58:56.960 --> 59:02.480
it must iteratively decolonize itself.

59:16.960 --> 59:20.480
That was really beautiful what that guy was saying, so he was saying like,

59:21.280 --> 59:25.840
this guy's really interesting. He's clearly a not-ordinarily-minded person

59:26.640 --> 59:31.840
because he has an enthusiasm that's far beyond what ordinary people would usually have, right?

59:32.400 --> 59:38.400
And he was saying, you know, the last few, few times I told myself as I was out on my walk,

59:38.400 --> 59:45.040
I'm going to pick up five pieces of litter. Each time I found like a pair of expensive

59:45.040 --> 59:51.120
ray bands, or one I found $100, every time I found something valuable.

59:52.480 --> 59:57.120
This is kind of what I'm, this is a strange sort of synchronicity.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:06.720
We, if our orientation is indictment and prosecution,

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.000
it's the path is too expensive and will continue to colonize itself.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.440
One of the ways that we'll do this is with nomenclature, actually two of the ways.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.360
No, it's like the Spanish Inquisition. Every time you look, there's more ways, right?

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:32.880
But yeah, it's with nomenclature, in other words, jargon, and it's with ideology, ideological fanaticism.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:44.080
So we have to be aware of those, we have to be aware of the way

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:53.200
that a purpose of orientation that starts out virtuous and altruistic

01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:01.200
in a trustworthy sense is easily captured even by its own,

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.920
by the threads of its own origins. And so we have to find a way to preserve

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:19.200
the possibilities of virtue, insight, learning, healing, growth, so forth.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:27.120
There's the terrifying machine signal

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.480
and then the horrible noise of death. Every animal that ever heard that was soon to die.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:42.880
Our cells know this is the, you know, this is the bell of doom when you hear the engines.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.640
Almost, I mean, there are a few exceptions. There's a few exceptions. I guess

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.840
the engines of the ships of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, for example,

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:05.360
are an unusual inversion of that paradigm. So what I'm trying to get us to remember here is that

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:13.440
all of the executors of colonization

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:24.000
were almost certainly victims of colonization first. They were infected with the thrisp-like

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.200
structure of processes that would convert them, their lives, their children, their ancestors,

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:39.440
the meaning of their origins and the shape of their future to omniside, dead terrain,

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:46.880
the production of commodities, the collection of commodities in the coffers of the powerful

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:59.040
and the wealthy who are themselves, sort of the seed bed, the dead inside seed bed of the pathologies

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.640
that become

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:13.920
the inaction body of the colonizing forces. And we must discover, and I mean, I think I have

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:20.480
some keys to this, which I have spoken of in the past, but we must discover and recover

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.760
the origins of the problem and clearly

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:51.520
Okay, I think we just got a clue here.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.400
So these geese are flipping out and the males are getting all spun up and they're getting spun up

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.520
because a human gave a couple of them some crackers.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.160
It'd be hilarious to discover that like the one of the origins of the problem of colonization

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:21.680
and I think there's probably a lot of evidence quote unquote for this is simply the introduction

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:28.640
of carbohydrates. Once you can store up huge amounts of carbohydrates, it's sort of like

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:35.600
what happens when you put a nectar bottle, you know, a bottle of dyed sugar water

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.760
in a population of hummingbirds. They might have been a little bit provocative before,

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.960
but once you put all those commodities in one place, now you got two problems. You've got to

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:53.440
protect them from people who might want to take them and it's a really attractive prize

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:02.080
because it represents what? Convenience. Okay, so we're going to see two things here fuel

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:10.560
and convenience and there's a third thing which is essentially

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.320
metals

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:29.600
particularly what we think of as precious metals and jewels, crystals, diamonds

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:41.440
gold, silver, platinum, copper, bronze, iron, diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:53.200
So and I'm not even getting close to what is actually going on. These are the later stage

01:05:53.680 --> 01:06:04.640
catalysts of devastation. What did they really want when they sent ships to the new world quote

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:12.480
unquote? Well, they wanted gold. What were they after? Gold. They might have been thinking land

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:19.280
but mostly they were thinking gold. Did those savages have gold stored up somewhere? Let's get

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:26.080
that gold or at least this is the story we tell and that story is probably three quarters wrong but

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.080
it maybe resembles our own projections

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.160
and projection is a large part of the problem because

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:46.880
if you think your opponent is up to something various then you have to get there first. This is

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:51.520
the race to the bottom the perverse incentive incentivization

01:06:53.920 --> 01:07:04.320
elucidated by Daniel Schmockdenberger and others of the Game B or new civilization project.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.720
You know what has to happen obviously is that we have to establish some options that are so much

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:24.320
more compelling than the zero-sum competitive pathologies we're currently enacting and being

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:29.520
conscripted to and punished by and devastated for.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:42.720
We aren't the people of the lie. We are the generation of lying. It's different.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:55.840
The context is so catastrophically multi-layeredly toxic counterfeit

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:07.600
projective. Everywhere we see presentations that advertise virtue and underneath are

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:17.440
essentially self-purifying disease vectors and this is you know the concept that I use.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:26.560
This is the origin. My quest to understand this resulted in a series of visions one of which

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.400
introduced the concepts of the Cognition which is the network of human minds, the Mimula which is

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:38.480
all the features of connection in that network and Thryps which compete for dominance of that

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:53.760
network under conditions in which the organic and natural orienteering principles that would guide

01:08:53.760 --> 01:09:04.880
and nourish and protect our collective insight, memory, intelligence, altruism, virtue when those

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:20.720
breakdown boom, drifts everywhere. It's similar to certain biological processes like those that

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.360
burn down our neural networks with prion proteins for example. One of the things

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:38.160
Kurzfeld Jacobs disease or otherwise known as mad cow disease and similar prion protein

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:53.680
disorders. As I understand it, the prions are essential to the differentiation

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.880
of our nervous systems and neural networks in the brain in early development.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:09.040
Similarly to how something kills off the flesh between our fingers so that you get these differentiated

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:20.160
very useful articulate appendages. Something resembling that happens in the brain in our early

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:31.520
developmental arcs with neurons. A lot of them have to be burned off and what that means is that's

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.840
one of the things that makes us each unique because we all undergo this kind of interior

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:44.560
extinction event and usually we think oh extinction is bad and it certainly is if we're burning down

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:49.600
anciently conserved ecologies to make more machines and stuff. That's insane. That's not

01:10:50.800 --> 01:11:00.080
there's nothing coherent or biorelationally integral about that. That's just madness and

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:08.960
wrongness. And yeah you can take the bigger picture. Sure. You can say things like oh life is resilient

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.800
earth is resilient.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:19.920
But I'd love to see where that perspective is arising from because if it's arising from some kind

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:26.960
of empirical or materialistic perspective based on what you think is the historical data and so

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:32.000
forth that's dissociative. That's dissociated. You're not connecting with nature at all. You're just

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:42.480
you're just being a disembodied grasping rationalist. So you're almost certainly going to be wrong

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:51.840
about nearly everything having to do with organisms if that's your that's your anchor in consciousness

01:11:52.400 --> 01:12:06.880
and concern. A mother's concerns much more trustworthy. She bears children. She has to fund them

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:15.280
fund just to build their bodies from her own biology right the calcium of her bones

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.640
the metabolic products of her body her heartbeat

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:31.760
is becomes the context in which life emerges and while our planet is only metaphorically

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:41.280
feminine in this sense that metaphor goes very deep and is very powerful. It's not merely a figure of speech.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:52.880
So we must recover the origins of the problem that led to our defection

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.600
from memory humanity insight virtue mutual intelligence mutual concern awareness

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:20.640
our real cooperative abilities and we must find ways to establish vehicles to conserve develop

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.800
enact

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:40.080
and and transmit communicate these potentials into the existing bodies of anti-culture

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:51.680
that largely own our species at this time our children and perhaps we may be so lucky as to

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:58.800
stumble into ways of being human that please our ancestors by fulfilling their dreams

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:06.160
and what they hoped for and worked for in the deepest recesses of their hearts minds and spirits

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:17.520
all of us moderns and for you know millions of lifetimes we have been slaves

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:25.680
to things that don't even exist we have been slaves to ghosts and shadows in the human cognisium

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:36.640
presenting as virtues or progress and delivering omniside amnesia torture despair

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:46.800
devastation of our our spirit our commonality the replacement of that with

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:57.840
prison-eering panopticon like surveillance systems that aren't killing us off directly at the moment

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:10.480
and this is this is actually part of the problem with the weird results of technology

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:22.160
there are fates worse than death and some of them involve the slow erosion

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:31.520
of our interior assets and potentials and if you can get at the thing with which we tell the

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:39.440
difference the thing with which we would otherwise notice what is happening then anything that gets

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:50.320
at that anything that gets at the fundamental basis of our capacity to discern change if you can

01:15:50.320 --> 01:16:00.560
co-opt that then the entire bank of the history and future of life on earth of human beings of

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:07.680
our interiority is now open for rape and you can get away with anything you can imagine

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:14.080
you just have to go slowly enough you just have to turn the heat up in the water slowly enough

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:25.920
that it doesn't overcome the disabled senses that would alert us to we must oppose this

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:32.640
that would cattle that would organize and galvanize us into communal

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.240
into heroic communal

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:46.640
organization intelligence resilience and activity

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:56.240
so these are a few of the things that are in my awareness today or have risen in my awareness

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:10.000
while I muse with you my listeners in the hope of better ways of seeing in the hope of an amnesis

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:16.400
in the hope of pleasing the ancestors and the muses and perhaps the angels

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:27.840
I'm so grateful to have this time together and for your kind attention your enthusiasm your wonder

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:37.840
your curiosity the spirit within you of heroic questing recovery and rescue

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:47.760
that is innate to our human nature may your ways and minds and dreams be beautiful and healing

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:59.040
and profound and may you find joyful relation with all the aspects of yourself your histories your

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:06.800
futures your ancestors your progeny and all of the beings who are in fact a single family

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:21.840
thank you for joining me I look forward to learning together again very soon bye bye for now
