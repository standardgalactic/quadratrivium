1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Great to see you again, Lee. I'm so happy.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Great to see you again, Darren.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm really excited. There's so much to cover.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We'll probably, we'll be sort of continuing along the lines that we established in our previous conversation.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And let's see here. So,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
sort of where we left off, we were talking a little bit about

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
how it's possible.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A process that resembles the caterpillar going into a priceless right where, where, where you can sort of liquefy the structure of history and the self.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And then reforge it, maybe without some of the impediments.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Right.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But it was

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
perhaps carrying historically and struggling with.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And we can return to therapy.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I just want to sort of bookmark that idea.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But there's a, so there's a, there's a span in your story previously that I'd like to revisit, which is the span between your walk.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And when you begin to

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
enter

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the learning process that I think starts with NLP goes to hypnosis goes to mesmerism and then circles back maybe to the walk and the events during it.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Right. Okay.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay. So maybe if you can help prompt me, because I'll be coming up with a lot of a lot of things here, which will be quite free form, but

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
so we spoke about in the previous interview or conversation, I prefer to put it really that we did.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There was the coast to coast walk that I mentioned and the particular section called the like wake walk, which I, which was particularly important.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's where I had my, what I'll call my Milky Way experience, where I had the experience of connecting the heavens and the earth through my through my physical body.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It was a very visceral experience.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And after this walk, as I mentioned, returning back to London where I was living at the time.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So like I say, this was around 1990.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I ended up having, I was catapulted into a, into a kind of what they would call in the alchemical tradition kind of like a niggerado state.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I felt a bit a little bit like everything was disintegrating like, like I've been ripped open and my psychic skin was really raw and bare.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I was able to sense everything around me, the vibrations of all of the people around me.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But in an uncomfortable way, when I returned from doing that walk, which was a very joyous experience.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It was, you know, an incredibly joyous experience doing that walk.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Like I say, returning to the city, returning to London at that time, very, very difficult.

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The important thing is, is that during, during that time, like I say, it was almost like entering into a type of depressive state.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But it also felt like I had terrible flu. So it was all, it was almost like a physical state as well.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But as I was coming out of this, I started to come out of this, due to a series of dreams that I started to have.

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is where dreams become really important in this whole scenario we're speaking about.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So I started to have lots of dreams and in, in this, in these dreams, I think I touched on this in the previous part, but I didn't go into great detail.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:35,000
In these dreams, I, there was a specific hill that was in these dreams.

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It was very, very characteristic. So it was the kind of thing that stuck in my head and it was a recurring dream as well.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And from the top of the hill, I looked down the hill and there was some cornfields and there was a river flowing through the cornfields.

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And I even could see, because of the dreams, because my encounters with a particular figure in these dreams that I found, there was a boat.

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And it was on a river. And this river was within the cornfield that I could see down in the sloping valley in the veil seen from this particular hill.

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And inside this boat was a goddess-like figure, a feminine figure.

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And every time I got into the boat with her, we would go for a ride.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And every night, we would go a little further.

49
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And this ride down the river was going from the vision of the hill, from the view of the hill looking down, the river flowed left to the left.

50
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So I got into the boat with her and every time I woke up, I felt an immense surge of healing energy.

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So this dream, I noticed, was beginning to act as a kind of medicine.

52
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It was healing me every single night, every night that I had the dream.

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I was looking forwards to actually being back there again.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And sure enough, every now and again, it kept coming back.

55
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And this dream would just heal me a little bit more.

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And this is what got me out of whatever it was I was in at the time.

57
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you have any impression about, how did you think about the woman, the boat and the river, but particularly the woman about her identity?

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Was it a matter of concern to you?

59
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Weirdly no.

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I just knew that she represented some kind of divine feminine force, that she was somehow a personification of nature that I was meeting in this boat.

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And that's all that really concerned me.

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Can you describe her from your recollection?

63
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I mean, maybe she doesn't have a specific appearance, but what do you recall?

64
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, I do recall that she had long hair.

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I do recall that she had a long dress.

66
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I think it was white.

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If I remember, I don't have full recollection of that.

68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The Dreaming Mind is a wooden rowing boat, I remember that.

69
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah, the Dreaming Mind isn't as concerned with what we might think of as particulars.

70
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But it was a cornfield, that I find significant, the fact that it was a cornfield.

71
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And this takes place looking down from Nap Hill.

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's right, that's right, but I didn't know it was called Nap Hill.

73
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I see.

74
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Now, I've mentioned this to you obviously in private, but the thing is, is I had no idea who this person was.

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I had no idea where this place was.

76
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It was a dream.

77
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But you see, in 1994, in the summer, I think it was the summer of 1994, there was a couple of friends of mine.

78
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I used to work on markets in London.

79
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I used to sell old 50s rock and roll collectible records and 60s psychedelic stuff and things like that.

80
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:57,000
A couple of my friends there, I got chatting with them on the stall and they just said to me,

81
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
they knew I had a van and we had similar interests, we discovered.

82
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And they said, should we take a trip out to the West Country, would you take us?

83
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I said, sure, you know, I'd love to do that.

84
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So we got in the van and went looking for crop circles.

85
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So this is in the summer of 1994.

86
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And whereabouts are you when you're on this journey?

87
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, you mean in terms of geography?

88
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Where are you going?

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Right, OK, so we got in the car in the van and we drove out of London and went over to the area of Avebury,

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
which is, you know, a really amazing place for those who've never been there.

91
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Look it up.

92
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's in Wiltshire, which is in the West Country.

93
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And we were looking around for all of these crop circles.

94
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And we found one or two that day around Avebury, around sort of in that vicinity in the fields around.

95
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Drive out of London to Avebury and you find crop circles just out there without even knowing where you're going.

96
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There's no internet, right?

97
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No, there was no internet.

98
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Just venturing out in your van and you come across crop circles.

99
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And I find that kind of surprising, but I'm listening, please continue.

100
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, as the story actually goes, is the fact that we actually basically all three of us agreed that all of the crop circles we found that day.

101
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think it was two or three we saw were kind of just fake.

102
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And it was kind of crop circle season.

103
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Right. OK, I follow.

104
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah, so there were supposedly some around or so they'd heard, which is what spurred them on to want to go and do the, you know, do the trip.

105
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So we went out there and all day we were looking for these things.

106
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We found two or three, like I say, and but we weren't convinced.

107
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They seemed a bit scrappy and a bit kind of, you know, like maybe some teenagers had knocked it up overnight, you know, sort of thing.

108
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So we sort of were everyone was a bit disappointed.

109
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We'd had a great trip out, but everyone was really tired and it was the end of the day.

110
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We'd been traipsing around all day through these fields and cornfields and stuff.

111
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And I just got this thought as a driver thought, oh, how about taking a different route?

112
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's let's go just take a random route off and go up through another through another route another way.

113
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Instead of going the main roads home, let's go off some some other way.

114
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So we did this and I didn't really know the area apart from maybe a couple of the main routes around there.

115
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And all of a sudden, like as we were going through all of these open planes.

116
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I suddenly saw the way the road swooped up to the right.

117
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There was a there was a track path coming away from the road.

118
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And as soon as I saw this, I had this immense impetus, this impulse to just stop the car and get out and walk up that track.

119
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So I did.

120
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And of course they were really, really tired and they were they were complaining.

121
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's like, oh, we've not found anything you've been walking all day.

122
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We're really, really tired.

123
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And we were supposed to be on the way home.

124
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So I said, you can wait here.

125
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And so they did they waited in the van.

126
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And I traipsed on up the track.

127
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And so I got out got out of the van traipsed up the track and went to the top of this track, the top of the hill.

128
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So when I got when I got to the top, I stood there and looked down across the hill.

129
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Lo and behold, I was absolutely transfixed by the fact that what I had in front of me was exactly what I'd seen in my dreams.

130
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
At least five years earlier.

131
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So back in, like I say, coming from the coast to coast back in 1990.

132
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So about four or five years earlier, I'd seen this very, very place in my dreams.

133
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You can't ignore that when that happens.

134
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're there looking at the scene and lo and behold, there is the there is the valley.

135
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There is the river snaking through exactly the same place.

136
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And while this is in my mind right now, I must mention this just in case it's not completed.

137
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's only about a month ago, I think just before our interview, the last interview we had.

138
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That I met a lady through a mutual friend around here where I live.

139
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And she actually revealed what I understand to be the actual name of this particular goddess that I'd come across.

140
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Okay, this is the thing I was having for a pastime, right?

141
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I sensed to like, she is someone who is she I'm listening at least.

142
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Right.

143
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Now, I feel it's maybe not the right circumstance to reveal that name.

144
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay, I understand that.

145
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah.

146
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And such things, there are some things that is important to keep private.

147
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah.

148
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And also to not speak about.

149
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's right.

150
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And I honor.

151
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And you can feel that viscerally, you can feel, don't speak of it.

152
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes, yes, good.

153
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes, I honor this and understand.

154
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah.

155
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But please continue.

156
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm with you.

157
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In actual fact, all I've mentioned up till this point, including the fact that there was this feminine figure, it was a goddess figure, it was there in the boat.

158
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It was revealed in a dream.

159
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
These parts until very recently, I've had, I've had a do not speak about it.

160
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, wow.

161
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Okay.

162
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So what is only now I'm beginning to speak about it.

163
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Wow.

164
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So do you have any sense of what the change what changed that made you feel more comfortable to speak of it?

165
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's an interesting question.

166
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
In my physical body, my body is telling me it's okay to mention it.

167
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's a visceral sensation.

168
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
There's a stop feeling when you know that something is not the time to speak about it.

169
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes, it's funny that you say that because, you know, we have this colloquialism in English, what we call the still small voice.

170
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Right.

171
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Right.

172
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And also, I think, though I'm not an expert on this topic, Socrates is Daimon.

173
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yeah.

174
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What it primarily did was just say no.

175
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yeah.

176
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Didn't tell him what to do.

177
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It didn't have, they didn't have conversations, at least not in the records that we have.

178
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And one thing that we know about it is it tells him just don't, this is, don't do this, or it might say, you made a mistake.

179
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah.

180
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah.

181
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And so there's this interesting in my own experience with this a couple of times in my life.

182
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I heard it tell me it, whatever it is, right.

183
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't.

184
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Just like, no.

185
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And not, I've had other experiences of, you know, sort of a Daimonic intelligence or whatever, but I honor that. And I want to just mention that I have a close friend who works with neurodivergent people.

186
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah.

187
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And her prime, one of her primary areas of expertise is a process called positive disintegration.

188
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay.

189
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And when you were talking about what took place when you returned to London.

190
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It has the earmarks of this process.

191
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Right.

192
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And she talks about it as in, in a variety of senses, but it's, it's, it's quite fascinating.

193
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Because she says that it's, it's a, it's a somatic array. It's an array of somatic intelligences.

194
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And you talk about feeling that you had the flu, but you also talk about having these extra sensitivities where you can feel people's energy and things like this, right?

195
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

196
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But it sort of has the earmarks of this process. I recognize from my recent discussion with her a similarity there.

197
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay. So you've, you've met a woman somewhat recently.

198
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
She revealed to you, and I presume that when she revealed this, it was resonant. You were like, oh, or how did you feel?

199
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, actually, I was absolutely gobsmacked because the very moment that and the odd thing is the fact that I was describing this specific place also caused a huge reaction and huge

200
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:01,000
explosion for her also, because she said that I can't believe the synchronicity of what you're describing to me.

201
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:13,000
She said it was literally just last night for the very first time that I was earmarking that very place you're telling me about to actually go and visit it.

202
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And then she revealed to me the actual name of the, of this particular, of this particular goddess figure.

203
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So it was kind of like a mutual, explosive, amazing sort of cross flow of information.

204
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And yes, I definitely feel it's not the right time to talk about the name. I'm not saying that.

205
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm not saying that just the sake of theory, you know, to be serious.

206
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:54,000
This is, this is trivial. What we're doing here is, I mean, it's beautiful and profound for me and, you know, but this is a, this is not the place for, for this kind of

207
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I just honor the fact that there's some things we shouldn't speak openly and particularly publicly or even on recordings about.

208
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Okay, so I mean, I just have a couple of questions about this. How did you come across this person? How long have you known them? What was the tell me something about that?

209
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's the peculiar thing. I'd never, well, actually, funnily enough, I'd, I'd seen this person a couple of times.

210
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And, you know, there'd been an acknowledgement, like I was recognized and so on. But there'd been no interaction. And there's been no interaction since either.

211
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It was purely just on this day I was there to meet someone else entirely. And it happened to be one of these talks over a coffee table that ended up sort of spilling out.

212
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And oddly, you know, it somehow, probably because of the company I was in, the conversation turned in that direction.

213
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And, and just strangely, these hugely important missing fragments of information that I'd been hanging on waiting for these extra pieces to arrive for years.

214
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And this very much touches on something central to my own personal attitude towards receiving gnosis or, you know, how it happens with dreams, with actual encounters.

215
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Whenever you receive anything what seems to be significant at the time, I take quite a, quite a detached approach to it.

216
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't let myself get overattached or over excited by anything which seems significant.

217
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What I tend to do is I tend to sort of earmark, earmark the events or earmark these things and put them put them on the shelf, so to speak.

218
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:15,000
To let them hang around because I have absolute faith or certainty in one way or another, that these things will be answered or I will understand their true significance, even if I have to wait years for it to happen.

219
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And this was a really good example of what I'm saying because I take life as one whole, if you like.

220
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So there are things that we can be experiencing now in our esoteric internal experiences, in our dreams, in our personal revelations of any kind, or synchronicities, significant synchronicity, which I have no doubt we will find the answers to.

221
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
20 years from now.

222
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I have full faith in that. There's no rush about this.

223
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So it's really interesting to hear you say this because I trust the wisdom of the intelligences in you that have this sense of no need to get super excited about this.

224
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Put this on the shelf, let it sort of, I don't know what the word is, be enriched by time or sort of like age, let it age.

225
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And then in time, it will become clear. The thing that I find funny about that is I'm completely the opposite and it gets me in trouble.

226
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I get super excited, right? And so I can become so excited and enchanted that I get very spun up.

227
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And then various things, it doesn't always lead to disaster, but sometimes it does, right?

228
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm disoriented by the excitement and the enchantment. And when one is disoriented, you know, untoward events may occur.

229
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:11,000
OK, so there's a number of threads here, and I have them fairly well organized in my mind.

230
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You mentioned in private conversation earlier, the like wake walk.

231
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Why don't you tell the audience a little bit about the definitions of those two terms and what they came to mean for you?

232
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Right, OK, so like I said, back in 1990, I undertook the like wake walk, which was part of the coast coast walk.

233
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
So I'll just recap very, very quickly from what I explained a little bit of in the previous part.

234
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:51,000
No, we did. England's a bit like a hand. The coast coast walk, of course, goes directly from the east to the west coast.

235
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Then the starting and ending places, if you don't mind.

236
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah, so on the west coast, sorry, on the west coast, which would be, if this was the hand of England, you know, this is Scotland up here, this is Northumbria, and here is the Pennine Ridge running down the middle.

237
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The Lake District over on the west is sort of where we started.

238
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So it's kind of like from the west coast over to the east coast.

239
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Of course, this would be Cornwall, London somewhere over here. The Cornwall is a bit like where the thumb is.

240
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So you would travel across starting starting, well, in this instance, I started from the west coast going to the east.

241
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yes, but what is the place where you started the name?

242
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So it's Saint B's Head.

243
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Great, thank you.

244
00:25:47,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Saint B's Head. So going from Saint B's Head, and then going across the Lake District, crossing the Pennine Ridge, which was very peculiar, I've just remembered, I may as well say these things as they're coming into my mind.

245
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Crossing the Pennine Ridge, I ended up meeting an old couple on the top of the Pennine watershed, really boggy watershed in mist.

246
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
A really old couple who were happening to walk this particular stretch of the Pennine Ridge.

247
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And so I kind of started chatting to them in the middle of mist, in the middle of nowhere.

248
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And I thought, this is interesting, this lady's, I said to the lady, old gent, old lady, I said to the older lady, I said, your accent sounds quite familiar.

249
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It sounds like it's from where I grew up, which is a place called Aquarth, which I grew up in as a small child, which is an old oak grove.

250
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Originally, it was part of an old druid oak grove up on a moor top.

251
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And she said, oh yeah, I come from a place near to Leeds, because don't forget this is, the Pennine Ridge here, it's sort of on the way to, it's almost closer to Manchester, really, at this particular point.

252
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So she could have been from anywhere up north, but I said, no, she identified her accent, she said, no, I'm from closer to Pontifract, Wakefield, outside of Leeds.

253
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I said, oh, so am I, so am I.

254
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,000
She said, well, do you know a place called Aquarth? I said, well, yes, it's the village I grew up in.

255
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And she goes, oh, really? She said, well, I lived on Moor Top in Aquarth.

256
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I said, well, that's interesting, because I lived on Moor Top in Aquarth as well.

257
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And it turned out, she said, oh, well, you know that big house near to the roundabout.

258
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
There's a, it used to be called, it's now called the Elm Tree Restaurant.

259
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Well, that was my house when I was a child.

260
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Well, my house is literally joined onto your house.

261
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's part, it's the coach house that belonged to your house.

262
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
She goes, oh, the coach house.

263
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I said, yes.

264
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So she was, she was literally my next door neighbour.

265
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Her house was literally physically joined onto the house I grew up in.

266
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Surely it has occurred to you that this might not be an ordinary couple.

267
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It has, while I was actually speaking to you now,

268
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
it kind of started to dawn upon me.

269
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I was beginning to think, I was describing the mist and everything.

270
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
And I was thinking to myself, hmm.

271
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah, because what she's saying in a way is in code, right?

272
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
In a way that wouldn't necessarily reveal it.

273
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
She's saying, you and I have been associated our entire lives.

274
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Right.

275
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Which is the kind of thing that, for example, the moon might say.

276
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yes.

277
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Yes.

278
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
The moon.

279
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yes.

280
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And it's very common in.

281
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Now I'm not making any claims about what took place with you.

282
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Right.

283
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Sure.

284
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm just noticing that.

285
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's common in indigenous stories.

286
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
For a very elderly couple to appear.

287
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Oh, right.

288
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And I didn't know this.

289
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Yes.

290
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yes.

291
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Very, very elderly couple appears and they may appear frail or weak.

292
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And they often look quite old.

293
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And it's, it's very strange to find an elderly couple out in the middle of

294
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
wherever you were.

295
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Like wandering around in the midst.

296
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I mean, yeah.

297
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah.

298
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Where, what are they doing?

299
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Like, I know what you're doing and you're a young guy and you're,

300
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
you know, you're on a quest.

301
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah.

302
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And since you're on a quest and you encounter an elderly couple,

303
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
but in many cases it's not clear to the people at the time.

304
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
At the elderly couple represent the sun and the moon.

305
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But they often do, right?

306
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And it's, it's quite often that.

307
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
The sun may give a gift or the moon may give knowledge.

308
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But yeah, it's, I just can't help but notice the strange.

309
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Be like, it's not metaphor.

310
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
There's another word for it that I don't know what it is.

311
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But the, the, the shape likeness.

312
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
In what she's saying.

313
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, you go through a series of steps.

314
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Right.

315
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Oh, you sound like, oh yes, you, you know, do you know this?

316
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You know, and then, and then it just traverses to.

317
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
We've been there the whole time.

318
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Like we've been together the whole time in the strange way.

319
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Right.

320
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Our origins are linked up.

321
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Right.

322
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So that's very profound.

323
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And I'm grateful to hear that story.

324
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm glad we glad you came across it.

325
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Please continue.

326
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah.

327
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
A couple of other things have just dawned on me because you've pointed this out.

328
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
And that's the wonderful thing about doing these sessions with you is that,

329
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
you know, all of these new parts of insight suddenly spring up while I'm in the

330
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
middle of speaking to you.

331
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So the Pennine Ridge is quite literally, I mean, it's known as the backbone of

332
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
England.

333
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But what's significant about this from the west to the east is that it's the

334
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
threshold between them.

335
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So this watershed was quite literally the barrier, the physical barrier that

336
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
divides Yorkshire from Lancashire.

337
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So you've heard of the War of the Roses, the red rose and the white rose,

338
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
but they're quite literally divided by these two sides.

339
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And what's what suddenly came upon me is the fact that the old man was from

340
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Lancashire and she was from Yorkshire, which was where I was from.

341
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So so you literally had a Yorkshire man and a Yorkshire woman and a Lancashire

342
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
man on this particular threshold between the two halves of the walk.

343
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, this curious sir and curious sir.

344
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

345
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah.

346
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Yeah.

347
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Beautiful.

348
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Interesting.

349
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Interesting.

350
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's wonderful to have these conversations just to document this stuff as well,

351
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
you know, because this is the thing, you know, when we it's often helpful to have a

352
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,000
companion to lead us along and help with the sort of the sequencing, right?

353
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But when you begin to recover, I'll just mention this very briefly.

354
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So yeah, my roommate recently came to me and said, you know, totally up to you

355
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
if you want to do this, but let's talk if you want, let's record like a life

356
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
history thing.

357
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Okay, so we started doing this, not for public sharing or anything for like

358
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
my own use.

359
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And, you know, all those things started lighting up because you're, you're

360
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
resurrecting these moments and they link, they start to link together.

361
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And the whole map starts to light up and that brings to mind perspectives you

362
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
haven't, you know, perhaps you haven't seen before.

363
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So let's not get too sidetracked by that.

364
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Please, please continue.

365
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So you come across the couple.

366
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Go ahead.

367
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah, yeah, I came across the couple.

368
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And it was on this particular threshold area.

369
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I mentioned it was a watershed as well.

370
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So basically all of the rivers flow, flow down from this place over the

371
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Pennine Ridge itself.

372
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So, so it's a source of rivers and lakes.

373
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So where is I going with this?

374
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
So after this point, of course, you cross over and then you're going into

375
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
East Yorkshire, into the East part of the country and into Yorkshire.

376
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And then it's from there that you pick up after, after a very small area, I

377
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
think it's called Appleby, Westmoreland.

378
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Remember, we, we walked through a place called Appleby in Westmoreland.

379
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And you go through there.

380
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That was a very beautiful area.

381
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It was almost like a very Edenic, very, very Edenic kind of feel, very lush

382
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and green and full of apple blossoms and apple trees.

383
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And that was an interesting place as well.

384
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Because that had some resonance later, but I won't talk about that now.

385
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And then you join on to the beginning of the like wake walk.

386
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So I think you mentioned a little earlier, tell everyone about the like

387
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and the meanings of the words and how you.

388
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah.

389
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah.

390
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So the like wake walk, like, L, Y, K, E.

391
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So the like is the corpse itself.

392
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But another interpretation is the double, that which is a like to you,

393
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
that which is like you.

394
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But if you're departed and if you're, if you're departed.

395
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So in like in the Egyptian cosmology to call it that you have the cat or the mummy,

396
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the mummia, the body, the corpse, the like.

397
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And then above that you have the car and the car is like the ghost body.

398
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So the more closer to the ghost body, if you like, so it's the habitual body in

399
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
the herbalistic terminology, they would call it like the nefesh, the animal soul,

400
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
that which hangs around the body or hangs around the corpse.

401
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So if you were, say, for example, the like from the point of view of the nefesh or from the point of view of the car,

402
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:24,000
you would be separated from your physical body but close to it.

403
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So the like is your double, your doppelganger in some sense.

404
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And the wake is like in Irish, you know, in Irish ceremonies when you have somebody who's passed over,

405
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
they hold a wake.

406
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So the wake is, is the celebration of the person's life.

407
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And you usually have a good old knees up, you know, around the grave of the person.

408
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's quite often with the person physically present there in the room.

409
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So that's the traditional Irish style of having a wake, celebration of the person's life.

410
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Now, this is the like wake walk.

411
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It covers 40 miles.

412
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And this 40 mile expanse, which 40 miles in itself is obviously heavily symbolic as well,

413
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:22,000
because it's the number 40 is always linked with passengers of moving from one state to another.

414
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You have like 40 days and 40 nights in the biblical symbolism.

415
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You have quite often in quite a lot of Tibetan Buddhist internal work,

416
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:45,000
they have like 40 day passages through dark, through darkness, or should we say a 40, 40 day and 40 night passage through darkness,

417
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
just total darkness in some of their works.

418
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
With five days on either side.

419
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Right.

420
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
As like the lead in, then you have one moon, and then the string out.

421
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yes.

422
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Similar.

423
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's like a, it's a, it could be understood as a lifespan, even.

424
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm with you.

425
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Please continue.

426
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Yeah.

427
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah.

428
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I think, I think indeed, indeed.

429
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And so the, it was on this particular part of the walk, the, the like wake walk over this 40 mile expanse,

430
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:41,000
which, that's where I saw them, where I had my Milky Way experience, which was incredibly profound, incredibly significant for everything that followed.

431
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Say a little bit about the experience again, even though I'm sure you have previously.

432
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I did, but I can go a little more into granular detail this time.

433
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So, so it was the time of year.

434
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Let's see.

435
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It was the beginning of August, end of August, beginning of September.

436
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And this point in time was deliberately chosen because it wouldn't be too seringly hot.

437
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So it was the end of summer coming into, into autumn.

438
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So there was the weather was kind of quite temperate, but I do remember the entire walk up to this point had actually been quite, quite bloody hot actually, all through the Lake District and so on,

439
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,000
apart from maybe some misty and rainy days halfway through on the Pennine Ridge.

440
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So going onto lightweight walk, these incredibly blue, sonic blue sky.

441
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But the lightweight walk itself passes through this 40 mile expanse known as Winnie Moore.

442
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Now Winnie Moore is actually in Old English means the Wine Red Moore, Winnie Wine Red.

443
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So the Wine Red Winnie Moore.

444
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So you're passing through the Winnie Moore.

445
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So it's a form of abyss.

446
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's a type of abyssal symbolism.

447
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And what it actually I've later come to understand, what I've actually come to understand it means is that you're actually passing through the menstruation period of the goddess.

448
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Beautiful.

449
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Because the track takes you through the track of death.

450
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So it's very Scorpio laden.

451
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's very, very scorpionic, Scorpio symbolism, but it's all wine red.

452
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's like a menstruation period.

453
00:40:43,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Now this is interesting and it just dawned on me right now as I'm speaking that perhaps this is why and where the goddess symbolism came from that led me out of the dream which is really amazing how that's just dawned on me.

454
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So, truly, you know, I mean, some quite revelatory thoughts come to me even while speaking here now.

455
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
It's so beautiful.

456
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
This is what I'm hoping for, yes.

457
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah.

458
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And the actual track is laden with marker points, marker posts.

459
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And those marker posts are actually carved.

460
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I have a book with me.

461
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I'll show you some pictures.

462
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I'll try and find some pictures.

463
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Yes.

464
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The marker posts themselves are ancient pagan standing stones which mark the track.

465
00:41:48,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Some of them have been turned into some of them have been turned into crosses were carved into Celtic crosses.

466
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Here we go.

467
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But quite a few of them are still pagan standing stones.

468
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
This is, I don't know if you can see.

469
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yes.

470
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
This face, this face here.

471
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And some of them are just many as typical many as so over the 40 mile expanse the way you find your way is by spotting these stones on the hill ridges.

472
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
As you're walking along the track.

473
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And all of the heather, the reason why it's the wine red more is because all of the heather goes sonic purple red.

474
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So with the blue sky and the sonic purple red, the weather had been very much like this clear clear blue, sonic purple red and these standing stones marking the way along the way.

475
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Some of them are are actually goddess stones as well.

476
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
One of them is called fat Betty.

477
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So.

478
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So there we have it.

479
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
That's actually the destination of where it goes Raven scar.

480
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Right.

481
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So that's that's the where you actually stop Raven scar.

482
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And the actual emblem for the walking for the lightweight hand with a candle inside.

483
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Interestingly, I decided to light a candle before I actually started this interview.

484
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:47,000
So, so there you go a little bit more information there for you but it came across to me very much that the wine red more is that is actually the menstruation of the goddess.

485
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,000
That's crucially beautiful. We can return to this topic, but I want to keep on the thread that we're on.

486
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And I'm trying to carefully track that. So describe a little bit more about the experience.

487
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So I'm just going to say something briefly.

488
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Sure.

489
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:16,000
There was a phase before my own experience where I used to practice a sort of a Tai Chi Chi gum practice actually, where

490
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,000
basically my teacher had taught us to gather up the energy from the earth, bring it up into the body.

491
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Distributed up into the sky, right into the universe, and then draw the universal energy back down into our body and down into the earth.

492
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And basically just you lean over, you picked up the energy bent over you draw it up into your bodies with an in breath.

493
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You, you know, you send it up with an out breath, you draw it back with an in breath, you send it down with an out breath.

494
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Yeah, I added to that practice that I was drawing the love of the planet, all together, all the animals all the living places all the histories that love

495
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:17,000
energy, and then, you know, sort of like many branches of a tree, sending that love out into the universe, literally saying like we love you we remember you we adore you.

496
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And then the same thing back right we love you we remember you we adore you back into the earth. I used to do this all the time, without having any complex

497
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:37,000
interaction about it right. And when you talked about your experience with a milky way I was reminded of this was practice.

498
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Right.

499
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So please share whatever comes to mind about the experience.

500
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah, so it's been really hot. I remember during that day.

501
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:20,000
And there was a, I put up the tent in the middle of this more, and I chose to put the tent in a field at the side of an in. So it was like a pub an in in the middle of nowhere.

502
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And I went into the pub. And in those days I hardly used to drink at all I used to have like lime and soda something like that you know like I wasn't even drinking.

503
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I went into the pub and had a couple of these lime and sodas or whatever. And came back out to the tent. And I was shocked to find that after the sun had gone down that there was a there was a light frost on the ground.

504
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Because the moors out there were very exposed. And there was a couple of other things I learned at that time as well which taught me some really interesting things to do with the action of the sun upon the earth and interacting with the earth and the waters.

505
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Which actually led me to some really, really quite amazing understandings of the the entire process of nature.

506
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I was going to use the word, it taught me quite a lot of the secrets of alchemy, but that sounds really that sounds really grandiose, but I don't have to be too afraid of that.

507
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It truly did. And, and I'll explain a little more of that later, but that day the frost was on the ground.

508
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:14,000
That evening the frost was on the ground the temperature had dropped quite quite a lot. And because it was so cold, and because the sky was so clear and because there was no light pollution whatsoever.

509
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I looked at the frost crunch crunch crunch feet on the floor crunch crunch crunch.

510
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So my attention was diverted down by the crunching, and then I lifted my head up. I wanted to just instinctively wanted to know what was right above me.

511
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So crunching feet lifted up the head.

512
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
My my the trajectory of my vision literally caught from the very moment my head was lifted.

513
00:48:41,000 --> 00:49:00,000
The whole path of the Milky Way just shot up in front of me and above me all the way behind me and it felt like the entire thing from from right above me right through my feet just like the two things just collided and like like a huge bang.

514
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And this intense visceral feeling of absolute connectivity, like an explosion coming from within the core of me reaching out forever.

515
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Everything met in that moment.

516
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
So there was something really really special about it.

517
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
It was like yoga in the true sense of the word.

518
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
True Union.

519
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So beautiful.

520
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yeah, it was it was it really was touching for some reason to hear the story.

521
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yeah.

522
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Please continue.

523
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Ever since that time.

524
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I've not been able to comprehend anything as separate.

525
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
What a gift.

526
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
What a what a healing inversion.

527
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It also comes with a great price though it seems.

528
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Because the although that's a although that's a huge understanding in and of itself.

529
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And like you say could be seen to be a gift.

530
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
It's it's I think the I think the Buddhist would have called it.

531
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
You know, it leads to the vision of universal sorrow.

532
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:53,000
In the sense that although you you understand the pure joy that's behind everything you can see and sense and this is what led me to that sorrow when I came back to the city.

533
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
There was this understanding that everyone is so disconnected from that reality.

534
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And that such great pain and suffering results because of the lack of understanding of the connectivity.

535
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And I understood that all healing is rooted in bringing people back to that sense of connectivity.

536
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Yes, and thus, in some sense, perhaps you will understand I'd be surprised if you didn't what I mean when I say, I'll try.

537
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I doubt you'll have any trouble.

538
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Many of my closest friends, these are people who I would call bridge bridge souls, right they join, they join to ordinarily disparate.

539
00:51:44,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I'm looking at my reflection it's backwards so my miss using the wrong app. But yeah, they join to ordinarily disparate people's places, histories, futures.

540
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So for example, one of my friends, Ryan first diver, he's a Blackfoot beaver man.

541
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And he's so in the Blackfoot traditional in their in their traditional life, the beaver man is the central ceremonial.

542
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
All the all the other societies orbit the beaver bundle tradition.

543
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And so he's, and he's half, you know, he's half Caucasian to so.

544
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So he joins like the colonizers and the Blackfoot people. He also takes care of rattlesnakes there so they are protected there.

545
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:56,000
So he joins the snake people to the to the regular people he's like this bridge between five or six different things I just use him as an example because he's a great example of this, but many of my close friends are like this there.

546
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:07,000
They're the between, right, even when you're telling the story you're saying like the sky came down and the earth, and they, you know, they joined, right.

547
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Yeah.

548
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So it's a, but say more about.

549
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Was it painful for you.

550
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
In, in what time what respect.

551
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Right.

552
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You say that you weren't able to see things as separate. And I say that's a gift and you say yes but there's a price. Yes, it seems there is a price and the price have bite in you.

553
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It can do it can do because because sometimes, you know, if sometimes you you can't.

554
00:53:45,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It's what it's quite, it's quite difficult to sometimes see the disconnection the lack of connectivity I think is the way to put it with with certain individuals that you know it's quite painful to see the lack of connectivity that they actually have.

555
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:14,000
You can, there's nothing you can do the only thing you can do is do things in an incredibly subtle way to help coax people towards this experience or this understanding.

556
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So that brings up a topic that I think you'll that I think is relevant here. Yeah, literally, and as it relates to human communication in general.

557
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Yes.

558
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
The common difference between men and women.

559
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Yeah.

560
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And hypnosis and LP, perhaps mesmerism, but certainly the idea of suggestion, which is something. This is a topic we didn't properly explore previously.

561
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
One of my bookmarks so I've noticed.

562
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I've always tended to emulate girls.

563
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:04,000
When I was in elementary school, they were the high performers, they could do seven things the boys could do to I emulate the girls, right.

564
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And I learned very quickly that that was a much faster path to progress.

565
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And the women are masters of indirection, generally speaking, right. They can suggest very subtly something. They're very cautious about making direct statements because they can then be held the task board later.

566
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And then historically subjected to masculine inquisition.

567
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Every like a billion times per lifetime right every woman, right.

568
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Masculine in inquisition.

569
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
You know.

570
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So,

571
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
where am I going with this.

572
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I myself have realized.

573
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
We spoke briefly of this in the last interview, but there are problems with declarative statements.

574
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And what you were saying was essentially what you can do has to be very subtle.

575
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:15,000
By which you mean indirect and suggestive rather than the typical masculine thing is just to go like, well, of course you just do this.

576
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You just tell them, here's the problem. Here's the solution. Right. The guy, you know, what brings out his toolbox.

577
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You know, when and often doesn't.

578
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:37,000
There's no subtlety whatsoever. And there's also no sensitivity to the other person's sort of where they are in the process.

579
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:43,000
What might be appropriate at this moment or in that in the phase of the process that they're in.

580
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Yeah. Yeah.

581
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
So yeah, please.

582
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Anything comes to mind about this.

583
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Well, once again.

584
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I mean, there's two things, obviously there's the therapeutic approaches, there's the actual use of these things for therapy within a therapeutic setting, which is one thing.

585
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And then there's the things that we encounter and the things we experience in daily, everyday life in terms of how we what we see around us, the types of interactions you see amongst people, you know, friends that you may have and so on and so on.

586
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And just generally, I mean, like you say, you've studied language patterns and so on and so forth.

587
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:47,000
It's amazing how I think I think NLP just to talk about that for a moment that really highlighted.

588
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You know, the old saying the map is not the territory.

589
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It's kind of what I'm talking about that disconnect that some individuals have between what's going on in their own minds and how they choose to communicate those ideas and such things, simple things as the art of conversation and so on.

590
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:23,000
It seems, I don't know if I'm right or wrong by saying this, but I've noticed a marked increase.

591
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I'd be interested in your opinion on this, a marked increase in a kind of almost a fragmentation of the ability to communicate in a meaningful manner, in a way whereby individuals can actually have meaningful conversations,

592
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,000
where people have the ability to listen and have the ability to speak and be heard.

593
00:58:46,000 --> 00:59:02,000
These, this cross flow, this dance, which seemed to be so much part of everyday life seems to be becoming rarer and rarer, I would say in the last three or four years.

594
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And I don't know if that's experiencing this.

595
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Yeah, there's some kind of a, you know, my friend was using the phrase positive disintegration.

596
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Right.

597
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I'm not sure it's positive. There's certainly a disintegration going on.

598
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
And I would, you know, we can talk about this.

599
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I want to be careful to preserve the threads.

600
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I, so one of the things I pay attention to is a neologism that occurred to me at the beginning of my experience of whatever it was I experience was where I imagined the network of human minds as an as a place as a physical environment.

601
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And I call that the human cognizium.

602
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
There are cognizia all around us that feed into ours.

603
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:11,000
But the human cognizium is undergoing a series of what look like catastrophic fragmentations to me.

604
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah.

605
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And that's being reflected in dissonance in human communication, and particularly in our perceptions related. I mean, this is kind of a running joke at the moment, but in our perceptions related to identity.

606
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Right.

607
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Someone is what something is why it's function.

608
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And I was talking with a friend last night, and we often have very playful, revelatory conversations.

609
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And I suggested to him that without us knowing it over the past few years, the world is no longer the world.

610
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Like it's a completely different thing.

611
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Now, it looks the same on the outside.

612
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It seems to be, we all think it's the same thing, but it's not that thing anymore. It's a different thing.

613
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:17,000
And so we were sort of playfully, I was suggesting that we could experiment by sending signals to the world, like pinging it, like in a submarine, right?

614
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:27,000
When you ping another submarine, you could ping the world and see what it brings back so that you could get a sense of what whatever it has become or what it is becoming.

615
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Yeah.

616
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Well, I think that that's to some extent what we're kind of doing now is.

617
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Yes, yes.

618
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:56,000
The part of the thing that's certainly driving me on to speak about these things and maybe driving you on to speak about these things is because it feels like an important time to speak of these things in a way where one hopes others are going to be giving us some feedback with

619
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
regards to what's going on.

620
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Yes, drawn into the conversation and fascinated and curious and have a sense of wonder and exploration with us.

621
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Absolutely.

622
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Yes, yes.

623
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:15,000
As if maybe we are, what, I can't quite find the word.

624
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:23,000
It's strange because in a way you can, I imagine something actually this, I don't know why but it's bringing, it makes me feel tearful.

625
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I imagine two magicians, not that I'm claiming to be one or that you claim to be one, but I imagine two magicians playfully getting together on stage.

626
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:47,000
And embodying the curiosity and passion and life paths of the audience without the magicians themselves knowing it, right?

627
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:58,000
And then engaging in this play on the stage that enlightens the magicians as the avatars of the audience, something like this, right?

628
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And what a beautiful, what a beautiful, like ecstatic figure.

629
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Thank you.

630
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Yeah, absolutely.

631
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
And I feel that we're at a very, very interesting time.

632
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Most definitely certainly a very, very interesting time because I think I'm not sure if I remember, if I actually said this to you last time or whether I said it to you in private on another occasion, but I really feel like we're at a really, really important point in terms of this communication we're speaking about.

633
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Yes.

634
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Communicating ideas. There's something really quite important about this type of work, you know, sharing these things that we're doing right now. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

635
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:54,000
You know, I'm sure you wouldn't be here either doing what you're doing if you didn't feel this, this same, almost a duty to be speaking.

636
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Emergency.

637
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Literally, it's an emerge and see, right? It's an emerge and see.

638
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Right.

639
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Emergency.

640
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yes.

641
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Yes.

642
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And yes, it is. It does seem very urgent and very, there are many people who are, they are dying inside. They're, they're completely lost, you know, and I'm not entirely free of that myself.

643
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Right.

644
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I think all of us are to some extent, you know, experiencing the hardships of the age that we're living with it. That's for sure.

645
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Yes.

646
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I think many would be very, would possibly be foolish to say they're not, but at the same time, I think it's a really, really, a really incredibly hopeful time.

647
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:55,000
There's a time where some, some incredible new points. There's a type of regeneration that seems to be taking place at the moment.

648
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And I feel a new opening for these types of explorations in a way that I've never quite seen to this extent before.

649
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I really do. I really feel like we're, we're on without claiming to be in any sense, you know, grandiose or an expert on these subjects. I'd just say, very happy to be part of opening the conversation.

650
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Yes, I agree. And I don't, I mean, one of the things that I'm learning more about that it's been clear to me as an artist for a long time is that personal identity is kind of a trap.

651
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Right.

652
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:46,000
So, the, the, yes, I understand. Obviously, I have some concern about Darren and his life and his whatever, right? His opportunities and so forth.

653
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:53,000
But it's much more fascinating at the layers above Darren and beneath Darren. Yeah, yeah.

654
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
They're together. Right. Yeah.

655
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:11,000
You know, something very strange is going on. I made a recording recently where I, where I said, I think the recording is just called 2024 is not a year.

656
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It's like, there's no more of whatever the hell was going on before has been thrown up into the suspended sort of cloud storm state, and nobody understands what the hell is going on anymore.

657
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Or if they do, it's just because they're clinging to the teddy bear of their previous suppositions about the world like desperately.

658
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:48,000
But yeah, it really is something profound because on the one hand, there's all these new opportunities. And on the other hand, there's this catastrophic and agonic, you know, dissolution and pain and death.

659
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So yeah, I don't want to use the trope from Shakespeare. So I'll just suggest that without saying it.

660
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Okay, so there's so much more. And by the way, how are we doing on time? I'm fine, but I want to I'm okay. I'm okay for for time at the moment as well. Yeah.

661
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I think I'm excited to continue.

662
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So.

663
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Okay, so what happened that night, the frost.

664
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
You look up the thing the whole thing. Yeah, yeah, as I explained.

665
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
What was I feeling at that moment?

666
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:33,000
What was I feeling? As I say, just just this incredible, energetic connectivity.

667
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And, and I felt like I was touching eternity, quite literally like touching eternity.

668
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And that experience, strangely, I had.

669
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I kind of discovered how to switch it back on at will.

670
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Oh, beautiful.

671
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
But this came much later.

672
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Whenever I did switch it on at will, it reminded me immediately of that moment once again, you know, so like immediate recognition of that experience.

673
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So that what I'm referring to is, and this touches on the courses that I do and things like this back here in England, I do them elsewhere occasionally if people ask me as well but

674
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
they're very important about those.

675
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah, yeah, so like I, I do.

676
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Every year, I try to do one, maybe two courses in usually they're advertised as mesmerism fascination presence.

677
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I mean, this is how you and I connected.

678
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Yeah, good.

679
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I think I said on part part one of this that it was about about nine years ago or so that we actually first connected but I think it was more than that was

680
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I think it was more like 12 actually I started doing I started doing those courses about 12 years ago now.

681
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Mesmerism fascination presence so obviously the thing I do sort of every year is hold these courses mesmerism is a for those who don't know is a type of hypnosis is an earlier type of hypnosis more of

682
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:30,000
a nonverbal form of hypnosis.

683
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And it was popularized by France on Tom Mesmer, hence the term mesmerism.

684
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
When was he active.

685
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Yeah, so this was sort of in the in the 1700s so mid 1700s.

686
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And it was just prior to the French Revolution actually he was around just prior to the French Revolution doing a lot of his work.

687
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
He was connected with some quite interesting people.

688
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:12,000
I don't know if you know this but he was he had his a thing called the glass almonica, which was an actual instrument.

689
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yes, I know about this instrument.

690
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And the classical piece of music Moonlight Sonata was written for this instrument.

691
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Yeah, so what this is is it's a series of rings glass.

692
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Yeah, it's like a it's like a plate with a with a ring around the edge of the plate to sort of, and these are put on a spindle.

693
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And it's a call it's a cone.

694
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Yes, perhaps there are either pedals or keys pedals.

695
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Yeah, pedals and then and then a little tray of water to dip your fingertips in that you can actually rub on to the.

696
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Okay.

697
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yeah, so the spindle spins and you get the sound that's like what you get when you circle a crystal bell or glass.

698
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Precisely, precisely.

699
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Yes, profoundly non ordinary sound.

700
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Absolutely.

701
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
It's like a harmonic.

702
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:21,000
It's almost like being able to play an instrument that only produces harmonics, which themselves are kind of a magical thing.

703
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Absolutely.

704
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And so and so like I say Moonlight Sonata was composed with this instrument in mind.

705
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And then and then Benjamin Franklin actually gifted this instrument he had one made and gifted it to Mesma.

706
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Oh, wow.

707
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Yeah, there's one in London actually there's there's a Franklin Museum I think in London and there's an example of it there.

708
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I've never seen one.

709
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Have you seen one?

710
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

711
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Like I say, there's actually been one.

712
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
There's one on display there in London, or there was some years ago.

713
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I spent a long, long time since I've seen it, but there was there was actually a model of it.

714
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I don't want to branch, but I'm curious.

715
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Have you ever been in a place where one is being played?

716
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I haven't heard one being played.

717
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I have to say no, no.

718
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
But you have heard recordings of them.

719
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Oh, yes, for sure.

720
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Me too.

721
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I remember this and just being blown away and thinking like I must find a way to have one of these when I first heard it.

722
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Yeah.

723
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Well, the thing is, is the actual tones themselves.

724
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Mesma believed that the tones themselves catapulted the individuals who heard them because of the tones actually activated certain states or trans states in themselves.

725
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Yeah.

726
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
The tones themselves activated some of these states.

727
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So, so that's interesting.

728
01:12:51,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Yes, I have a sort of peculiar personal sensitivity to anything that produces a non ordinary effect or, you know, like in terms of Stephen King's book like the shining.

729
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Certain features are facets of reality.

730
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
They don't. It's not like a visual shine.

731
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
There's like a spiritual shine to them.

732
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
They resonate.

733
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
They ring.

734
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Right.

735
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
You can tell like, oh, here's one of the hidden keys.

736
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Yeah.

737
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And two very obvious features of this for me that were apparent in childhood were spiders and they make what they're making of webs.

738
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Right.

739
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Just watch them make what is going on there.

740
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:41,000
There's some that's you could study just that one thing and it would lead you everywhere you needed to go.

741
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Right.

742
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's like a master key to every library hidden in an organism.

743
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Yes.

744
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And then similarly, another place where a similar key is hidden, a living key is in the praying mantises.

745
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Ah, yes.

746
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I've noticed you're particularly keen on mantises.

747
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
But let's not branch too far.

748
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
So what were met?

749
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,000
What were the precursors that led Mesmer to his discoveries?

750
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Do you think?

751
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Right.

752
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Okay.

753
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:30,000
So when Mesmer was, um, I think when Mesmer's career was just beginning, when he was first, he was first introduced to the concept of magnetism from a priest.

754
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I forget the name of the priest.

755
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Fair enough.

756
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Um, but he introduced him the concept of magnetism and he utilised actual magnets.

757
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Wow.

758
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
On different points of the body.

759
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Uh-huh.

760
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Though some esoteric priests have actually done this and used this therapy in different ways.

761
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But of course you and I both know that the power isn't necessarily in the magnets, is it?

762
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
No.

763
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Okay, please continue.

764
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Yeah.

765
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:22,000
So Mesmer himself, um, you know, quickly jumped the use of the magnets and, uh, sort of really concentrated more on the natural ability that we all have as individuals.

766
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:31,000
They call it animal magnetism because of the fact that the animal kingdom exhibits this force in abundance.

767
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,000
But we humans kind of don't seem to believe we have it, but clearly we do.

768
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And certain individuals seem to have had it in historical epochs, perhaps more than others.

769
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:53,000
And there are famous examples of this.

770
01:15:53,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And so, you know, some people, they thought of it as charisma or something like this, um, which itself, you know, the word charisma relates to the golden anointing.

771
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So, uh, so, so this force is something all individuals have at different levels.

772
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
So it's a natural ability, natural ability.

773
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I would suggest that, um, if you wanted to see a clear example of it that's commonly accessible, the gaze of infants.

774
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh, yes.

775
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Right.

776
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

777
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I think they're actually surprised.

778
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I think the infants can be surprised when it fails.

779
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Right.

780
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Right.

781
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Because they know, they seem to know that it works.

782
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:55,000
But yes, match gaze with an infant or a very young child, and you will see directly an example of the kind of thing I think you're talking about.

783
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
And I would also suggest that praying mantises are doing something very similar.

784
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Right.

785
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:09,000
There's a reason why a creature this big can terrify a grizzly bear.

786
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Right.

787
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Right.

788
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
And then it's screaming for the woods, you know.

789
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Right, right.

790
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
It's not an accident and it's not just a visual display.

791
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Yeah.

792
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Yeah.

793
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Please continue.

794
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

795
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
So, um, so basically, uh, where was I going with this?

796
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Well, you said that certain people were clearly more so.

797
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Animal magnetism, the humans don't necessarily believe they have it, but we do.

798
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And some people either have sort of a greater capacity and or develop it.

799
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Right.

800
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Yeah.

801
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
So, so it's something that is, is there in abundance in the animal kingdom.

802
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I was talking about the example of snakes on the previous part we were doing, you know, and basically it's not just.

803
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Not just the vision, not just the gaze that they exert, but it's also everything else.

804
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It's the actual awareness of the physicality of their existence in this present moment.

805
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So this is where we link back to the Milky Way experience because the key component is the physical presence.

806
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:35,000
The key component that empowers all of those other techniques is the physical moment by moment awareness of your existence or of each one of our existence.

807
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:51,000
So by contacting that, we generate through the conscious awareness of our physical existence, we generate a kind of a field and we, and we switch it on.

808
01:18:51,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And that experience that I had with the heavens and the earth and me sandwiched or hit between them was very much a moment where crunching of the feet, the stars above my head, me between the biting of the chill of the air on what had been a really hot day.

809
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Yeah.

810
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
It's like a rod ringing.

811
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Yes.

812
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Yes.

813
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:23,000
It's, it's the origin world and the physical earth.

814
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Yes.

815
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Eating and sort of mating and resonating.

816
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yeah.

817
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Yes.

818
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Absolutely.

819
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Absolutely.

820
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
So I was talking about the alchemical components of this.

821
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And of course the actual earth that I was walking upon at that particular point in the path was pure Pete.

822
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:57,000
So the Moorlands have the blackest Pete I've ever seen in my life.

823
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And like I say, even at certain other points like the Pennine Ridge, you'd be walking on the Pete on that particular part of the walk.

824
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:19,000
You'd be walking upon the Pete and the black soil of the Pete, which the Egyptians used to call chem, by the way.

825
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
So chem, K-H-E-M.

826
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Which chemet comes from.

827
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Which chemet comes from.

828
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:36,000
So it was the actual residue cast up from the Nile over and over again would bring all of this fertile Pete onto the surface or the silt.

829
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
So that would be the thing that would give the fertility and bring the fertility to the land.

830
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And of course the likewise.

831
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Almost like a menstrual exudate of the river.

832
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Yes.

833
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Yes.

834
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Yes.

835
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Exactly this.

836
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Exactly this.

837
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Exactly this.

838
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:05,000
So you have the Nile delta with this, you say, you know, with this exudate coming out and fertilizing all of the land around it.

839
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Oh my God.

840
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
We're starting to get all Egyptian again here.

841
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yeah.

842
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
We're talking about this fragmentation.

843
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:21,000
And of course the fragmentation and the whole art of healing is to bring back together that which is scattered.

844
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:30,000
So the body of Osiris, of course, represents like all the shamanic myths, you know, the body is scattered to the four winds, so to speak.

845
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And Isis was the one that got the separation from the land, turned herself into the hawk, looked down upon the land and discovered the fragments scattered across the land and brought them back together again to actually make the first mummy, which was the resurrection of Osiris from the world of the dead.

846
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It strikes me that the Eye of Toth is actually related to the Eye of the Kestrel.

847
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Right.

848
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Little hawk.

849
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
The Desert hawk.

850
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Right.

851
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Which you can't really see it, but this image is an image, a very complex magical image of Kestrel.

852
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Inside the frame behind you.

853
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Yes.

854
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Yes.

855
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:37,000
It also implies rising above the human or even the temporal, right, into the what might, what Oman Hillman calls the aonic life.

856
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Right.

857
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It's not just outside of location in space. It's outside of location in time. And from there, you can find all the pieces.

858
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Yeah.

859
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Speak.

860
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And again, now here again, we have this concept of the bridge being.

861
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Absolutely.

862
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:13,000
The bridge being who becomes sort of a linchpin above all of these fragments, linking them together and then perhaps drawing them back down into a being, a situation, a place, the healing.

863
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Please continue.

864
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Well, exactly.

865
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:26,000
What are my big questions today was basically, okay, so what is healing anyway, in its truest sense, you know, we can have some

866
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:38,000
fairly simple examples like, oh, you know, you want to heal bad eyesight, you want to heal, I don't know, a throat condition or something like that.

867
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
We've got these small examples of healing.

868
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:55,000
But of course, the healing we're, we're speaking of really when we're speaking of sacred healing is we're talking about like, it's an overused term, but you know, making something, bringing the holism, bringing the, the bringing

869
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
something back to a sense of holiness.

870
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
There is also a feature of an amnesis.

871
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
You're right.

872
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Yes.

873
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Forgetting.

874
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Yes.

875
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,000
No, not everyone knows this, but the word lethal that comes from the River Lefe.

876
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Right.

877
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Yes, in between our lives. And there's, there's a bunch of sort of narratological arcs around why we here on earth forget our previous incarnations or perhaps embodiments.

878
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:51,000
So yes, there's an unforgettable aspect, because it's weird, you know, it's almost as if in some of us in some features of our lives, we specifically bury some part of us that is fragmented by a situation.

879
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And then we enact a drama.

880
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Personally, a personal drama, I have done this right, it's embarrassing, but I know I'm aware of it.

881
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
We humans are sometimes embarrassing.

882
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
It's true.

883
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:16,000
So I will enact a drama about the part of myself that I dissociated from and hid from.

884
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And the drama is very mythic.

885
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Yeah.

886
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Yeah.

887
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
In transactional analysis.

888
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
There's a concept of life scripts.

889
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Yeah.

890
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Right, which, which are coping mechanisms often established in childhood that are useful, sort of fairy tale ish. Right.

891
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:50,000
But when they are not conscious in our adult lives when when they're no longer really necessary and we have the capacity to negotiate and work with what's actually going on.

892
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:56,000
It's helpful for us to make conscious this life script, this mythic story that we've been playing out.

893
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:02,000
And perhaps rewrite it.

894
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Yeah.

895
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And the thing is, of course, you know, if we go into the much, much bigger wider, wider picture, you know, I mean, I've said and this leads on to a lot of the things I was going to say about the the hill.

896
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:32,000
I was talking about it all points to and leads to many details, which confirmed for me in various ways.

897
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:41,000
The threads, the connective threads to actually weave me back to my previous incarnations, so to speak.

898
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
And this is where this becomes really important.

899
01:26:45,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And this is where I gain this peace and faith, for want of a better word, of this process that whenever I receive any of these pieces, whenever I receive any of these fragments,

900
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I don't worry about chasing them, because I know, I absolutely know that all I have to do is wait.

901
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Because there's going to be a time where, like I said with the individual that I met over a coffee table who told me the name I knew with certainty, I wasn't even looking for it.

902
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I knew with certainty that this was the name and I knew at that moment that all I have to do is call on that name.

903
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:46,000
And I didn't chase it.

904
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:57,000
And all these little fragments that I've parked on the shelf and just bookmarked them, put them on the shelf and waited.

905
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:20,000
What it is, is it's all the fragments that I know, that as long as I keep myself open to all of these possibilities, that everything that is, that belongs to my trajectory, my journey through time and eternity, is all going to come to me.

906
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I don't think the purpose of our current incarnation is necessarily to chase after all of these missing fragments, but they play a really important part and they will come to us anyway.

907
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:56,000
So sometimes I might wake up and be woken up by a repeat, I will be repeating to myself a specific set of words or a specific word.

908
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:03,000
And sometimes it's not even, it's in a language I don't even know what it is.

909
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:10,000
The important thing is, is that I remember it, I write it down and it sticks with me.

910
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,000
The other important thing about these things is because they're explained later.

911
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And sometimes each one of these phrases and words are like a key that opens up a whole insight into another area.

912
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:32,000
But sometimes it takes five, seven years before I get the next part.

913
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:39,000
So I'm just sharing with you how for me these things work.

914
01:29:39,000 --> 01:30:01,000
These little fragments which seem to belong to a, I'm sort of lost for words, but like a kind of fragmenting, fragments of like a weaving tapestry that belongs to many other incarnations that have existed from times before.

915
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:09,000
So there's a, there's a, what a figure that perhaps might be useful or helpful here.

916
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Yeah, call it the starry blanket.

917
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:23,000
And one can imagine that over time, many lives, they are sewing in a sense in the sense of like needlework.

918
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:32,000
They're sewing a sort of a celestial blanket with acts of beauty and intelligence and courage and rescue and healing.

919
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:38,000
And that our souls are actually drawn from stars in this blanket. Many of them, right?

920
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:47,000
So our soul isn't one thing. It's like a set of connections between historical beings and places and moments and such.

921
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
And then as we live, we are adding to this blanket, right?

922
01:30:51,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And it might seem fragmentary from down here where the star and that star and the moon and that planet and so forth.

923
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
But from up there, it's not fragmentary.

924
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
No, no.

925
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
It's fragmentary because of our relationship with linear time, I think primarily.

926
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:15,000
That's right. That's right. Absolutely right. Yeah, because of our relationship with linear time.

927
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
This is the thing that you doubt.

928
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Yes, yes.

929
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
You learn to doubt, right?

930
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:32,000
And that's why you're not concerned with urgencies when you find the fragment, you place it on the shelf, you know linear time is an illusion.

931
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
That's it.

932
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:41,000
So over you'll you will traverse the illusion of linear time and the integration will naturally.

933
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:47,000
That's it. That's it. I couldn't I couldn't have put it better myself.

934
01:31:47,000 --> 01:32:01,000
But you've put into words what I kind of viscerally feel because it is a feeling, you know, it's a feeling that there is no need to, you know, there is no need to be too concerned.

935
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:13,000
About it. Although like we said earlier, there is a certain there is a feeling of a sense of urgency right now in in some of the things we're discussing and communicating and sharing.

936
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I understand your point of view on that.

937
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:23,000
But for me personally, in relation to these experiences.

938
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:40,000
It comes across to me personally in very much a way where it's like, right, okay, okay, I'm just getting another little, little bit of confirmation of my want of a better word.

939
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:49,000
My connection with eternity.

940
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I mean, connection is not essentially, it's more your identity as in eternity.

941
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Yeah, yeah, like you and eternity are the same thing, even though there's the Milky Way, and there's Lee.

942
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
It's true for all of us.

943
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Yes, it is. But you and it's so profound because when, like, in our conversation now, you have to disparate sort of wanderers right and they both had these long paths but when they come together there's this profound

944
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
conversation.

945
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Which is a kind of a musical composition.

946
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:54,000
The language, the spoken language of which is in a sense the least important thing, even though it's the, it's, it's the glass harmonica of our souls, sort of resonating back and forth.

947
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Yes, yes.

948
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I want to return to something you were speaking about earlier unless there's something urgently in that you need to share right now.

949
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
No, no, please, please go ahead.

950
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Okay, so what is the gaze.

951
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Yeah, we've been taught and I'm sure you'll, you'll have some things to add here but I want to introduce this topic.

952
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:32,000
We've been taught that that what we see is passive, right, that our eyes are receptors for light, that all that's happening in vision is that we receive the reflected light of things around us and the brain organizes that into a

953
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:45,000
sort of a picture in consciousness right it flips it over on the back the retina we know we have the scientific explanation of the mechanics of human vision.

954
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
So for most of human history.

955
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:54,000
None of that was what was being understood the Greeks were absolutely aware.

956
01:34:54,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And I can't explain the complexities of their awareness and understanding of this fact, but that that the eyes project.

957
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Participatory.

958
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Just as in just as when you speak, my ear rings, and I hear something very similar is happening with vision it is kind of a, a speaking of energies into the world, which then press and touch in their various intentional ways.

959
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:46,000
The power, or the cloud, or the ball, and then this returns the, the, the, the sort of resonance of how we reached out to touch, and the purposes for which we reached out to touch affect the world, and this effect returns to us as vision.

960
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Now, yes, say one more thing before I hand this over to you because I'm desperately curious about what you think about these things.

961
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I've had the experience of waking up in my bed, looking around my room, seeing how things are laid out my girlfriend next to me on the bed, the shape of her hair on the pillow and so forth.

962
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:12,000
And then realizing that my eyes are closed.

963
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Yeah, yeah, and opening my eyes and having nothing effectively changed except a feature of the feeling of the origin of the seeing.

964
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Yes, yes.

965
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
So it's very clear to me that it is possible to see without eyes.

966
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Yes.

967
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Now, I'll hand this over to you and whatever.

968
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Yeah, I'd love to get it.

969
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Yes, yes.

970
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Well, if we refer back to part one of the conversation we had last time, we were talking about the sun, you know, and we were talking about where is the sun.

971
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
You know, we can point to it in the sky and all of this sort of stuff.

972
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
And yeah, there's the sun and the rest of it.

973
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:58,000
But like we were talking about seeing the sun in dreams, feeling the sun upon your skin in dreams and so on.

974
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And where is the sun in a dream?

975
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
You know, it's like, where is it?

976
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Where is the sun you actually see?

977
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Where is it?

978
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
You know, where is it?

979
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Also, the whole notion of the heliocentric theory and the geocentric theory, you know, is the Earth in the center?

980
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Does one go around the other or is it the other going around the other?

981
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Well, yes, both are true.

982
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
And so we're back to that old quandary again.

983
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:37,000
And what you've just been describing is I'll bring your attention to a very strong symbol that many may be aware of or may have seen.

984
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:42,000
And that's the image of some of the images of Akhenaten.

985
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:58,000
So you have that famous image of Akhenaten, sometimes with the Arten itself, the sun, his version of Ra, or the solar god, the Arten, with its various rays with hands on the end.

986
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Each ray has got a hand on the end.

987
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Oh yes, yes, yes, the sun and then the rays.

988
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
The rays with hands.

989
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
The rays with hands.

990
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
The ray has like a hand.

991
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Hand on the end, yeah.

992
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
It's sort of like this or something, right?

993
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
If I remember correctly.

994
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Yeah, that's right.

995
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:25,000
So it's a sun with a splay of different rays and each ray has got a hand on the end of each ray.

996
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:41,000
And sometimes you see, I've seen images of Akhenaten and Nefertiti with rays coming, literally coming out of their eyes, like similar, you know, like rays jutting out of their eyes.

997
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:54,000
So this touches on a lot of the things you're speaking about in regards to

998
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Is the manifest and does the manifestation come from within out?

999
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Is it that light which reaches out into space only forms images when it has something, you know, when it has something to bounce off.

1000
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:22,000
In the same way as the sun sends out rays to say, for example, the moon and the moon gives the reflection of the light.

1001
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Everything we see from the old perspective, you were mentioning the Greeks, but also the Egyptians, there was this notion that everything that was projected from within out, so to speak.

1002
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
You have an image here.

1003
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Yes.

1004
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
That's it.

1005
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Of Nefertiti and Akhenaten.

1006
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:57,000
And the, yeah, so you have the the art in with all of the rays coming out and you can't see it too well but on the ends of those rays, you have each one of the rays has got a hand on the end.

1007
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Yeah, and she's got a child in her lap.

1008
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
That's right.

1009
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Yeah.

1010
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
That's right.

1011
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Very peculiar.

1012
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Yes.

1013
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Very profound.

1014
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Absolutely.

1015
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Okay, so I didn't mean to interrupt.

1016
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:21,000
So with the gaze itself, all of these things you're talking about come into play.

1017
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:36,000
The gaze is not a, if the one who is practicing can truly step inside this, this way that you've just described, this particular perspective, for one's better word.

1018
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:49,000
If the practitioner can step inside that and then experience that, then there is the opportunity for that to take place.

1019
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Oh, there's so much here.

1020
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
The recipient would be the passive one.

1021
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Yes, but it's also resembles the relation where, okay, this is just something that's occurring to me.

1022
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:13,000
If the practitioner becomes the point of origin, not the sun as hypostasis, but the origin of why there is a sun.

1023
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Right.

1024
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Right.

1025
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And then the patient, so to speak, becomes sort of like the earth or something illumined.

1026
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Or the moon.

1027
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Yes, exactly.

1028
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Precisely.

1029
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Illumined by that.

1030
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:39,000
And so this ancient, originary role, not a play, but a role embodiment.

1031
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Yeah.

1032
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Right.

1033
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Sort of naturally and in a way, magnetically.

1034
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Yes.

1035
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Yes.

1036
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Because of the ancientness of these roles.

1037
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Yes.

1038
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Please continue.

1039
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Well, yes.

1040
01:41:53,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I mean, what you were saying about, you know, one being literally like a sun, the other being like a moon.

1041
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:08,000
You literally create that polarity between the practitioner and the subject.

1042
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
There has to be that polarity created.

1043
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:20,000
And it has to be something which is done in a very, I keep using the word in a very visceral manner.

1044
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So when an animal is exuding this force, like a snake, for example, or a lion or something like this or some other beast, it's actually, it's actually doing it usually with the intention of it being almost like it's going to catch its prey, so to speak.

1045
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:49,000
It has to find a way to, in a sense.

1046
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I'm trying.

1047
01:42:50,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I'm not very, very good at finding words today, but in a sense, it literally plummets that the recipient into a complete trance just for a moment often.

1048
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:15,000
And it's that, that state that the recipient falls into that the hunter, so to speak, uses to its advantage.

1049
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Okay, I want to say a few things here briefly.

1050
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:33,000
In nature, those of us who are sensitive to sentience, consciousness, awareness, intelligence, particularly, we'll see different forms of intelligences embodied in nature.

1051
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:45,000
For example, in the eyes of a cow, it's not the same as looking in the eyes of a raccoon, or it's not the same as looking in the eye of a praying mantis, it's not the same as looking in the eye of a cat.

1052
01:43:45,000 --> 01:44:04,000
The snake's eye is a very particular thing, but one of the best examples of what you're talking about is utilized, because it's really obviously a human can easily see it on film, is what a cuttlefish does when it is hypnotizing a shrimp.

1053
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I see pulses of colorful light traversing the skin of the cuttlefish in an increasing frequency, and you see the shrimp actually start to just sort of float off and then, you know, and then when he grabs it, right?

1054
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:31,000
For the praying mantis, what it does is this kind of thing.

1055
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:37,000
It will weave slowly, and then very rapidly, and then strike.

1056
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
That's it, just like a snake.

1057
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
It's very similar.

1058
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
There are forms of martial art that are not the similar.

1059
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
That's right.

1060
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:51,000
In martial art, the goal is to hide the, it's to hide the build up, right?

1061
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
You don't want the build up to be seen.

1062
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
So the build up becomes internal.

1063
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Right, right.

1064
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Like you say, visceral.

1065
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Please continue.

1066
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Yeah, this is right.

1067
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:14,000
And when the individual is practicing with fascination techniques, the gaze techniques, it's very subtle.

1068
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:25,000
This is something, obviously, if I was working with someone directly and teaching them, teaching them exactly how to do this, there is a certain way to do it.

1069
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,000
And so often you have to demonstrate it on the person you're trying to teach, of course.

1070
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:36,000
You know, you have to demonstrate it directly to them so that they actually grasp what it is you're actually doing.

1071
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Once they've been on the sort of recipient end of it, then it's my job to actually get that individual to replicate that effectively.

1072
01:45:47,000 --> 01:46:02,000
So I would then coach that individual into how to actually replicate that properly and teach them all the little tips on what to look for, precisely what to look for, to know that it's being done properly.

1073
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:08,000
And that's the important thing, is teaching them exactly what to look for.

1074
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Because there are certain signs that it's being done properly.

1075
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Yes.

1076
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Unmistakable, you might say.

1077
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Uh-huh.

1078
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:25,000
It's different from hypnosis, but there are signs also in the client in hypnosis.

1079
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Yes.

1080
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Yes, this is very true.

1081
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Often you can see the pulse in someone's neck.

1082
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
You can see it slow.

1083
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
You can see the relaxation of the facial muscles.

1084
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:41,000
You can detect the shoulders may drop slightly.

1085
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
The breathing changes.

1086
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:50,000
These are hard to see over a camera, but when you're in person with someone, they're relatively easy to see.

1087
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I'm sure there are different signs for the success of mesmerism, but there's another principle I want to speak briefly about here.

1088
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:18,000
And before I continue, I just want to say, I think that sometimes when people are listening to me speaking, they may have the impression that I'm reading from the book of what I already know.

1089
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Right.

1090
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Because this is what it is common for us to think when people speak.

1091
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:33,000
They, that they are saying things they already know.

1092
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
They have known before.

1093
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:40,000
And in our conversation, much of what is taking place is not that.

1094
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:45,000
It is something very strange is happening where.

1095
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
My awareness.

1096
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:52,000
It feels like is touching a nonverbal mirror in you.

1097
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Right.

1098
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
And I'm able to somehow coalesce.

1099
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:03,000
It's like the thing we were talking about with, with seeing, I can less the reflection.

1100
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:10,000
And then I can begin to articulate what I am feeling or seeing, which is not something I have known before.

1101
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Or articulated before.

1102
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Right before.

1103
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
So this is what is so beautiful and exciting.

1104
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Part of what is so beautiful or exciting for me.

1105
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
As well as the an amnoetic.

1106
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Reweaving of histories and, and potentials and seeing.

1107
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
The thing I wanted to mention is that.

1108
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Again, my friend Ryan first diver who.

1109
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:47,000
You know, certainly doesn't consider himself a magician, but the path of a black foot ceremonial person is involved with something.

1110
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
They don't have the concept for magic.

1111
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
There's lots of words in English.

1112
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
They don't even have a concept for it.

1113
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
And their treatment of identity is so different.

1114
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:01,000
From ours, that the idea of concrete identity basically doesn't exist.

1115
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,000
So you see a person, it's not necessarily that person.

1116
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Right.

1117
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
They don't just presume, oh, it's that person.

1118
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Because you could be coming from the sun, or you could be coming from the land, or you could be coming from another tribe.

1119
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:22,000
So your identity is in how you relate rather than in your visage and, you know, your name badge or whatever.

1120
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
As it is in the West.

1121
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Right.

1122
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:31,000
We just know we think, oh, that's Joe, you know, I was taught to not think that way.

1123
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:36,000
And during my experience, I was taught to very carefully.

1124
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Participatorially establish our identities together rather than presume them.

1125
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:48,000
But there's two principles that I think are relevant, perhaps to hypnosis and maybe mesmerism.

1126
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And one is similitude, the resemblance.

1127
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Right.

1128
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Resembling.

1129
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:00,000
When you say like, I get them to emulate me.

1130
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Right.

1131
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
That's the similitude principle.

1132
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Right.

1133
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Well, there is, it can never be truly emulated because it's such an infinitely variable and minuscule actual thing that takes place.

1134
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:25,000
But yes, you're on the right track and it's definitely there is definitely a similitude and.

1135
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
And there is something.

1136
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
It's something you can replicate.

1137
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Yeah, it's not emulation that leads to success. It's emulation that gives that maybe communicates the form and then the form has to be embodied.

1138
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Yes, yes.

1139
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I think that that is successful or not.

1140
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:50,000
But then the other principle is I think is quite trippy is contagion.

1141
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I'm going to actually use the word transmission, actually.

1142
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Fair enough.

1143
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Because because there's the principle of transmission is something that's very real when you're working with the type of thing that I'm talking about, because it's something which is, which is coursing through you.

1144
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:22,000
It's almost connecting to a field of connecting to a field of information that exists out there beyond us.

1145
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:40,000
So if it's coming through me, and I know how to actually, and I successfully or, you know, enable this to be transmitted to the individual that I'm working with, then it's by the very nature of this energetic field starting to connect.

1146
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:56,000
One will connect to that continuum, which links through all of my own experiences somehow, and it actually is transmitted to the individual who, who I'm working with.

1147
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Yes, so when you say this continuum, so to speak, it's almost as if not just your history, but the lineages that feed in your history.

1148
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Yes, go into the other person and as a seed sort of and begin to light up and expand. And I'm not trying to couch our discussion in terms of concepts from, for example, traditional Blackfoot ceremony, but crucially in their way of life.

1149
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:40,000
They have this concept that is more primordial than the other two that I was just using, which are similitude and contagion. And obviously those are English words.

1150
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
It's transfer.

1151
01:52:43,000 --> 01:53:08,000
You know, in English, we might call it initiation, but it's much more intimate than this. It's literally both something being placed into you, and also you being drawn into a lineage history that you now become a family member of, so to speak.

1152
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:29,000
So we can bring this analogy to say, for example, when somebody is in certain types of tradition where you have, say, for example, the laying on of hands as an actual transmission, it's similar to this.

1153
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:42,000
There is something that is transmitted through time from lots of different individuals who have existed physically, but maybe don't exist physically anymore.

1154
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:49,000
However, they're present in you at the moment that you transmit to the next person.

1155
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Yes.

1156
01:53:50,000 --> 01:54:13,000
And you, in the future, when you're no longer this incarnate in the normal sense, will be transmitted through your, you know, the connection you had, you have added to that continuum of energy, amplified it in some measure, and then that's added to what's passed down to the future generations.

1157
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Yes.

1158
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:30,000
So there is a type of transmission that we're speaking of here. And initiation, as you say, it's all, these are all relevant terms, maybe not always satisfactory words, but, you know, they don't have the same idea.

1159
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I think the concepts are easily understood. I just want to share a couple of other things briefly.

1160
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:49,000
When I began to study Tai Chi, I studied it before with it with a teacher and then I lost my form and there's a whole adventure behind that, but I found these five older men who were practicing every morning and maybe end to teach me.

1161
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Yeah.

1162
01:54:50,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And I was very passionate about this, right? And pretty soon, within about three months, about three months in, I started having dreams. I had three or four of them.

1163
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:14,000
In which a group of older Asian men would come and they would just straight up tell me, you know, we've heard that, you know, we've heard about you and we're here to check you out.

1164
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Yeah.

1165
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Want to see, like, who are you? You know, what are you for real? You know, either kind of person we would want to join the family, you know, this kind of thing. And thankfully, in those cases, it worked out well for me.

1166
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:42,000
There was a similar thing that happened when I experienced a transfer from Blackfoot culture where, and it was much more profound and like primordial.

1167
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:59,000
And there were, there were like hundreds of men, warriors and bound ceremonial elders and stuff that came. There was this quest. There were all these amazing features that were nothing like a regular dream.

1168
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Right.

1169
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Very obviously, something's going on here. So I just, I just wanted to share that because it might help people to understand what is meant by joining a lineage or being introduced or having a transmission.

1170
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Right. It really is to become a part of a lineage and a family.

1171
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:42,000
And to be checked out, right? To be sort of, you know, tested. Like, are you, are you for real? You want to sell this? What do you want? You know, actually, often there's a question when you meet a non-ordinary being or intelligence, they may praise you, right?

1172
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:50,000
They'll sort of, they may sort of build you up and say, oh yeah, you're really cool. We like you, blah, blah, blah. And so we're going to give you a gift. And what do you want?

1173
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Sorry, because they're really trying to figure out, are you, are you selfish?

1174
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Yeah, right.

1175
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Right. Are you selfish? It's really kind of the question. And by the way, that question leads to a ladder of other questions.

1176
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Yes.

1177
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:13,000
That's the first question, right? I think. But yes, please continue.

1178
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,000
And how are we doing? How are we doing on time? How are you?

1179
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I think I can do maybe, maybe about another 10 minutes or something like that, more or less, on this occasion.

1180
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:42,000
So, I'm just trying to work out where we were because, so really, to me, all I'm trying to find a way to sort of conclude it on this, on this occasion.

1181
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
So,

1182
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Yeah, I mean, we can have, we can hopefully we'll have further explanation.

1183
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Yeah, well, well, you know, like I say, when, when I've got the ability to make it coincide with everything I've got going on here, I'm very, very happy to do that.

1184
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
As a mile.

1185
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Yes.

1186
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Yeah, great. So, so to sort of try and pull this together at the moment, it's more a thing of like, you know, where is all of this going?

1187
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:14,000
You know, what, what is all of this giving to us?

1188
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:21,000
You know, it seems as if there is a, there is a question hanging.

1189
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
We experience these things.

1190
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I'm sure there are many, many, many others similar to ourselves who've been having these experiences.

1191
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:41,000
And it's been feeding into the work that we're doing and reflecting itself back in the work that we're doing.

1192
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Certainly, we can, we can very likely even identify what we believe our roles and our duty is in this incarnation with regards to how we pass this onto people and what you what utility it has as well.

1193
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
You know, for the benefit of others.

1194
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:15,000
But there is a big question which is hanging there all the time and that that is where is this all ultimately leading to.

1195
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:27,000
You know, this is this is the question for me, or at least the question which I'm going to leave hanging in the air, perhaps.

1196
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Now, of course, it would probably be foolish for us to to conclusively answer anything of the kind.

1197
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:46,000
We've touched on that previously, you know, sometimes there's no point in, you know, it's not right to kill the to kill that question.

1198
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:55,000
But it's certainly something which is worth putting out there.

1199
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Even if it's for our own personal work.

1200
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
In our conversations so far.

1201
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
We have run.

1202
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:13,000
We have sounded bells along a trajectory, right.

1203
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:18,000
And those those ringing notes.

1204
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,000
They naturally coalesce over time.

1205
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:37,000
In the same way that you were speaking about the recovered fragments and how it's not you allow them to be sort of preserved without constant attention and inquiry.

1206
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Yeah, exactly. Yes.

1207
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:55,000
And also the concept of suggestion and indirect communication is very profound. So for me, our conversation sounds these notes that ring in the between of our conversations, and I'm sure we'll ring in the audience.

1208
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:02,000
In a very, very generative and fertilizing way like that.

1209
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Like the Pete, like, like the menstruational, you know, intensity of the blue sky and the sonic purple, the red purple.

1210
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Yeah, I have so much faith in you and your way and your path.

1211
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:34,000
You as a being who who has a noble purpose. You know, you have great charisma, but you're not like a personality.

1212
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,000
You know, in the way of someone who's self aggrandizing.

1213
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:46,000
And so I'm just so grateful for this opportunity to learn and see with you every time we may have it.

1214
02:01:46,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Yeah, and Darren, similarly with with yourself, you know, you the way you the way you lay things out in terms of your own summaries and descriptions are incredibly, incredibly illuminating on the spot, you know, for me.

1215
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:17,000
It's not even like I'm sure maybe if I listen to this interview in the future, I'll have further revelations but in the midst of actually being here talking about these things.

1216
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:31,000
There's been a great deal of actual living, you know, things kickstarting like coming to life in my own understanding right there on the spot as as we saw earlier today.

1217
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:49,000
And that in itself, you know, is is incredibly inspiring and there's something about the way that you're presenting these things to me or reflecting them back to me in some instances, which is incredibly illuminating for me.

1218
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:56,000
So it's it's there's something very fruitful about the way I feel we're we're interacting on these matters.

1219
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:06,000
It's profoundly the same for me it's almost as if the light of my history and awareness and the light of your history and awareness, they meet somewhere.

1220
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:15,000
And then there's, there's like, there's like a group of figures who speak back to us from the the the intersection. Right.

1221
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:20,000
It's so beautiful. And I'm just so grateful and humbled.

1222
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Me too. Me too. And I'm also curiously aware of the fact that there is something I feel there's something in in your own experiences and background and in and in mine that somehow relates to something beyond us, which we've not quite yet been able to quite fathom or grasp

1223
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:52,000
but there's a it feels like there's a reason why this connection came together. So absolutely.

1224
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
So healing for me. Yeah, inspiring.

1225
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:07,000
And it's so insightful. I've seen I've learned so much. I mean, it sounds like I'm talking and blah, blah, blah. I get it. But I've learned so much.

1226
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Every time we come together and it really is humbling because it's not like a what is it's not like it's about what Darren knows or anything like that something very magical, sort of mysterious and alive.

1227
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,000
And I just want to honor that and you and your work.

1228
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:30,000
I'm so grateful and I can't wait for the next time.

1229
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Well, well, hopefully, when you're when you're over here in the UK, I mean, I'm, you know, we I don't think we can miss the chance to try to, you know, to pull that together to meet up and and do something.

1230
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Go to some of these sacred sites around.

1231
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:58,000
I just want to extend the invitation you ever want to come here you've got a spot, you know, I don't know have you ever been to California.

1232
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:09,000
You've never been. Well, actually, I think when I was 10 years old, I did, but that was when I was 10 years old, I, it was actually Florida, not California now.

1233
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Sorry, just like, well, we'll talk about the soft line, but I'm there.

1234
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:24,000
And yeah, I'm just so excited and thank you so much, Lee. It's brilliant to have a chance to speak with you and learn together so.

1235
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Absolutely.

1236
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Our next adventure. Absolutely. Yes. Yes.

1237
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
May your path be blessed and beautiful.

1238
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Yours too, sir.

1239
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Bye bye for now.
