00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hello everybody. Welcome.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
I especially want to thank those of you who are new to my channel

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
for giving me a little bit of attention.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
I work pretty hard to produce quality content.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm not here to blow my own horn or parade around like I'm something special.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
What I'm interested in is learning how to see better together,

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
trying to understand what the actual potentials of our human nature are,

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
how those were lost, how we might recover them together.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
So this is what you're going to find me exploring.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
And some of the older material, you're going to see like a radical difference

00:55.000 --> 01:04.000
in the depth and the level of inspiration in some of my older material

01:04.000 --> 01:13.000
because back in the days when I was younger and the experiences that forged my mind were more fresh,

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
there's some very profound stuff back there.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
You'll find a little bit of mania back there too,

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
but if you don't find a little bit of mania,

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
you're probably looking in the wrong place because our actual nature as human beings

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
is so staggering that if exposure to it doesn't light you up,

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
you're probably mostly dead inside or you've just been turned into some kind of a conceptual

01:46.000 --> 01:58.000
and sensorial zombie by the ceaseless impoverishments of our common anti-cultures

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
and ridiculous domineering paradigms.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
So yeah, I encourage you to do the archaeology,

02:10.000 --> 02:19.000
go back in time, especially to the historical epoch in my channel

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
where you'll see the same image, looks sort of like a little satellite, right?

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
And there's some kind of a code word.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
Those are the early days and some of that stuff I think you'll find very,

02:36.000 --> 02:45.000
at least at the very least entertaining, if not astonishing and inspiring.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
So yeah, I'm so glad to have some new subscribers.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
I think a lot of that is probably due to my...

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
some of it's due to interviews with Lee Gerard Barlow

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
who I'm going to be doing another interview with on this coming Wednesday.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Super excited about that.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
And then also Alan Steinfeld and Henrietta Weeks

03:13.000 --> 03:25.000
who I should be having another interview with on Monday or Tuesday of the coming week.

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm working on getting some other interview subjects which I'll keep quiet for the moment.

03:33.000 --> 03:41.000
I also think some of the new people are here because of my discussion of Amon Hillman

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
who is certainly a maniac, but a rather interesting one.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
I've got an essay about him coming out shortly on my medium channel.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
You can find me there.

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
If you just look for Darren Stevenson on medium.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
I think my channel is called At Organel.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
I've got that if I remember that correctly.

04:11.000 --> 04:18.000
So yeah, please take a moment to ask a question.

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
If you do in fact like the content, like it, share it.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Anything that helps me grow my audience is very powerful

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
and its ability to empower me to continue this work.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
And I'm profoundly thankful to my Patreon supporters.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
If you want to throw me a dollar every month, that means a lot

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
because if there's a few of you that do that, that adds up quickly.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
So you know, that's $12 a year.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
I also have a PayPal account.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
You can make a direct donation if you care to.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
I very rarely solicit patronage,

05:09.000 --> 05:16.000
but it's extremely helpful for me.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Even though, you know, what I actually earn from patronage

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
is about these days around $140 a month, pretty minimal.

05:27.000 --> 05:36.000
And I pay out some patronage to others whose work is important to me as well.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
So yeah, take a moment, ask a question, share an experience,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
an insight, share your thoughts.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Like or you know, hell dislike the video.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Share it, whatever you feel comfortable doing.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Grateful that you're all here.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
And then I'm still vertical after all these years.

05:58.000 --> 06:12.000
I can walk around and still physically able, body, and somewhat able-minded.

06:12.000 --> 06:21.000
I've been listening over the past couple of days to

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
something I very rarely pay any attention to, Joe Rogan.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
But I was curious to see his interview with David Grush,

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
former top-level intelligence officer with the United States military,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
whistleblower on the topic of UFOs.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
I learned quite a bit.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.000
You know, I've been following Grush since approximately May of last year.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
And I've written a long essay on the history of the UFO phenomenon

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
in the United States. It's on my medium channel.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
There's actually a couple essays of related topic there.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
I've been following UFOs since I was six or seven years old.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
So you're talking, you know, late 60s, late 1960s.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Long before this was a cult phenomenon.

07:17.000 --> 07:25.000
I've always had a bit of the, perhaps both the stigma and the shining

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
of the non-ordinary about it.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah, when I was a kid, I read Chariots of the Gods by Von Donnecken.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
I was fascinated by Egyptology.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
I read the Egyptian Book of the Dead when I was 11.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
I was a voracious reader as a child.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
I don't know if I'm, if I still qualify because I'm not doing a lot of reading these days,

07:53.000 --> 08:02.000
but I have a huge library and an active bookshelf.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
So I've been fascinated by this since I was a child.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
I think the inspiration of my fascination is relatively simple.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
There must be actually intelligent other beings in the universe.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
And those of you who know my work know that I very commonly argue

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
that there's actually intelligent other beings all around us.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Because their mode doesn't match ours,

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
our species generally doesn't recognize them in sciences.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Only kind of starting.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Not that science is one thing, it's not.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
But there are people within science who are well aware

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
that we are surrounded not merely by intelligences, but by transcendentions.

08:53.000 --> 09:01.000
This doesn't have language or models to talk about it yet.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
So, yeah, I think, you know, if what we mean by intelligence is builds machines,

09:08.000 --> 09:17.000
then we're the only one around here, the only local one here that seems to be doing this.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Apparently, we are apparently the only local one.

09:20.000 --> 09:29.000
That's a pretty dumb idea of intelligence because without the complex necessary social intelligence,

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
the capacity to build machines will get everything dead right quick.

09:33.000 --> 09:41.000
So, it doesn't look like intelligence to me that looks like a specific mode of cognition

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
that's extremely dangerous and not actually intelligent at all.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
Any species that offloads their evolutionary momentum into machine building

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
is going to snuff themselves and their environment in short order.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
So that just doesn't look intelligent to me.

09:59.000 --> 10:07.000
And I longed to meet other beings who were actually intelligent,

10:07.000 --> 10:13.000
partly because I believed that the universe would produce such beings

10:13.000 --> 10:19.000
and partly because they might give us the keys to save our world.

10:19.000 --> 10:28.000
And if not, our world, at least our minds.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
Now, I have a variety of topics on my mind today and I'm not sure which of them I'm going to get to.

10:33.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm going to start here.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I'm going to bookmark a couple things.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
So, frame collapse, I'm going to call frame collapse,

10:48.000 --> 10:58.000
and multiple worlds but not the physics theory.

10:58.000 --> 11:06.000
So, I've been listening to Joe Rogan's interviews over the past couple days,

11:06.000 --> 11:17.000
first with David Grush, who I think is a person of high integrity and true patriotic spirit.

11:17.000 --> 11:25.000
And what I mean by true patriotic spirit is a very rare kind of thing.

11:25.000 --> 11:39.000
Believes in the origins and purposes that underlie our nation's formative urgencies

11:39.000 --> 11:54.000
and is willing to risk everything to preserve, protect, and develop those.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
There are probably far better urgencies.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
We're running a nation on an operating system written in the 1700s.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
We think we're intelligent, that's not intelligent.

12:08.000 --> 12:16.000
And in fact, at the level of we, the level of our collectives, our species is idiotic,

12:16.000 --> 12:27.000
catastrophically ignorant, easily captured and mismotivated,

12:27.000 --> 12:41.000
inclined to continue with devastatingly stupid orientations, activities, agendas, and so forth.

12:41.000 --> 12:50.000
So, there's very little intelligence about the dominant features of human beings in our time.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Human beings as a group.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
Individual humans, it's easy to find shining examples of brilliance.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Collectives vary uncommon, why is this so?

13:01.000 --> 13:18.000
This is a question we should deeply preserve, pursue, and I suggest transform.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
So, the Grush interview was quite interesting.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
I learned a number of new things.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
I've probably heard six interviews with him, maybe seven.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
People may say whatever they like about him.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Personally, I consider him a modern hero.

13:40.000 --> 13:51.000
He is certainly the flag bearer, the ring bearer of the movement for disclosure in our time.

13:51.000 --> 13:58.000
Disclosure being the revelation of what our government, quote unquote,

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
I mean, that's presuming it even belongs to us, which is sort of a ridiculous supposition.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
It's not our government, it's a government.

14:09.000 --> 14:18.000
It's a government that is associated with us, but has its entirely own, it should be very obvious,

14:18.000 --> 14:27.000
existence, agendas, motivations in there, not ours.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
So, yeah, I mean, that should come as a revelation.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
The American government is not ours.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
It's not going to become ours.

14:38.000 --> 14:49.000
It's a separate entity, a dumpster fire of competing, highly aggressive, well defended thrips,

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
which are dead inside processes that capture groups of humans,

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
and deploy them for the furtherance of non-human agendas.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
By non-human agendas, I don't mean alien agendas.

15:03.000 --> 15:21.000
I mean agendas born in the absence of our humanity in the collective behavioral cognition of our species.

15:21.000 --> 15:36.000
Three of the very lethal modes of this are commerce, war, and ideology.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
So, yeah, this is not our government.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
This is the government associated with where we live.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
It was never really our government.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
When we were born, it wasn't ours.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
When we will die, it won't be ours.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
It won't belong to our children.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
It didn't belong to our ancestors.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
You should understand this very clearly.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
The idea that we have a government is insane.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
It's no chance of that being true.

16:04.000 --> 16:16.000
That's a lethal fiction that we operate under the ages of daily to our grave detriment.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
But Grush came forward and said,

16:20.000 --> 16:30.000
this government here has and has long had direct knowledge of non-human intelligences in time space,

16:30.000 --> 16:39.000
visiting Earth with objects, material objects, things that we would call technology.

16:39.000 --> 16:52.000
We have recovered or have been given instances of these technologies including things we would call vehicles.

16:52.000 --> 17:01.000
There are a number, at least 10 and possibly as many as 30 vehicles.

17:01.000 --> 17:08.000
There are a broad array of objects of a semi or metatechnological nature

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
that this government is and has long been in possession of.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
There is intelligence about this matter.

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
This government is in possession of, and there is no oversight.

17:21.000 --> 17:30.000
In other words, you have a breakaway civilization inside this government that is no longer merely human.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
They are no longer modern humans, they are not us.

17:36.000 --> 17:43.000
What I mean by a breakaway civilization is a civilization in possession of artifacts and or technologies

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
that are advanced so far beyond anything we can even conceive of

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
that they qualify as a different species.

17:53.000 --> 18:06.000
If you could imagine a group of humans capable with computers and capable of using them during, say, the Civil War era.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
This is what we are talking about.

18:09.000 --> 18:19.000
Same physical species, not the same technological species.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
Now, Grush isn't saying there is a breakaway civilization, but let's be clear.

18:25.000 --> 18:36.000
These topics are classified above, at levels above, weapons of mass destruction, nuclear power, nuclear weapons and so forth.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
This is the most secret of secret things.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
And the reason that it is the most secret of secret things is fairly simple.

18:46.000 --> 18:56.000
It comprises the holy grail of asymmetric advantage over any conceivable terrestrial enemy.

18:56.000 --> 19:09.000
And strangely, ironically, lethally and devastatingly, at the group level, our species is absolutely married

19:09.000 --> 19:20.000
to war, commerce, prison nearing, ideology and self-devastation.

19:20.000 --> 19:31.000
At the individual level, nothing like that is going on.

19:31.000 --> 19:45.000
At the collective level, the kind of animal that we are is absolutely captivated by what I call thrisps,

19:45.000 --> 19:56.000
which are essentially artifacts that form in our group, in the dimension of human group cognition.

19:56.000 --> 20:11.000
When that dimension of group identity, relation, memory, commitment, orientation, purpose is evacuated.

20:11.000 --> 20:20.000
When we depart from that, thrisps are the result.

20:20.000 --> 20:35.000
You could imagine something like cancer, you could imagine something like the difference between the untouched Amazon rainforest

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
and dead cities.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
Imagine cities that just build themselves with robots, they're dead inside, there's nothing in there.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
It's a good analogy for a thrisps, right?

20:48.000 --> 20:59.000
So the dead cities eat the living rainforest and just self-replicate lethal dead structure,

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
whose primary purpose is simply the production of further dead structure.

21:05.000 --> 21:15.000
In this case, rather than in the Amazon rainforest, it's in the network of minds comprised by human beings

21:15.000 --> 21:27.000
and the other living networks that we humans draw our origin, purpose, spirit and dreaming from,

21:27.000 --> 21:34.000
which would be all the living beings of Earth and in fact, beings far beyond the Earth,

21:34.000 --> 21:42.000
beings who are not merely material.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
So Grush, you know, was being persecuted.

21:47.000 --> 22:07.000
He was tasked with determining if such black projects exist that are oriented to hide and reverse engineer retrieved non-human technologies.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
He discovered that there were in fact such black projects.

22:12.000 --> 22:23.000
And then he started being persecuted, not surprisingly, and threatened and so forth.

22:23.000 --> 22:45.000
So he went directly to the Inspector General of the intelligence community and, you know, dumped data about the history of this situation.

22:53.000 --> 23:11.000
Mainly so that he could be in some way protected from reprisal, but also because what's going on is illegal, right?

23:11.000 --> 23:19.000
It's a violation of the concept of the constitutional government, democracy, so forth.

23:19.000 --> 23:38.000
Because what we apparently have here, or what exists here, whether we have it or not, is a relatively modest group of humans within the U.S. military

23:39.000 --> 23:59.000
that are operating without oversight and are essentially stealing funds from other projects and then hiding that extortion.

23:59.000 --> 24:20.000
So, you know, this has been going on now for, well, look, people have been trying to bring this to light for probably more than 50 years in our nation, in this nation,

24:21.000 --> 24:39.000
and mostly failing and suffering, murder, threat, derision, the obliteration of their social or personal or vocational identities, histories, potentials and so forth.

24:39.000 --> 24:50.000
So Grush, you know, in some ways he's Frodo, right, in the Lord of the Rings, right? He's the ring-bearer.

24:50.000 --> 24:57.000
He's the one on whose shoulders this has landed, and I really don't care what anyone has to say.

24:57.000 --> 25:17.000
There's no way this guy was motivated by self-interest. If he was motivated by self-interest, he would maintain his clearances and continue to ascend the essentially endless ladder of privilege and pay in top branches of the United States military.

25:17.000 --> 25:28.000
Are you kidding me? Like, you know, someone thinks like, oh, he's trying to make money or there's no money in this for him.

25:28.000 --> 25:46.000
He's trying to stay alive, trying to keep his family alive, and he's trying to reveal in a way that can't be rolled back a series of catastrophic agendas and situations.

25:46.000 --> 26:05.000
Within the government of the United States, in the closed stacks, so to speak, of the libraries of our government.

26:05.000 --> 26:28.000
So, you know, that was an interesting interview. I knew most of what Grush spoke of there, and he's limited in what he can speak of because he has to have, he has to have a thing called dobser clearance and he has to have, he has to completely, perfectly fail to violate that.

26:28.000 --> 26:44.000
So, he can say what he has been authorized. No, he can say what he hasn't been forbidden from saying, but if he veers much from that, they're going to come for him.

26:44.000 --> 27:12.000
And there's a lot of people hoping that he's going to do that, right? Because they're just, they just want him to veer a tiny bit from the way he crosses one of those tees or dots one of those eyes in what he's sharing, and they'll arrest him, or silence him, or revoke his clearances, or, you know, whatever, whatever steps can be taken

27:12.000 --> 27:29.000
at the official, logistical, and legal level to get that, to get that guy off the playing board. He's a big thorn in the sight of many.

27:42.000 --> 28:09.000
So then, today I was listening to Rogan interviewing George Knapp, who's, you know, been at this for, what is this? You know, he's been a pro disclosure, someone working for disclosure for like 36 years, long, long time.

28:09.000 --> 28:38.000
And also Jeremy Corbell, who is a little more recent in his commitment to the mission. And again, what's, you know, what's the mission? It's, it's layered, right?

28:38.000 --> 28:55.000
Layer one, tell human beings we're not alone. We know for a fact that we're not alone in the universe. There's no chance of that being true. And we've known this for a long, long time.

28:55.000 --> 29:22.000
There are other intelligences. It's not entirely clear that they're merely biological the way we are. I am also aware that there are other forms of intelligence. There are field intelligences that are probably the origin of our minds, without which we wouldn't have consciousness or anything like it.

29:22.000 --> 29:46.000
And there seems to be a ladder of forms of intelligence, each of which contribute something to both the ladder and the orders above and below them.

29:46.000 --> 30:15.000
So for example, around here, the plants and the microorganisms are profoundly advanced intelligences, physicalizations, platforms, if you will.

30:17.000 --> 30:37.000
They contribute up and down scale to the possibility of the existence of our minds, the minds of animals.

30:38.000 --> 30:57.000
We think, who knows what we think? At the collective level, we're relatively stupid because we are easily captured by ideological, what, inhibitions, nonsense?

30:57.000 --> 31:23.000
So like reductionism and materialism have dominated our species at the collective level for a very long time. Well, a long modern time, I don't know. A couple, three, four hundred years or something maybe?

31:27.000 --> 31:38.000
And those two ideologies are blinding, stupefying and mechanizing.

31:57.000 --> 32:19.000
You can imagine, bless you. You can imagine some sort of comic book scenario, right, where like a human lives in a caged off area or in a box, and outside it there are trillions of forms and modes of other intelligences.

32:19.000 --> 32:31.000
But in its backyard, it only sees, you know, a few examples of other beings that it can convince itself aren't intelligent because they don't make machines.

32:31.000 --> 32:49.000
Let me just be really clear about something. Any cell in your body outperforms the entire history and future of human forged machines three billion times per second.

32:50.000 --> 33:04.000
There's nothing, there's no need for anything resembling machines. None. Nature is billions of light years beyond anything resembling the necessity of mechanization.

33:07.000 --> 33:13.000
All of the things we think we need machines for, we don't need machines for those things.

33:13.000 --> 33:22.000
And since we're developing only machines, we've lost access to the meta technologies that are implicit in nature.

33:24.000 --> 33:33.000
And these include the ability to travel anywhere instantaneously, to not merely touch other minds telepathically but forge networks of them.

33:34.000 --> 33:50.000
Anything you can, instantaneous healing, probably resurrection of the dead, anything you can possibly imagine with the exception of war or the need for commerce or prisons or anything like this.

33:50.000 --> 34:17.000
The actual situation that we're in bears no resemblance to our common suppositions and the ideologies that dominate our common layer of thought, supposition, expectation, cosmology, science, so forth.

34:21.000 --> 34:38.000
If you're alone, you're going to need machines. If you belong to the families, the time space is the standing wave body for you will never need a machine.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
And so some people say, well, why are there UFOs and so forth?

34:42.000 --> 34:56.000
Yeah, well, you might not need machines. That doesn't mean you'll never forge them. There's a difference, though, between...

35:09.000 --> 35:29.000
The difference between intelligences that forge machines and intelligences that are dominated by them is that the latter are quickly snuffed by their own, by the results of their own defection from life.

35:30.000 --> 35:43.000
It's not a problem to forge the occasional machine. Having a couple of automobiles isn't a big deal. Having billions of them competing with the anciently preserved ecologies of our world, that's a deadly deal.

35:44.000 --> 36:11.000
So there are, you know, throughout time space, biological and parabiological peoples who do forge something, at least vaguely resembling machines, presuming that the things that we have, the things in the possession of our government,

36:12.000 --> 36:25.000
are that kind of thing, right, or a machine. And, you know, probably part of the reason why our government has been unable to properly reverse engineer these things is that they're not merely machines.

36:26.000 --> 36:32.000
They involve principles that we have no analog for.

36:35.000 --> 36:47.000
They are, you know, if they are piloted, they're not piloted mechanically. Most likely they're piloted by consciousness.

36:47.000 --> 37:00.000
So now you need, so in order for our government to do anything with these, we need humans who have the capacity to touch objects with consciousness and manipulate them that way.

37:00.000 --> 37:13.000
They don't have levers and wheels and things inside them. Many of them are probably single objects, right, have no parts. There's no parts. They might have features, but not parts.

37:17.000 --> 37:30.000
So today I was listening to Corbel and Knapp talk about kind of the history and a bit more in depth from outside of Grush's experience, what's been going on with him.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
And that's been quite fascinating. I learned a lot from that conversation.

37:35.000 --> 38:04.000
This is some downstream intelligence, you know, from after the time when our, this government forged some documentation and, you can call this, some legal structure around the topic for fiscal 2024

38:04.000 --> 38:22.000
appropriation of military budgets. There's legislature, legislation that, wow, there's some other intelligence right there.

38:22.000 --> 38:49.000
There's legislation that orbits the disclosure of these situations and that authorizes Congress and the House to go after factions within this government and within the private commercial sector that have been involved in this situation.

38:50.000 --> 39:01.000
It sort of gives them a sort of truth and reconciliation. I'm not talking about the halo video game level. Of course I kind of am.

39:01.000 --> 39:15.000
Where, you know, come forward, let us know, we'll relieve you of responsibility. Don't let us know, we'll come for you kind of thing.

39:15.000 --> 39:27.000
So that was gutted. My understanding is that the legislation was gutted to some degree. And there are particular people in the government.

39:27.000 --> 39:53.000
The gentleman whose donors include Raytheon, Lockheed, Boeing, et cetera, and whose district includes Wright Patterson Air Force Base, which is historically infamous in this fiasco.

39:53.000 --> 40:11.000
I can't recall their names at the moment. Not too hard to find them. There's a couple of people that have shut down the public hearings and so forth, a couple of what senators or congressmen, these guys are idiots, they are.

40:11.000 --> 40:27.000
There are people with historical records of catastrophic misdeeds. They're shills, they're straight up shills. So that's been going on since last year.

40:27.000 --> 40:43.000
There have been some hearings, at least two. One major one where Grush, David Fraver, and another ace fighter pilot, and another pilot what, Ryan Graves maybe?

40:43.000 --> 40:57.000
I'm not trying to remember all the names at the moment where these folks all testified about this matter.

40:57.000 --> 41:15.000
And to the degree that it would become futurally impossible to make ridiculous claims like there's nothing there, these are not cases, these are just crazy people, which this is what's been going on to hide the phenomena on purpose.

41:15.000 --> 41:30.000
They lit up crazy people on purpose and then pointed at them and laughed publicly for the past 50 years to produce a smokescreen about the topic in the public eye.

41:30.000 --> 41:45.000
So the first layer is to reveal to the public that we're not alone. We're not the only game in town, in time, in space, even around here. We're not. We never have been.

41:45.000 --> 42:03.000
And this is the second layer is that this has long been being hidden primarily because it's, like I said, the holy grail of asymmetric war advantage or asymmetric commercial advantage or asymmetric slavery, enslaving advantage.

42:03.000 --> 42:25.000
And at the group level are completely disoriented species captured by thrips, highly motivated in these three areas, enslave, imprison, slaughter, commit on the side, kill everything you can, turn that into products, stack up representations of that value in banks,

42:25.000 --> 42:49.000
concentrate the value in 0.02% of the living human population for one lifetime, burn down the future, obliterate the historical past, lie like there's no tomorrow, rape the children, burn the mothers, just like demons, straight up demons.

42:50.000 --> 43:00.000
So yeah, these are the motivating forces that are arrayed against us. And people are concerned about which president wins? Well, of course, there is some concern. There's good reasons for that concern.

43:00.000 --> 43:28.000
But at this point, at this late point, you know, if this is kind of a ridiculous analogy, but if human civilization, if we metaphorically analogize human civilization as the construction and preservation of the giant double penis with no testicles,

43:29.000 --> 43:47.000
that used to dwell in New York, right, between towers, then what's going on right now is that the charges have been detonated inside the structure of the building. The charges have been detonated.

43:48.000 --> 44:00.000
The things are falling, you know, the planes have crashed, the charges detonated, the things are falling, and we're arguing about, you know, who gets to stand on the top floor while the thing collapses.

44:00.000 --> 44:14.000
It's catastrophic disorientation of our human potential and nature, history and future.

44:15.000 --> 44:32.000
Watching the sick leaf sewage rich froth bubbling on the surface of our present moment in human history is terrifying and demoralizing for all of us.

44:33.000 --> 44:40.000
We are not our families, our histories, our lineages.

44:40.000 --> 44:53.000
And when I say those words, I mean the living places we arose in and for.

44:54.000 --> 45:13.000
Our families include the sky, the moon, the sun, the mountain, the forest, the river, the desert, the ocean, the animals, the plants, the insects, all of the water creatures.

45:13.000 --> 45:32.000
These are our families. They are being put to the torch in our lifetimes for the sake of disorientations too absurd to imagine, let alone pursue.

45:33.000 --> 45:41.000
And yet this is where quote we unquote are now.

45:41.000 --> 45:47.000
And it seems that we are incapable.

45:47.000 --> 45:52.000
Hi.

45:52.000 --> 46:02.000
That seeming is wrong. It's not true. It seems that we are incapable of forming anything that could. We don't need to fight against what's happening. That's one misconception.

46:02.000 --> 46:12.000
Any kind of war is going to lead to more war. The planet and we are too delicate at this point for war.

46:12.000 --> 46:25.000
So this is one of the other layers, right? The third layer is the lie that there's a government that represents us. It doesn't. Never did.

46:25.000 --> 46:34.000
Let me be really clear. We have been alive for X number of years. The government is older than us. It's a structured array of lethal fictions we inherited.

46:34.000 --> 46:46.000
Birth. It's bullshit. It's deadly. The fact that you have the better version of cancer than the other people on the planet that will not fucking help you. Ever.

46:46.000 --> 46:54.000
If we're to have anything resembling our humanity, we have to forge something worth living in and for together.

46:54.000 --> 47:15.000
And this will not be a set of structured agreements. It will be a set of relational prodigies, ways of playing at being human together that are so beautiful, restorative, medicinal, developmentally profound and amazing that no one's willing to be left out.

47:15.000 --> 47:35.000
That direction is open. That door is open. Everything in the history and future of life on this world wants the humans to become uncaptured.

47:35.000 --> 47:52.000
So there are ways of starting on a small scale, three to five people, that quickly become extremely effective and profound and contagious and don't involve war.

47:52.000 --> 48:11.000
That's where hope, that's one of the directions in which hope is alive for this planet.

48:11.000 --> 48:30.000
Alright, so, let's see here. By the way, that little vocal move that I made there was, that's my father's voice. It's not mine.

48:30.000 --> 48:45.000
It's my dad. My dad's voice. That was one of his vocal idiosyncrasies. I just recognized it playing in me.

48:45.000 --> 49:07.000
You know, we think we are individuals. It's insane. What I am is like, imagine a billion threadlines of history and relation from every part of nature in the sky and these billion threadlines have a kind of a bubbling forefront, a wavefront in time space.

49:07.000 --> 49:24.000
That's what I am. I'm not Darren. I'm not merely human. That's what we are and if we don't have access to that because of some fiction where I think I'm Darren or Darren's important or any of that kind of thing, it's not that I'm not.

49:24.000 --> 49:50.000
It's that letting the aspect of me that thinks that's important drive the car is insane because there's, you know, nine billion forms of intelligence supporting me that if I would just let them synthesize and symphonize together, if I would just let them orchestrate,

49:50.000 --> 50:10.000
there's no chance logic can outperform that. There's no chance rationality, conceptual thought, even what we think of as mathematics. There's no chance of those useful artifacts outperforming their origins.

50:10.000 --> 50:37.000
If their origins are free to fuse and synergize and see and learn and grow and amnese together, to unforgettable together. You know, there is something weird going on here on earth, which I don't think is universal, which is a kind of a forgetting.

50:41.000 --> 51:01.000
Metaphorized in the Greek myth of the river Lethe in which we are dipped between lives so that we forget all that came before. An amnesis is the reversal of that tragedy in us.

51:01.000 --> 51:30.000
You know, some portion of the question surrounding the existence of what we think of as UFOs and alien life, probably a good portion of that question has to do with our own origin as a species because let's be really clear.

51:32.000 --> 51:50.000
I'm not an expert, but listening to many experts, the chances that we evolved here on earth by mere mechanical accident as reductionist materialism supposes.

51:50.000 --> 52:03.000
In my view, the chance of that 0.0000001 or less. And you know, roll the dice. How many times do you have to roll the dice to come up with that?

52:03.000 --> 52:09.000
Well, trillions and trillions and trillions of times and finally you get that result.

52:14.000 --> 52:24.000
Yeah, there's no chance that we just evolved mechanically. Do humans look like a natural result of evolutionary processes on earth to you? Is that what we look like to you?

52:24.000 --> 52:53.000
Because look around. There's precisely one representational cognitive on this planet. One. There's exactly one animal capable of completely defecting from all relationships into mechanisms.

52:54.000 --> 53:21.000
Into commodity, into war. Into attacking the reflection of its absence in the mirror of biorelational progeny. That's a weird fucking accident. Something went horribly sideways for that to occur.

53:25.000 --> 53:43.000
I have precisely zero suspicion that humans evolved without the direct intervention, influence or engineering of other intelligences.

53:44.000 --> 53:58.000
And indeed, you know, our religions directly or indirectly and as insane as many of them are, and I don't mean insane in the good way. I mean insane in the broken way.

53:59.000 --> 54:20.000
Most of them, if they don't directly say that this is what has taken place, they imply something similar. That we were intentionally engineered. We were made.

54:21.000 --> 54:40.000
And there appear to be a number of stories that's very specifically, at least if we listen to Maniacs, half brilliant Maniacs like Randall Carlson,

54:41.000 --> 54:56.000
that specifically detail something that sounds an awful lot like the careful genetic evolution, genetic engineering of our species.

54:57.000 --> 55:09.000
In what? Sumerian tablets, which I guess there are many thousands.

55:09.000 --> 55:18.000
Now, I'm not using those as evidence. I think you can just look at the situation, right, here on Earth.

55:19.000 --> 55:28.000
Look around at the rest of nature and look at us. Do we look like the same thing? Because we don't, to me, I mean, when I see automobiles, I'm seeing something that doesn't belong in nature at all.

55:28.000 --> 55:36.000
And, you know, there are people who will say, well, you know, nature is really weird, like anything, you know, it's the encompassing supercontainer.

55:36.000 --> 55:46.000
So anything that appears in nature is natural. Yes, from one perspective, that's absolutely true, from a conceptual perspective, nature is the supercontainer for all that is.

55:46.000 --> 55:52.000
So it's the same thing saying everything. So you can't, from that perspective, there's nothing that's unnatural.

55:52.000 --> 56:10.000
But from the perspective of biorelational intelligence, there's nothing that I can understand about nature that on a living planet would produce

56:10.000 --> 56:18.000
omnicidal maniacs like modern homo sapiens, machines.

56:18.000 --> 56:31.000
And this is a question I've chased for a long time. Okay, so our, you know, is what, we have this word, the word is artificial.

56:31.000 --> 56:37.000
And what we mean by that usually, we can mean different things with it, depending on who's talking and where.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.000
Words don't have meanings, we use them to mean things to each other.

56:40.000 --> 56:47.000
But what is generally meant is human engineered.

56:47.000 --> 57:04.000
And this word we use to divide, to distinguish between what a world without humans would naturally produce

57:05.000 --> 57:14.000
and what humans, as we know ourselves, produce. Artificial.

57:14.000 --> 57:29.000
So it looks to me like our species is a strange example of defection from nature that I want to highlight and emphasize and pay very careful attention to.

57:29.000 --> 57:38.000
Because the history and future of life on earth may very well depend on making this specific distinction.

57:38.000 --> 57:56.000
Our ability to make this distinction intelligently with awareness, understanding, insight, recognition of the face of origin, face of living beings.

57:56.000 --> 58:03.000
And the difference between that face and the face of our species at the group level.

58:03.000 --> 58:17.000
Because that's a staggering difference. It's the difference between sunrise and the detonation of a nuclear weapon.

58:17.000 --> 58:24.000
If you can't see that difference, my God, what can you see? You are blind.

58:24.000 --> 58:34.000
You are blind in a way that will just generate further blindnesses in order to justify the blindnesses that have gone, you know, unopposed thus far.

58:47.000 --> 58:55.000
That sound is the opposite of omnicidal fury.

58:59.000 --> 59:15.000
That's the sound, not of speech, but of anciently originating and conserved intelligence, transcendence, origin.

59:17.000 --> 59:22.000
So beautiful. So true.

59:30.000 --> 59:38.000
Absolutely authentic. That's a signal whose content you can absolutely trust.

59:38.000 --> 59:43.000
And whose content may be so profound.

59:43.000 --> 59:48.000
Who knows what's in there, right? Who knows what's in that signal?

59:48.000 --> 01:00:02.000
That's a signal towards transcendence. That's a signal towards the resurrection of the possibilities of intelligence.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:12.000
There's no defection. There's no deception. There's no agenda.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Ma'am, I think you dropped one of your bags back there. Certainly.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:47.000
You see, when I began to speak with the older woman, in the beginning of my speech, she had to go through a series of phases, communication phases, where she evaluated signal for a variety of features, right?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Is the signal deceptive? Is the signal predatory? Is the signal opportunistic?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And as I was speaking, she was doing these evaluations. I could see her doing them. She did not meet my eyes.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:20.000
This is what is known as signal intelligence. And it's fundamental to having minds that have boundaries, right?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
It's fundamental to us and themism.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:38.000
So she had to go through a cascade of evaluations. And after the first ones I mentioned, then came things like, is the signal useful? Is it intelligent?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Is it operationally coherent? Does it matter? Is it important? Is it significant, right? Significant. All these things.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Now, this is what's going on every time we speak or encounter information. We're doing the same cascade.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:17.000
The problem is that the orienting gatekeeping intelligences or features, what I would call sentinels in consciousness, can be captured. They can be overwhelmed.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And social media is made of the tactics that overwhelm these sentinels. So is commercial media.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Even private media has to compete, right? So people like Banksy employ coding strategies that produce the desire to replicate the signal.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:16.000
NAP in the interview with Rogan.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Actually, I'm going to go back to Grush. Grush was talking about his specialization in forms of intelligence and technological weaponized technology that fall under the ages of cyber war.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:04:03.000
And what he was saying was that part of the current landscape or the landscape when this was current for him was something we could call attribution obfuscation, right?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:17.000
So an event occurs, let's say you obliterate the power grid of a nation, right?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:34.000
That's a tactically effective, that's a tactically asymmetric effective military advantage.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But another part of the, if your goal is to fuck people up or kill them or obliterate the coherence of their structured relationships, then there's other layers, right?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Like you can obfuscate who did it or you can plant evidence that makes it look like it came from so-and-so when actually it came from thus and such.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:15.000
And you can also, there's all kinds of sort of signal intelligence aspects of war.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And I mean you can, one can easily cause an enemy to obliterate themselves for you with the right kinds of obfuscation technology and attribution error.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:48.000
I'm not going to detail a variety of scenarios to you, but imagine that the United States, you know, thinks that Russia has launched nukes at it.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
In fact, there are no nukes flying.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:00.000
The U.S. responds as though nukes are flying and ends up gone.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I mean that's a really crudely modeled toy of a situation where you take down large portions of the United States.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Yeah, let's look at a better one.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Say you can take down immediately large portions of the United States energy grid and then attribute it to a foreign actor

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
that had no involvement, you can take out both enemies at the same time, right?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
The United States will take out, try to take out their perceived enemy.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Meanwhile, that perceived enemy had no knowledge or functional relationship to the event and so forth.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:55.000
These are sigint, the weaponization of sigint and identity and conflict, right?

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Weaponizing identity and conflict.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
So, we've come a long way here.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I think what Gresh was talking about in his concerns about cyber war was that the United States is developing technologies that are uncontrollably powerful,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:23.000
particularly with the advent of what we're referring to as artificial intelligence.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And so are other nations and that's going to lead to a race to the bottom of weaponized computational technologies.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Rogan seems to think we are a meat caterpillar engineered to produce a mechanical butterfly.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I got to say like Rogan's cosmological speculations are among the least interesting things I've ever had them as fortunate of listening to.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Even if they are relatively sophisticated just because of his position, right?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
His position is integrative, right?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:26.000
He's standing over a vast array of intelligent and amazing and insightful human beings.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
He's the lynchpin that links all those together.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So that's a highly privileged position.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.000
And actually an intelligent person would go for a position like that very intentionally,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:52.000
not entirely dissimilar to Alan Steinfeld's position in the UFO paranormal, non-ordinary, near-death, shamanism, so forth, communities.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:01.000
That's the sign of a very advanced intelligence to get into the between of all those minds.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.000
So before I'm about to come to a place where there's a lot more noise, unfortunately,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000
but I'm going to talk briefly about the ideas that were in my mind when I first began this recording.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:30.000
So many of you have heard the term synchronicity and it's hard to know exactly what this means.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Once again, we use terms to mean things to each other rather than them just having a meaning as we might otherwise suppose.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Outside of a meaningful conversation, terms don't have much of a meaning.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
They just have denotations, right?

01:09:47.000 --> 01:10:08.000
But synchronicity is commonly taken to mean something resembling a meaningful or benevolent or dangerous array, a cascade of what we would think of as coincidences.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:32.000
The other afternoon, I was in my basement and I was thinking about a text I had sent three days ago to a friend in which it was clear we had the tempo of the communication had been broken.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:42.000
So we were texting back and forth every few minutes and then I texted him and nothing came back.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:51.000
So two or three days later, I was in my basement and I was taking out the garbage and I thought for a moment I brought to mind the sequence of that conversation.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
When I went back up the stairs and looked at my phone, he had responded.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And that's not a mere coincidence.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:15.000
That's what I would call an incident of communicative telepathy, which I've had enough experiences of to know what that feels like, what it looks like, and the difference between that.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:23.000
One of my frenemies likes to say, yeah, you just think it's telepathy because you're not counting the times it failed.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Well, here's the number of times it failed, never.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Because the thing that he's calling a failure doesn't look the same or feel the same as the thing that actually succeeds.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:45.000
But yeah, imagine that you're driving through a city and every time you come to light it's green for like half an hour.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
There's an example.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Now it's possible that you just happen to be in the right place at the right time, but not over 50 stop lights.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Not likely.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:06.000
So synchronicity usually is used to mean a sequence of non-ordinary coincidences.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:32.000
And often there is something like this that happens around the event horizon of a non-ordinary, the emergence of non-ordinary awareness, intelligence.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Or experience in a human or a small group of them.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Sometimes a large group.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Mostly a small group though.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And there's a related phenomenon that we don't usually talk about.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Someone said, for example, to me this morning that my posts on Facebook had often, they felt, had often had a peculiar resonance with what was going on in their life at the, you know, around the time that they found that they encountered these posts.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And this brought to mind something I discovered fairly recently.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
I was probably aware of the principle before.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I didn't have any reasonable way to talk about it.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
So here's how it works.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:14:06.000
If you set up, and this is what can breed madness, mania, paranoia, megalomania, grandiosity, schizogenic, perfusion of conceptual linkages of symbols in experience, but it can also read insight.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
The others are more common, but insight is possible.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:32.000
So what it is, is if you set up in consciousness a set of symbols or persons or situations that you're constantly paying attention to in such a way that it feels like, or may indeed be true,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:50.000
that your future, or your well-being, or the well-being of your family or loved ones, depends upon changes, having a clear understanding of changes in these person situations and so forth.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:02.000
We all do this. We set up these sort of monuments in consciousness that our lives and minds orbit.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:15.000
When we do that, we're setting the character of the frame.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Sometimes we can allow the character of the frame to be set for us by external symbols, for example.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I just walked past a book kiosk in my neighborhood.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Now suppose that I took the titles of those books as precognitively predictive of what I should pay attention to in consciousness.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:03.000
So I'm going to replace whatever framing I might have previously had with the titles of those books, and then I'm going to proceed through the rest of my day.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Perhaps I could go back and read those titles right now, just to give you an example.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I think I don't need to. I can do something simpler.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I'm going to take the sequence of letters and symbols on this license plate, 8ZHY640, and the one that follows it, 8RXZ199.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Now if I keep reading the license plates, what's going to happen?

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
I'm going to notice correspondences.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:56.000
And even if I don't replace the ones I have, like I have some, right?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Is my heart doing okay?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
How's my house?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
About my roommate.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Otherwise known as Let's Talk UFOs on Reddit, who I love.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
My bank accounts.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
The people with whom I'm in fairly regular contact.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.000
The one or two people who either depend on me or I depend on...

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Those beings are all significant.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
We call them anchors in my consciousness, right?

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:46.000
So if you replace those anchors with something, or you add a new anchor and it becomes very interesting to you,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.000
perhaps a love interest, or someone you're afraid of, right?

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Someone you feel is...

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Somebody who someone has a reason to feel is conspiring to harm them.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Perhaps physically, relationally, vocationally, or especially magically.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:23.000
You can see that what tends to happen is if you set up the frame,

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:30.000
then reality warps in consciousness toward the things you've set up as anchors, right?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.000
So this produces the semblance of synchronicity.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
And it's not actually that there isn't any.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000
It's just that it's not necessarily particularly non-ordinary.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Consciousness orients itself with anchors.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000
This is well known in NLP, right? Neurolinguistic programming.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Hypnosis circles. Magicians know this.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Illusionists know it. Darren Brown is a brilliant provocateur who utilizes this to astonish ordinary humans

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and to manipulate them.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000
It must be a very lonely and perhaps grandiose life,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
although I don't know what Darren Brown's life is like.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It's very difficult for me to imagine.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I do know, or at least I have heard, that the castle that he owns

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.000
has many instances of...

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
What's that stuff called?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
What is that stuff called?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Not stuffed animals, but preserved, carefully embalmed creatures.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Yeah, the word almost came to me.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
A book has just arrived. Do I take this as significant?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000
It's Paul L. Ward's Selected Writings,

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:23.000
which I found the book cover for in my room but could not locate the volume for.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Yeah, I can't. My hippocampus is failing to find the word.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
It's on the edge of my tongue. I'm sure it'll come to me.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:51.000
So, we create the anchors that our sentinels, our watchers, pay attention to,

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.000
and then we interpret reality according to transformations in the field

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:02.000
in between the anchors.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000
So, this is likely to look metaphysically significant.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000
If somebody's, for example, if someone is paying inordinate attention to my posts

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.000
and the time and the day on which they occur,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
it's very likely that there will be two effects.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:28.000
One, an interpretive effect where they will feel that I'm precognitive

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
or in some way influencing their situation.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And the second one, more like the latter, that I may be predictively aware

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:46.000
or actively, magically, so to speak, transforming their situation.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:53.000
And this is what I want to highlight is frame collapse.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
So, we should be aware both, we should be aware, okay.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
This is a power for those of us who understand it.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It's not a power to manipulate other human beings.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
That's a malignant use of power.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
It's a power to transform situations if we understand it clearly.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
It's a power to transform our own minds, our futures, our destinies,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000
our memories, our dreaming, our relationships.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.000
It's this kind of a power.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
So, we should, but it's also a danger, right?

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
It's a danger in that we may think we're having metaphysical insight

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
or experience when actually what is happening is our consciousness

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:40.000
is responding to the peculiar way we have set up.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
That's interesting.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
That's familiar to me.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I wonder if this book is around.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:23:01.000
The peculiar way we have set up the anchors in concern, right?

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:08.000
In interest and in awareness.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Yeah, that's okay.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:16.000
It's a little bit old, but it's all right with me.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I have my Paul L. Ward book that I have long had the cover to

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
but can't find the book for.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
By the way, I love me some Paul L. Ward.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Of course, in translation, I guess.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
All right, so pay attention to the possibilities,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
not nearly a frame collapse, but a frame establishment.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
If we can select really good anchors,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
we're going to get a completely different mode of awareness,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:48.000
possibilities of learning intelligence, sensitivity,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
possibilities of fulfilling the purposes for which we established

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
sentinels in the first place,

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
especially if we do this together, right?

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Because these potentials are radically magnified

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:05.000
in even small groups of highly motivated,

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
highly relationally motivated individual,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
quote, individual humans.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
And then I'm just going to touch on the second topic,

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
the multiple world topic before I wrap up for today.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
So yes, of course, there's this multiple world theory

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
in physics, whatever, who cares.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I doubt it.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I very, very much doubt it.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I think that theory will either be overturned

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
or be shown to have been extremely partial.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
In other words, what you get are tiny, little,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.000
para-candidate universes, most of which never persist

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
or only partially emerge.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
But I think the theory is a misunderstanding

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000
of something fundamental about nature and time-space.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I strongly suspect that anyway.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
So yeah, what I want to talk about is different.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:13.000
What I want to talk about is that there are billions of worlds right here.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:20.000
We think the world matches up with our usually extremely limited

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
experience and awareness of it.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
We think we know what the world is, what humans are,

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
what's being done, what isn't being done,

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
who's doing it, who isn't doing it,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
what's possible what isn't, what's historically accurate what isn't,

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000
what's futurially accessible what isn't.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000
All these things we think we know them based on the incredibly narrow

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
little slice of reality that we get exposed to, most of us,

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:51.000
and some of us have realized through experiment and so forth

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
that, wow, if we step outside that slice,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
things get really astonishingly diverse and interesting.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
So for example, I have never traveled.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:09.000
My little slice of reality is super tiny as far as my human stuff goes.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Nature, a bit different than most humans.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Time-space, different from most humans,

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:22.000
because I've had contact with non-human intelligences.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And very, very few humans who claim that have had anything resembling

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
coherent contact with NHI.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
But my little slice of life, if I were to determine what the world is,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000
based on what media reaches me and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000
I'd be thinking about the world from the perspective of less than,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I don't know, a millionth of a percent of it.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.000
So what I want to make clear is that what's actually going on,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
the world is billions of worlds.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.000
There are worlds of human life so far beyond anything you've ever imagined

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
that they might as well be other universes and they're all around us.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Ordinarily what limits us to some degree,

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:22.000
the two primary limiting factors in our world are proximity and wealth.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Wealth doesn't totally liberate you.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
In fact, it can trap you in many ways if you start out with it especially.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:38.000
But a close friend has lived a life of not entire impoverishment,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
but relative poverty.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And he lives in a place where it seems like his prospects are very limited.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Recent events have demonstrated to him that they might be far less limited

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
than he'd ever imagined and that there might even be a couple of avenues

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:02.000
to what could qualify as spaceflight for him in terms of his lived experience

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
of being human on Earth.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
So what I'm trying to get at is like there are groups of people

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000
and people who are so profoundly advanced and fascinating and alive,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
intelligent and confusing, brilliant and so forth,

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
that are nothing like what we think the world is like.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
This is a world of a billion worlds.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:26.000
People who travel eventually get some kind of a taste of this.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I have never done that.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I know from having been above,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I know from having what the overview effect that space travelers have experienced,

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000
which happened to William Shatner and many of the astronauts, right?

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000
They see, oh my God, this is a tiny little droplet of water and a vast immensity.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Unimaginable.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.000
So what I want you to understand is do not ever think that your capacities are limited

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
to what you've experienced thus far.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
If you can achieve, find a way to achieve meaningful coherent escape velocity

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
from the tiny little slice of life that you've become habituated to

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000
and that is familiar to you and may feel safe even if it's miserable,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.000
outside that there is a billion universes right here on this planet.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000
The continents are different worlds.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Think about history, right?

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Think about what was going on in what we call Peru when Egypt was thriving.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
What was going on in China when Egypt was thriving?

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000
What was going on in Antarctica before it was frozen?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:47.000
There are many worlds right here and there are billions of unique human worlds.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Indeed, every little shop or home that you enter is like a womb or a universe.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000
It's unique, it's profound, it's a completely different way of life.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:04.000
So I may pursue this topic further in upcoming recordings.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:18.000
I'm only giving it a provisional sort of tale and glance before I wrap up here for today.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
But as always, I'm so grateful to have this time with you.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
So thankful for those of you who pay attention to my recordings

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.000
and particularly those of you who support them, like them, share them,

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
ask questions, leave comments and so forth since that's...

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:39.000
If you're getting some value here, remember that I don't allow advertising,

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
which would be really ironic if I did, so I can't.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
There's no way.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
So it's your support that I depend on.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I'm just so grateful to have this time together.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:56.000
I'm really looking forward to our next adventures in awareness,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:03.000
and amnesis, and mutual wonder.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Thank you for joining me.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:10.000
I look forward to learning together again very soon.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:17.000
May your ways be blessed and beautiful, and may your dreams be profound and rich

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
as your relationships live for now.
