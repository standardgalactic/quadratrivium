0	12320	Hello, everybody.
12320	18400	Welcome.
18400	27920	It's sometime on a Gregorian Monday afternoon in March of 2024.
27920	41920	This is the weirdest year in the history of my life.
41920	50920	I'm out for a wander.
50920	58920	I'm by tracks on the path.
58920	64920	I don't know if any of my ancestors were skillful trackers,
64920	72920	but there is a kind of a genetic predisposition I suspect.
72920	80920	I suspect this from knowing members of my family
80920	98920	and watching them in various situational contexts.
98920	108920	My mother used to have an annoying habit,
108920	118920	and I recently discovered some letters from him to my mother in his teenage, late teens.
118920	130920	I think they were 17 or something.
130920	134920	There were some letters from him that I haven't actually read.
134920	138920	I've only seen the beginning of one of them.
138920	152920	He was about to launch into a dissertation on a system that he had stumbled on in his observational mind.
152920	166920	A system for getting a perspective on people and situations that might be understood as preternatural.
166920	182920	He implies that in the following letters he will encode a system.
182920	184920	A system of seeing.
184920	192920	He never spoke of this during my life,
192920	200920	but he did seem to have an uncanny influence among humans,
200920	204920	and sometimes with dogs.
204920	214920	But the annoying habit that he had was he understood the language of film,
214920	224920	and he could see very quickly from the observation of subtle cues what was about to take place,
224920	228920	and I thought to myself, I remember thinking to myself as a kid,
228920	232920	of course my mother would become very angry with this.
232920	234920	You're ruining it.
234920	238920	My dad would sort of chuckle.
238920	242920	It's obvious, but I thought this was very peculiar.
242920	248920	I didn't know anyone else at the time, had no experience of others with this skill,
248920	250920	and sometimes his predictions would be uncanny, right?
250920	260920	He was a bit of a detective.
260920	270920	Similarly, other members of my family, particularly my sister,
270920	282920	display an almost dangerous awareness of tiny details that others cannot see,
282920	290920	or do not notice.
290920	296920	With most of my male friends, I can quickly predict where they're going to go conversationally,
296920	302920	and this is perhaps part of the experience of being intimate as human beings.
302920	318920	In a sense, we form a kind of a shared mind space that includes both of us, but is beyond ourselves.
318920	324920	An in-between mind.
324920	335920	Last night I had a very strong experience of the texting equivalent of telephone telepathy.
335920	340920	A picture of my friend whose name begins with J came into my mind,
340920	348920	and immediately I then was doing something on my phone after that,
348920	351920	and he had just sent me a text.
351920	365920	I don't use notifications on my phone, and I've had a number of situations like that.
365920	380920	A long time ago, I'd had a very enthusiastic and profound conversation with a friend in Morocco.
380920	387920	This is one of the most peculiar examples of it.
387920	399920	When we closed the call, a few minutes later I got an effusive text from her about how wonderful our conversation was,
399920	409920	and how it makes her feel really happy.
409920	417920	It was quite, this is actually so blatant as to seem ridiculous.
417920	422920	She described tasting a peach flavor in her mouth that was so delicious,
422920	431920	and all these went on for two or three sentences effusively.
431920	446920	After the call, I was eating a piece of peach gum, a very strongly flavored peach gum from Japan.
447920	454920	Naturally, if we don't find a good reason to form up against one another,
454920	460920	to object or to play domination games,
460920	467920	then I think we as humans generally, and I'll speak only from my own experience,
467920	469920	but I've watched other people doing it.
469920	472920	We get into a situation where we can complete other sentences,
472920	478920	and there are circumstances under which non-ordinary communication takes place.
478920	483920	I wouldn't argue that the cell phone is separate from that communication.
483920	493920	In fact, though it's not the kind I want, it provides a physical link.
493920	500920	There's a physical link that extends to many, many humans in that phone.
500920	511920	And like many of our technologies, I don't think the humans have reflected carefully enough
511920	514920	upon what that actually turns out to mean.
514920	519920	Because it means that if human minds naturally form networks,
519920	533920	they're now going to form networks in spite of or as a result of technologies
533920	540920	that restructure our networks according to mechanical principles.
540920	545920	For organisms, that doesn't usually go well.
545920	561920	For disembodied humans imagining some kind of eternal life in the body of a robot or something,
561920	567920	maybe it goes well, but it tends to end organismal development on living planets.
567920	575920	As we can see from our own behavior, we don't even need a second example yet.
575920	583920	So the smartphones do, our technologies, affect what I call the Cognizium.
583920	596920	And what I mean by this is a topology that isn't merely physical and is like an environment
596920	603920	in that certain kinds of things can undergo developmental, quote, competition,
603920	607920	unquote, within that environment and be transmitted.
607920	613920	This is a bit, this resembles slightly, or perhaps more than slightly,
613920	616920	Sheldrake's theories of morphic resonance.
616920	618920	Excuse me, resonance.
618920	620920	That's interesting, resonance.
620920	622920	Amorphic resonance.
622920	624920	I guess maybe that's what a mind is like.
624920	628920	Amorphic resonance.
628920	632920	But I'm not trying to explain what I think is the case, right?
632920	634920	What I think is true.
634920	636920	I'm not sure what is true.
636920	640920	If someone says, you know, what are the facts?
640920	647920	We could probably do studies that would validate or invalidate the idea
647920	651920	if our science has advanced enough to chase such matters.
651920	657920	And if our perspectival orientations are heuristically sound, right?
657920	659920	They will teach us for sure.
659920	669920	They won't mislead us by causing us to misconstrue the results of data acquisition
669920	675920	or data gathering and analysis.
675920	685920	So, in my family, it's common for us,
685920	693920	and honestly, I think my mother had a similar array of senses,
693920	702920	whereas my father's were relatively, almost mechanically empirical seeming.
702920	705920	He had a method, right?
705920	710920	He was running a protocol or a series of them,
710920	712920	and possibly parallel.
712920	718920	My mother was more of an intuitive person,
718920	723920	but also could see...
723920	727920	She was, in a way, the sort of perfect match for my dad's strange intelligence,
727920	736920	because she could see into the emotional spectrum of humans and animals
736920	738920	and living places and things.
738920	742920	And she had long ago learned not to talk much about it.
742920	751920	As any person who wants to survive in the relatively harsh climate of human culture,
751920	756920	most of us do learn to shut a lot of that down
756920	764920	or at least hide it from common perv, right?
764920	769920	We save it for conversations with trusted people
769920	780920	who either share our values and the urgencies of our interiority
780920	788920	and our ethical concerns and our moral concerns and our relational concerns.
788920	793920	We may save it for those usually rare situations,
793920	798920	unless we form a group, right?
798920	802920	If we form a group or if we join an existing group,
802920	808920	then we may find ourselves in the company, generally speaking,
808920	812920	of others of, quote, like-mind, unquote,
812920	817920	which I'm not sure that really means like-mind.
818920	827920	I don't know what those principles shining in our hearts and bones
827920	831920	and ancestors and lineages, what are those principles?
831920	834920	Are those mind?
834920	845920	I find it confusing.
845920	848920	But that may be.
848920	854920	It's funny, the gentleman I just saw resembles a guy who was in my dream last night
854920	858920	or actually this morning.
858920	866920	Yeah, it looks like my family, my core family,
866920	873920	they all have a peculiarity about noticing tiny divergences from that
873920	877920	which is expected or the ordinary.
877920	887920	And I also tend to pay attention to the ground when I am walking.
887920	901920	So I will see occasionally something that stands out.
901920	904920	I never really learned to track.
904920	908920	I had little opportunity to do so.
908920	915920	But I did pursue a slightly similar discipline.
915920	923920	I learned to interpret, I learned to diagnose problems with computers
923920	927920	which usually aren't hardware.
927920	929920	It can be.
929920	938920	But almost all of the problems I was diagnosing were problems with the operating system
938920	950920	or the software is installed or an associated file on the computer that had become corrupted
950920	956920	or problems with the directory of the disk.
956920	961920	And I became quite skillful at intuiting.
961920	966920	Even if I couldn't find the problem which most of the time I tried to do.
966920	969920	I wanted a theory.
969920	971920	I think it's this.
971920	973920	And then test it.
973920	974920	Nope, wasn't that.
974920	976920	Okay, next.
976920	981920	And just go through a sort of decision tree which by the way if you call Apple this is what they do.
981920	986920	The text have a book.
986920	991920	But I was that book for a long time.
991920	994920	So I'm really good with Apple stuff.
994920	997920	Generally, having affinity for it.
997920	1003920	And preferred that OS over the other extant OSs.
1003920	1008920	Each of which has their unique benefits, whatever.
1008920	1012920	And of course this exposure and the exposure to computer programming
1012920	1015920	got me to think in very unique ways about the mind.
1015920	1018920	Now rather than like many technologists deciding like,
1018920	1023920	oh the mind is a computer.
1023920	1027920	When I was a teenager I had already, and I was first exposed to computers
1027920	1031920	and fascinated with their possibilities.
1031920	1037920	Kind of in love with them as a device.
1037920	1040920	I became interested in artificial intelligence.
1040920	1045920	I was reading Ray Kurzweil and stuff in my late teens.
1045920	1051920	And as a science fiction reader I had long, right, in the,
1051920	1059920	in what the 60s we saw examples in on TV.
1059920	1066920	Of computers that we could speak to.
1066920	1071920	And they would respond and do data analysis
1071920	1076920	and suggest solutions to various things
1076920	1082920	and eliminate theories of identity or cause.
1082920	1084920	No, it's not that.
1084920	1087920	And so forth.
1087920	1091920	So, you know, by the time I was a teenager
1091920	1100920	the idea of artificial intelligence was quite well seeded in my awareness.
1100920	1103920	Now back then it never occurred to me that human minds form networks.
1103920	1107920	This is something that's obvious whether you believe my cognizium model or not.
1107920	1112920	I'm not asking you to believe the model that I call the cognizium.
1112920	1120920	Which is a model that was shown to me by another intelligence as an example.
1120920	1129920	Look at it like this for a moment. See it like this.
1129920	1133920	And as I've commonly said lately there are perspectives that are very profound.
1133920	1136920	They're not profound based on whether they are true or not.
1136920	1140920	They're profound based on whether they deliver useful intelligence,
1140920	1145920	opportunity, protections, so forth.
1171920	1178920	It's challenging when, for me,
1178920	1186920	when another human being enters what I consider my personal space, right?
1186920	1197920	Sort of the bubble within, I don't know, a foot of the surface of my skin.
1197920	1200920	As if I'm not there.
1200920	1203920	Or as if the fact that they're moving quickly
1203920	1212920	liberates them from the respect of other people's sort of private body space.
1212920	1218920	That's quite challenging.
1218920	1223920	Most of the time I don't bristle, but sometimes I do.
1223920	1230920	And I wonder what that's all about.
1230920	1238920	I mean, I get some of the basic stuff, right?
1238920	1245920	And occasionally it seems as though this is being done on purpose.
1245920	1254920	A sort of gleeful entitlement to intrude on the space of others who are moving more slowly.
1254920	1263920	Hopefully that's rarely going on.
1263920	1272920	And for the sake of not, what?
1272920	1277920	Not fomenting conflict, physical conflict?
1277920	1281920	I normally ignore it.
1281920	1283920	At least I don't respond, right?
1283920	1289920	I don't say, hey, blah, blah, blah, what are you doing?
1289920	1291920	There might be exceptions.
1291920	1294920	I haven't come across any yet.
1294920	1310920	But I don't enjoy it.
1310920	1317920	So when I was walking on the path earlier, I noticed splash pattern.
1317920	1320920	This loops back to where I began.
1320920	1327920	I'm recursing on the topic that led to the filial awareness of little details,
1327920	1333920	which, by the way, can become really problematic for human cognition.
1333920	1345920	Primarily because if you have this proclivity, if you enact this inclination to observe details,
1345920	1353920	then hypervigilance and its dangers are not too far away.
1353920	1363920	Now you start to see a pattern in the tiny details.
1363920	1370920	And thinking that no one else sees these details,
1370920	1384920	this pattern-matching aspect of consciousness tends to acquire a unique form of authority in consciousness.
1384920	1392920	And this can lead to lots of trouble, delusions, megalomania, paranoia, schizophrenia.
1392920	1403920	These are just labels, but they are useful in broadly circumscribing various kinds of human experience,
1403920	1417920	even though I understand the modern concern with diagnostic labels
1417920	1424920	and to some degree share it.
1424920	1434920	The way that I generally cope with that for myself is I distinguish between clinical, casual, analytical,
1434920	1442920	and various kinds of conversation or purpose.
1442920	1453920	Certainly, for example, if something is wrong with us and we can take two very different examples,
1453920	1459920	we can imagine someone going to a Western doctor, let's take three.
1459920	1465920	And the Western doctor has an algorithmic chart in their mind.
1465920	1469920	They're a bit of a detective, they're meant to be clinical, not personal.
1469920	1480920	This is how this branch of medicine functions.
1480920	1490920	I can't remember the technical term.
1490920	1499920	There's allopaths, osteopaths, homeopaths.
1499920	1503920	I think there's one more. It might be allopaths that I'm talking about.
1503920	1512920	Anyway, we go to the doctor and we tell them something about what's going on with us.
1512920	1516920	I was listening to a doctor talk about this, actually.
1516920	1520920	He said that people come and they want a diagnosis.
1520920	1527920	He was saying that to diagnose a human being's condition, unless it's something very obvious right away,
1527920	1536920	where you run down a few algorithms and you can run a test.
1536920	1544920	You can try something and see if it affects the condition, and if so, how?
1544920	1547920	But he said people come and they want a diagnosis right away.
1547920	1554920	Well, if you're going to a doctor, categories kind of matter, don't they?
1554920	1561920	The doctor takes a nose swab and says, okay, you have an infection of X
1561920	1567920	and it's moving to another part of your body or something like this, right?
1567920	1570920	And they may want to prescribe antibiotics or whatever they do.
1570920	1573920	And some of that stuff is devastating.
1573920	1582920	Humans aren't all the same thing and diseases aren't all the same thing and just health problems.
1582920	1586920	But you kind of do want a categorical answer, right?
1586920	1598920	So if you hurt your limb, if one of your limbs is somehow injured, may you be protected from injury?
1598920	1605920	Then you want to know, you know, in one of the four or five ways that I can imagine that it can be hurt,
1605920	1609920	which one is it hurt?
1609920	1611920	For example, does it need to be immobilized?
1611920	1614920	Immobilization is a category.
1614920	1618920	A broken bone is a category.
1618920	1623920	A broken bone is empirically demonstrable via X-ray.
1623920	1635920	Very unlikely that something affects the X-ray machine to produce a visible break in the anatomy of a bone
1635920	1638920	and there's actually no problem with the bone.
1638920	1645920	It probably has happened with humans attempting to deceive each other on purpose or something,
1645920	1651920	but probably extremely unlikely in other cases.
1651920	1654920	So when we go to the doctor, that doctor, we want categories.
1654920	1666920	And another person goes to a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine.
1666920	1672920	This person is more osteopathic and they tend to treat the whole person.
1672920	1678920	That's the idea of osteopathic medicine, I believe, treat the whole person.
1678920	1689920	TCM is similar but very old and involves things like humors, heat and cold, moist and dry,
1689920	1697920	fluid or stagnant, dynamic or stagnant.
1697920	1707920	These kinds of principles and it examines sort of the energetic body of the person.
1707920	1717920	And thus includes treatments such as herbs and acupuncture and sometimes cupping or acupressure
1717920	1726920	or the stimulation of Qi, life energy in a specific, along a specific meridian
1726920	1729920	and perhaps centering on one or more organs.
1729920	1740920	But still, when you go to the TCM doctor, she will say,
1740920	1746920	you know, your liver Qi is very weak and your heart Qi is too much.
1746920	1752920	We have to balance them.
1752920	1755920	And here's what I recommend and then we'll try this.
1755920	1762920	They are also somewhat experimental.
1762920	1768920	And then you could go, now I don't actually know what a session with an indigenous medicine healer
1768920	1771920	would be likely to look at, to look like.
1771920	1773920	I can imagine, I imagine things.
1773920	1778920	And so what I'm talking about here are just my imaginings.
1778920	1786920	And in case someone ever says to us something that resembles,
1786920	1792920	you don't have the right to imagine or speak of your imaginings.
1792920	1800920	Well, I'm not going to agree with that probably ever.
1800920	1806920	And if there are highly motivated individuals who want to come to me and say like,
1806920	1815920	you know, accusations of appropriation or whatever the violation is,
1815920	1821920	I will listen for a time and I will reflect on what they say.
1821920	1836920	But the urge to take that kind of offense is problematical.
1836920	1844920	I mistrust it in many of its common implementations.
1844920	1848920	That said, if you went to an indigenous person,
1848920	1854920	they might say many different things.
1854920	1863920	And it almost, in this case, the category will also be discussed.
1863920	1867920	It's this kind of a problem.
1867920	1870920	I'm going to make something up here out of whole cloth.
1870920	1878920	When you cross that stream to get to the place where you got your food,
1878920	1889920	you did not take time to recognize the stream, the waters there, the living waters there.
1889920	1893920	And they're not used to that.
1893920	1895920	So they are angry at you.
1895920	1899920	We must appease them.
1899920	1908920	Now, this might sound like nonsense to an empiricist.
1908920	1918920	Nonetheless, the often astonishing efficacy of non-ordinary interventions
1918920	1930920	granted that many of them are in our world and in our time, many of them are fake, right?
1930920	1942920	Or possibly delusional, the ones that we are likely to encounter in western culture and so forth.
1942920	1946920	Commonly fake.
1946920	1952920	Or often, sometimes delusional.
1952920	1957920	But there are lots of diseases that are not merely physical.
1957920	1963920	And the allopath can't do doodly squat about that.
1963920	1971920	The homeopath, well, that's basically a religion.
1971920	1980920	It's very difficult to disambiguate that.
1980920	1990920	An empiricist, materialist, you know, person who is very upset about the idea that there are metaphysical models at all
1990920	1998920	will certainly point out the many studies that have failed to show any effect.
1998920	2001920	I'm not here to comment on that.
2001920	2008920	What I'm actually concerned with is just that when we go to see a healer,
2008920	2016920	there will probably, and it's almost certainly better if there isn't in some ways, particularly if they're very skillful, right?
2016920	2027920	If they're really skillful, it might be better not to say anything about what the actual problem is and just to deal with it.
2027920	2030920	But we expect, you know, categories.
2030920	2038920	And when you go to the store, there are no products there.
2038920	2045920	There are precisely zero products that don't belong to any category.
2045920	2051920	It's a, it's a metaproduct, right?
2051920	2053920	It doesn't belong to any category.
2053920	2055920	It's not food.
2055920	2057920	It's not pet supplies.
2057920	2059920	It's not kitchen gear.
2059920	2067920	It's not some branch of food, vegetable, animal, you know.
2067920	2082920	There's, you will never buy at the grocery store something that you don't understand what category of thing it is.
2082920	2087920	And now that I've introduced the topic that preceded my beginning of this recording,
2087920	2092920	I'm going to go back again and circle back to the beginning.
2092920	2106920	I was walking on the path and, you know, I do notice details and frankly this detail is fairly, it's not subtle.
2106920	2110920	There's some splash marks on the asphalt.
2110920	2114920	They are darker than they should be.
2114920	2118920	They're clearly not something that is being tracked, right?
2118920	2135920	They're not something stuck to the bottom of someone's shoe making an impression every step or every other step or something.
2135920	2145920	And the, the Stellar's Jay family is here.
2145920	2150920	I recognize their filial chatter.
2150920	2153920	Another network intelligence, right?
2153920	2162920	Tightly, intimately filial, a little pod of Stellar's Jay's.
2162920	2179920	They're adventuring together, protecting one another, looking out for one another, sharing knowledge, skillfulness.
2179920	2188920	So I was walking along the path and I saw splash marks and they're dark and they had a reddish tint even though it was very,
2188920	2192920	that was modestly subtle.
2192920	2209920	And they occurred at intervals of approximately perhaps six to eight feet and sometimes longer and sometimes shorter.
2209920	2216920	They went on for quite some time, they disappeared, they started up again, they disappeared.
2216920	2223920	And, you know, it looks like blood.
2223920	2238920	Now, there are people, perhaps wisely, who would say something resembling, do not interact with such things.
2238920	2244920	They don't even concern your mind with them, right?
2244920	2250920	This will tarnish your mind.
2250920	2255920	But you will get some of it on you in a way so as to become unclean, right?
2255920	2266920	And there are many ancient traditions and spiritual traditions.
2274920	2303920	That are, that contain very complex systems of what must be avoided, when to avoid it, when not to avoid it.
2303920	2312920	And also some things that are declarative commandments, you know, you must do this.
2312920	2315920	But a lot of avoidances, right?
2315920	2332920	There are vast books of such things that seem to arise perennially throughout the, what comes down to us in written form of older peoples.
2332920	2354920	And I suspect about these books that, while sometimes intelligent, right?
2354920	2360920	Some of this stuff, there's traditional knowledge encoded in it.
2360920	2368920	But the encoding normally is handed down family to family, tribe to tribe and so on.
2368920	2372920	I mean, within a given people.
2372920	2379920	And sometimes exchanged, perhaps, that maybe there's some crosstalk between peoples about this.
2379920	2387920	But this looks to me like the evidence of a problem.
2387920	2404920	A problem where the corpus of the traditions within the people has been lost.
2404920	2415920	And someone's trying to forge a sort of a counterfeit or a replacement for it.
2415920	2426920	And thus it is that, for example, it's a well-known, I suppose it's a well-known tradition among Blackfoot people, according to my friend, Ryan First-Diver,
2426920	2430920	that if a bird flies into your house, you have to kill it.
2430920	2432920	Otherwise bad things will happen.
2432920	2443920	Now this looks to me like the remnant of something that somehow got promoted to first a principal, right?
2443920	2445920	And then a law.
2445920	2447920	Obviously this is not so.
2447920	2455920	And also obviously, just thinking rationally, any event can produce.
2455920	2463920	Any event can be causally linked to some future result.
2463920	2470920	And we can get really busy analyzing the opposite, right?
2470920	2477920	It didn't fall down on the path today and that led to me losing my wallet later.
2477920	2485920	Because I left my wallet somewhere and it disappeared.
2485920	2493920	It's funny, you know, there's a problem in English for me as someone who's aware of human psychies and cognition.
2493920	2495920	There's a problem.
2495920	2508920	And the attempt to avoid it is really confusing because to properly avoid it one has to kind of avoid certain purposes in speech.
2508920	2515920	And one of them is to alert others to a flaw or a danger.
2515920	2526920	By doing this, inadvertently, there's psyche, there's features of the psyche that invert what we're saying.
2526920	2529920	So I'm really not sure what to do about that.
2529920	2544920	It's a very peculiar feature of human cognition and psychology that involves problems with prohibitions and taboos.
2544920	2552920	It doesn't merely make them more interesting, though, you know, there is a natural proclivity.
2552920	2564920	If someone says, don't do this, there's some, you know, however modest aspect of ourselves that sees that as a challenge or,
2564920	2570920	well, I need to do that and find out why they said that or, you know, whatever, right? Something like this.
2570920	2581920	We're really strangely self-conflicting and some of us more than others and under certain, you know, situations or under stress or whatever it more so.
2581920	2588920	I'm going to leave off on that topic because it's not crucially important, but you can see the problem, right?
2588920	2597920	If the bird comes in the house and has to kill it or bad things happen, this has to do probably with a bird coming into a house in a story
2597920	2603920	that is fundamentally traditional.
2603920	2611920	I don't really mean a story because it's not really what they are, nor are they the same thing as myths,
2611920	2624920	but maybe cultural, hmm, I wish my friend Ryan were here, he could tell me, he could help me see better anyway.
2624920	2646920	They often involve origins and histories and specific characters who are often both human and somehow primordial at the same time
2646920	2656920	or are primarily primordial, like the sun, for example.
2656920	2675920	These stories have in them principles of a kind of knowledge that has been mostly lost because nature is not understood by western minds, so to speak.
2676920	2685920	So I saw the splashes and you can see already in my mind, there's a category thing going on here.
2685920	2695920	Well, first is what is that and then what's the frequency and then how old is it, how old does it look and was someone hurt here?
2695920	2697920	Did somebody suffer?
2697920	2704920	Was there, you know, this is near a street, there are many animals here.
2704920	2723920	Animals can get hit by cars, especially at night here, so I'm looking and I'm tracking the shape, the splash patterns, color, trying to figure out how old it is.
2723920	2746920	Now, even I am aware of two principles, similitude and contagion.
2746920	2766920	These are the words that my friend Ryan uses and I was aware of them in my own way before he spoke of how pervasive they are in the Blackfoot way of life.
2766920	2774920	What we might think of as tradition, but we'd be half wrong at least.
2774920	2794920	A way of thinking about relationships and transformation, a way of thinking about safety and taking care of one another and the living places and the living beings.
2794920	2823920	Two fundamental principles in the topic that might slightly equate to the topic of magic or one of the dumbest words the humans ever made, which is nonetheless still useful, the supernatural.
2824920	2833920	The mysterious relational exchanges that happen outside our efficacious model systems.
2833920	2844920	So I'm approaching where the splashes begin and I'm not so OCD about it that I counted them or anything.
2845920	2863920	The first splashes here, the next one is six and a half feet, then inches, then three feet, then two feet, then inches, then two feet, and so forth.
2864920	2874920	And the splashes point east. Creatures traveling eastward. Whatever's making the splashes is traveling eastward.
2874920	2898920	And they begin in a specific spot and they continue. They acquire relative regularity, which is mostly more than what an average person's gate would connect.
2904920	2923920	If someone were running, if a human were running, for example, and had either cut themselves or had a nosebleed, but then they stopped for quite some time and, you know, it's hard for me to imagine what it could be if it isn't blood.
2923920	2936920	But even I do not interact with such things directly. Like, I'm not unaware of the principle of contagion, but neither do I.
2936920	2947920	And here there's a lot and there's a short, yeah, here they're almost a pace, they're a pace apart and there's more.
2947920	2957920	And it's a long sequence, right? We're talking about like 100, 150 yards.
2957920	2966920	No, I don't know what happened and I'm not trying to disturb my listeners at the same time.
2966920	2975920	I mean, this is just part of my experience that, you know, I'm experiencing today.
2975920	2987920	But I am curious. I have an aspect of my intelligence that when it sees things tries to reconstruct them from evidence.
2987920	3005920	And obviously there's only certain kinds of things that arouse this interest in me, but tracks arouse this interest.
3005920	3016920	And I guess anything having to do with blood would certainly ring that little bell in my consciousness.
3016920	3029920	I don't know what I make of that. I think it's probably blood, but it also looks a little pinkish, like anemic if it's blood.
3029920	3036920	And I don't think it could be spilling. I mean, that's not true.
3036920	3046920	I think it's plausible that it's at least possible that somebody was like carrying something and spilling it every few feet for 150 yards.
3046920	3052920	It just seems wildly unlikely to me. It looks like something got hurt.
3052920	3070920	And I don't know. But you can see that my concern begins not with, oh, there's some marks on the pavement, but with the categorical concern.
3070920	3077920	Are these marks blood? What is it? What are these?
3082920	3108920	The geese are signaling. I mean, it's a display.
3108920	3119920	And it's probably a lot more complex than what I'm inclined to think is a human, because we're inclined to think things like, oh, it's a territorial incursion.
3119920	3131920	The males are, you know, got their hackles up, because it does appear that one of the groups is pursuing the other one from the shore to far away.
3131920	3147920	And the other group appears to be sort of trying to get out of eye shot, but these are human interpretations.
3147920	3156920	Now where I'm going to go from here is quite complicated.
3156920	3173920	Because I'm going to talk a little bit about how it is both true that categories can be used in tyrannical ways by humans with untrustworthy motives.
3173920	3185920	But also, it's unreasonable to suppose that we can just do away with them at will. Very unreasonable to suppose this.
3185920	3195920	There are purposes for which the intelligent suspension of categories turns out to be very useful.
3195920	3211920	And there are other purposes, especially if anyone should go around declaring aggressively that categories are some...
3211920	3240920	The active categorization in human consciousness descends or arises from colonizing patriarchal, authoritarian,
3241920	3252920	traditions. Are they involved? Yes, they are involved. Is our category tree screwy? Yes, it is screwy.
3252920	3265920	Do we get stuff wrong with it all the time?
3270920	3288920	We are in our time faced with very strange situations that are profoundly confusing to attempt to understand or amend.
3288920	3304920	Involving the intentional weaponization of a variety of features of conceptual thought.
3304920	3332920	And it's clear to me, at least it seems relatively clear, that a goodly portion of this is intentional sci-opping made contagious by social media.
3332920	3345920	And media in general.
3345920	3367920	I know for certain that there exist companies that sell these services as a weapon to countries with military agendas.
3368920	3394920	Again, one of the ways that I manage to deal with my own exposure.
3394920	3412920	I view media. I use the internet. I have a Facebook account, a Twitter account I nearly never use.
3412920	3433920	Someone has been very energetically attempting to hack my Facebook account for some time now.
3433920	3441920	I have exposure and part of how I deal with that exposure is compartmentalization.
3441920	3453920	You can think of it in a similar way as if you had to be really concerned about contagion at your house.
3453920	3472920	You might respond to the necessity in various ways. You might have staging areas where, for example, when we come home, there is a specific area where we put things that are going to be brought into the home.
3472920	3491920	If we don't take our shoes off at the door, we take them off near the street and there is a staging area.
3491920	3495920	So we had quite a pause there.
3495920	3512920	I'm going to change the topic a bit. I'm going to bookmark where I was. It was categories and how their intentional distortion.
3522920	3543920	The usefulness and dangers underneath the common behaviors that we see in various cohorts, primarily in the United States or in the western nations.
3543920	3546920	I'll come back to that.
3546920	3564920	When you grow up in the same city, you live in one city most or all of your life for a long time, long ago anyway, and I don't know how common it is these days, it seems less common.
3564920	3583920	But there are certain kinds of people or certain instances of humans that are quite eccentric and also what you might think of as local color.
3583920	3588920	They tend to not be wealthy people.
3588920	3595920	The wealthy people can be eccentric.
3595920	3611920	And they tend to form a bit of a following, right? Their characters.
3611920	3615920	I am one of them.
3615920	3626920	I remember in Santa Rosa there was a pair of twin women, older women, they were elderly by the time I knew them, and clearly they had been famous there and their youth were very well known.
3626920	3633920	There was also a woman named Pepper who always wore all red.
3633920	3645920	There is an older woman in my neighborhood who I've known actually for quite some time, who almost always wears only white, but sometimes red on top of it.
3645920	3653920	And then there's the woman that I just met, Nancy DeStefanis, who is well known here as the Heron Lady.
3653920	3664920	Now this lake has just been renamed Blue Heron Lake, and for many years in a dead tree on one of the islands, it's a man-made lake here.
3664920	3667920	It used to be called Stow Lake.
3667920	3674920	Five to seven, it was a social tree, right? Five to seven Heron nests every season.
3674920	3683920	But storms broke a lot of the old dead trees' extensions off, and so the Herons have moved around.
3683920	3696920	And I ran into Nancy and we know each other for many years. She knows that I pay close attention to the birds.
3696920	3707920	And she was talking about how the Herons will sun themselves on the top of this pine that they're currently nesting in on the other side of the lake.
3707920	3720920	And I mentioned that I think I noticed that many water birds use sunbathing, and I theorize that perhaps it's assisting their metabolism in digesting food.
3720920	3724920	Of course, this is true of many animals, right?
3724920	3731920	All the animals pay attention to heat gradients. They pay very careful attention to them.
3731920	3734920	Survival often depends on this.
3734920	3747920	The cats, given the opportunity to share bio-warming, will usually want to do so. The dogs too.
3747920	3759920	It makes everything better, right? We hitchhike on each other's heat gradients and on the heat gradients of the sun and also these days of machines.
3759920	3769920	This is a lesson I learned in a very difficult way that I will keep to myself at the moment when I was a young man.
3769920	3777920	So, I had some time with Nancy, and I could have just left the recorder on, but it seemed indelicate to do so.
3777920	3784920	But she's a fascinating, brilliant, elderly person who I care for.
3784920	3789920	Now, I could just say she's a person. Why do I have to say she's elderly?
3789920	3793920	Well, I say that she's elderly with great reverence.
3793920	3801920	Should I refrain from saying anything about...
3801920	3805920	Should I refrain from categorizing her?
3805920	3816920	Am I committing an injustice by categorizing her as elderly?
3816920	3823920	Now, certainly much like all the people I know, very, very few people I know are old inside.
3823920	3832920	Most of them, they're just like children or like they're 20 or 30 inside. Their body is elderly.
3832920	3838920	And many elderly people walk this lake. It's a pretty safe place.
3838920	3849920	Also, people would probably come to your aid if something went wrong.
3849920	3857920	I revere the elderly people.
3857920	3863920	I'm sure someone could make some kind of accusation about this. Were they thusly motivated?
3863920	3882920	I want to know what motivation should encourage them or even require them to indict me for categorizing Nancy as an elderly woman.
3882920	3889920	Now, when I was speaking to her, I asked deferentially how she prefers to be called.
3889920	3897920	I said, what do you mean? I said, if I see you, which name should I use?
3897920	3903920	She said, you can just call me Nancy. I was like, yes, great. But it's nice to ask.
3903920	3913920	She said, if there are children around, then it's Mrs. D.
3913920	3917920	I said, oh, because it's your last name. She's like, yes, yes.
3917920	3922920	So we had some negotiated, you know, I mean, negotiated monikers.
3922920	3927920	But what she probably prefers to be known as is the Heron Lady.
3927920	3934920	And that's a pretty unusual category. There's only one of them around here or they ain't two.
3934920	3941920	It was just one. Just as there was only one pepper in Santa Rosa.
3941920	3945920	And there were characters around the city at various times, too.
3945920	3955920	There was an African man who was the mayor of one of the little districts or something for many years.
3955920	3961920	I don't think I met him. And there are lesser and greater characters.
3961920	3974920	It seems much less common these days that the goodwill of the people supports the peculiar characters who, you know, they're not doing anyone any harm.
3974920	3987920	I don't think, generally. And they're contributing something profound to the local culture.
3987920	3995920	I have great admiration and respect for Mrs. D.
3995920	4000920	She runs a website about the Herons here.
4000920	4011920	And often you will see her driving her car with a large plastic Heron sticking up through the sunroof.
4011920	4018920	But people know that, you know, this is all about Herons.
4018920	4026920	It's funny she said, and speaking of certain nests, she said, you know, I just pray that I don't think she's religious.
4026920	4035920	And if she is religious, she's Heron religious.
4035920	4040920	I never got the sense of her to speak as if she believes in God.
4040920	4049920	She seems much more like a pragmatic atheist or someone who's willing to pray but isn't really religious, right?
4049920	4055920	I don't think everyone that hedges their bets is wrong.
4055920	4062920	Obviously, the atheists, just kind of a peculiar position to have.
4062920	4077920	It's not peculiar to have atheist leanings in the face of some of the ridiculous nonsense that modern religion promulgates.
4077920	4087920	But we should also be careful of similarly forged weapons.
4087920	4092920	So let's go back to the category thing.
4092920	4099920	It's funny her fascination with just one of the birds.
4099920	4108920	All of her attention has gone to Herons for a long time, such that she is identified with them.
4108920	4119920	Perhaps she thinks of herself as belonging to the Heron people, though I would be shocked to hear such a declaration from her.
4119920	4128920	And there might be private things, there must be both private things and secret things about who she is.
4128920	4133920	And some portion of the secret things are secret even to herself.
4133920	4141920	And this is the matter with being human.
4141920	4146920	Now, can I say anything useful about this category problem?
4146920	4154920	First of all, it is important to occasionally invent or repair categories.
4154920	4164920	Because our lexicon, its categorical structure, which I'm sure there's technical language about,
4164920	4175920	the library of categories native to English, for example, is missing all kinds of things.
4175920	4177920	Lots and lots of things are missing.
4177920	4184920	And if they're missing, we're inclined to overlook them because the language doesn't direct our attention in that way
4184920	4202920	and thoroughly does direct our attention in other ways.
4202920	4212920	It's a sunset crow call, raven call.
4212920	4222920	I often wonder what that call means.
4222920	4224920	It seems a communal.
4224920	4241920	I always get the sense that it's a remembering of some kind when I hear this particular double call.
4241920	4250920	Something like this, except it's got tremolo in it.
4250920	4252920	What can I say about the category?
4252920	4258920	So I was listening, I was briefly exposed early this afternoon.
4258920	4268920	I was working on getting a video up and YouTube presented me with some shorts.
4268920	4277920	And unlike my ordinary inclination, which is to completely ignore all such things,
4277920	4285920	I think there is a contagion problem there.
4285920	4295920	But I suspended my ordinary disinclinations and watched a few.
4295920	4303920	Some of them were artistic performances or musical performances, some of them were martial performances.
4303920	4308920	Some of them were wow.
4308920	4317920	And I watched maybe 10 or 11, most of them were less than a minute long, kind of short attention span theater stuff.
4317920	4344920	And in one of them, one particular male, you know, white male, was arguing with proponents of critical theory or critical race theory or stuff we might associate with the derogatory label Wokeist.
4347920	4357920	That would be a little bit too aggressive.
4357920	4375920	Categories are fundamental to conceptual awareness.
4375920	4386920	And certainly the linguistic apperception of identity.
4386920	4393920	But most of what's actually going on doesn't fit in them, right?
4393920	4409920	So in that sense, you know, over time we've become subject to a variety of modern, if I want to be friendly about it, I'll call it linguistic transformations.
4409920	4418920	And if I want to be diagnostic, I might call it contagions.
4418920	4432920	It was not very long ago that precisely zero people used the filler word like.
4432920	4461920	And the contagiousness of that linguistic habit had to do probably with a disaffinity for the declaration.
4462920	4470920	Of explicit identity, situation, relationship, transformation, and so on.
4470920	4475920	Because there's a natural disinclination.
4475920	4480920	Our psyche, our dreaming mind, our emotional self.
4480920	4509920	We have many features that resist the sort of boxy cages that categories, perhaps particularly or peculiarly in English, forces into.
4509920	4525920	So there's a kind of a natural pushback against that explicit declaration of history, situation, identity, relationship, transformation.
4525920	4550920	And when we say, when we use this filler word, it's a way of retreating from both the onus of declaration for which we can later be indicted.
4550920	4559920	Yeah, it's funny.
4559920	4573920	If I say explicitly what I did, then someone else can catch me out on that either right away or in the future.
4573920	4580920	It can be used as evidence against me, I can be judged by it.
4580920	4588920	So this like word blurs features of identity and category.
4588920	4596920	And we're seeing a similar blurring or rejection.
4596920	4598920	And I was watching the YouTube videos.
4598920	4606920	I don't know who the man, I don't know who the guy I was watching was who's probably 26.
4606920	4620920	He had kind of a broad face and a young white guy he was arguing with in one clip.
4620920	4632920	In both clips, he basically tabled a demand for a definition.
4632920	4646920	And in both cases, the people he was arguing with were poorly equipped to support whatever their or even declare whatever their position might have been.
4646920	4659920	I'm sure he's quite, you know, anyone who's rhetorically trained or anyone who's practiced debate with any degree of regularity.
4659920	4674920	Having arguments with ordinary people is like using a tank to swap flies or something, not that the people are fly like or I'm not meaning to denigrate them.
4674920	4681920	I'm just saying like it's overkill, profound overkill.
4681920	4689920	And I suspect that, you know, he's carefully, he's probably fought many battles, won many battles.
4689920	4696920	If winning is the goal, really insight should be the goal.
4696920	4700920	Mutual understanding and insight when we get together.
4700920	4703920	Not winning.
4703920	4708920	But in both cases, he asked that I saw.
4708920	4710920	He asked a very simple question.
4710920	4718920	What is a woman?
4718920	4737920	And in my own thought, there is a place where I can entertain linguistic deconstructionist, postmodernist, neo, what, neo what?
4737920	4748920	Neo put any word you want after neo, but also neo ideological constructs.
4748920	4752920	There's a, there's a compartment where I can play that.
4752920	4760920	And there's another compartment where I'm clinical.
4760920	4765920	And there's another part compartment where I experiment.
4765920	4777920	And there's another compartment where I'm actually fascinated by the existence of categories and what's missing from them.
4777920	4800920	And part of my mind is familiar with the dangers and tribulations
4800920	4816920	around the propagation of viral, sci-fi human linguistic behavior.
4816920	4824920	So I have these many different facets and I can play well with others in most fields.
4824920	4843920	I am going to say, however, to declare openly that I believe in the biological categories of gender, however poorly I may understand them.
4843920	4865920	And I'm going to take a break and have some food and then we'll see how much intelligence is left in me when I have to both digest and make allocutions.
4865920	4887920	As someone who has the joy of sometimes engaging in creative activity, I've noticed something that I've heard before.
4887920	4898920	But like most of what can be said, it's very different to hear it and experience it directly.
4898920	4914920	And I'm speaking of the difference between being hungry, which is a statement of state.
4914920	4925920	Being hungry, I'm rarely as inspired when I'm full as I am when I'm hungry.
4925920	4938920	And if I'm writing and I'm sort of on a roll or something, or whatever I might be creating music or my recordings or whatnot, it's just a radically different experience when there's food in my tummy.
4938920	4946920	Much less impetus and inspiration and motivation.
4946920	4958920	Of course, probably slightly depending on what kind of food I eat and perhaps the company I'm keeping.
4958920	4986920	So for me, as someone who studies language and semantics and has long been curious about how language affects our minds and psyches and societies, if we dare call them that,
4986920	4996920	there are situations which look to me more like diseases than development.
4996920	5000920	It's pretty similar with my physical health.
5000920	5017920	I might notice a slight catch where my nasal passages meet my throat.
5017920	5024920	A tiny bit of post-nasal drip or slight irritation.
5024920	5036920	And often I get over it most of the time, but sometimes that turns into illness.
5036920	5059920	It's much more difficult to understand mimetic and linguistic contagions, and all of us are surely exposed to mimetic pathogens.
5059920	5072920	I'm very concerned when I see the kinds of things.
5072920	5084920	Nearly every psyop raises the flag of virtue, of liberation, of unity.
5084920	5113920	And it's very common for the language to transform dramatically when the principles of democratic coexistence
5113920	5137920	and mutual concern and so forth begin to be captured and or weaponized.
5137920	5156920	Generally what is common when some kind of psyop is going on, one of the key signals that you can see when you sort of take the pulse of the linguistic situation,
5156920	5176920	particularly as it surrounds cohorts of humans, groups of humans, tribes, so forth, whether they're ideological or genetic or based on some feature of gender.
5176920	5196920	When something attacks the roots of our lexicons and makes the claim of heroic revision, whether that claim is overt or covert,
5196920	5210920	we want to be extremely cautious and look very carefully both at the ploys, the methods, the techniques, the protocols, and their actual results,
5210920	5228920	not what they claim to be doing. What's actually going on as the transformation of categories becomes prominent.
5228920	5244920	And on the one hand we should together be willing and capable and trained to intelligently for each other for the sake of insight,
5244920	5267920	question the nature of categories, and perhaps repair our lexicons.
5267920	5296920	That's an important part of my goal as a cognitive activist. At the same time we should have watchful concern about certain kinds of transformations.
5296920	5325920	Our capacity to be rational, to weigh evidence, to think clearly, to revise our thinking in the face of new data, to attend the authority of facts without becoming entranced by them.
5325920	5350920	There is a compartment within which I understand that conceptual facts, linguistic facts, there's a compartment in which I can play as if they are in fact an authority ploy.
5350920	5362920	And there are certainly situations in our culture, relationships, societies, and so on where this is so. The facts are not actually facts.
5362920	5376920	For example, the fact that the CDC promoted the COVID vaccines as safe and effective. Not fucking true.
5377920	5390920	We may have needed vaccines. There might have been a real fire where our infrastructure of society was at risk, which was the primary argument, or one of them.
5390920	5409920	But even that, you don't get facts about complex situations immediately. Data never catches up to what's actually going on unless what's going on is so simple, like is the water boiling?
5409920	5429920	That's a fact you can get a relatively clear grasp on because it's very simple. Where did COVID originate? Not facts. That's speculation and data and research and analysis and so on.
5429920	5452920	And wherever the humans don't do the data or research or analysis, then the data never reaches the common people. And the common people don't get much clarity of data at all unless they're connected with somebody who's professional, like a scientist or something.
5452920	5465920	It's actually doing the research or gathering data. Data is always partial, never complete, and it takes a long time for it. It can never catch up to what's actually going on now.
5465920	5486920	So it's always post facto, right after the fact. In its hindsight, what we get is mostly from data unless the analyses are very simple or temporally accessible rapidly. We don't get good data.
5487920	5511920	And our data is always partial and it's biased, and all of that is true, but that doesn't entitle us to just dismiss, pretend that the data isn't there, or that all facts are really just, for example, a result of the agendas of colonizing patriarchy or this kind of thing.
5511920	5535920	That's ridiculously nonsensical. And if we say, it's not that there's no truth in it. There's a little bit of truth there. There's a branch of factfulness that is emerging from colonizing entities and perhaps even patriarchal motivations.
5536920	5543920	True. The whole thing, impossible. Cannot be so.
5544920	5562920	And when you see in the common people the signal that we're going to blur, doubt, and erase fundamental categories,
5563920	5584920	I strongly suggest that we recoil, become very studious and cautious about what the fuck might be going on, because on the one hand, anything that damages fundamental categories, these are things that I call holophores in English.
5585920	5604920	These are root concepts that if you change them, all other concepts inherit the changes you've applied, each concept somewhat uniquely, but you cannot change, for example, the meaning of male or female without affecting all other concepts.
5605920	5631920	And in a situation where the fundamental basic elements of the sort of primitives of our lexicons, the categories, if these come under attack and the attack is successful, our people will go nuts. It will cause insanity.
5631920	5654920	It's possible to produce waves of transformation in the lexicon and in the categories, that it's not possible for humans to keep up with cognitively, and it's also possible to destabilize the basis of human identity this way.
5661920	5673920	There's so much trouble going on here, and this is a very sophisticated topic, which I'm giving a fairly superficial treatment to at the moment. I'm merely speaking of some of my concerns.
5673920	5702920	No matter how many people try to tell me that their transformation of a fundamental category feature is true, good, appropriate, noble, reflective of actual understanding,
5702920	5722920	and so forth. I'm willing to have the discussion. I'm not willing to be threatened into categorical changes that I fundamentally don't agree with.
5722920	5748920	I've read works that question the common human gender categories, male and female. I'm well aware, for example,
5748920	5758920	that if we want to use gender to talk about bacteria, there's probably seven or more genders, and there's different ways they can connect.
5758920	5784920	I am aware of what has been called hermaphrodism in nature and humans. I am unwilling to submit my mind and my lexicon to the whims
5788920	5810920	of people or groups of people whose motivations may appear superficially humanistic, but whose activity largely creates very...
5810920	5834920	It inverts the problems of racism and genderism and then points those back at the people who it wants to frame as oppressors, many of whom have never actively oppressed anyone or anything much.
5834920	5850920	There has been colonialism real, patriarchal dismissal of women, children, living place, absolutely. There has been chauvinism.
5850920	5878920	There has been unjustifiable suffering visited on peoples and groups, all through. The resolution for those matters is clearly not being woke.
5879920	5905920	And this nation that I live in, which I do not identify closely with, is clearly suffering a series of assaults from various bad actors, other nations, factions and so forth,
5905920	5927920	that are intent on fomenting schizogenesis. And one of the best ways to do that is to attack basic categories. It just so happens that these primordial features of our lexicon
5928920	5944920	are both vulnerable to capture and distortion and very rewarding, rapidly rewarding in terms of schizogenesis of populations and cognition.
5945920	5961920	So, I'm not trying to call anyone out. I'm saying I don't trust this situation. I've watched it carefully from its origins. I was reading post-modernist texts in the 1980s.
5962920	5975920	And already I developed not exactly an allergy, but a significant concern about that direction in intellectual development.
5975920	5997920	Some will claim that the wakest concerns don't start there, but that's not their origin or parentage. I find it a bit difficult to believe.
5998920	6023920	So, there's much more to say on this topic. Perhaps I am trying to say that I'm very skeptical of particular transformations
6023920	6041920	in our lexicons that look to me more like the result of weaponization than they do of insight or humanitarianism, person-terrainism, whatever you wish to call it.
6042920	6057920	In the shorts that I saw earlier today, I just saw this guy asking one question to a couple different people.
6058920	6079920	And the question was, what is a woman? And none of those people answered. They made various claims like that he was grandstanding or that he's found a pivot point around which he can dance and sort of score points.
6079920	6088920	And one of them said, I just don't think categories are that important in human relationships or something to this degree.
6088920	6105920	Well, I'm not judging the person. Again, the guy on the stage was clearly rhetorically trained and prepared for actual debate, and the people that were approaching him were not.
6106920	6113920	This is a typical gambit, also sort of what disingenuous, right? Fake.
6113920	6132920	Typical gambit in videos that are intended by their creators to capture audiences via outrage and other dangerous purposes.
6135920	6144920	But I do think the question is relevant.
6144920	6168920	I don't know the answer to the questions that arise in the wake of the methods that allow people to modify their bodies.
6175920	6193920	Identify their gender or perhaps even what is it, right? What is it that gets identified?
6196920	6203920	Sometimes it's gender, sometimes it's sexuality, sometimes it's public face.
6203920	6218920	I wish to be known in the public as masculine or feminine or neither. I'm not binary. I'm not plus or minus. I'm not boy or girl. I'm beyond.
6218920	6233920	Now again, there's this problem in the background, which is that we can all sense that there's an issue with categories and their explicit declarations of identity.
6233920	6248920	And this can be the source of injustice for sure, but so can the other side of it, right?
6248920	6262920	So for now, I really just want to highlight the questions and I'm pretty sure I know how I would answer. I'm not going to try to do it here at the moment.
6262920	6274920	The question, what is a woman? What do we mean by the word woman? This is always a question of who we are and what we intend to mean rather than what does the word mean?
6275920	6288920	Biologically, though there are outliers, there are outliers in every category, right? There are things that cross over into other categories.
6288920	6299920	Think about the idea of food, right? There's food that you know to be food and there's also food that you know not to eat.
6299920	6309920	The rotting apple is rarely consumed by humans. An apple is a fruit. A fruit is food.
6309920	6317920	But there's all kinds of edge cases. We don't then decide there's no such thing as apples.
6317920	6325920	I mean, unless, you know, we're really advanced philosophically or something and we realize that language is a game.
6326920	6340920	But unfortunately for us, that game has very profound social and historical and what? Future repercussions.
6341920	6359920	How humans play with categories is fundamentally determinative of many aspects of thought, relation, behavior, expectation, objection, vehemence, anger, fear, all these things, right?
6359920	6369920	So if we're going to just mess with fundamental categories at the root of our lexicons, we had better be prepared to ask the really hard questions there.
6369920	6380920	And not come to the table with standing presuppositions on either side.
6380920	6388920	The question of what is a woman? Does biological gender actually exist?
6389920	6409920	Is delicate and sophisticated in measured, almost in like a kind of mathematical relation to our purposes in asking the question and our purposes in pursuing the question.
6410920	6429920	I don't think, in the same way that I don't think that machines qualifies intelligences at this point, that doesn't mean intelligences couldn't hitchhike on them.
6429920	6433920	Ours do. Ours does.
6433920	6446920	In the same way that I don't think machines are intelligences and we should call artificial intelligence something like human assisted computational heuristics.
6447920	6472920	I don't think, I'm certainly willing to call my friend who I knew was born male, she, if my friend really presses me and says this is important to me, this is what I want, I will do it.
6472920	6479920	But I will not be thinking of that person as a woman.
6479920	6493920	I still believe in gender as, at least in the bubble of biology, right, in the compartment of my mind where I think about biological situations.
6493920	6505920	I believe in genders. The concept makes sense to me, it's familiar to me. I'm not going to try to rationalize it here.
6505920	6516920	And in another bubble, a different one, I'm willing to acknowledge the concerns of someone I care for or am in relation with.
6516920	6519920	But there's a limit.
6519920	6534920	If they want to police my lexicon for the sake of some ideology they've come under the sway of, we're going to have some very serious discussions over long periods of time.
6534920	6545920	And I would expect the same thing if I demanded they change their lexicon or be indicted.
6545920	6556920	That's not going to fly, that creates a disproportionate power dynamic in the relational envelope that I don't agree with generally.
6556920	6560920	There's much more to learn here and much more to explore.
6560920	6566920	For now I'm going to wrap up just because it's getting late, not because I have a full tummy.
6566920	6568920	Thank you for joining me.
