0	1760	Hello, everybody. Welcome.
4880	9200	I'm going to just straight up. I don't usually go in for this kind of thing.
10160	12080	But I'm going to straight up.
15440	21200	I'm going to warn you that the topics I'm about to explore here
21280	31760	are so profoundly controversial, so provocative,
34880	43520	that if you're not up for some serious provocation,
46240	47360	feel free to turn aside.
48320	53040	And I know my audience well enough to know that that will have no effect on nearly all of you.
54240	56320	But for those people who haven't listened to me before,
56320	59440	and I'm also going to say that I'm going to be holding back.
60720	67840	In fact, that's normally what I do, because if I were to talk openly about what I have seen
67920	70240	and come to know as a human being,
73680	81760	yeah, people would not probably, it would not be allowed for one thing. I would be shut down
81760	89680	very quickly. And, you know, other collectives or whatever might actually hunt me down.
90640	94960	I don't talk about what I've seen and what I've known, what I've come to know.
95760	101760	I talk about the wrapping paper around the surface of that stuff that I can get away with
101760	111040	speaking about in public. Even in private, if there's even such a thing anymore,
111760	127840	I would be extremely hesitant to delve directly into the incredibly shocking implications
129840	138320	of what I've been shown by non-human intelligences that are not demonic. I'm pretty damn sure.
139280	143440	What I've seen and what I've experienced and what I've come to understand in my own
144160	149120	walk as a human being, and as not merely human being.
152320	160000	So, over the past couple weeks, I've been listening to Amon Hillman.
160400	172560	And, you know, I would argue that Amon himself doesn't understand what he has clearly discovered
174080	181920	in ancient texts about religion, magic, and knowledge.
182080	192880	I was listening to him today talk on a podcast, I think it's number 63, interesting number,
195280	207840	of The Sacred Speaks. And, he's talking about before the stories of Odysseus and Achilles
207840	213520	and so forth, there was a woman named Medea, who is essentially the origin of magic.
214800	223600	And, the origin of magic has to do with a mixture of basically, okay, this is going to go way out
223600	231920	there, people, but get ready for this. So, the idea of Christos is a medicine that is put in
231920	239840	people's eyes. It's not Jesus, and whatever Jesus might have been up to, it's probably
239840	243680	nothing like what we are trained to think, if Jesus actually existed.
246720	251200	And, in fact, most people will literally go out of their minds and say,
252160	257200	if they even try to understand some of the things that Amon
259360	266480	is saying exist in the primary sources, what does he mean by this? He said, you know,
266480	271200	I had a great advisor in my early education, this guy has a PhD in classicism,
272160	278320	he reads Greek like pretty much no one on earth can. There might be a few people that are close
278320	289440	to his skill level, from what I understand. I'm going to wait till this monstrosity ceases its
290240	297760	overhead, fundamental disturbance of all beings.
298080	309120	You know, in antiquity, if something like a helicopter went over and just disturbed everything,
309120	313920	people would think that was a God, because how could you have such universal effect? You'd have
313920	320160	to be a mountain or, you know, thunder or something like, there's no way, how could you project such
320160	326800	incredibly generalized and universal effect from on high, if you weren't a God.
328080	331840	And this is part of why I say that the humans essentially invent demons,
332640	336160	and they think these are conveniences or powerful.
336160	355040	Yeah, here it comes again, maybe, utterly disturbing.
360480	364560	They don't understand that the dog is disturbed by the helicopter, but it is.
366880	369920	Their dogs just stopped moving when the helicopter flew over.
370720	374720	And it's the same principle I was trying to explain, and I'll bet now that it's, yep,
374720	380160	now that it's gone, the dog is totally fine. And the humans were confused, they couldn't
380160	384640	figure out what was frightening the dog, even though something in the sky was dominating
384640	394640	everything around it universally. And the dog naturally felt unsafe to move. It would not move,
394640	403280	they tried to drag it, it wouldn't move. And let me be really clear, what I'm talking about right
403280	410480	now, and much of what I talk about, is forbidden knowledge. You're not supposed to be able to
410480	419440	know these things. And this is part of what Amon Hillman's game is, except that Amon himself
420080	427520	doesn't actually understand, I think. If he does, he gives little evidence of it,
430960	439840	because he presents his perspective as opposed to what he has learned about the ancients,
439840	449360	the topics of magic, medicine, visionary experience, the non-ordinary, all of these things.
450480	458880	This man has seen a universe that moderns know nothing of, and it has blown his mind.
459600	468320	You know, what he actually said was, I thought, kind of hilarious. He wrote a dissertation
470320	484400	on what was going on in Roman Athens. And, oh my god, the poor. Every naive human is subject
484400	488800	at some point to this kind of catastrophe. I'm going to get back to the whole thing I was talking
488800	497760	about with Medea. Yeah, this is going to go way, way into outer space. So,
500880	506400	he wrote a dissertation, and his advisor said, he wants you to remove all references
507200	516720	to anything that we could imagine to meet recreational drug use by the ancients,
517680	522720	which was probably, you know, I don't know, wild guess here, 70% of the material,
523840	529440	except that they didn't have the idea of recreation related to drugs at all. It was
530160	536640	it was pharmacopia, right, was the use of poisons. You need to understand this, this pharma,
537280	547440	it doesn't mean medicine in the way we imagine. It means the titration of poisons.
548800	555920	And there are two primary sources of poison, maybe three, if the human body is the third.
556880	566160	The first is plants. The second is animals. The third is humans, and the fourth is
569040	575600	just take those first three and put a make a concentric rings around them, and then take that
575600	581840	and put a plus symbol next to it. It's that plus. It's anything that's beyond those first three.
581840	593280	And the whole history of medicine is the titration of poisons, right, meaning the dosage,
594000	601280	and not just the curing, not the idea of curing, but actually of rebalancing,
602560	609360	right, of rebalancing the body. So what the ancients were doing in many cases is,
609600	619040	you know, something incredible to our minds. They are going to the edge of death while embodied.
619680	628080	They die, and then they are resurrected from this state by the administration of an antidote.
628320	636400	Do these people actually not even know that I exist? It's so funny.
640480	646080	Some moderns, particularly younger people, they have no concept of personal space.
647360	652400	They'll walk right within, you know, like a half an inch of my body as if I'm not even there.
653280	657360	And not just when they're looking at their phones, but I want to be really clear about something.
657360	662800	Anyone who is walking around in the world with a phone in their hand is disoriented.
662800	667360	And if they're looking at that phone, they are completely disoriented. They might as well be
667360	673840	unconscious. Okay, no, it's not possible to pay attention to their environment or their body
673840	680160	or anything when they're looking at that phone. That thing is an energetic and attentional black hole.
682560	687040	And people say, well, I've seen you, you know, walking. Yes, how do you think I figured it out?
687840	693920	I had to first resist what they did for many years and then eventually give in and try it myself.
694880	703120	It's terrifyingly dissociative. You might as well just take like a shot of ketamine right to the brain.
704240	709440	It's totally dissociative, except it's worse because at least with the ketamine, you might have
709440	714000	something like a dream or a vision, but with the phone, you just have game empty.
717280	725600	It's like a cartoon where your brain just starts producing square waves like a synthesizer with
725600	736080	a bad LFO or something. Yeah, a bad oscillator is just nothing in there. The whole brain activity
736080	745440	goes to poop, zip-o, this is nothing. Or it goes to like the opposite of anything resembling
745440	756240	attentional or relational coherence. In any case, all right, so the thing with Ammon is that he,
756400	763440	he, okay, I'll put this, people have the wrong idea about him. They think he's,
766320	774000	they think he's demonic, right? And weird things happen all around him very regularly,
774800	784000	which that is not surprising at all. Also, if you look at the guy, he's basically like a walking
784000	791840	psychedelic. So that's a third problem, right, is that ordinary people are going to freak out
791840	796480	in his presence for nine different kinds of reasons that he himself probably can't even
796480	803840	understand. He probably thinks there's some. I mean, I think he has an idea about it.
806240	809840	I don't know what those ideas are. Perhaps I may reach out to this guy and see.
809840	815520	Okay, what the hell is going on here?
818480	823200	The geese are gathered. There's a bunch of feathers on the ground. Have they pulled them out themselves?
827680	828720	This is so weird.
831760	836080	That's a huge lot of feathers, but there's no blood on them, which implies that
836080	841840	the geese pulled the feathers themselves in their preening behavior, which they're doing very
843680	845120	attentively at the moment.
850160	853280	If those feathers had been pulled by a predator, there'd be blood on them.
855360	862000	What is that Greek word for hymen? That's the Greek word for blood hymen,
862800	865600	according to what I heard from Ammon.
874080	878080	Yeah, these quills would make excellent pens for ink.
882960	890080	So I'm sure Ammon doesn't really know why people get really freaked out by him,
890640	896080	although if you look at him, he's thoroughly tattooed with Greek
897600	905600	phrases and words. I'd love to know what the Greek word for my body has become a book is,
907280	912000	or my body is a papyri. This would be great to know about.
914560	917120	Okay, so things are going to get much weirder here just to be clear.
918080	928560	What he's talking about are the intentional use of extremely complex pharmacological
928800	935680	substances. Often aphrodisiacal,
946800	953120	substances introduced during rites of orgiastic
953120	974000	flagrancy, often into the rectum or the eyes or the mouth, almost invariably by women or
977760	980720	a male officiant who are not merely priests.
983840	998960	And many of the substances involved came from the bodies of children.
1000400	1005120	We've heard nonsense, probably hopefully nonsense, but not necessarily about this
1005840	1011360	in our modern situation with extremely wealthy people or powerful people.
1012240	1019680	There's myths, I think, I hope, about some substance called adenochrome or something, adrenochrome.
1023600	1031840	But I haven't heard Ammon say anything about the sacrificing of children. Rather, he speaks about
1032800	1041200	getting substances, initiates, taking substances from the bodies of
1042000	1048000	prepubescent boys and girls, mixing these substances with the venoms from snakes
1048720	1054960	and substances that are botanical, and also possibly substances that are cathonic
1055600	1061440	or from the earth. In other words, very specific soils or dusts.
1063280	1068720	I haven't heard him mention that specifically, but from my own knowledge I would be shocked if
1068720	1078560	there's none of that going on. And then the ceremonial introduction of these substances
1079280	1090640	into the eyes, noses, mouths, vaginas, rectums of people who either are undergoing
1092080	1102160	a spiritual transformation or are being healed. He talks of, in what I was hearing him talk about
1102160	1110640	today, he was speaking about Medea and how she became sort of the origin of the idea of magic.
1113120	1121440	And he also talks about, in the Bible, a segment where I suspect he's talking about the horror
1121440	1128960	of Babylon, quote unquote, and that's the English. I'm sure the Greek is vastly different.
1137600	1142640	That's funny. People are trying to balance a rock on a rock. If only they could balance their mind
1142640	1155920	on their mind, things would go much better. So wildly unlikely. All right, so Medea became,
1155920	1165200	and also almost certainly Cleopatra, they became adepts with the use of various toxins,
1166160	1176240	which they kept in their hair often. This is where you get the idea of a Medusa,
1176960	1183200	a woman whose hair looks like snakes, right? What that means is she has dreads, and the dreads are
1183200	1191760	thick with substances that can either be, you could apply moisture to them and get them on your
1191760	1199200	fingertips and then fling them into the eyes of a person in front of you, similarly to what a cobra
1199200	1208320	does, right? Or you could twist a spine or an arrow, some sort of projectile into the dread
1208960	1215040	with a substance on it that would cause the concentrated toxins in the hair to
1215040	1226880	both become liquefied and to then be absorbed onto the surface of the projectile. You could
1226880	1240400	then shoot that into someone and it would paralyze them. A mirror basically keeps the gaze
1241360	1248320	of something from touching you, and this is the concept I think, though I haven't read the original
1248320	1257680	Greek, which you know would certainly be useful and helpful. A mirror would keep the gaze of
1257680	1264000	someone from touching you, and it's the idea that it's the gaze of the Medusa that paralyzes.
1264960	1270320	Not entirely impossible, but I'm going to wildly guess here that Amma would tell us
1270960	1277520	there's no evidence of that in the primary sources, and what his first counselor told him,
1277520	1289200	I'm circling back now, was you need to keep three things in mind as you pursue your academic
1290160	1296160	passions. The first thing is primary sources. The second thing is primary sources.
1297440	1303680	You can probably imagine what the third thing is. It's primary sources. What his advisor is saying
1305200	1315360	is give no credence to anything that has to do with someone discussing their opinions or perspectives
1315520	1326080	as a classicist, as a Greek scholar. You can only rely on primary sources. You must always rely
1326800	1335120	on the first texts and never mind what other people think, say, because what you'll find is that
1335120	1345360	very quickly beyond the primary sources, political and religious and military and
1346400	1359760	what philosophical orientations rapidly warp the originals, which is why we are catastrophically
1359840	1366000	confused according to Ammon about who Jesus was and what he was actually up to.
1367920	1374000	I'm not going to get much into that today. You can check out Ammon yourself if you want
1374000	1379760	his views on that, but let me just say this. It has nothing to do with what we are thinking.
1380160	1396480	Jesus was, in Ammon's view, a, what is the right word, a lasia? I can't remember,
1396480	1408000	lasie, lasia, lasia. Essentially, a trafficker in young children. If you can imagine anything
1408000	1419680	more provocative than that. And as Ammon will tell you, the sources that we have for the Torah
1420560	1427760	are not in Hebrew or Aramaic. They are in Greek. We don't have sources for written,
1428720	1438960	the written Torah is translated from ancient Greek into Hebrew, which is insanely ridiculous
1440240	1446880	to imagine. I had heard this elsewhere. I had heard this from a scholar,
1447520	1457120	God. I was eventually able to find the source. I heard this from a scholar who was writing on
1457120	1462400	Korah, a brilliant author actually, who was doing something very, very dangerous on Korah,
1463120	1468800	for which he eventually got banned because he was masquerading as a woman
1469520	1476960	and had written some astonishing sort of memoirs of things that had happened to him
1479440	1485680	as a her, which of course didn't actually happen in the way that he
1487200	1494240	so artfully wrote at all. But one of the things he was writing about was a day when he was studying
1494320	1504160	the history of the actual origin of the Torah and why there were, why it was that
1506320	1511440	the original sources were all in Greek. I mean, can you imagine how provocative that is?
1512640	1517040	And I'm sure there are people who will want to yell at me and go like, oh, you're an idiot.
1517520	1526880	Of course, they were in Hebrew or Aramaic. But I challenged them to produce the dated
1526880	1538000	material that shows that the Hebrew or Aramaic predates the Greek from which the Torah was
1538000	1548080	certainly translated into Hebrew, which is, again, staggeringly unexpected.
1549520	1553680	But this is the kind of thing we will consistently discover when we look into
1554720	1560160	not just history as a record of what happened, history is the mysterious origin of our present
1560480	1570000	circumstances. History as that first tone that's being echoed cyclically, recursively in a spiral
1570720	1582000	that rhymes with its previous arcs. History is that. So basically, his advisors told him,
1582000	1587440	you have to take out everything that we would understand is related to recreational drug use
1587440	1594560	among the Romans. And he said, why would I do that? And they said, because it's obvious that
1594560	1602640	the Romans would not neither do that nor put up with it. And he thought to himself two things,
1603440	1611440	I think. The first one is, how the fuck would you know that? What, you just have some moralistic
1611440	1619280	predictor of what you think the Romans would or would not have done? But the second thing he thought,
1620320	1631360	which I think is hilarious, was, okay, I'm going to take all this stuff out so that I can at least
1631360	1636560	publish my dissertation. But for the rest of my life, I'll find all the things that the Romans
1636560	1647520	wouldn't do. My job from now on is I will be the human who knows all the things that you think the
1647520	1659040	Romans wouldn't do, wouldn't allow. And he cites, knownness, primarily. Galen,
1663680	1669200	Escalus, not sure if I'm pronouncing that right. Some of these things are hard to pronounce,
1669200	1677360	but knownness and Galen aren't. And a big shout out to my friend who's actually named Galen.
1677920	1685360	Here. Because he's almost like the, no one would ever believe it, but he's almost like the rebirth
1688560	1696240	of one of the Greek scholars in the modern times. And wow, what a problem that is for him.
1697120	1699680	And you know, those who love him, and I'm one of those people.
1700400	1714640	So yeah, he cites the actual Greek in the New Testament, from which the New Testament is derived
1714640	1722080	in English. And he points out all kinds of catastrophic mistranslations, which are endemic
1723040	1729440	to the Bible that we read. I mean, the idea that you could translate Hebrew into English
1730640	1739200	is pretty nearly insane if it's biblical Hebrew, or you know, Torah Hebrew. But again,
1739200	1743280	you have the same problem, right? There's no such thing as biblical Hebrew. Biblical Hebrew is a
1743280	1750960	derivation of biblical Greek. And the chances of you translating a language is sophisticated in
1751040	1761600	its connotative and technical features into English. I don't even know. It would be like trying to
1761600	1770560	translate Romanian geometry into basic arithmetic. It's just not going to ever happen.
1770960	1777040	And this is part of the problem that we face
1779600	1786480	with our historical documents in general, and anything that where we can't go to the original
1786480	1797440	source with, you know, arm in arm with a scholar of significant educational and linguistic depth,
1798240	1803600	right? And clearly, Ammon is one of a few such scholars that exist. He's not the only one.
1806320	1806880	But uh,
1813360	1818720	there's so much going on here that it's really hard to remain focused. All right, so
1819680	1829440	so they made him remove everything that that they thought might possibly indicate what they
1829440	1835040	call the recreational use of drugs by the Romans and the Athenians. And this is the birthplace
1835040	1841360	of the idea of democracy in so much as we moderns understand it in the West. Obviously, there were
1841360	1847520	experiments long before this, and there were things more like liquid democracy than formal
1847520	1853040	democracy. By the time you have to formalize a system, you've lost most of its essence and
1853040	1860160	origin completely, right? By the time you have to formalize relationships, you have a problem where
1860160	1866480	the concept of the individual has achieved an unjustified primacy. You follow me? It should
1866480	1874960	never be this ultimate. This idea of individual should never be this ultimate. So um,
1877520	1884080	I'm going to carefully skirt the, oh god, what a pun. I'm going to skirt the topics
1885680	1894160	that are related to what I have said, which is the ceremonial use of substances produced
1894800	1901840	by the bodies of prepubescent humans. I'm going to skirt that topic, but I'm going to circle it
1901840	1908960	and highlight it just so that it remains in the orbit of what we are here trying to understand.
1910960	1921440	Medea became a master of the uses, both of snake venom and the mixtures, the careful mixture,
1921440	1932400	like as if, as if, as if each venom. So the substances that a human body produces can be
1932400	1946160	understood as elixirs, right? The sweat, the tears, the saliva, the, oh my god, dare I even say these
1946160	1961920	things? I, no, I'm not going to say it. Sexual exudations and a couple of other things that
1961920	1966880	I'm going to leave out. If you're really imaginative, you'll figure out what I'm pointing at. Most of
1966880	1975680	you won't, probably for everyone's best interest that you don't. And these topics are so forbidden,
1976560	1982000	right? They're, they're so forbidden that you will be killed for considering them in many cases,
1982560	1987760	but certainly you will be, you know, obliterated for publicly discussing them.
1987760	1997600	And so I'm taking a lot of risks here, even though I'm being relatively circumspect.
2003760	2009920	This guy looks like he's aware of principles related to
2010000	2020320	interior martial arts. He's using hand gestures that are evocative of the manipulation of chi,
2021520	2025280	which is a related topic here, okay? But things are going to get really weird in a moment.
2026880	2033760	So Amon decided, I'm going to find out everything that those, those Greeks wouldn't have been doing.
2034560	2040000	And he did. I mean, he's, you know, and he's been accused of strange
2041440	2047840	things that I think people have him entirely backwards. If they think he's interested,
2047840	2053520	for example, in summoning demons or opening portals. I mean, the problem with Amon
2054320	2057840	is that if you're walking around on earth with the knowledge that he has,
2058800	2064800	you might, you are a portal. You don't have to go opening them. You are one.
2066240	2072400	And, and this is a problem for him that I think he'll hopefully artfully
2076720	2086160	negotiate, right? Mitigate or work with. All right. So remember, this is a, this is a topic that
2087840	2094400	other things down here. This is a topic that has fascinated me and I've had some brand new insights
2094400	2102320	today based on what Amon was talking about that are staggering to me and wildly unexpected
2103520	2110240	because I felt like I mostly knew what was going on because I had been shown
2111200	2118160	stories, but the stories omitted certain things. And Amon's
2121520	2132720	discussion has illuminated something fundamental. Okay, I'm going to take a couple of these quills
2132720	2143200	because these quills are seriously great. So I want, I want this one.
2150720	2151200	This one.
2162720	2191520	So, long ago,
2193440	2200080	an on-ordinary being offered me a wish and had I been intelligent,
2202400	2207840	I would have perhaps wished differently. And I now for the first time understand something about
2208560	2213360	why that being seemed very surprised by what I had selected.
2217200	2222000	But the fundamental wish was help me understand how my species got broken and if there's any
2222000	2233200	medicine for that. And what it did was it dripped insight into the eye of my mind
2234080	2240320	very delicately so it would not destroy me. And so that I would understand the origins
2241280	2246400	of what I refer to as representational cognition in our species
2246640	2261840	and the histories and mysteries of how that very problematical feature of we moderns originated.
2262720	2273600	But I also asked specifically, talk to me about the tree incident in Genesis
2274560	2282080	because this seems to be at least for some people or in some way a crucial origin story
2284480	2295840	where the problems apparently get started. And I'm going to spoil the charade here because,
2295840	2304800	okay, so what I was first shown was that the serpent, quote unquote, was an angel
2306320	2312480	in a sense and it was the angel of the knowledge of dividing things, one from another,
2314320	2320480	the knowledge of distinguishing. And so it made divisions in the minds
2320960	2331440	of first of Eve and then of Adam by giving them the fruit of the tree of knowledge.
2333440	2336720	And certainly,
2337120	2352800	this can be thought of in a variety of ways. I've had many perspectives on what that
2353520	2359200	concept of the fruit might refer to. And it's much better to have three to five good
2359200	2364640	perspectives than it is to have one. If you have one, it will blind you. And some of us,
2364880	2367600	some people will think, well, there's a difference between things that are actually
2367600	2375040	true and those that aren't. Yes, there are, but insight is not always forged from the facts.
2375760	2383680	Often it's forged from the dreaming, which is the intelligent,
2383760	2393840	what, reambiguation of the facts. The intelligent reamb, getting the facts
2393840	2401360	is useful. The intelligently reambiguating them is profound. And this is what happens
2401360	2407600	when we dream. This is part of what happens when we use certain substances, pharmacoya.
2408160	2418880	And what I've seen today for the first time is, okay, let me go back to Medea.
2418880	2428000	So, Ammon was saying that Medea became a master of the, not just the application
2428560	2441440	of substances derived from vipers and snakes. Oh my God. I can't believe I can see so many
2441440	2446800	problems in me sharing this recording. I can't, I'm going to be surprised if the recording even
2446800	2455840	survives. Am I still actually recording? Yes, apparently I am. Okay. Wow. So,
2458640	2465440	Medea became
2470400	2483200	supra humanly adept, not merely at the acquisition of venoms from snakes and possibly other creatures
2483840	2485760	and possibly
2490960	2497680	botanical and perhaps cathonic substances as well, the mixing of them.
2499600	2507120	This, in a sense, he's saying she is, at least in some historical lines or traditions,
2507680	2516960	the first pharmacologist, the one who mixes toxins and also understands them probably in a kind of
2516960	2527360	a spiritual way that results in the capacity to produce antidotes, which are not merely curatives.
2527680	2531360	They can rebalance
2534720	2542000	and possibly even resurrect. So, what is being implied here by Ammon,
2543360	2549280	and I don't think he's going to agree with me about this if he even becomes aware of my theory,
2549520	2562960	is that the viper at the tree in Genesis, the serpent, which in my, in the stories I was shown,
2563840	2568400	is essentially an angel. It's like the first angel. It's the angel that divides.
2570480	2576480	It's the angel with the gift of cutting, essentially cutting in the mind. So, it's
2577040	2584320	the angel that allows for the possibility of distinguishing and thus the beginning of the
2584320	2593520	concept of naming and thus the beginning of concepts themselves and the tree of nomenclature,
2594560	2603760	reference, representation, tokenization and consciousness, commodities, all these things.
2603760	2608240	You can see, in a sense, it could be understood as the origin of evil,
2609920	2618800	because all of these departures from unity and communion are necessary for the idea of knowledge,
2619600	2629920	right? And knowledge is so often, if not always, the death of participation. It's the knife that the
2629920	2637760	waking awareness brings to the bubbles of dreaming, collapsing them into awakening,
2638640	2645600	where identity is declarative rather than connotative or relational. It is declared rather
2645600	2654800	than suggested, which is what happens in moonlight. Sunlight is declarative, moonlight is suggestive,
2655520	2665760	invocative, invitational, connotational, associational, more like the imagination
2667040	2674880	than the denotation or the dictionary. And so, the implication here is that the serpent, both
2675440	2684400	the amonic, I'm going to call it the amonic implication for me, is that the serpent gave
2684400	2693280	Eve the toxin that brought her to the verge of death, to the liminal space between worlds,
2694640	2701360	the hypnagogic, pompic space. The serpent injected her with this venom and gave her the
2701360	2707360	knowledge of the venom and how to use it and also how to comprise the antidote.
2710000	2718560	And then she died and was resurrected and thus had knowledge, because the whole idea of knowledge
2719840	2729760	is equated with death in the Hebrew. The tree, the sephiroth in the center of it that isn't
2729840	2737840	numbered is doth, which is knowledge. And this doth and death are closely related. So the concept
2737840	2747440	here is that Eve was brought to the verge of death, essentially killed by the serpent, resurrected,
2747440	2753520	given the knowledge of the antidotes. She communicated this knowledge to the males, to Adam,
2754400	2761840	by producing the same series of events in his body and consciousness. They both were awakened
2762560	2774000	to the reality of death, which before had been perhaps impossible for them. And now that they
2774000	2782480	were no longer immortal in the sense of a rising moment to moment from the communal essence of
2782480	2794320	being, now they have become subject to mortality and physical death. And this is the
2798480	2806640	implication of the Ammonic knowledge that Ammon himself seems very resistant to. He claims that
2806640	2836400	this is the Canaanite path that he associates with all kinds of apparent ethical
2837280	2850720	deviation. I'm going to go check out this music, but we're going to come back to this. And the place
2850800	2862240	we'll come back to is Medea and how we get to the idea of Medusae from there. All right, so
2866240	2875760	I walked into the concourse between the museums here in San Francisco. There's a bunch of people
2875920	2884160	with spacesuits on the stage of the amphitheater, and they're playing a jazz version of Hallelujah
2884960	2889840	while I'm making this recording, which I think is fairly ridiculously
2891760	2900080	synchronistic and trippy and bizarre. All right, so Medea became one of the first
2900800	2910240	masters of the formulation and applications of venoms from serpents.
2915040	2918480	We must imagine particularly vipers, but probably also
2919440	2925760	cobras, and there are a variety of, okay,
2928880	2934720	ophi, let's see, what was he talking about?
2937840	2945600	I cannot recall the genus name that refers to the serpents, but it's OPH, right? It's like
2945600	2958960	ophiologists study serpents. So he talks about, in the book of Revelation, a reference,
2958960	2975360	it's insane people, unfortunately. He talks about
2976240	2993760	people referred to as essentially devotees of both this woman who
2994320	3005360	distributes elixirs that are derived both from serpents and her sexual exudations.
3010720	3020480	The ophians, ophidians, something like this. I can't quite find the word. In any case, Medea ends up in
3021120	3029520	what later becomes Sicily. I can't remember the other s name it had previously, which turns out to be
3029520	3037680	the birthplace of my direct paternal ancestors. Syracuse, I think, is what he called it.
3040560	3046880	And there's a man who's been bitten by a marsh viper, and she reaches, and this is in the original
3046880	3051840	sources, right? This is in the ancient Greek, probably in Nonos or Galen or something. She reaches
3052640	3062480	beneath her undergarments, produces a substance from her vagina with which she resurrects the sky.
3065520	3073760	And, you know, moderns, you poor, benighted folks, you can think whatever you feel comfortable about
3073760	3082400	thinking. You can think people are just making this stuff up. This is wildly improbable. Of course,
3082400	3090880	we know what's actually true about Jesus and pharmacology and molecular chemistry and all
3090880	3096560	of these things. Yeah, we know the mechanics to some degree. We know nothing of that plus.
3097520	3104880	And very, very little, we don't. We stopped mixing snake venom, you know, 8,000 years ago,
3104880	3110240	but there were people all over the world who knew that what could kill you could heal you,
3111760	3123840	and that particularly the energies and the capacities of the human spirit when driven into
3123920	3132960	either ecstatic modes. And when I say this word mode, I want you to think of both the
3132960	3143120	frequency and an array of shapes, a progressing array of shapes like you might see on a drum head
3144400	3151440	with sand or another substance on it when frequencies are being played on speakers
3151440	3158160	underneath the drum head so that geometric figures arise in the sand on the surface of the drum
3158160	3171280	head. This is what I'm, the human soul is capable of producing an array of iterative transformations,
3172080	3180000	right, that can be recursively self-amplifying and can produce staggering forms of healing.
3181840	3188880	In someone who is sick or poisoned. And what these ancients were often concerned with
3189920	3197200	was something, you know, when you hear, no one would think when they hear the psalm,
3197200	3202560	yea, though I walk through the shadow, you know, through I walk, yea, though I walk through the
3202560	3211920	valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. And they think this means you will not
3211920	3218320	fear evil because the holy ones are with you. But what it actually means is I will not fear dying
3219280	3230240	because the people of the antidote are with me. No one will think this. And yet the actual texts
3231120	3236960	almost certainly refer to something like this rather than what we are trained to think.
3237840	3246240	Now I have seen and was shown histories that are much more shocking and staggering than anything
3246240	3254800	Ammon has even hinted at. I don't speak of them to humans ever, not even in private.
3254960	3259360	I was shown
3264640	3276320	modes of relation that led to abilities that are wildly non-ordinary and unexpectedly profound.
3277200	3285440	I don't practice these things. I am simply aware that we are very confused about what it means to be
3285440	3291680	human. And actually we are extremely confused about what knowledge is because it has almost
3291680	3300240	nothing to do with the capacity to form mechanical tools. Actual knowledge is insight. And insight
3300960	3310800	means knowing the span from origin to the present, intimately and amnoetically recalling it
3311760	3316000	as if you are doing a sort of spiritual and or genetic
3316560	3329680	and amnoetic, right? Unforgetting archaeology within the depths of our bodies and being
3329680	3336160	and relationships. This is what real knowledge is. It's not mechanical knowledge. It's not physics.
3337120	3342880	It's not math. It's not mere geometry. Though geometry is strangely profoundly
3342880	3344880	related to all of these topics.
3363200	3367200	To concentrate on surviving the street crossing there.
3367520	3381520	So somehow today, for the first time, I've become capable of imagining
3383600	3390400	a gloss on the tree story that had never occurred to me before. That the serpent
3390800	3405120	took Eve to the brink of death or actually into death, right? And then gave her the antidotes,
3406640	3417760	revived her, resurrected her, and then she in turn led Adam through the same initiatory
3417760	3434080	process. I don't know, I may never know what Ammon actually thinks because I suspect that
3434640	3441280	if he's intelligent, like me, he won't share with, he won't say anything about this
3441920	3447600	to anyone ever. Or he might say something about it in private. I don't know what he
3447600	3455600	actually thinks or believes. One of the things he said when Danny Jones asked him if he was religious at all,
3458640	3465520	because he often apparently says the phrase, Hail Satan. And Danny asked him,
3465520	3469040	you know, why do you do that? Are you Satanist? He says, no, I don't like those people.
3469040	3473600	And Danny says, so why are you doing that? Who's Satan? And he says, he talks about Satan as
3474160	3489920	the Morning Star, the Lightbringer, the Enlightener, who was lied about because Zeus was a liar and so
3489920	3499200	projected, if I understand, this is very spooky and sketchy, but Zeus projected his own failings
3499760	3513680	and perhaps flailings onto Lucifer. And these are matters I inquired into during my own experience.
3516240	3523920	And I'm happy to communicate about privately, but I don't want to make clumsy abstractions about,
3524480	3531280	clumsy abstract generalizations. In effect, that is a form of sin. It's
3532720	3535440	sin by generalization and sin by abstraction.
3538400	3544640	In order to speak meaningfully about such matters, we must inquire together. We must begin with the
3544640	3557360	spirit of inquiry, not the spirit of dissertation or locution, has to start with inquiry together.
3557360	3567760	Then we have a chance to speak intelligently and learn intelligently together. So I will resist
3567760	3578400	the urge to speak about that matter abstractly at the moment. And I want to be clear that
3580720	3585920	for those of you who may have a desire to actually drink the waters
3590720	3596400	together, that's a wedding that doesn't happen in the invitation.
3597200	3606720	That's something that happens one on one. If we both agree that we want to cleanse our eyes
3608000	3619200	of the anciently complicated obstructions that language, concept, religion, policy, expectation,
3619200	3631520	tradition have imposed on us so unjustly, so terrifyingly. And yet some of the jungles,
3632640	3639600	you know, there are portions of the jungles of insight that are at least as terrifying to our
3639600	3647040	common expectation of meaning, identity, relationship, origin. They have nothing to,
3647040	3653280	they don't care a whit about what we prefer to believe or what we think is sane,
3654480	3664640	what we think is clean. There's no, you know, it's like dumping a bucket of water on the sun's surface,
3665440	3673600	if you could transport one there somehow. There's no respect for that.
3677520	3679760	There, it cannot be preserved there.
3686800	3697600	Huh. Okay, I'll try that.
3698320	3709840	There's a little library here on my street where a woman puts her books out and I saw her yesterday,
3709840	3713600	she came home and it's the first time I've seen who it is that's putting the books in here.
3714480	3717360	And I said, you know, you have some very interesting books and she looked at me
3718080	3723920	like I was an insane person, like I was a dangerous person, like I was someone she would
3723920	3731280	prefer to have no Congress whatsoever with. And it was really weird. She definitely
3735520	3740720	both refused the compliment. I feel like, yeah, you can keep that compliment to yourself, buddy.
3742160	3748720	I don't care. And I don't want to know you. And your mother was a conigate and your father
3748720	3760160	smelled of elderberries, et cetera, et cetera. But yeah, I've just found a book called the Child
3760160	3770160	Garden, which has extraordinary praise written all over it by Geoff Reiman. So maybe I'll read
3770160	3779440	some science fiction again instead of living it. But yeah, if you think what I present in my
3779440	3786320	recordings is deep, you should get a taste of what you're actually carrying, where you come from,
3786320	3794720	where we come from, where our minds, by what parents, our minds and souls were forged,
3794720	3802320	and for what purposes. And when we breach or broach the topics that I've been playing with
3802320	3812960	today, which were masterfully introduced by Amon Hillman, we're at least closing in on the vicinity
3813200	3828400	of stuff that really matters. We're closing in on the outskirts of the gardens of infinity
3829280	3843680	that are the origins of not just the lights in the sky, but the sky itself, and that from which
3843680	3854080	it emerges as a reflective embodiment of this thing, the living waters,
3855040	3860800	which Amon, a phrase that Amon actually mentions in relationship to
3862080	3869680	what he calls the third ventricle, which is a capacious space inside the brain
3870800	3881040	where a liquid circulates, an elixir. And what he talks about is women learning how to produce
3881040	3890960	drugs in their own bodies, so that their bodies became a pharmacopia. He says that the sources speak
3892240	3905760	of Medea and other women, Medusa, she calls giants not meaning huge, in size meaning huge,
3905840	3916560	in knowledge, gigantus. It's lovely to hear the reverence and terror with which he sometimes
3916560	3926000	pronounces Greek words. He claims that small serpents were treated with oils and stored
3927120	3933680	in the vaginal cavities of these women. I know how the moderns are just going to
3934400	3939200	like squinch up their faces and go like, okay, this dude's nuts, or maybe Darren's nuts.
3940000	3945680	But neither of those things are true. What's actually true is we moderns are completely broken
3947280	3948160	because we have
3951760	3958800	absolutely wrong ideas inculcated by nonsensical absurdities.
3964640	3969120	About matters related to medicine, origin, spirit,
3970480	3978160	Christ, the meanings of these ideas, all of these things are completely delusional.
3979040	3988000	We have this weirdly puritanical opposition to anything that might actually resemble understanding.
3988800	3996000	And if we are to have understanding, we must divest ourselves of the obstacles between us and that.
3998160	4006720	And some of that divestment is profoundly uncomfortable and conceptually unimaginable
4007920	4014080	to we who have grown up in a world divorced from these original stories.
4014720	4022560	So, as usual, I'm grateful for this time we've had together. I have arrived home.
4022560	4028400	I'm going to wash some feather quills that I retrieved and listen to more Ammon
4029200	4033680	and probably regret that I didn't speak further and longer on this topic,
4034400	4038160	which is so fascinating to me because for the first time I've started to see what
4038960	4053040	the possible relationship is between the snake in the tree in the garden and insight,
4054480	4062240	and also possibly a mystery in the black foot lore where the moon falls in love
4062240	4065440	with something that is referred to in the English translation
4065440	4068800	as a many-legged snake that lives in a hollow log.
4070240	4078640	Oh, God, this is so... I'm not even going to start to elucidate my concerns and thoughts about that
4078640	4085680	matter, which has been a primordial question that I and Ryan Firstiver have been chasing together
4085680	4093040	for many joyful years now. Thank you for joining me. I wish you all blessings, a beautiful path in
4093120	4100160	your life and day and moment. I wish you the wonders of actual insight. May the
4103200	4108240	may the plank in your eye be removed and may you resist
4111280	4120160	the compulsions of judgment so that you may taste the nectar.
4123040	4130160	Of liberation and insight. Bye-bye for now. Thank you for joining me.
