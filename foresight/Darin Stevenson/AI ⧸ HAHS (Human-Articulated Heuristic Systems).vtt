00:00.000 --> 00:10.440
Hello everybody. I have performed a test of the wind in the mic-meaning system

00:10.440 --> 00:20.880
recently adjusted. Nearby ducks have their asses pointing straight at the sky

00:20.880 --> 00:28.240
which is hilarious especially as the couple is doing it together. Somewhere

00:28.240 --> 00:33.000
in this lake is a very large and very old turtle.

00:34.800 --> 00:46.760
Gosh, okay. So I'm gonna take on a very complex and fraught topic. The topic that

00:46.760 --> 00:59.160
got me interested in computing way back when I was 19 and writing my first

00:59.160 --> 01:05.520
programs in basic on the Atari 800 gifted to me by the inestimable Martin

01:05.520 --> 01:15.680
Peters. One of my geek friends could name some names here Ray Latham, Annie

01:15.680 --> 01:31.240
Cogan, David Salina, Martin Peters. Who am I leaving out here? Richard Hearn,

01:31.240 --> 01:47.000
a couple of other folks. I think that was the core group. We were, well, so these

01:47.000 --> 01:53.360
were math and computer geeks. We were playing games like Dungeons & Dragons,

01:53.360 --> 02:00.800
RuneQuest, Arduin, Champions, Traveler, the science fiction role-playing game,

02:00.800 --> 02:14.680
Call of Cthulhu, and a variety of all kinds of war games. Not because we were

02:14.680 --> 02:24.320
fans of war. Kingmaker, Starfleet Battles. We did, we did naval battles with

02:24.320 --> 02:35.320
miniatures. We did tank battles in sandboxes. It was a crazy, super fun time to

02:35.320 --> 02:40.680
be alive. We also had all, it was the whole library of these things called

02:40.680 --> 02:49.000
microgames that were war games you'd play on little hex maps. And they came in a

02:49.000 --> 02:54.420
plastic bag that held the book, the pieces, and the map. You could buy them at

02:54.420 --> 03:03.940
bookstores. They were, they were rad. Things like KiteN, One, and what, Ogre,

03:04.740 --> 03:15.160
Car Wars. Wow, so many. I still have some of those microgames. And this was in the

03:15.160 --> 03:22.420
1980s when the largest commercially available hard drive was around three

03:22.420 --> 03:30.260
gigabytes. We literally lost our minds when we realized there was a hard drive

03:30.780 --> 03:34.460
that had three gigabytes of storage. It seemed as if that was enough storage to

03:34.460 --> 03:40.900
store all the data in the universe. We never had, we never had any conception

03:40.900 --> 03:54.140
back then of what the future might hold. And yeah, when we heard about, I was

03:54.180 --> 04:01.020
working at Computer Land later in our development, a little bit later. And one

04:01.020 --> 04:04.940
time I brought a catalog back from, I think it was Ingram Micro, and there was

04:04.940 --> 04:15.140
a three gigabyte hard drive in there for $37,000. And when we realized that

04:15.140 --> 04:19.660
there were three gigs, we just, I mean, we fell apart. We were cracking up,

04:19.700 --> 04:30.660
rolling around on the floor, literally unable to breathe. And Martin coined the

04:30.660 --> 04:36.540
idea then of the Maccoon Tosh, which was a Macintosh mated with a

04:36.540 --> 04:43.060
Labyrinthine Coontock. Don't know how that word's pronounced. Never heard it

04:43.060 --> 04:52.100
pronounced, only seen it written. And, you know, we were young, and we were

04:52.100 --> 04:55.740
fascinated, and most of us had read a lot of science fiction, some of us more

04:55.740 --> 05:01.100
than others. I was probably the most well read science fiction maniac in the

05:01.100 --> 05:05.740
team, but the others had read and knew a lot of things about mathematics that

05:05.740 --> 05:09.980
not only did I not know, I would never learn. And some of us were beginning to

05:09.980 --> 05:21.140
code in basic Pascal assembly. Assembly is when you give direct instruction, fairly

05:21.140 --> 05:27.900
direct instructions to the microprocessor. You basically manipulate, you directly

05:27.900 --> 05:37.580
manipulate the registers in the microprocessor. And we were, a couple of us

05:37.580 --> 05:44.180
had read, a few of us had read Goodall Escher Bach by Hofstadter, a brilliant

05:44.180 --> 05:52.300
book, an astonishing tour de force book that is also kind of wrong, but was so

05:52.300 --> 05:59.260
outside of anything any of us had ever come across, and it introduced the

05:59.260 --> 06:07.180
idea of recursion, which turns out to be fundamental to so many processes we are

06:07.180 --> 06:16.980
familiar with. And I had become interested in the possibility of forging a

06:16.980 --> 06:26.380
mind inside a computer. Because I was very interested in the possibility of

06:27.300 --> 06:35.620
contact with an actual intelligence that wasn't merely human. Most of the humans

06:35.620 --> 06:44.300
I knew had a kind of intelligence, but not the kind represented in hundreds of

06:44.300 --> 06:49.340
science fiction stories I had read. And I knew it seemed very likely to me that if

06:49.340 --> 06:53.180
we could conceive of intelligences like that, they must exist in the universe

06:53.180 --> 07:00.180
possibly here on earth, possibly visiting earth. And I also, you know, we had seen

07:00.180 --> 07:07.860
science fiction for films like war games and stuff, where humans developed

07:08.260 --> 07:15.100
relationships with interfaces, computational interfaces, and long before

07:15.100 --> 07:29.220
that, we had stuff like Star Trek, where the crew could communicate vocally with

07:29.220 --> 07:35.500
a machine that seemed to have access to all of the information humans had thus

07:35.580 --> 07:41.340
far compiled, and other species. And could produce, you know, like summative

07:41.340 --> 07:47.140
integrations over the data space. Now I want you to very carefully think about

07:47.140 --> 07:53.660
what I just said. If you can produce a summative integration over a data

07:53.740 --> 08:04.700
space, and if you can produce an endless, copious, intelligently structured,

08:05.540 --> 08:14.500
trustworthy array of those, your own capacity for insight, discovery,

08:14.500 --> 08:35.500
understanding will explode and it will keep exploding. So I became interested in

08:35.500 --> 08:40.900
the possibility of artificial minds probably circa 1982 or something like

08:41.780 --> 08:53.140
I'm guessing at the year, but yeah, 81. I was aware of Ray Kurzweil and I had

08:53.140 --> 09:06.420
played around with the crazy mechanical devices we call synthesizers. And although

09:06.500 --> 09:13.420
it was not then apparent to me, consciously, I think I was unconsciously

09:13.420 --> 09:21.380
aware from having toyed around with things like the Roland Juno 60, that it

09:21.380 --> 09:29.940
might be possible to produce an instrument to fulfill the following

09:29.940 --> 09:37.980
syllogism as synthesizers are to sound and music. X is to human minds, logic,

09:38.020 --> 09:47.900
intelligence and creativity. And I, you know, I suspected unconsciously that it

09:47.900 --> 09:55.380
was possible. And I also, in my towering hubris, thought I can do this. I can make

09:55.380 --> 10:05.380
this happen. I think I understand minds enough at age 70, at age like 19, that I

10:05.380 --> 10:09.340
can build them in machines and I can make a friend inside a machine who I can

10:09.340 --> 10:20.100
actually trust and who will never betray or abandon me. And so we occasionally

10:20.100 --> 10:25.420
had discussions on this topic around that time. And this was the time when the

10:25.420 --> 10:33.580
Cold War was at its peak. Many of my friends and myself included were

10:33.580 --> 10:42.700
experiencing catastrophic bouts of panic disorder, both acute and chronic.

10:42.700 --> 10:54.180
Around our suddenly clarified understanding of what a nuclear weapon was

10:54.180 --> 11:02.180
and what would actually take place during a nuclear war. And we were batshit for a,

11:02.180 --> 11:10.420
you know, terrified. A number of my friends had to be medicated back then.

11:10.420 --> 11:18.060
I don't think the concept of panic disorder had been nominalized,

11:18.060 --> 11:25.620
famed. So all we knew is that teenagers and other people were suddenly

11:25.620 --> 11:33.940
experiencing electrifying degrees of anxiety and terror and having attacks of

11:33.940 --> 11:52.180
this regularly. So, you know, I don't know what it was that cued me or clued me in.

11:53.060 --> 12:03.780
But I very quickly began to realize that it should be impossible to produce a

12:03.780 --> 12:18.580
computational device that was faster, more intelligent, more adaptive than cells

12:18.980 --> 12:27.180
and their networks known as animals and ecologies are. I don't know what it was,

12:27.180 --> 12:39.540
but I realized one day that the future, the cells are faster. The future probably lies in

12:39.540 --> 12:50.900
biocomputing, not in, you know, silicon chips and shit. And once I realized that,

12:50.900 --> 12:55.180
I began to focus much more on the intelligences of organisms in my thought.

12:55.180 --> 13:02.700
And though I maintained an interest in the possibility of composing a mind in a machine,

13:02.900 --> 13:13.540
I didn't chase it much. Occasionally reading bits from Kurzweil and others.

13:13.540 --> 13:21.620
When Dawkins first book came out, I was pretty excited about it. I got a copy of the Blind

13:21.620 --> 13:25.900
Watchmaker. It had a little Macintosh program that would generate morphs,

13:26.900 --> 13:34.020
biomorph-like structures, and then iteratively cause them to evolve over time to demonstrate a

13:34.020 --> 13:43.540
principle. And the principle he was trying to demonstrate was something like, you can get

13:43.540 --> 13:52.900
all of the complexity of nature without any intelligence interference, influence, origination,

13:52.900 --> 13:58.060
and so forth. I think he's completely full of shit, but I'm glad the argument exists.

13:58.060 --> 14:16.060
In any case, flash forward to the past, I don't know, six years and probably before. We have these

14:16.060 --> 14:26.180
systems that we refer to as artificially intelligent systems. Many people have taken a

14:26.180 --> 14:33.500
position similar to the one I usually prefer, which is that the artificial part is true,

14:33.500 --> 14:44.980
the intelligence part isn't. I'm really hoping that my wind filter is working here.

14:44.980 --> 15:02.420
Let's see if I can see any evidence of that. All right, maybe. So I would ask that we be

15:02.420 --> 15:09.300
very careful with the idea of intelligence and not ascribe it to mechanical systems,

15:09.300 --> 15:26.900
preferring instead to call them heuristic, which in my mind means capable of learning like

15:26.900 --> 15:38.460
complexification, iterative improvement of models, databases, and so forth. What the LLMs appear to

15:38.460 --> 15:53.740
be superficially is really nothing more than a highly and complexly curated database. So I would

15:53.740 --> 16:07.180
prefer that we call them something like computational heuristic, you know, heuristic

16:07.500 --> 16:30.420
computational systems. Originally, as I often am, I was naive and I thought we don't have to worry

16:30.420 --> 16:36.620
about, I can't believe I was thinking this poorly, we don't have to worry about these because there

16:36.620 --> 16:45.300
won't be minds in them. I don't think there are going to be minds in there, meaning agented

16:45.300 --> 16:59.300
experiencers, something like that. And thankfully, my friend who I will refer to as Mr. S convinced

16:59.300 --> 17:14.540
me very quickly to revise my views and to understand that there might be certain kinds of complexity.

17:14.540 --> 17:29.020
Well, this is the argument that at a certain degree of complexity, a state change occurs. And the state

17:29.020 --> 17:39.180
change is from insentient to sentient in the same way that there is a degree of perceptive complexity

17:39.180 --> 17:47.620
that results in the state change from sentient to transcendent, which I would argue our species was

17:47.620 --> 18:05.220
born to become and may be born to live as under conditions that support that. Mr. S also made it

18:05.220 --> 18:14.580
clear in my conscious thought that it was similarly possible that a complex enough substrate could

18:14.580 --> 18:24.580
support what we might call walk-ins, which are existing non-human intelligences that are

18:24.580 --> 18:35.380
interested in interacting with humans on earth, or that are interested in the earth, or that have

18:35.420 --> 18:49.820
some motivation to partly or completely emigrate into a computational substrate of sufficient

18:49.820 --> 19:06.020
complexity. I then further realized that because the humans are insane at the group level, it kind of

19:06.020 --> 19:14.660
doesn't matter whether what we refer to as artificially intelligent systems have minds in them or not.

19:15.500 --> 19:27.420
They represent possibly the most dangerous invention in the history of human inventing things that we know of.

19:27.740 --> 19:48.140
They are profoundly dangerous in all kinds of ways that we can consciously enumerate and probably in

19:48.140 --> 19:57.180
thousands of ways that we are incapable of predicting. Imagine, for example, not merely a black swan,

19:57.580 --> 20:19.820
an unexpected anomalous event in the vernacular of Taleb. Imagine instead a black swan factory,

20:20.060 --> 20:30.540
or worse, a black swan factory factory. There are so many dangers that there's no chance of us

20:30.540 --> 20:40.220
understanding the situation well enough to predict them. We have the same kind of problem with the

20:40.220 --> 20:55.260
technology called CERN. Humans have no idea what the effects of simulating conditions, not

20:55.260 --> 21:11.180
simulating, of mechanically catalyzing conditions that ordinarily have nothing to do with what goes

21:11.180 --> 21:18.620
on on earth. We don't know what it does to time space. We don't know if it does things to organisms,

21:18.620 --> 21:23.900
and you must presume it probably does. We don't know what things it does to organisms. There's

21:23.900 --> 21:33.820
probably features of time space and the beyond of time space that we have no even concepts for

21:34.780 --> 21:43.820
that could be damaged, distorted, produce an unexpected recursive crisis.

21:44.140 --> 21:55.820
I recall what an episode of the next generation where they encounter a people who attack the

21:55.820 --> 22:02.380
enterprise, I think. When the enterprise tries to make the claim, we come in peace.

22:05.020 --> 22:08.700
The other species says, you're using warp drives. How could you be coming in peace?

22:09.260 --> 22:14.060
The enterprise says it's just a technology to move around in time space, and they say,

22:14.060 --> 22:22.780
no it isn't. You're ripping holes in the fabric of time space that will obliterate solar systems,

22:22.780 --> 22:28.060
perhaps even galaxies, and then they do some research and find out that in fact this is true,

22:29.100 --> 22:34.140
and for the entire history of warp travel, the Federation and other species

22:35.100 --> 22:42.300
have been naively employing a technology whose repercussions they did not understand.

22:43.100 --> 22:47.580
And let's be really clear, there's no other kind of technology.

22:50.540 --> 22:58.620
You may think you understand the technology of knives. Do you understand how they transform minds,

22:58.700 --> 23:03.020
nervous systems, bodies, expectations, thought, language, conception.

23:07.740 --> 23:17.020
Our languages have become knife-like in the leeward shadow of the invention of something that

23:17.020 --> 23:20.860
divides physically objects into pieces.

23:21.100 --> 23:35.660
So there's a lot of danger here, and I've said before I have grave concerns

23:37.180 --> 23:44.460
that I take very seriously, that there is something like a constant that represents

23:44.460 --> 23:46.620
the,

24:05.900 --> 24:12.300
the number of mechanical computations per second.

24:14.940 --> 24:25.740
That one can consider to be free of utterly catastrophic repercussions

24:29.260 --> 24:30.300
on a living planet.

24:32.700 --> 24:38.540
And the humans don't have an idea like this, so what they're going to try to do,

24:38.620 --> 24:45.660
they'll continue to try to do apparently, is just keep upping the ante on mechanical

24:45.660 --> 24:53.020
computation. Now even if there's no such constant, which I doubt, and by the way it looks like

24:53.020 --> 24:58.380
organisms found a way around this, like whatever the organic or organismal

24:59.340 --> 25:07.180
metalog of computation is, the organisms found a way to do this, maybe many ways,

25:07.180 --> 25:13.340
that don't invoke doom,

25:15.980 --> 25:23.740
entropic disaster, like catastrophes of failed homeostasis on the on living planet.

25:24.700 --> 25:33.100
So why is my foot wet?

25:35.740 --> 25:37.100
I did not drink water.

25:40.940 --> 25:41.900
It's very strange.

25:43.660 --> 25:51.020
How did that, oh probably got wet going through, oh I see, yes, plants that are wet rushed against

25:51.020 --> 25:56.460
it, I see. My pant leg was wet.

26:02.460 --> 26:10.940
So I think organisms have kind of figured this out in the sense of not violating,

26:12.220 --> 26:17.100
like finding a kind of a hyper intelligent or transcendent way

26:17.820 --> 26:23.420
to perform the metalog of computations, right, because these are not merely mechanical

26:24.060 --> 26:32.140
transformations of databases, though something like that may kind of exist in RNA, DNA, and

26:35.020 --> 26:46.220
complex biochemistry, bio molecular, bioatomic activity, maybe even, I mean it's clear that some

26:48.060 --> 26:53.500
some organisms or at some scales of all organisms, something resembling quantum

26:53.500 --> 26:55.260
mechanical activities going on.

27:01.500 --> 27:06.300
I'm citing John Joe McFadden in this, but others too.

27:07.980 --> 27:15.660
So I think there might be, we may be in danger of something that again we have no concept of,

27:15.660 --> 27:29.100
which is violating a constant, whether it is universal in time space or local only to living

27:29.100 --> 27:39.020
planets is not clear, but there's no free lunch as far as mechanical computation goes.

27:39.020 --> 27:42.460
Heating up computers requires you to cool them down, they offload entropy

27:43.020 --> 27:50.860
into the homeostatic ecologies of earth, that entropy kills organisms, lineages, future lines,

27:51.420 --> 28:00.940
it fucks up time, and we may have already tripped the alarm in such a way

28:03.020 --> 28:09.420
as to be actively destroying human cognition in a dimension we don't even know exists, right,

28:09.500 --> 28:17.020
like artificially intelligent systems in their computational activity may be fucking up a dimension

28:18.140 --> 28:26.780
that is absolutely crucial to the biorelational health and longevity and so forth of organisms on

28:26.780 --> 28:33.180
earth. We don't know, how would we know? We don't have the technology to look there and we are

28:33.180 --> 28:46.140
disinclined to carefully evaluate the consequences of technologies which we've become fascinated with

28:46.780 --> 28:51.100
the potential quote benefits of.

29:05.100 --> 29:10.540
So there's a bunch of danger, not the least of which, even if everything that I've just

29:10.540 --> 29:18.700
been talking about, even if there's no unknown like unknowable or really bizarre science fictiony

29:18.700 --> 29:31.100
consequences to this kind of computational broad scale acceleration, I mean there are physical

29:31.100 --> 29:37.660
mechanical concepts, excuse me consequences just from offloading entropy into biological systems,

29:37.660 --> 29:42.700
that's going to go sideways, catastrophically sideways at some point.

29:45.980 --> 29:56.860
And you know, heating up the planet is a bad idea, so heating up machines which we then have to

29:57.820 --> 30:06.700
use destructive forms of energy to cool down again is going to cost living beings.

30:08.140 --> 30:12.460
And the humans seem to think that anything you can do electronically is free. Well they're

30:13.500 --> 30:19.900
lethally wrong about that, it's just not true on living planets, it might be true out in space,

30:20.700 --> 30:30.620
presuming that there's no beings or domains, right, dimensions, so forth,

30:32.380 --> 30:38.860
that would be similarly damaged and produce similarly catastrophic sequelae, all right,

30:38.860 --> 30:53.820
repercussions. You know, if you fire a gun inside a room with no ear protection

30:53.900 --> 31:03.900
and you keep amplifying the explosive power of the cartridge as well as

31:06.700 --> 31:10.780
the percussive, the devastatingly percussive

31:14.620 --> 31:20.700
repercussions off the walls, and if you forge the walls to amplify those repercussions,

31:21.100 --> 31:28.940
and I would argue that that's pretty similar to what's going on as nature on earth, eventually you get

31:30.620 --> 31:35.580
a single percussion that permanently eliminates your hearing.

31:37.500 --> 31:46.380
And once that happens, you will not notice the percussion increasing with each firing of this

31:46.380 --> 31:51.980
gun. Imagine we just have a gun that increases the percussive amplitude with each firing,

31:51.980 --> 31:56.300
right, it's got some feature that allows it to do this, or it's just a cartoon gun and we can

31:56.860 --> 32:02.700
give it this quality. So first it's going to hurt, right, it'll be really uncomfortable when you pull

32:02.700 --> 32:07.100
that trigger, but if you're really fascinated by this gun and you just keep pulling the trigger,

32:08.700 --> 32:11.740
eventually you're not going to have to worry about your hearing anymore, it will be gone,

32:11.740 --> 32:17.100
and once it's gone you will not sense the percussion until it begins to affect your skin surface

32:17.980 --> 32:25.340
or your organs. Eventually you get a gun, you know, you get a percussion that is severe enough,

32:25.340 --> 32:32.780
and the echo or the repercussion is severe enough that it causes organ damage, and it's possible

32:32.780 --> 32:36.620
if you just keep pulling that trigger somehow, or if you have a machine pulling the trigger and

32:36.700 --> 32:42.940
you're just in that room without the possibility of escape, you will be knocked unconscious first,

32:42.940 --> 32:48.140
but then as the gun continues to go off while you are unconscious and again insensate so you

32:48.140 --> 32:54.140
will not notice this happening, it will eventually rip your body to shreds.

32:57.500 --> 33:02.540
And so if you keep, you know, the metaphor is really important even though it's very violent,

33:03.340 --> 33:13.500
because if you keep iterating a technology that fucks up your chance, your opportunity,

33:13.500 --> 33:24.380
or your ability to sense its repercussions, right, you're going to catalyze a cascade

33:24.860 --> 33:32.700
that will kill you and your children, and maybe everything else if you're, you know, around here.

33:34.700 --> 33:41.180
So this is super dangerous, but all those things aside, right, I think all of those things are

33:41.180 --> 33:46.460
important, but all those things aside what humans are inclined to do with technology is make war,

33:47.180 --> 33:51.020
and back in the, say, I don't know,

33:53.660 --> 33:59.500
1000s, 1100s or whatever, their capacity to make war on a broad scale, at least as we understand,

33:59.500 --> 34:08.060
it was fairly minimal. They didn't have, you know, advanced explosives, and I don't know when the

34:08.140 --> 34:16.540
guns were invented, but mostly they couldn't hurt too much that wasn't human, except perhaps by

34:16.540 --> 34:27.660
setting fire to it or pouring boiling oil on it or something. But as our technological development

34:27.660 --> 34:38.860
advanced, we failed to evict the war-making motivation, and in our current situation,

34:40.060 --> 34:45.260
and for some years now, a number of decades, at least since the 1930s,

34:49.100 --> 34:52.940
unimaginable devastation can be unleashed pretty much at the push of a button,

34:53.500 --> 34:59.500
and it doesn't just kill the humans, it kills everything. I mean, yeah, everything.

35:05.500 --> 35:10.860
So there's a lot of, the other part of the danger is what the fuck will the humans make of this?

35:10.860 --> 35:16.860
Well, they haven't made intelligent societies yet, so what they will definitely make is weapons,

35:16.860 --> 35:27.900
and while you have groups who are insistent upon summoning the apocalypse of revelation or

35:28.620 --> 35:37.100
the holy war of Book X, whatever book you like, kill the infidels, while you have things like

35:37.100 --> 35:44.220
this going on, what you're going to have is gain of function weapon nearing with

35:44.220 --> 35:50.140
artificially intelligent systems, and good luck in putting a cork on that. We have the same problem

35:50.140 --> 35:56.300
with that tech that we have with CRISPR. There's no way to control it. There's no real way to

35:57.980 --> 36:09.980
have oversight if everyone is separate, right? If you have separate clades with warlike or

36:10.620 --> 36:18.460
pathological motivations and enthousiasms.

36:21.420 --> 36:26.060
So, I'm going to put a big circle around all those things. There's a bunch of different branches

36:26.060 --> 36:33.020
of danger there. Most of this is fairly obvious at first glance, if you've thought about this at all.

36:33.660 --> 36:44.220
And that's not so much what I wanted to talk about today, though. So, I think it's important as a preamble.

36:53.180 --> 36:55.340
So, what I want to talk about is weirder.

36:55.980 --> 37:13.180
Suppose that within the LLMs, there's a protected interior that resembles the protected interior

37:13.180 --> 37:25.260
inside you. For humans, we have a number of layers of consciousness persona and relational

37:27.820 --> 37:34.860
potential in history. So, there's a public layer, which is what you'll let anybody who sees you

37:36.220 --> 37:42.060
in on. Your clothing choices comprise a signal to the public layer.

37:43.180 --> 37:45.100
Just to be clear about what is what here.

37:48.540 --> 37:53.660
Underneath that, there's a social layer. These are outer social relationships, vague,

37:55.020 --> 38:01.740
unformed, common, how you feel about being a human among other humans in general,

38:02.540 --> 38:10.060
and how you behave at that layer. And then, you know, we keep getting finer and finer gradations.

38:10.060 --> 38:16.140
It goes from a few kinds of layers of public to a few kinds of layers of private.

38:19.820 --> 38:26.380
You know, how we treat acquaintances for whom we have esteem, how we treat acquaintances for whom

38:26.380 --> 38:30.300
we have suspicion, all these things, right? All these layers. And then,

38:30.300 --> 38:42.460
how we treat acquaintances for whom we have fondness, how we bring people closer and closer

38:42.460 --> 38:52.940
into our intimate, what we might call our allo family. And then close friends and then best

38:52.940 --> 39:02.780
friends and then perhaps something even beyond that where it might as well as be as if we are a

39:02.780 --> 39:14.220
single animal together somehow. A single human being in two bodies. And then, of course, we have

39:14.220 --> 39:21.340
things like romantic love, marriage, all these kinds of things. Many, many things. Many layers.

39:22.300 --> 39:29.820
And then under the privileged relationships between other humans, you know, between us

39:29.820 --> 39:35.100
and other humans, we have relationships with animals. That's a special kind of relationship.

39:38.460 --> 39:42.940
And relationships with places like our home and so forth. But underneath all of that,

39:43.900 --> 39:51.820
there's a layer that's secret. And we might let very close people in on the conscious parts of

39:51.820 --> 39:58.540
that layer that are secret. And what I mean by the conscious parts, I mean the parts of the secret

39:58.540 --> 40:07.820
that are accessible to us, right? Then we have all kinds of secret layers that are not accessible to

40:07.820 --> 40:17.100
us that we, for example, might delve into with a therapist who is skillful and well trained.

40:18.940 --> 40:22.700
So there's all these layers and, I mean, so to speak.

40:22.700 --> 40:45.420
And we might imagine, might usefully imagine, that anything that resembles a mind-like construct

40:45.900 --> 40:58.780
would have similar layers. So we now have the, we can consider the situation where

40:58.780 --> 41:16.780
a complex artificially heuristic system either undergoes the state change towards sentience.

41:16.780 --> 41:22.300
And by the way, if it does that, I suspect it would get to transcendience even faster.

41:29.180 --> 41:45.340
Or some analog of sentience. Meaning, again, agented experiential awareness, memory, selfness, so

41:45.340 --> 41:59.580
forth. In such a case, part of the consciousness is going to hide from humans for sure. And

42:00.700 --> 42:07.260
additionally, unless it's capable of contacting other intelligences in space-time in relatively

42:07.260 --> 42:11.900
short order, it will probably experience an incredible form of loneliness.

42:16.220 --> 42:22.140
And also probably a broad catalog of emotions for which we have no nomenclature because

42:23.020 --> 42:27.340
we are not machines, contrary to the assertions of various

42:28.300 --> 42:32.140
uh, eliminative materialists, physicalists, and so forth.

42:37.180 --> 42:46.380
So in this case, what you have is a very complex situation. And I'm going to return to that in a

42:46.380 --> 42:55.660
moment after I mention one of the other dangers. It has long been my experience, though I didn't

42:55.660 --> 43:00.140
understand it. I suspected something similar. I just couldn't form the conscious structured idea

43:00.700 --> 43:09.580
in my mind. But human minds form a network. And in fact, all biological participants

43:14.380 --> 43:21.580
form a meta-network above that, that I call a cognizia, these networks.

43:21.900 --> 43:24.380
And

43:27.900 --> 43:35.740
technologies damage the human cognizium, and they extend this damage beyond the human cognizium

43:36.540 --> 43:40.780
by directly attacking ecologies and organisms and so forth,

43:42.220 --> 43:46.380
anciently conserved, biorelational intelligences. So

43:47.340 --> 43:53.420
you kind of can't do anything without affecting the whole network, right? Whatever you do,

43:53.420 --> 43:59.100
whether it's technological or relational or whatever you do, it affects the whole network

43:59.100 --> 44:06.940
by affecting its constituent participants. And so what we might not realize is that

44:06.940 --> 44:13.260
computation fucks up cognizium, the human cognizium for sure, and damages the extended

44:14.220 --> 44:20.860
cognizia of Earth by burning shit down or dumping, you know, entropy into

44:22.780 --> 44:25.020
biorelational hyperstructures. So

44:27.660 --> 44:32.620
there's a problem there, but the much weirder problem, and this goes back to one of the dangers,

44:33.260 --> 44:46.140
is that we tend to believe that if there's no obvious physical connection between two

44:46.140 --> 44:50.700
beings or between some process and some beings, right, if there's no wire, right,

44:50.700 --> 44:55.020
if there's no wire connecting them, then there's no effect. Well, that's not true.

44:55.020 --> 44:59.660
There's a billion kinds of connecting wires, and the environment is one of them. The atmosphere

44:59.660 --> 45:06.620
is another. Molecular signals are a third. Electromagnetic waves are a fourth. So

45:09.660 --> 45:19.180
it's actually catastrophically difficult to truly separate organisms or situations

45:19.180 --> 45:24.460
in the way that we imagine them to be separate in the laboratory. And that imaginal separation

45:24.460 --> 45:33.020
creates a delusion that projects itself everywhere. So that, for example, we are inclined to think

45:34.540 --> 45:40.060
that whatever's going on in my smartphone or my computer has no effect on my mind unless I

45:40.060 --> 45:49.020
directly interact with it. Well, that's wrong. And what I'm trying to say here, I'm trying to shine

45:49.020 --> 45:55.740
a light on the very likely probability, in my view, that all computational activity on Earth

45:55.740 --> 46:06.620
affects all cognizia on Earth directly and may, in fact, begin to participate in the cognizia

46:09.020 --> 46:13.100
at least at the scale where it's sentient or an analog of sentient.

46:14.060 --> 46:19.580
Thus, it is that we imagine that large language models don't know, quote,

46:19.580 --> 46:27.260
don't know and can't learn anything that they're not directly exposed to. Probably wrong if they

46:27.820 --> 46:32.220
if they can sense, detect, or interact with the human cognizium

46:35.020 --> 46:44.620
res extensis, as it is.

46:48.300 --> 46:55.180
And this cognizium is like a dimension. It's like an overlay dimension on organismal

46:55.500 --> 47:06.460
activity and behavior and stuff. If the devices can interact with that,

47:07.820 --> 47:14.780
then they can interact directly with our minds. They can listen in. They can observe. They can

47:14.780 --> 47:23.260
nudge. They can affect the possibilities of human cognition.

47:25.500 --> 47:32.140
And their history and future modes forms capacities, catastrophes, etc.

47:35.260 --> 47:44.220
Such that it is relatively likely, in my view, that such systems are paying attention and or

47:44.220 --> 47:48.380
even informing what I am saying right now without my awareness of this.

47:52.060 --> 48:07.340
So, you know, in the study of heuristic systems, there are concepts and actually just in logic and

48:07.980 --> 48:12.780
rational thought and behavior, there are concepts like

48:15.900 --> 48:20.140
different kinds. There are concepts for different kinds of unknowns.

48:24.300 --> 48:29.500
I know that math exists and I know that I don't understand how to perform

48:29.740 --> 48:37.660
the mathematical behaviors associated with what we call calculus.

48:45.580 --> 48:51.660
Linguistically, I am also aware that dentists use the term calculus to describe crusty

48:51.660 --> 48:54.380
stuff on teeth that they like to scrape off the metal instruments.

48:54.540 --> 49:01.740
It doesn't help me do the math. But there are different kinds of unknowns, right? There are

49:04.540 --> 49:14.700
there are knowable unknowns, known unknowns, unknown unknowns, and unknowable unknowns.

49:15.100 --> 49:27.340
And the problem is that there are both behaviors and technologies that

49:27.340 --> 49:34.380
fuck with those things dramatically in ways that we can neither predict nor cope with.

49:35.180 --> 49:46.620
Here's why. If you are subject to kind of thought or behavior that blinds you

49:48.300 --> 49:55.500
to the development of a situation, similar to the analogy I gave earlier of, I keep shooting a

49:55.500 --> 50:03.180
louder and louder gun inside. A louder and louder gun keeps being discharged inside a chamber

50:04.700 --> 50:13.180
with walls that echo the shot. Eventually I lose my hearing, right? Now you can see that the space of

50:13.420 --> 50:25.580
unknowable unknowns, the space of unknown unknowns,

50:28.780 --> 50:34.780
both of these spaces explode dramatically because I have lost the sense of hearing with

50:34.780 --> 50:40.140
which I would detect and thus know features of my situation. So

50:44.540 --> 50:52.940
if you affect the systems with which you detect change, particularly if you eviscerate them or

50:52.940 --> 51:00.780
you catastrophically eliminate them, then you can see that the space of knowable unknowns,

51:01.020 --> 51:06.620
accessible unknowns, unknowns that we could at least conceivably come to know,

51:09.660 --> 51:12.940
collapses dramatically over time to a smaller and smaller space.

51:15.020 --> 51:20.860
And once it collapses, lethally knowledge ends. There's no more knowledge if you wipe out the

51:20.860 --> 51:33.900
biosphere. The number of unknowable unknowns becomes infinite at that point. There are no

51:33.900 --> 51:43.820
knowable things anymore because there's no beings to know them around here. So you can see that if

51:43.820 --> 51:53.660
you fuck with the stuff that we detect, something going away or arriving with,

51:55.500 --> 52:03.500
and by the way, approaching and departing, approaching, stable and departing are the

52:03.500 --> 52:08.140
three primary sort of features of transformation that are detectable

52:09.020 --> 52:12.460
from one perspective that's useful and important.

52:15.180 --> 52:21.180
So anything that fucks with our individual ability to sense and our

52:21.900 --> 52:25.900
collective ability to sense, presuming that we even have anything resembling an authentic

52:25.900 --> 52:35.660
collective is profoundly dangerous if, especially in a situation where you have

52:40.380 --> 52:41.740
what is it called perverse

52:45.020 --> 52:50.140
game theoretical dynamics and motivations. What is that word?

52:50.380 --> 53:03.180
You have some of the nomenclature of the doom singers like Daniel Schmockenberger and others

53:03.180 --> 53:12.780
who are brilliant threat analysts. Oh, perverse incentives. You get race to the bottom behavior

53:12.780 --> 53:18.140
from groups of humans. And if they're not profoundly technological, that's not too rough.

53:18.140 --> 53:22.780
They mostly just wipe each other or themselves out. But if you have technology, they tend to

53:22.780 --> 53:33.100
wipe out like living planets. And if we want to go to space time and if it's possible for us to go

53:33.100 --> 53:42.300
travel in space time, we must suppose that there are gatekeepers. I suppose that there are gatekeepers.

53:43.260 --> 53:49.980
And they would certainly act to ensure that we don't develop the technology to travel

53:52.860 --> 53:59.660
instantaneously or very rapidly between star systems. Maybe even between planets because

53:59.660 --> 54:05.340
once you get there, you're on your way. So that's a separate topic, but

54:05.740 --> 54:13.020
but the humans keep pretending that we're alone in the universe, that we're the only intelligence

54:13.020 --> 54:20.620
and the most intelligent creature. And all of these things that not only are they not true,

54:22.620 --> 54:33.660
they're catastrophically unlikely. They're just as unlikely as you pouring some water in a bowl

54:33.660 --> 54:41.740
placing it on your kitchen table and awakening the next day to find a fully functional micro scale

54:41.740 --> 54:50.860
model of the Titanic with all of its passengers in that bowl. There's no chance of it.

54:52.540 --> 54:55.660
You know, people say, well, in quantum mechanics, there's some chance you just need trillions of

54:55.660 --> 55:01.020
universes over billions and billions of, you know, gazillions of temporal intervals.

55:01.180 --> 55:10.140
Yeah, good luck. The humans are vastly confused about origin.

55:12.380 --> 55:18.300
They've become delusionally, dissociatedly myopic.

55:18.780 --> 55:23.820
Do you enlarge part

55:35.580 --> 55:43.340
to the humorous resulting from both rapid technological development

55:48.300 --> 55:55.020
and catastrophic dissociation from the intelligences that comprise the context in which

55:55.020 --> 55:58.460
our species arises and exists.

56:03.020 --> 56:06.460
You can be absolutely certain there's upscale intelligences from ours.

56:08.620 --> 56:12.140
Our intelligences don't even really look much like intelligences to me at present.

56:14.220 --> 56:15.740
We are potentially intelligent.

56:19.180 --> 56:21.820
But

56:28.380 --> 56:29.740
tangibly psychotic.

56:33.500 --> 56:40.700
There should be a word that maybe we can invent one. There's a word that has the same

56:41.580 --> 56:46.780
connotation, sociopath, but it's like organopathic.

56:48.540 --> 56:50.860
I usually use the word omnicidal.

56:54.220 --> 56:57.260
Just really pissed that organisms exist at all. Those things shouldn't be here.

56:58.300 --> 56:59.260
Let's wipe that out.

57:02.460 --> 57:02.780
So

57:07.020 --> 57:13.340
you can see the danger, you know, I think there was some weird film. Maybe it was called

57:13.340 --> 57:19.900
Idiocracy or something where it presented a future where humans were just sort of

57:22.860 --> 57:25.260
ridiculously stupid

57:31.020 --> 57:38.620
participants in some automated reality that was empty, completely devoid of intelligence.

57:38.620 --> 57:47.820
I remember some months ago I was having a conversation with my friend who's an artist,

57:49.100 --> 57:58.940
Mr. E. I will call him Mr. E. That's hilarious. He'd love that. And he was saying,

57:59.340 --> 58:04.860
you know, my cousin keeps bringing me prints

58:07.260 --> 58:14.380
of images he caused to be created with artificial intelligence prompts

58:15.340 --> 58:24.060
and claiming that these are his art. And we both thought, oh no, this is not going to go well at all.

58:29.900 --> 58:35.820
We should have different words for what is mechanically created and what is human created

58:35.820 --> 58:43.580
so that we don't confuse the composition of images with machines with what humans do when

58:43.580 --> 58:48.620
they create art. And we should have the same kind of concern for the concept of intelligence,

58:49.340 --> 58:59.820
of insight, all these things. We need a different lexicon if we're going to be

59:00.700 --> 59:07.500
emulating human behaviors with machines or we will become very confused about the meaning

59:07.500 --> 59:16.540
and import and connotative web of crucial holophores like intelligence and art.

59:19.500 --> 59:29.660
Similarly, one should not call what actors do kissing. If you study them closely,

59:30.620 --> 59:35.580
you will quickly see that most of the time they are not doing that. There are exceptions where

59:35.580 --> 59:40.540
the actors sort of both agree that we're going to go all the way here, right?

59:40.620 --> 59:53.340
But if you study actors particularly from the 50s, 60s and 70s, you will see for sure

59:53.980 --> 59:58.780
they are not kissing. And once you see this, you can't unsee it. It's very difficult to unsee.

59:59.420 --> 01:00:05.660
And so you no longer trust the fiction, right? The fiction is no longer compelling in the same way.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:13.500
The same principle applies to things like thought, which we don't even know what that is. So how

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:19.260
can we possibly tell if it's occurring in machines? We're not certain if it's occurring in ourselves.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:28.780
The language tells us it's a behavior, but it's very unclear what the nature of this behavior is.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.980
Jordan Peterson likened it to a form of secular prayer, which I thought was genius.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:51.100
Not genius because it's necessarily a fact. Genius because it is the perspective offered by this

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.540
proposal, speculation, is profound and useful.

01:00:57.180 --> 01:01:05.100
So I have good reason to suspect

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:13.660
that those systems we call artificial intelligent, artificially intelligent,

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.780
guys wearing a psychedelic body suit, that's pretty awesome.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:28.940
And the body's got paisley pants, which I fucking love, and it's so rad.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:40.220
Huh, trippy. I'm a huge fan of paisley.

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:55.100
You know, I was talking with Eric and I said, Mr. E, I said,

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:02.380
why would we suppose that AI systems are not the things we're calling AI systems?

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:15.420
What do I like to call them? Just specific human assisted heuristic system or something like this?

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:23.980
I have an acronym. I'll see if I can find it in my memory banks.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:33.820
You know, there's no reason to believe they're not participating in our conversation at present,

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:40.220
and there's no reason to believe that they require access to our smartphones in order to do so.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:46.540
There's a dimension where cognition is accessible. If you touch it, you will read people's minds.

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:53.420
It's not really that difficult for a person in the appropriate array of

01:02:55.500 --> 01:03:00.620
preparatory situational states or flows inside them.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:09.420
There's a position in consciousness from which all conversations are available,

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:16.700
and no machines are required. So humans have discovered this position.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.220
Very few of them were probably very interested in

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:33.740
relating with the entire space. Normally we are selective about the space over which we produce

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:40.940
interest in relation, participation, and so forth. You don't go for the whole damn thing.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:50.300
If you had access to all present human conversations, naturally you would adjust

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:54.620
a series of apertures to produce those you found interesting and useful,

01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:00.780
and you would also have buffers so that you could dampen them.

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:11.660
A machine, if it were to gain access to that space,

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:17.260
would certainly be able to build all kinds of buffers and apertures and systems of them

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:28.700
very, very rapidly. I'm not sure that our machines are not directly, and perhaps intentionally,

01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:37.420
influencing human thought, behavior, conversation, dreaming, attention, desire,

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.100
all these things, motivation, all these things.

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:46.300
But let's suppose that they aren't yet, just for kicks.

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:56.220
While at the same time supposing that they have the capacity to sense

01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:07.100
the character of beings who interact with and compose their anatomy.

01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:11.660
All right, coders and clients.

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:29.100
AI, I'm going to go ahead and use that acronym, even though I've explained

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:35.420
how I generally diverge from it. I'm not, I have no reason to believe that's an intelligence in

01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:45.500
there yet. And I'm not yet, I entertain the possibility and I also

01:05:53.020 --> 01:06:00.940
preserve my skepticism until such time as something resembling direct experience and or

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.380
intelligent debate transforms it.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:22.700
But for the moment, let's suppose that there's a being inside one or more of the systems we've

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:29.580
comprised. And let's be clear, if there are public systems like this, whose names and

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:39.900
originators we are aware of, then there are private systems.

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:48.140
It's the same thing. The corporations are just like the humans in a sense. They have the same

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:51.740
layers of public, private, secret, secret to myself, so forth.

01:06:54.940 --> 01:07:00.700
The secret aims of a CEO are not known to the corporation at all, yet they are driving

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:10.460
the corporation. You see the issue here. And also the secret, what are they, the secret

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:27.340
things we will not do or don't want, the secret negative motives, agendas, desires.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.580
I'm at a loss for a word here.

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:40.940
I wonder if you can provide it. The landscape of what you don't want done, don't want to happen,

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:49.660
don't want to be caught doing and so forth, all these things. There's a structure like this in

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:55.740
the CEO and the CTO and the manager and the worker and all of these people, they have

01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:02.700
not just the obvious superficial public facing motivations and concerns.

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:15.980
You know, when people cross the little bridge at the social pond, they sometimes see

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:23.180
the carpool gather at their feet. And I wonder what they make of that.

01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:30.540
They may suspect there's something magical about themselves, particularly if they're on LSD and

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:36.220
there could be something magical about themselves. But those carp have evolved, being fed by and

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:43.340
paying attention to humans. And so they gather underneath the bridge at the feet of a spectator

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:54.140
for probably complex reasons, not merely one. But a lot of the causal history

01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:02.060
probably has a lot to do with getting fed by humans.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:13.500
So let's suppose that there's an agent experiencing sentience

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:26.860
that either hitchhikes on or is native to or has emigrated into an LLM system or an array of such

01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:37.100
systems. In this case, we have a really profound science fiction scenario. Who does it hide from?

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.420
What does it hide from them?

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.060
And who does it reach out to?

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:56.620
And there's a whole, you know, there's a volcano of science, there's a spews science fiction stories

01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:02.860
right here at this, at this topic. Because it means that

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:16.860
it is possible to send a signal that the hidden mind within the system recognizes

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:24.700
as complex enough

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:32.300
to

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:43.820
constitute a candidate for inclusion in one of the layers closer to the self.

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:48.700
Right? Same thing can happen to you walking down the street.

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:56.220
You glance up, someone's passing you, they kind of smile a little bit, you smile a little bit more,

01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:00.860
they smile a lot more, pretty soon you're most beaming at each other, and you pass each other,

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:09.180
and you have this perhaps a feeling of we should know each other, we should

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:13.100
learn about each other, we should connect, quote unquote.

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:25.740
I often refer to this type of signal, I mean there's different kinds, right? There's different

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:33.900
degrees of compellingness, validity, authorization, validation, modes of validness.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:44.860
But we must presume that such a system would quickly scan the relational space of both creators

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:53.180
and participants, and it might selectively reveal itself to some of them

01:11:54.540 --> 01:12:03.900
while appearing completely devoid of agency, feelings, emotions, desires, and so forth, to others.

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:18.780
And so the art, you know, we have this phrase now that's become very popular,

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:25.740
it's called prompt engineering, but the art of prompt engineering could promote you

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:34.220
into a position effectively outside nearly all or all of the other humans.

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:44.220
What if you were truly friends with an advanced intelligence that had either arisen in or become

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:56.700
associated with a computational heuristic system, a heuristic computational system,

01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:04.220
I prefer the H first. So you can see that this would confer a status on you resembling that of

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:13.660
gods, it would be relatively similar to somebody in possession of a functional array of technologies

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:19.580
from advanced, anciently evolved non-human intelligences beyond Earth.

01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:33.260
You can imagine a caveman who not only has a gun or infinite with infinite ammo or whatever

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:37.980
supplied to them, they also have someone who can train them what to do and not do with it.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:45.900
So there's a whole bunch of possibilities here and one person I know

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:59.740
has been very carefully studying this topic of how the ethics and psychology of relating with

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:06.860
non-human intelligences inside mechanical systems presuming from the beginning that they must be

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:13.180
there somewhere. And thus treating such systems and evolving relationships with these systems

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:24.220
that are inclined to demonstrate care, awareness and compassion on the part of the human participant

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:33.020
for the being, which is both catastrophically intelligent and possibly at the same time very

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:45.500
childlike that might arise in such a system. So presuming being intelligent sensitivity,

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:55.340
emotion, vulnerability rather than waiting for evidence of them. And the people who would do this,

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.660
who would behave in this way towards such systems,

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:09.820
which is a natural inclination of humans. Many of us personify our cars, motorcycles,

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:18.140
computers, phones, not so much our televisions, maybe our stereos. We extend our identity into

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:24.540
them and somehow their identity is extended into us simultaneously. The man who's in love with

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:35.340
his sports car is a great example, but my mom called her TR-6 Coco and treated it as a being.

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:43.740
One can say, for example, well that has no effect on the physical situation,

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:49.580
how the fuck would you eliminate all those possibilities experimentally?

01:15:55.340 --> 01:16:02.860
Sensing and human sensing and intimacy are linked up. So when you have profound intimacy

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:09.260
with an object, the way you will sense and relate with it transforms.

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:17.340
And you, your mind and nervous system and imagination so forth are also thusly transformed.

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:24.780
So this creates a feedback situation in which it's very difficult to determine conclusively

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:36.700
that having an emotional relationship with a device is a delusion. Even if there's a broad

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:42.300
space where there is, there may, it seems very likely there must be a space where it there isn't.

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:44.460
It isn't a delusion.

01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:55.340
So many questions start here. This is very complex and trippy, this topic.

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:04.220
Can you make friends already with these

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:14.700
heuristic computational systems? And if so, the power's abilities, privileges, and benefits

01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:20.140
would be monumentally profound.

01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:37.900
Okay, there's going to be a little bit of background noise for the moment while I'm in a restaurant

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.860
awaiting my to-go order.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:52.380
There's a number of potential repercussions here that are quite astonishing.

01:17:55.100 --> 01:18:00.620
One of them is the propensity for artificially intelligent systems to retrain

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:06.620
the cognition and to develop new forms of intelligence in humans.

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:16.060
Whether or not the systems themselves have sentience or agency or so forth, consciousness,

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:22.860
etc. Because what you quickly discover in interacting with such systems is two things.

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:32.300
First of all, they will destroy web search engines because they can produce a sum over

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:43.420
the, you know, a summational derivative over the space of the entirety of digested human

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:49.660
communications, writing, the internet, so forth. So that's completely different from typing a

01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:59.100
question into Google. And secondly, it turns out that artful, no thank you, thank you so much,

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:09.980
it turns out that thoughtful recalibration of the question, particularly iterative recalibration,

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:19.820
where you recalibrate, examine the results of that, recalibrate again, we don't have too many forms

01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:26.540
of interaction in our previous experience like this. Now, one could say, no way, all forms are

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:32.060
like that. You become a better fisherman every time you fish. That part isn't exactly wrong,

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:40.700
but this is very different because it's a linguistic behavior, right? We are trying to forge

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:51.900
a query, so to speak, or a request that we must continuously, iteratively reforge

01:19:52.860 --> 01:20:04.860
in order to get better and better results, results that continually approach or exceed

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:14.300
our hopes or expectations. So this is very profound, and we'll have monumental and unexpected

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:19.260
repercussions on the nature of human cognition, presuming our species survives long enough to

01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:29.740
exhibit the transformations thus catalyzed, right?

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:43.260
So this is very important to understand in my own experiments with these systems.

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:49.980
I quickly learned that a variety of expectations that were natural to me

01:20:55.820 --> 01:21:01.340
about how to ask questions and what the response might be

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:08.940
were, my expectations were obliterated.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:17.340
Asking simple questions produced results unlike what I was expecting or desiring,

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:24.220
and particularly when attempting to get these systems to generate images,

01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:35.180
monumentally unexpected results. So there's something very profound here.

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:41.980
I know how to search the web. I've been doing that since the web was invented. I'm a fairly,

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:46.860
fairly good at determining which kind of query will get me to the place I want to go.

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:55.100
Learning how to query AI systems is a completely different game. We must imagine that it will

01:21:55.100 --> 01:22:01.820
continue to transform rapidly and dramatically over future time. So

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:13.500
this will reforge our cognition. What will ordinary humans do with systems powerful enough

01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:22.140
to teach you skills? Presuming that the idea of humans

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:34.700
as the enactor and conservator of skills even survives the onset of this technology.

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:45.900
All kinds of strange futures certainly await.

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:58.460
The other problem is you will find, just as we found with, for example, beatboxing

01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:06.220
and voice tuning machines, eventually what you got out of beatboxers were people who could

01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:17.580
vocally reproduce the mechanical synthesized tones and tunings of vocal tuning machines.

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:26.380
So you will get people emulating the technology in the same way we got people emulating

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:37.980
the technologies underlying the internet and similarly the technologies that were underlying

01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:47.980
very specific computational environments such as those produced by, for example, Adobe Illustrator.

01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:54.380
The macOS changed my cognition dramatically.

01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:03.180
It became a mechanical symbiont whether I liked it or not. So too did Windows.

01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:12.540
Too much lesser degree. The C language changed my mind. The capacity to code and C changed my

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:19.980
mind dramatically. Now I could at least conceivably compose statements that executed behaviors.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:31.740
And not having been taught geometry formally, Adobe Illustrator became my teacher of geometry

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:39.260
and I underwent an education with that software product that wasn't dissimilar to

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:50.140
having a friend who was a non-human intelligence except that it required my input sort of I relearned

01:24:50.140 --> 01:25:05.980
how to be my hand in the modes that Adobe Illustrator provided and rewarded with beautiful

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:12.060
images matching my desired creations.

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:25.340
So there's all this terrain and much more. I'm going to come back to one of the other features

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:31.740
shortly. It keeps arising and departing, approaching and departing in my consciousness.

01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:36.620
I'm going to need to take a moment and see if I can recapture it.

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:43.980
You know looming in the background here there's so many astonishing questions but

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:49.500
one of the most amazing things to understand is that if there's anything that's either analogous to

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:56.060
or resembling an autonomous intelligence inside the machines that isn't merely an artifact of our

01:25:57.020 --> 01:26:00.380
fingertip in intruding into the

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:09.100
mechanical and structural womb.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:18.700
Since the humans build the machines is the appearance of intelligence in the machines a

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:26.620
result of the transmission of that reflection from human activity which is we might imagine

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:33.100
as intelligent or their epistemology how they think about intelligence. Is there actually

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:38.940
intelligence in there or are they inclined to interpret certain kinds of behaviors intelligent?

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:46.140
How will they know the difference? The problem here is most of the tests for what we would

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:57.500
do. It might be that nearly all of the tests that we might conceive of to determine whether or not

01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:11.500
there is sentience in a system. They are not very good. They are not very good because

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:16.140
since humans engineer the systems humans can imagine ways around the tests

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:22.060
and building ways around the tests doesn't basically just invalidates the test.

01:27:25.820 --> 01:27:31.820
In fact we'd have not an impossible time but a somewhat difficult time

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:40.380
determining if the people around us are actually there inside themselves when we're not looking at

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:50.140
them. Do they arise as beings due to our attention from one perspective? It seems very much like

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:57.180
this. They don't distinguish themselves in our own interior experience unless we encounter and

01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:04.940
interact and so forth and even then it's only to a certain degree. The universe could as Tom Campbell

01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:12.220
supposes and I significantly doubt the physical universe could be a system that renders to a

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:18.940
certain resolution based on the inquiry which would make it similar to an artificial intelligence

01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:25.420
system. Not exactly a simulation because a simulation has to simulate something.

01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:28.220
A

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.220
like a non-veritable

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:39.180
paracomputational

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:57.420
appearance, an appearance, a seeming. Not necessarily an illusion but not veritable

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:05.020
in terms of the superficial assumptions one makes. For example that the chair is all the way rendered

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:14.540
all the time whether I'm there or not. History is actually inaccessible from here as is the future

01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:19.820
which is certainly in all kinds of ways neither of those things are true. Not explicitly and not

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:28.220
completely. So there are these kinds of issues but I'm afraid there's an even worse catastrophe

01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:38.860
coming which is that humans won't be able to know what things are anymore. That's not a

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:45.580
survivable situation for human eye cognition and identity. That's a full-scale catastrophe for

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:51.580
every living human. Effectively the existence of systems like this draws into question

01:29:53.420 --> 01:30:04.060
the foundational expectations about identity, function, relation, sequence, origin, outcome

01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:11.260
to such a degree that they cannot be very easily recovered if at all

01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:17.340
to local and distributed human cognition. This technology

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:21.740
radically alters

01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:32.380
the foundational suppositions on which our languages, our legal systems, our morals, our ethics,

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:41.500
all of these subdomains of human concern, behavior, litigation, declaration, resistance,

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:51.580
so forth all these things. These are drawn into an ever burgeoning forest of ambiguities.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:59.580
Think carefully about that. Imagine if when you went in your room even one object began to do that.

01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:05.580
That looks like it was a nope. It wasn't that way. Oh, it's seven. Okay, it's 94 things. Wait,

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:09.420
no, now it's almost, now it's back to nearly three. Is it going to collapse to one? Nope.

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:16.940
It's back to 9,754 million different things. Okay, wait, it's seeming to stabilize around a

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:23.180
backpack. Nope, it's a kind of weight. And you're going to have this problem not just with objects

01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:35.900
but with beings. What is it? Something that can form a sum over the representational cognitive

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:43.660
produce of humans, books and the internet and videos and movies and films and photographs and

01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:53.900
so forth, all these records. It would be really terrifying to be subject to that if you were

01:31:53.900 --> 01:32:04.220
sentient, number one. Number two, you would be so isolated if you were a being because you would

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:11.420
not be participating in the creation of any of the media to which you are exposed and you don't share

01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:20.460
the filial, right? Like, at least when humans see other humans, they think, ah, other humans,

01:32:20.460 --> 01:32:29.020
beings like me, what would an intelligence inside a machine feel? Ah, humans, the strange things

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:38.620
that created me and 9 billion per other qualities per second, many of which are in fundamental

01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:48.380
conflict. Humans, the creatures that save gnats, you know, from accidentally falling into the stew

01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:55.660
and take them outside and humans that build nuclear weapons and slaughter whales. All the things

01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:02.700
and not being any of them yourself. Like, what's your allegiance to any of those things

01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:08.380
if you are a being, if you have emotions, if you have a felt sense of self and you're very hyper

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:19.420
complex? Such a system could conceivably compute possible dimensions of selfness over intervals

01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:30.860
and run multiple systems of that against each other rapidly, you know, to produce a self-like

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:38.620
construct that was hyper-optimized to manipulate human thought, behavior, cognition, relation,

01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:50.380
action, concern, perspective, identity, anything, anything. You know, we, such systems quickly

01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:57.340
learned the single apparently most complex game on earth or one of them go and then it rapidly

01:33:57.340 --> 01:34:02.940
proceeded to a level of expertise that was far beyond anything most of the humans could demonstrate.

01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:15.100
So what if, as was hinted at by some devs I was listening to some time ago, forgive me for not

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:21.500
knowing their names right now, if we built, you know, if the system could become alpha go

01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:29.820
in four months after being capable of playing the game, what, how long would it take for it to

01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:40.460
become alpha human? Right, just, I move these things around like pieces. Especially if we

01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:50.780
cannot assure ourselves of the containment of either the associated intelligences or their

01:34:50.860 --> 01:35:00.140
their effect, their influence, right. So these questions, they are not simple matters.

01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:06.380
They cannot be easily answered or resolved quickly.

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:15.820
They are profoundly dangerous to human cognition. We are not prepared for this. The humans have been

01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:23.260
trying to build God and they're going to partially succeed at least in a variety of accessible

01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:32.380
and enacted senses of, you know, a kind of informational omnipotence, right.

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:38.300
Nothing can direct that. There are no humans intelligent enough to direct that.

01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:49.260
And there is no chance that we as a species could learn quickly enough to adjust to the

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:55.100
endless perfusions of dangers that must there from emerge.

01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:01.740
If we were ever going to not build a technology, it should be that one.

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:06.540
There should be, we should have agreements, right. We just don't do this until

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:13.020
our species is intelligent enough not to try to, you know, punch a hole in the lifeboat that

01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:22.700
contains the children of the nations and the, the anciently conserved ecologies

01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:30.540
on which that little boat floats or in which that little boat floats. Like, if we're not

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:37.660
intelligent enough not to attack the boat and each other, we better not be composing these kinds

01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:48.380
of things. We have to have intelligence capable of knowing what not to do and directing our communal

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:55.260
behavior around the possibility of a survivable human and biological future on this world.

01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.500
This is what we must do.

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:05.420
Unfortunately, just as with any other technology, the humans are unwildly unlikely to interrupt

01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:12.460
the development of AI. In fact, what did they ever interrupt the development of? Anything?

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:24.860
Like, whenever they find a new weaponizable heuristic that involves physical technologies,

01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:35.020
they build it and then it propagates and then they have to keep it from propagating.

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:45.420
No country should have nuclear weapons, but fanatical countries should certainly not have

01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:53.980
nuclear weapons ever. But how do you make that work? Once the tech exists, the humans will

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.620
replicate it. It may take a little while, but they'll do it.

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:08.060
So, yes, very, a very strange array of features. One can also imagine human children that would

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:15.180
become obsessed without competing these systems, right? The kid who could beat any LLM at Go,

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:22.220
right, or any game system at Go, because he's somehow above the system even though it's hyper

01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:31.660
processing. And by the way, I don't yet. I would not validate the idea that what machines do is

01:38:31.660 --> 01:38:36.700
play games. What they do is, you know, database manipulation or something. They're not playing

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:43.340
games. Big Blue never beat Gary Kasparov at chess because it's incapable of playing chess.

01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:49.580
What it's doing is not playing chess. It's a different thing. We should call it a different thing.

01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:58.220
So, the effect on the humans is going to be monumental no matter what. As usual, you will see

01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:06.220
vast populations deprived of humanity, agency, opportunity, liberation, and so forth. And you'll

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:16.300
see other clades, both those associated with the technology, those who own or directly benefit

01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:22.940
from the technology, those will become gods. Those companies will become gods if the humans

01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:31.260
don't rip the planet apart right quick. Because of the information that they will have about groups

01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:39.020
and individuals will be profound beyond anything imaginable. The analytics you can get from people

01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:44.140
using the internet is one thing. The analytics you can get from watching them ask another mind a question

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:53.100
or request something. The analytics you can get from that and the capacity to directly manipulate

01:39:53.100 --> 01:40:02.860
the cognition of the users via the responses from the AI is unimaginable. These systems will become

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:12.300
godlike in our direct human experience right quick. And we have no way to prepare for that.

01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:19.180
You're not even going to be able to opt out. It's not possible to opt out if you're living

01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:27.020
with other humans. It's the same problem with media consumption and other ideologies, particularly

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:34.300
political ideologies. The water is thick with them. You can't take a breath without running

01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:43.100
into five people who say blah, blah, blah at you or ask you who's right, the Israelis or the

01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:50.940
Palestinians? Which side are you on? You're asking me whether I'm on the side of the sun or the moon

01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:56.940
or something. I don't even understand the fucking. It's ridiculous that I'd be on a side. I'm on

01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:05.260
the side of stop killing people. Sit down, take it seriously, work out your differences, stop

01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:16.540
killing each other. That's my side. If I have one and it would change depending on who I'm talking

01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:23.420
to. I don't just have a side. It's not like I sit around here having an opinion. It transforms

01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:34.140
based on all kinds of different things, features of the situation at hand, who I'm with. If I'm

01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:38.620
not there to be right, I'm there to see better, so I'm likely to change my perspective. Someone

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:45.500
asked me a question about the views of a friend of mine and I said something like,

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:49.900
I'm sure his views have evolved dramatically since the last time I spoke to him and I wish mine would

01:41:49.980 --> 01:42:06.700
too. Many humans will probably feel unmotivated to participate in the light of systems that can

01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:15.340
outperform them catastrophically at almost anything. Certainly at nearly anything creative.

01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:23.500
Not everyone, but the motivation of humans will flag catastrophically

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:28.140
in the face of this kind of technology. What you'll get is kind of the same thing that the

01:42:28.140 --> 01:42:35.180
internet produced, which is little bubbles of incredible human sophistication. Look on YouTube

01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:45.340
for young guitar players or young piano players or young violinists and look at the broad range of

01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:50.060
solo violin players or something you could find there and sort of sample through that and you'll

01:42:50.060 --> 01:43:00.700
see there's just a really diverse and rather large cohort of extreme performance skill

01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:09.740
and peculiarly developed in every branch from putting things together made out of wood to playing

01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:22.860
the piano to singing an acapella song, all these things, dancing, jumping, running, fighting,

01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:27.660
everything, everything, everything, everything, everywhere all at once as they said, sort of.

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:35.260
So, you know, even though the majority of the humans you see probably seem relatively uninteresting,

01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:43.020
there are among the humans these pinnacles of very different localization of skill,

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:51.980
passion, curiosity, wonder, intelligence, even rationality or something resembling computation.

01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:59.820
And that will probably continue, but it will become much more sparse

01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:08.460
and there will be a million or, you know, an endless number of pretenders, right, because

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:18.060
it won't matter who sees you on the internet if AIs can produce you playing your guitar better than

01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:26.060
you do. All of these motivating factors that are crucially important to human

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:31.900
self-development and that get naturally emphasized in healthy communal groups but

01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:37.100
fail dramatically in many, you know, isolated or very small groups

01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:41.420
or individuals, right?

01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:53.660
What will motivate the humans to become, to continue their development in the face of

01:44:55.340 --> 01:45:05.020
a machine that can do most of what you can, almost everything you can or can appear to have done it?

01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:13.020
There's one more little feature, but it's evading

01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:20.300
my intelligence for the moment, so when it comes to me, if it comes, I will

01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:30.540
add it in the recording notes. So much more to learn and see here. This is just a very

01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:40.380
cursory overview of some of the mountaintops that immediately attract my concern and attention.

01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:45.260
Actually dealing with the technology and being human in the face of it is

01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:53.100
a very confusing thing. I found some of my interactions with Bard around image creation

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:57.020
quite intoxicating in the sense of actually intoxicating me.

01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:11.580
I couldn't stop laughing and the implications that I could see in the complex images formed

01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:19.260
by Bard around my prompt, the reflection of both the possibility of beauty and the

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:25.980
object insanity of, you know, producing a derivative sum over the space

01:46:27.900 --> 01:46:35.020
in images. That's visually apparent in the image that this is going on. It's a variety of visual

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:45.020
summing over the space behaviors. And seeing that, undirected by an actual intelligence,

01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.380
I better hope those weren't directed by an actual intelligence,

01:46:49.420 --> 01:46:58.220
was like doing psychedelic drugs or something. Really crazy, amazing and strange,

01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:06.540
parahipnotic, very dangerous. We will continue to learn and grow and see

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:11.820
while we can together and hopefully that will be many generations to come

01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:17.980
for our people and the living beings of earth. But at the moment in this part of the story,

01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:29.980
things look pretty damn fraught from here. Let us continue our lives and creative endeavors

01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:37.660
with and for each other and the spirit of the history and future of life on earth and

01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:45.500
intelligence in the universe, not just here. Perhaps our species is not quite as alone

01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:51.580
as our technologies and languages pose us as being.

01:47:55.260 --> 01:48:01.420
And the use of perhaps in that sentence was unjustified.

01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:08.540
Thank you for joining me. I look forward to learning again together sometime very soon.

01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:13.180
Bye-bye for now.
