00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,160
Dagen H or H-Day was the day on the 3rd of September 1967 in which the traffic in Sweden

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,600
switched from driving on the left hand side of the road to the right. Dagen means day

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,200
and the H stands for Hurger traffic, the Swedish word for right traffic. It was by far the

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,120
largest logistical event in Sweden's history. The first attempt to order traffic to the right

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:39,880
was in 1718 but by 1734 ordinances had stipulated Sweden should drive on the left. This of course

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,080
didn't matter too much until motor traffic became common and with Sweden's neighbours Norway and

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,560
Finland driving on the right border crossings were a very awkward dance. Sweden was starting to think

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,680
more globally and driving on the right would put it in line with many other members of the new

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,120
common market. The Swedish government had been making noises to change over to the right since

10
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:09,480
1927 and that had encouraged car manufacturers such as Saab and Volvo to design their cars for right

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,760
hand drive roads but this led to many head-on collisions when passing on narrow two-lane

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:23,720
highways. Despite this the change was unpopular. In a 1955 referendum 83% voted to keep driving on

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,400
the left. In a move that wouldn't be the first or the last to ignore popular opinion after it had

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,240
given them the answer they didn't want in 1963 the Swedish parliament approved the prime minister's

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,960
proposal of right hand drive traffic beginning in 1967 as the number of cars on the road tripled

16
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:47,960
from 500,000 to one and a half million and the problem was only expected to get worse with more

17
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,960
people driving. A commission was established to oversee the change and began to implement a four

18
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,160
year education program. The campaign included displaying the DAG and H logo on various commemorative

19
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,320
items including milk cartons and underwear. Swedish television held a contest for songs

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,120
promoting the change and the winning entry that became a popular hit was a song called

21
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,880
Keep to the Right Svensson. Surprisingly there was actually a bit of road in Sweden

22
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,120
where people already drove on the right. The road between KvÃ¤lje and Tundtje in Norway

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,200
had been drawn incorrectly and a bit of it went over the border into Sweden. Although this was

24
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,960
now a Swedish road to avoid having to swap the sides of the road twice for this short section

25
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,920
of road it was agreed to keep drivers on the right hand side. As DAG and H neared every intersection

26
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,800
was equipped with an extra set of poles and traffic signals wrapped in black plastic.

27
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,880
Workers roamed the streets early in the morning removing the plastic. Existing road lines were

28
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,000
yellow so before the change over white lines were painted then covered with black tape.

29
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:07,000
Approximately 350,000 signs had to be removed or replaced, 20,000 of them in Stockholm alone.

30
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,240
Some signs were mirrored such as the roadwork sign and the sign warning of moose crossings

31
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,640
as it was felt that the moose were more likely to come from the right hand side of the road.

32
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,360
Black hexagonal signs with a letter H were placed on roads to remind drivers to drive on the right

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,320
and while they were altering signs the government took the opportunity to impose

34
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,000
speed restrictions on certain roads. One way streets presented unique problems,

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,400
bus stops had to be constructed on the other side of the street and intersections had to

36
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,640
be reshaped to allow traffic to merge. It's still possible to spot motorway sections built before

37
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:52,440
the change over as the on ramps are shorter than usual and off ramps longer. New cars from 1966

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,760
had headlights that were designed for driving on the right but special stickers were applied

39
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,680
with strict instructions that they shouldn't be removed until the switch over. On the day itself

40
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,920
all non-essential traffic was banned from the roads from 1am to 6am. Any vehicles on the roads

41
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:16,360
during that time had to follow special rules. All vehicles had to come to a complete stop at 450am

42
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:22,040
then carefully change to the right hand side of the road and stop again to give others time

43
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,120
to switch sides of the road and avoid a head on collision before being allowed to proceed at 5am.

44
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,200
In the large cities of Stockholm and Malmo the ban was longer from 10am on saturday

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,960
until 3pm on sunday to allow work crews to reconfigure intersections and other towns

46
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,200
also saw extended bans. Despite the transition being in the middle of the night it was covered with

47
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:54,280
probably not that scintillating live tv coverage. Over 10 000 police and military personnel monitored

48
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,880
the process along with over 100 000 people helping out at pedestrian crossings. The relatively smooth

49
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,160
change over saw a temporary reduction in the number of accidents. Experts suggested that

50
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,920
changing to driving on the right reduced accidents while overtaking as people already drove left

51
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,080
hand drive vehicles thereby having a better view of the road ahead. People were also lightly more

52
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,480
cautious and alert driving on the other side of the road which reduced accidents. Fatal car to car

53
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,840
and car to pedestrian accidents dropped sharply as a result. The number of motor insurance claims

54
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,760
went down by 40%. Of course these initial improvements didn't last. The number of motor

55
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,760
insurance claims returned to normal over the next six weeks and by 1969 the accident rates were back

56
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,840
to the level seen before the change although more cars were on the road by then. Trams in many

57
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,280
cities were withdrawn and replaced with buses. In the run up to the change local authorities had

58
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,720
been buying buses designed to be driven on the right but some seven and a half thousand existing

59
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,480
buses were converted putting doors on the other side starting 18 months before the switch over.

60
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,400
The cities of Gothenburg and Malmo sent their existing buses to Pakistan and Kenya

61
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,760
who drove on the left. The modification of buses was the largest cost of the change.

62
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,600
Although all Swedish road traffic switched to drive on the right metro and railways didn't

63
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,600
change and continued to drive on the left. Fellow Nordic country Iceland changed to driving on the

64
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:36,440
right the following year on a day known as H-Daguin. A big thank you to all my patrons for supporting
