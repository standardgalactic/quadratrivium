0	14160	Dagen H or H-Day was the day on the 3rd of September 1967 in which the traffic in Sweden
14160	19600	switched from driving on the left hand side of the road to the right. Dagen means day
19600	26200	and the H stands for Hurger traffic, the Swedish word for right traffic. It was by far the
26200	32120	largest logistical event in Sweden's history. The first attempt to order traffic to the right
32120	39880	was in 1718 but by 1734 ordinances had stipulated Sweden should drive on the left. This of course
39880	45080	didn't matter too much until motor traffic became common and with Sweden's neighbours Norway and
45080	51560	Finland driving on the right border crossings were a very awkward dance. Sweden was starting to think
51560	56680	more globally and driving on the right would put it in line with many other members of the new
56680	62120	common market. The Swedish government had been making noises to change over to the right since
62120	69480	1927 and that had encouraged car manufacturers such as Saab and Volvo to design their cars for right
69480	74760	hand drive roads but this led to many head-on collisions when passing on narrow two-lane
74760	83720	highways. Despite this the change was unpopular. In a 1955 referendum 83% voted to keep driving on
83720	89400	the left. In a move that wouldn't be the first or the last to ignore popular opinion after it had
89400	95240	given them the answer they didn't want in 1963 the Swedish parliament approved the prime minister's
95240	101960	proposal of right hand drive traffic beginning in 1967 as the number of cars on the road tripled
101960	107960	from 500,000 to one and a half million and the problem was only expected to get worse with more
107960	113960	people driving. A commission was established to oversee the change and began to implement a four
113960	121160	year education program. The campaign included displaying the DAG and H logo on various commemorative
121160	127320	items including milk cartons and underwear. Swedish television held a contest for songs
127320	132120	promoting the change and the winning entry that became a popular hit was a song called
132120	137880	Keep to the Right Svensson. Surprisingly there was actually a bit of road in Sweden
137880	144120	where people already drove on the right. The road between Kv√§lje and Tundtje in Norway
144120	150200	had been drawn incorrectly and a bit of it went over the border into Sweden. Although this was
150200	155960	now a Swedish road to avoid having to swap the sides of the road twice for this short section
155960	162920	of road it was agreed to keep drivers on the right hand side. As DAG and H neared every intersection
162920	167800	was equipped with an extra set of poles and traffic signals wrapped in black plastic.
168440	173880	Workers roamed the streets early in the morning removing the plastic. Existing road lines were
173880	179000	yellow so before the change over white lines were painted then covered with black tape.
179720	187000	Approximately 350,000 signs had to be removed or replaced, 20,000 of them in Stockholm alone.
187640	193240	Some signs were mirrored such as the roadwork sign and the sign warning of moose crossings
193240	197640	as it was felt that the moose were more likely to come from the right hand side of the road.
198520	204360	Black hexagonal signs with a letter H were placed on roads to remind drivers to drive on the right
205000	209320	and while they were altering signs the government took the opportunity to impose
209320	215000	speed restrictions on certain roads. One way streets presented unique problems,
215000	219400	bus stops had to be constructed on the other side of the street and intersections had to
219400	225640	be reshaped to allow traffic to merge. It's still possible to spot motorway sections built before
225640	232440	the change over as the on ramps are shorter than usual and off ramps longer. New cars from 1966
232440	236760	had headlights that were designed for driving on the right but special stickers were applied
236760	242680	with strict instructions that they shouldn't be removed until the switch over. On the day itself
242680	248920	all non-essential traffic was banned from the roads from 1am to 6am. Any vehicles on the roads
248920	256360	during that time had to follow special rules. All vehicles had to come to a complete stop at 450am
256360	262040	then carefully change to the right hand side of the road and stop again to give others time
262040	268120	to switch sides of the road and avoid a head on collision before being allowed to proceed at 5am.
268760	274200	In the large cities of Stockholm and Malmo the ban was longer from 10am on saturday
274200	279960	until 3pm on sunday to allow work crews to reconfigure intersections and other towns
279960	286200	also saw extended bans. Despite the transition being in the middle of the night it was covered with
286280	294280	probably not that scintillating live tv coverage. Over 10 000 police and military personnel monitored
294280	301880	the process along with over 100 000 people helping out at pedestrian crossings. The relatively smooth
301880	307160	change over saw a temporary reduction in the number of accidents. Experts suggested that
307160	312920	changing to driving on the right reduced accidents while overtaking as people already drove left
312920	319080	hand drive vehicles thereby having a better view of the road ahead. People were also lightly more
319080	325480	cautious and alert driving on the other side of the road which reduced accidents. Fatal car to car
325480	330840	and car to pedestrian accidents dropped sharply as a result. The number of motor insurance claims
330840	336760	went down by 40%. Of course these initial improvements didn't last. The number of motor
336760	342760	insurance claims returned to normal over the next six weeks and by 1969 the accident rates were back
342760	348840	to the level seen before the change although more cars were on the road by then. Trams in many
348840	354280	cities were withdrawn and replaced with buses. In the run up to the change local authorities had
354280	359720	been buying buses designed to be driven on the right but some seven and a half thousand existing
359720	365480	buses were converted putting doors on the other side starting 18 months before the switch over.
366200	371400	The cities of Gothenburg and Malmo sent their existing buses to Pakistan and Kenya
371400	376760	who drove on the left. The modification of buses was the largest cost of the change.
377640	382600	Although all Swedish road traffic switched to drive on the right metro and railways didn't
382600	388600	change and continued to drive on the left. Fellow Nordic country Iceland changed to driving on the
388600	396440	right the following year on a day known as H-Daguin. A big thank you to all my patrons for supporting
