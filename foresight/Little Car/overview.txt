Checking Little Car/When Sweden Switched To Driving On The Right.txt
 Dagen H, or H-Day, was the day on September 3, 1967, when Sweden transitioned from driving on the left side of the road to driving on the right. This significant change was part of an effort to align with international trends and to improve traffic flow at border crossings with neighboring countries that already drove on the right. The idea of switching had been around since 1927, but it wasn't until the number of cars on the road tripled and a referendum in 1955 showed that 83% of Swedes preferred to continue driving on the left, that the government moved forward with the change.

To facilitate the transition, a four-year educational campaign was launched, including publicity stunts like placing the Dagen H logo on various commemorative items, such as milk cartons and underwear. A song titled "Keep to the Right, Svensson" was even composed for the occasion. Special attention was given to road signs, traffic lights, and street markings, with approximately 350,000 signs being removed or replaced, and existing yellow lines being covered with black tape before the switch.

On the day of the transition, all non-essential traffic was banned from the roads from 1 am to 6 am to allow for a smooth changeover. Vehicles on the road during this time had to stop twice to avoid head-on collisions. In larger cities like Stockholm and Malm√∂, the ban extended into the daytime to give work crews time to reconfigure intersections. Despite the transition being conducted in the middle of the night, it was covered live on television.

The change resulted in a temporary reduction in accidents, as drivers were more cautious and had better visibility when driving on the right side. The number of motor insurance claims dropped by 40% initially, but by 1969, accident rates returned to their pre-change levels, with more cars on the road. Trams were replaced with buses in some cities, while others sent their existing buses abroad, and all other forms of public transport, including metros and trains, continued to drive on the left.

The costliest part of the transition was converting the seven and a half thousand existing buses, which involved placing doors on the opposite side. The change also saw Sweden's neighboring Nordic country, Iceland, adopt the right-hand traffic system the following year.
