00:00.000 --> 00:14.160
Dagen H or H-Day was the day on the 3rd of September 1967 in which the traffic in Sweden

00:14.160 --> 00:19.600
switched from driving on the left hand side of the road to the right. Dagen means day

00:19.600 --> 00:26.200
and the H stands for Hurger traffic, the Swedish word for right traffic. It was by far the

00:26.200 --> 00:32.120
largest logistical event in Sweden's history. The first attempt to order traffic to the right

00:32.120 --> 00:39.880
was in 1718 but by 1734 ordinances had stipulated Sweden should drive on the left. This of course

00:39.880 --> 00:45.080
didn't matter too much until motor traffic became common and with Sweden's neighbours Norway and

00:45.080 --> 00:51.560
Finland driving on the right border crossings were a very awkward dance. Sweden was starting to think

00:51.560 --> 00:56.680
more globally and driving on the right would put it in line with many other members of the new

00:56.680 --> 01:02.120
common market. The Swedish government had been making noises to change over to the right since

01:02.120 --> 01:09.480
1927 and that had encouraged car manufacturers such as Saab and Volvo to design their cars for right

01:09.480 --> 01:14.760
hand drive roads but this led to many head-on collisions when passing on narrow two-lane

01:14.760 --> 01:23.720
highways. Despite this the change was unpopular. In a 1955 referendum 83% voted to keep driving on

01:23.720 --> 01:29.400
the left. In a move that wouldn't be the first or the last to ignore popular opinion after it had

01:29.400 --> 01:35.240
given them the answer they didn't want in 1963 the Swedish parliament approved the prime minister's

01:35.240 --> 01:41.960
proposal of right hand drive traffic beginning in 1967 as the number of cars on the road tripled

01:41.960 --> 01:47.960
from 500,000 to one and a half million and the problem was only expected to get worse with more

01:47.960 --> 01:53.960
people driving. A commission was established to oversee the change and began to implement a four

01:53.960 --> 02:01.160
year education program. The campaign included displaying the DAG and H logo on various commemorative

02:01.160 --> 02:07.320
items including milk cartons and underwear. Swedish television held a contest for songs

02:07.320 --> 02:12.120
promoting the change and the winning entry that became a popular hit was a song called

02:12.120 --> 02:17.880
Keep to the Right Svensson. Surprisingly there was actually a bit of road in Sweden

02:17.880 --> 02:24.120
where people already drove on the right. The road between KvÃ¤lje and Tundtje in Norway

02:24.120 --> 02:30.200
had been drawn incorrectly and a bit of it went over the border into Sweden. Although this was

02:30.200 --> 02:35.960
now a Swedish road to avoid having to swap the sides of the road twice for this short section

02:35.960 --> 02:42.920
of road it was agreed to keep drivers on the right hand side. As DAG and H neared every intersection

02:42.920 --> 02:47.800
was equipped with an extra set of poles and traffic signals wrapped in black plastic.

02:48.440 --> 02:53.880
Workers roamed the streets early in the morning removing the plastic. Existing road lines were

02:53.880 --> 02:59.000
yellow so before the change over white lines were painted then covered with black tape.

02:59.720 --> 03:07.000
Approximately 350,000 signs had to be removed or replaced, 20,000 of them in Stockholm alone.

03:07.640 --> 03:13.240
Some signs were mirrored such as the roadwork sign and the sign warning of moose crossings

03:13.240 --> 03:17.640
as it was felt that the moose were more likely to come from the right hand side of the road.

03:18.520 --> 03:24.360
Black hexagonal signs with a letter H were placed on roads to remind drivers to drive on the right

03:25.000 --> 03:29.320
and while they were altering signs the government took the opportunity to impose

03:29.320 --> 03:35.000
speed restrictions on certain roads. One way streets presented unique problems,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.400
bus stops had to be constructed on the other side of the street and intersections had to

03:39.400 --> 03:45.640
be reshaped to allow traffic to merge. It's still possible to spot motorway sections built before

03:45.640 --> 03:52.440
the change over as the on ramps are shorter than usual and off ramps longer. New cars from 1966

03:52.440 --> 03:56.760
had headlights that were designed for driving on the right but special stickers were applied

03:56.760 --> 04:02.680
with strict instructions that they shouldn't be removed until the switch over. On the day itself

04:02.680 --> 04:08.920
all non-essential traffic was banned from the roads from 1am to 6am. Any vehicles on the roads

04:08.920 --> 04:16.360
during that time had to follow special rules. All vehicles had to come to a complete stop at 450am

04:16.360 --> 04:22.040
then carefully change to the right hand side of the road and stop again to give others time

04:22.040 --> 04:28.120
to switch sides of the road and avoid a head on collision before being allowed to proceed at 5am.

04:28.760 --> 04:34.200
In the large cities of Stockholm and Malmo the ban was longer from 10am on saturday

04:34.200 --> 04:39.960
until 3pm on sunday to allow work crews to reconfigure intersections and other towns

04:39.960 --> 04:46.200
also saw extended bans. Despite the transition being in the middle of the night it was covered with

04:46.280 --> 04:54.280
probably not that scintillating live tv coverage. Over 10 000 police and military personnel monitored

04:54.280 --> 05:01.880
the process along with over 100 000 people helping out at pedestrian crossings. The relatively smooth

05:01.880 --> 05:07.160
change over saw a temporary reduction in the number of accidents. Experts suggested that

05:07.160 --> 05:12.920
changing to driving on the right reduced accidents while overtaking as people already drove left

05:12.920 --> 05:19.080
hand drive vehicles thereby having a better view of the road ahead. People were also lightly more

05:19.080 --> 05:25.480
cautious and alert driving on the other side of the road which reduced accidents. Fatal car to car

05:25.480 --> 05:30.840
and car to pedestrian accidents dropped sharply as a result. The number of motor insurance claims

05:30.840 --> 05:36.760
went down by 40%. Of course these initial improvements didn't last. The number of motor

05:36.760 --> 05:42.760
insurance claims returned to normal over the next six weeks and by 1969 the accident rates were back

05:42.760 --> 05:48.840
to the level seen before the change although more cars were on the road by then. Trams in many

05:48.840 --> 05:54.280
cities were withdrawn and replaced with buses. In the run up to the change local authorities had

05:54.280 --> 05:59.720
been buying buses designed to be driven on the right but some seven and a half thousand existing

05:59.720 --> 06:05.480
buses were converted putting doors on the other side starting 18 months before the switch over.

06:06.200 --> 06:11.400
The cities of Gothenburg and Malmo sent their existing buses to Pakistan and Kenya

06:11.400 --> 06:16.760
who drove on the left. The modification of buses was the largest cost of the change.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.600
Although all Swedish road traffic switched to drive on the right metro and railways didn't

06:22.600 --> 06:28.600
change and continued to drive on the left. Fellow Nordic country Iceland changed to driving on the

06:28.600 --> 06:36.440
right the following year on a day known as H-Daguin. A big thank you to all my patrons for supporting
