0	6600	Hi everyone, welcome to the Power Hungry podcast.
6600	8480	I'm Robert Brice on this podcast.
8480	11880	We talk about energy, power, innovation, and politics, and I'm pleased to welcome back
11880	13520	for the third time.
13520	16880	That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the third time, Dr. Judith Curry.
16880	22320	She is the author of a new book called Climate Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking Our Response.
22320	24760	Judy, welcome back to the Power Hungry podcast.
24760	26120	Well, thank you.
26120	28600	I'm delighted to join you again.
28600	33480	So your book has been out now a couple of months, and it's called, as I said, Climate
33480	37720	Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking Our Response.
37720	41480	You've been on the podcast before, but guests on this podcast, I think you remember, introduced
41480	42480	themselves.
42480	46200	So you've been on here once, but imagine you've got 30, 60 seconds, you've walked into a room,
46200	47200	you don't know anyone.
47200	48200	Introduce yourself, please.
48200	49200	Okay.
49200	50200	I'm Judith Curry.
50200	56160	I spent most of my career in academia, most recently at the Georgia Institute of Technology,
56160	61120	where I was chair of school of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences for 13 years.
61120	65560	I'm currently president of Climate Forecast Applications Network.
65560	73240	I'm proprietor of the blog Climate Etc. at JudithCurry.com and author of a new book,
73240	75840	Climate Uncertainty and Risk.
75840	76840	Very succinct.
76840	79280	Well done, Attagirl.
79280	83360	And you're also on Twitter, so we get this out of the way, at CurryJA.
83360	84360	At CurryJA.
84560	85560	Okay.
85560	91200	Well, I'm going to just tell me, you know, I've been reading your book, give me your
91200	92200	pitch.
92200	93200	What is this new book about?
93200	97720	We've talked before on the podcast, we've talked about climate science, media, et cetera.
97720	102440	What is this book and what do you hope to achieve with it?
102440	108320	Well the whole climate science issue and the policy response has been squeezed into this
108320	113960	little tiny box, you know, with everybody bouncing around inside the box dotting eyes
113960	118480	and crossing T's and threatening anybody who tries to go outside the box.
118480	121240	Well, I blow the lid off the box.
121240	127280	I look at all the other stuff that people, the inconvenient things that people are trying
127280	128840	to shove under the rug.
128840	130240	I look at the uncertainties.
130240	131640	I look at the controversies.
131640	137600	I look at why we disagree, both in the science and the policy response.
137600	145000	I talk about, you know, how politics of this has really torqued this in a very unfortunate
145000	146000	way.
146000	154440	I talk, the middle part of the book, I look at, speculate about what we can expect in
154440	157280	the 21st century in terms of climate.
157280	163680	I mean, the climate models are deeply flawed in terms of giving us a reliable perspective
163680	164680	on this.
164680	170200	I speculate, you know, on a whole range of possible outcomes, including plausible worst
170200	171880	cases.
171880	177360	And the third part of the book is the most important one really, it's risk and response.
177360	185400	And this is where I talk about how we've fundamentally mischaracterized climate risk and how we've
185400	188960	fundamentally mismanaged our response.
188960	196960	And I use principles from a variety of risk science disciplines to put together a menu
196960	202760	of some other approaches that we can take that make more sense when you're dealing with
202760	211720	a very complex, deeply uncertain problem with conflicts of values and political disagreements
211720	213440	in play.
213440	223320	So, you know, it's a very different approach, and it's a very integrated approach to this
223320	229560	very wicked problem that I think can lead us on a path to doing sensible things and
229560	237640	setting our path towards a prosperous and safe 21st century.
237640	238640	That's a good summary.
238640	240140	Thank you.
240540	244700	Looking at the book, though, and as I've been going through it, and I don't mean this
244700	247020	as a slam, but we talked about it right before we started recording.
247020	251820	You said this was written or published by an academic press, Anthem Press, and it's heavily
251820	252820	footnoted.
252820	254820	And I got to say, I love me some footnotes, right?
254820	257140	I have footnote all my books.
257140	259580	It's a laborious process.
259580	262500	So well, this is a kind of a geeky question.
262500	267340	I could tally them all up here, but about how many footnotes are in this book?
267340	268340	Roughly.
268340	269340	About 1500.
269540	273500	1500 in 239 pages.
273500	280060	So you have your references here, which I think you made clear.
280060	282100	You wanted to publish this book before we started.
282100	286540	You said you wanted it published by an academic press, that it was peer reviewed, and everything
286540	291060	here you've stated is all fully cited.
291060	295780	But still, I mean, the fundamental issue that, and we've talked about this before, is that
295820	301860	we're seeing this lack of robust debate, or even any debate, really, and that most recently
301860	308700	John Clouser, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in just in June and August, had a speech,
308700	313180	a presentation to the International Monetary Fund that he was canceled because he's not
313180	317540	towing the line on the catastrophist orthodoxy.
317540	323660	If I can use that phrase, I mean, it seems rather than getting better, rather than the
323660	329300	debate getting slightly more open, it's getting even yet more constrained, or is that fair?
329300	330300	How have things changed?
330300	331300	Oh, that's correct.
331300	335420	I mean, we'll go back to the little box again.
335420	341580	And the reason it's all been shoved into a box, everybody has to agree, because the
341580	348180	oversimplified analysis that our brilliant policymakers have made is that we need global
348260	351700	collective action on this problem.
351700	354300	And in order to get there, everybody has to agree.
355540	363140	So, you know, so there's huge motivation with that framing of the problem to nuke anybody
363140	364140	who disagrees.
366260	369060	I just want to make sure you said oversimplified analysis.
369060	370580	Is that is that what you the phrase?
371380	375020	Right. So we have to nuke anyone who disagrees.
375420	382060	But that I think that seems to be the right right description as well, that there we will
382060	383700	not brook dissent, right?
383700	388140	But is that so you've talked about this in academic terms, because that's where you
388140	388940	come from this.
388940	393500	And I come at it from as a more, I would say just a more general reporter approach.
394380	397740	But if I were to say, well, what's driving this, I would say it's money, right?
397740	403100	That there is a lot of money at stake here for various subsidies under the Inflation
403100	406700	Reduction Act. This is one of the big drivers, of course, of the renewable energy rollout,
406700	410460	right? There are massive subsidies for wind and solar at hand.
410460	413660	So there must not be any controversy about this.
413660	419660	Otherwise, the sub that you stop the flow of the money is that an oversimplified analysis?
419660	421500	It's an oversimplified analysis.
421500	426940	I think we have to go back to the 1980s and the UN environmental program.
427420	433340	There was a big drive for non-governmental world control through health, environment,
433340	437900	and all these issues, and they keyed on climate change is the issue to get us there.
438620	444860	And we had a climate change treaty in 1992, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
444860	449100	This was before the temperature even started warming in a significant way,
449100	452620	and the US even signed on to that treaty.
452620	459740	So from the very beginning, you've had the policy card way out in front of the scientific horse.
459740	465980	And this is a UN agenda. It's degrowth. It's anti-capitalism. It's anti-democratic.
466620	470700	And in order to enforce this, they amp up the alarm.
471260	476780	I mean, the worst rhetoric, I mean, apart from extinction, rebellion, or something like that,
476780	484940	comes from you and officials, global boiling, code red, all of this kind of stuff over a slow creep
485660	491660	of warming. And the agenda is to kill off the fossil fuel industry. They don't like that.
491660	498380	They don't like nuclear either. So this is a real, it's a clash of values.
498380	504860	And there was a recent survey of university climate scientists, and they asked them a
504940	512780	bunch of questions. And a majority of them were in favor of degrowth, not green growth,
513500	519340	but degrowth. Okay, so you can see the perspectives of these people. I mean, it's not necessarily
519340	524300	about money. There is certainly an element of, you know, follow the money and all this.
524860	529660	But there's a whole worldview and an ideology behind all this.
530220	537420	That's interesting. I guess, so maybe what, I mean, in your reply, I'm not going to argue with it at all.
538460	543100	That is more on the science kind of policy side. I guess what my point about the money and the
543100	547260	subsidies is on the deployment side, right? On the amount of money that's available for the
547260	552380	mitigation side, right? Which was where there's staggering numbers, now hundreds of billions
552380	556540	of dollars, whether it's electric vehicles or solar or wind or hydrogen or carbon capture.
556540	561340	I mean, it's just a staggering amount of money. I think it's the biggest corporate giveaway in
561340	567020	American history, and there's no second place here. But your points are more on the policy side
567020	572540	about this ideology that's driving this alarmism, I guess, to put it, is that a fair way to
572540	578140	characterize it? Yes, yes. Oh, there's definitely money in play. And, you know, Warren Buffett
578140	584220	was very cynical. I mean, he was an early investor in wind power. Sure. He liked wind power, but
584220	588220	he saw it with all these subsidies and whatever, I'm going to make money. He's no dummy.
589340	593100	The only reason to build wind turbines is to collect the tax credits, right? He said that
593100	600140	very clearly, right? That was his famous line. Okay, well, so I live in Texas, and let me tell
600140	605580	you, it feels a little apocalyptic. And let me just tell my climate, what is my view on climate
605580	609740	change? Climate change is a concern. And I think it rhymes with what your book says. Climate change
609740	615260	is a concern. It's not our only concern. So not that I don't favor action on climate change,
615260	619900	is that it's a concern, but we have to balance our action on that against other concerns. And I
619900	625100	think if I were to boil down what I see in your book, you're saying something somewhat similar,
625100	630220	and I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. But it's been stinking hot here in Texas this summer,
630220	635420	Judy. I mean, it's just been, and I'm used to the heat. I lived in Texas, I'm from Oklahoma.
635420	642300	Okay, so here's the question. Is it possible that the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in January 2022
642940	646460	is in part responsible for the weather or this hot weather that we're seeing now?
647500	652940	Okay, first off, Texas is an anomaly. If you look at the average temperatures over the summer so far
652940	657740	for the US, we're slightly below normal. I mean, you look at the set. I have to move then is what
657740	667180	you're saying. The US has been cool. So you know, Texas is just bad luck. I did my latest blog post
667180	675180	that's up, looks at what is causing all this more on a global level. And it looks Hunga Tonga,
675180	681740	and it looks at the ship fuels, and it looks like the long wave and the radiation budget at the top
681740	686220	of the atmosphere, it looks at the surface energy balance, it looks at the internal modes of climate
686300	692700	variability. It's a very comprehensive discussion of what's going on. To get back to Hunga Tonga,
694060	702460	Hunga Tonga usually volcanoes spew particulates into the atmosphere, which in the stratosphere,
702460	709020	and that has a cooling effect. Well, Hunga Tonga spewed only a little bit of sulfate and a substantial
709020	715420	amount of water vapor into the stratosphere. So right now in the summer hemisphere, it looks
715500	722700	like the effects of Hunga Tonga on the radiation balance are canceling out, you know, the long
722700	727260	wave and the short wave are canceling out. But if you go to the winter hemisphere, the southern
727260	733100	hemisphere, we are seeing the effects of Hunga Tonga because the long wave infrared effects are
733100	740700	dominating. And you see it in a, this is part of the circulation pattern that's giving us an early
740700	749740	ozone hole and is giving us the low extent of the Antarctic sea ice this winter. So Hunga Tonga,
750620	755180	and we may see a bigger effect of Hunga Tonga in the northern hemisphere during our winter.
755900	759980	So that, but if you're interested in that, you know, check out my blog, judithcurry.com,
759980	766220	I've got a whole long post on all this. I see. Well, I just found it. It was posted August 14.
766220	771180	I was looking at your other blog post. It's with Jim Johnstone and Mark Jelenek, I guess,
771180	775340	is that that's the one you're talking about? Right. Yeah. Okay. I didn't have time to look at that
775340	781260	one. I was also looking at the post you did on the hell versus Montana lawsuit, which I want to
781260	787820	talk about as well. Okay. So I just want to read back. So you're saying I can't blame the hot weather
787820	795980	in Texas on Hunga Tonga. No, it's unfortunate circulation patterns. Okay. So well, and that's,
796140	802220	but isn't, I guess, me even asking this question, as I say it, am I, this is part of the issue,
802220	806380	right? Well, why can't we blame this on that? Isn't this, of course, to be due to that, that
806380	811820	there's, like everybody else, I'm like, well, tell me the cause, right? Or is this, you know,
811820	815740	and the Bill McKibbins of the world will gladly say, Oh, well, see, there you go.
816380	820860	You know, you guys in Texas, or in fact, Mark Goodell and the pages of the New York Times,
820860	827900	kind of, he said, in fact, in his piece, that this is, oh, this is like, you're getting payback.
827900	833100	Now, this is you're getting Texas is getting paid back for being a bad guy, right? That this is
833100	839260	like, this is the cause. Is this, is this part of the whole problem? Well, okay, here's the issue.
839260	848300	We're talking about a very complex, chaotic nonlinear system. And not only do we have a
848380	854380	chaotic atmosphere, it's coupled to a chaotic ocean. And it's subject to
856380	863100	changes in external forcing. And the mathematicians, you know, call this
863100	868540	pandemonium, it's even beyond chaos. And trying to unravel causes and effects
870620	877500	is, you know, not impossible, but it's not simple. You know, you can't do this by waving your arms.
878060	885740	Like the analysis in my blog, you know, it unravels a lot of things. And it gives you a sense of how
885740	893340	difficult it is to attribute any specific things to any specific forcing. It's very challenging.
894540	900300	Well, okay, so fair enough. And you have 17 figures in this, in this posting here.
901180	908780	But I guess maybe I'm, my, my desire for that simple solution is reflective of this kind of
908780	915740	broader societal design. Well, of course, this means that, and therefore, we have broad terms,
915740	923420	the way I see a lot of the climate apocalyptic analysis, we've sinned, now we're suffering,
923420	927180	and we're going to pay the price. And therefore, we have to repent, right? That this is,
927180	932140	there's a lot of kind of Christian echoes of what, you know, sin and redemption here, right? And
932140	935020	is that part of the narrative as well, that why this narrative is so strong?
935900	941420	This is the policymakers back in the 1990s, wanting a simple cause and effect and a simple fix.
942140	949260	And it was also the hubris that they can control the climate by, you know, eliminating fossil fuels.
949260	960140	So it's looking for a simple solution and just a total lack of humility and thinking that we can
961100	968220	actually control this. So, you know, it's just, you know, human failing. It's not surprising.
968220	973420	That's why we have scientists to sort all this out. But when the scientists become political
973420	979500	activists and become active in trying to cancel anyone who disagrees with them,
980300	985660	then the whole thing falls apart. And we end up with nonsense, like we're currently facing.
986700	993900	And when you say the nonsense, we're currently facing, so, okay, force rank the nonsense for me,
993900	999100	if you would, then if we're looking at policy responses to climate change, and we've heard
999180	1003820	repeatedly from the Biden administration, this is our main concern, right? And, you know,
1003820	1008940	the president, in fact, at a League of Conservation Voters meeting at a high dollar fundraiser,
1008940	1013740	I wrote about this on my substack, bragged about the fact that the Export-Import Bank of the United
1013740	1020620	States was giving a $900 million loan to build a solar project in Angola. Never mind that 60%
1020620	1024060	of the people who live in Angola don't even have electricity and we're building them a coal,
1024060	1028220	a solar plant, not a coal plant, not a gas-fired power plant, even though Angola has
1028220	1033900	all kinds of natural gas. Okay, all this nonsense. So, force rank the nonsense. If you look at this
1033900	1039340	survey of what our responses, our policy responses have been, what's the silliest of the silly?
1040700	1045900	Well, this rapid rush to wind and solar, I mean, that's the silliest of the silly. I mean, you know,
1047260	1053500	I think it makes sense to think, to look forward, you know, into the 21st century and figure out how
1053500	1062460	we can, you know, improve our energy infrastructure so that we have, you know, more abundant, cheaper,
1063580	1068860	cleaner energy and let's look forward and try to get there. I mean, that's just going to help
1068860	1074540	support our progress in the 21st century. That's going to require research and development and
1074540	1081580	learning curves and different localities and countries experimenting and, you know, at the,
1081580	1089340	by the end of the 21st century, if the market was left to, you know, take care of all this,
1089340	1094460	we'd probably have a much better, cleaner energy infrastructure. But now that we're,
1096300	1101420	you know, tearing what we have down and replacing it with wind and solar, which is totally inadequate,
1101420	1107180	I know I'm preaching to the choir here, we're setting ourselves up to make ourselves more
1107180	1114380	vulnerable to whatever weather or climate extremes nature might throw at us. I mean,
1115180	1122220	electricity helps keep us safe, you know, with desalination plants and air conditioning and on
1122220	1130540	and on it goes. And it's also electricity is the source of our, you know, innovations across
1130620	1137020	everything. So I mean, what we're doing is extremely stupid and we've got politicians in
1137020	1142300	charge of all this wind and solar stuff and nobody's talking to the engineers, you know,
1142300	1147580	people who, who design transmission lines, the grid operators, you know, they're all sort of
1147580	1153420	tearing their hair out over all this wind and solar. So what we're doing is just plain stupid.
1153420	1158780	And if we continue on this path, we're going to end up in a worse place at the end of the 21st
1158780	1166460	century than if we had just let market forces and our desire for innovation just to take charge
1166460	1173660	and move forward. So it's just a very bad place to be. Well, you are preaching to the choir,
1173660	1181100	but amen, sister, keep going. Hallelujah. Past the collection plate. I'd boil that down,
1181660	1187740	how I distill this is if, if, if we're facing more extreme weather, it's the height of foolishness
1187740	1191660	or the depth of foolishness to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather.
1191660	1198220	I mean, we need weather, we need weather resilient systems, not weather dependent systems. And yet
1198220	1203340	that is in fact what we're doing. And just in the last few days here in Texas has been insanely hot
1203340	1208060	and the wind is going and the wind doesn't blow when it's really hot. And so there's been a, you
1208060	1212700	know, wind energy, we have a huge fleet of wind energy turbines. And yet they're only producing
1212780	1218700	at single digit percentage outputs during times of peak demand. So anyway, I just had to had to
1218700	1224300	throw that in there. Okay, so let's talk about censorship because you also know a little bit
1224300	1230380	about this. We talked, I think the last time you were on the podcast, which was in December of 2022,
1231260	1237260	that in on Twitter, you, you were very pleased that Elon Musk had Elon Musk took over Twitter
1237260	1241420	because suddenly you got more traction there, you weren't being throttled, your content wasn't
1241420	1245260	being throttled. Is that still the case now? Do you, have you gotten more followers on Twitter?
1245260	1249900	Tell me about how you see what's going on just on that platform. And then we'll talk about other
1249900	1258060	things. Okay, just from my perspective, Twitter's going along great. I know a lot of people don't
1258060	1266060	like it. Well, they don't like, you know, the climate scientists don't want to have the rabble
1267020	1272460	questioning them. And they don't like that. And a lot of them are leaving Twitter. Also,
1275180	1281420	Elon has made a couple of changes to the functionality treat decks. Okay. And a lot of
1281420	1288780	people are very unhappy with that. So some people are leaving, but this the overall,
1289020	1296460	you know, from where I sit, I think it's so much improved. And, you know, the quality of my
1296460	1301500	interactions and the number of my followers has increased very substantially. So I'm happy.
1302060	1306460	And I have to say that's the only social media platform that I'm happy with.
1307740	1312300	Well, then let's talk about the others then you were on John Stossel's show. And it was,
1313660	1317900	was it censored on Facebook? Tell me what this has been several days ago or a couple of weeks
1317900	1329900	ago, but it was labeled as false information. And this was me talking about my experiences and
1329900	1336220	my perspective. So I don't know how you label this as false information. So, and that was,
1336220	1341020	you know, they still left the link where you could click there. But there was this big warning
1341020	1348620	that this was false information because everybody knows that the consensus exists 97% of climate
1348620	1359180	scientists agree or whatever. No, there's no debate. I was on a podcast earlier this year
1359180	1367900	with the Heartland Institute. Right. And this was, it was live. And they, as soon as it started,
1368140	1376140	they took it down. Facebook did Facebook and they were sensitized to me because like about
1377020	1383740	two weeks earlier, I, there was a something posted on YouTube. It was an interview by
1383740	1395580	business news in South Africa. And it went sort of viral. I mean, it got like 500,000 views
1395580	1401500	in a couple of days. And then YouTube took it down. You couldn't even search for it. Okay,
1401500	1406460	you couldn't search for it at all. There was no message, no nothing, you couldn't search for it.
1406460	1412940	So that must have raised some sort of flag to Facebook. So as soon as they saw me being a guest
1412940	1419500	on the Heartland podcast, they just canceled that live feed. And they, you know, so I'm being
1419500	1430140	really canceled, you know, by the Mark Zuckerberg type social media. So, you know, and what I say,
1430140	1436940	if you actually listen to what I say, it's pretty innocuous. I mean, it's not cheerleading, you know,
1436940	1444860	for the team, but you know, I'm just raising some critical questions. And that's very uncomfortable.
1444860	1451180	I mean, I'm well outside that little box. And that makes people uncomfortable. And they view me
1451180	1457900	as a threat. I mean, all those footnotes in my book, you know, it's like evidence sort of supporting
1457900	1466300	my points. And you know, they view this as sort of dangerous. Well, in the way you speak, in what
1466300	1471340	you're talking about it, and yes, as I've done, you know, a couple hundred podcasts, and I'm a dad,
1471340	1476140	and you know, been married a long time. I listen to how people listen to how they say what they're
1476140	1480460	talking about, right? The words matter, of course, but it's, but there was the tone in your voice
1480460	1488140	about what I describe it, disappointment, anger, frustration. Here's the, you know, the TV journalist
1488140	1492940	favorite, how do you feel? How do I say that? I'm just kind of joking about it. But I can sense
1492940	1497980	of you a kind of an outrage or just a disappointment. How does it make you feel?
1497980	1507180	Well, you know, I'm a scientist, you know, and reason, dialogue, evidence, debate, and especially
1507180	1512860	in universities, you know, debate and disagreement is the spice of academic life. And all that's
1512860	1519660	been canceled. You know, it's the universities which discuss me even more than social media. I mean,
1519660	1524460	social media is social media, but it's what's going on at the universities to me is the absolute worst.
1525420	1531020	I'm seeing a few of the universities turn around, but the overall tenor at universities is just
1531900	1537660	terrible. And, you know, you saw this whole dynamics play out with the COVID situation. It's
1537660	1545820	just endemic to our society right now. And it's very dangerous and free speech issue, political
1545820	1551420	freedom, you know, there's a lot of issues here. And unfortunately, a lot of this gets tied up in
1551420	1557020	what's going on with Donald Trump. And, you know, then it just becomes a big political mess.
1558060	1565340	But these are very serious issues. And I mean, how I mean, God bless Elon Musk for trying to open up
1565340	1572540	Twitter. He has his own quirks and whatever. But overall, this is like the one place where people
1572540	1578460	from across the spectrum still come and, you know, engage and look at, you know, a broad range of
1578460	1585740	material everywhere else, or most other places. It's in a pretty sad state. How are we going to
1585740	1591580	get anywhere if we don't think critically and engage in constructive debate and discussion?
1593260	1596220	You know, what you said about Twitter, I think we talked about this last time,
1596220	1600620	but Alina Chan and Matt Ridley, who wrote a book called Viral on COVID,
1601500	1605740	they said the same things about the importance of Twitter in terms of this opening the debate
1605740	1611580	around origins of COVID. And now, which clearly seems to be, as I think they suspected all along,
1611580	1615980	a lab leak, right? Or the result of some kind of a lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
1616940	1621980	But they were being censored almost everywhere else, except on Twitter. And this is before Musk took
1621980	1630380	over. But that lack of critical debate, the free and open debate, I have to agree with you. And
1630380	1636380	because we're messing with the most important system in our society, which is our energy network,
1636380	1639980	and we're making it, we're weakening it and spending hundreds of billions of dollars in
1639980	1645740	the weakening of it, right? Because of the fashion of, and it is fashion, and the way I would talk
1645740	1651580	about it, I guess, the, I call it climatism and renewable energy fetishism, right? That we have
1651580	1658220	this combined isms, right there that are, have replaced what has, I would call traditional
1658220	1662860	conservation, conservation, the traditional conservation ethic. And that's one of the things
1662860	1668140	that I'm with you exactly on wind and solar. There's this insane headlong rush toward these two
1668140	1673260	sources of intermittent weather dependent renewables. And with no regard for land use birds,
1674140	1679900	landscapes, view sheds, it's this, oh, well, this is the, this is the cure. And therefore,
1679900	1685100	anyone who stands in the way, we're going to run over. And it is almost that bold in terms of,
1685180	1689340	I mean, some of the states are even saying they're going to override local zoning laws to force
1689340	1693180	communities to take wind and solar projects they don't want, which just seems the absolute wrong
1693180	1701340	way to go in terms of democracy and process due, due process and so on. And I know I'm, I'm, I'm
1701340	1707660	rambling here, but does that ring, ring true to you? Oh, for sure. You summarized it perfectly.
1708220	1714780	I mean, this is, this whole thing is dangerous in so many different ways. I mean, not just to our
1714780	1721260	energy infrastructure, but to our freedom and our, the political way that we do things. I mean,
1721260	1728620	it's, it's a, it's a very slippery slope that we're sliding down. You said, I wrote it down,
1728620	1735500	you said the universities disgust me. And I reserve my disgust for a few things, lima beans and cauliflower
1735500	1742300	are two of them, but unpack that just a little bit for me when you say they disgust you. Why is
1742300	1754460	that? Well, because of the, the cancel, the cancel culture, all of the faculty members, you know,
1754460	1761260	very talented people can't get hired because they don't know how to write a good DEI essay, diversity,
1761260	1768140	equity and inclusion. And if you're a chemistry professor or something, what the heck, you know,
1768140	1771980	when you're talking about molecules, how do you bring that into your teaching? I mean, there's a
1771980	1780300	lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. They're allowing students to basically lead the charge to
1780300	1786620	get rid of faculty members that they don't like for some reason. They're interesting and provocative
1786620	1794780	speakers are getting disinvited because some students feel threatened by their words. And they,
1794780	1805820	and they pander to this, and they pander to this, people who are sort of skeptical of climate change
1805820	1816940	or in, in gen, in biology and right, all sorts of other fields. And I thought it was just really
1816940	1822300	climate change and biology, but people tell me it's rampant in law schools and social psychology
1822300	1829580	departments and political science departments that the same disease is rampant anywhere that
1829580	1838700	there is a that's socially relevant. When you're talking about that, it makes me automatically
1838700	1847180	think now of this held versus Montana lawsuit, which as I read the slump when I brought it up,
1847180	1852620	you were an expert witness or retained, I guess, as an expert witness in that case, and ultimately
1852620	1857820	did not testify. But when you're talking about the what's happening on the universities, the line
1857820	1862620	that comes into my head is grievance culture, right, that everyone's agreed. Everyone is a victim
1863180	1869500	somehow some way they've been offended or their future has been, been somehow clouded by this,
1869500	1875580	that or the other. That was in fact the claim, the legal claim that these teenagers made in
1875580	1885100	Montana that the state was injuring them and their potential, their future. And they won the
1885100	1891900	court case under the what seemed to be a fairly narrow ruling based on the Montana Constitution.
1891900	1896940	I know you wrote a blog post about that in June, but now we're here after the held versus Montana
1896940	1901660	litigation that they won and they Montana Attorney General said he's going to appeal.
1902300	1904700	How do you read that decision and how important is it?
1906140	1913180	Well, I don't think it's important. It might stand because the Montana Supreme Court
1913900	1922460	seems to be equally clueless and sympathetic to these environmental claims as the judge. So
1923740	1928380	it may not be overruled. If it stands, it's not going to have a big material
1928380	1935180	impact on what goes on in Montana in terms of changing the statute that they want to change
1935180	1940860	because Montana and principle, I mean, it just adds a lot of paperwork to everything Montana and
1940860	1949980	principle can still approve new power plants. It may, it may end up slowing down wind farms
1949980	1955340	by the same token with all this extra paperwork. I don't know, but it's a symbolic victory for
1955340	1960780	our Children's Trust, which is the advocacy group behind this case and it's given them fresh steam
1961500	1965980	because they've been around for 10 years and this is the first case where they got any kind of
1965980	1971900	attraction. You know, they've been thrown out. Their cases have been thrown out everywhere
1971900	1977340	until now. They're still pending in a few additional states, but this is the first traction that
1977340	1986140	they've gotten. And to me, the most dangerous part of this is that like the state legal systems
1986940	1993740	are ill-prepared, both the judges and the state's attorney's office to deal with an issue like this.
1993740	1998300	I mean, a technical issue like this. These things should not be decided in the courts.
1999020	2004060	Okay, they should be decided, you know, by the legislature, you know, elected
2005020	2010540	legislators and they should have hearings from people across the spectrum and, you know,
2010540	2017660	wide deliberate deliberations and whatever, not by a single judge who's sympathetic to the defendants
2017660	2027100	and doesn't have a clue about climate science. And the Montana state's attorney, I mean, I was
2027100	2034140	brought on the case at the last minute, like the end of last September. And the lawyer that
2036540	2043500	hired me, he then left a few weeks later. There was a private company who then
2043500	2050300	took legal firm that then took over and then the lawyer who was eventually in charge of the case
2050300	2057820	didn't even join it until December. And so he was left, you know, brought in at the last minute.
2057820	2062380	These weren't witnesses of his choosing. He didn't particularly understand the climate
2063020	2070540	change issue at all. He wanted, you know, the case to be about something different about
2072780	2079580	legal nuances. But in spite of my best efforts, I didn't convince him that this was really going
2079660	2088140	to be about climate change and that you needed to deeply challenge their witnesses and, you know,
2088140	2092940	the points. And he just didn't know how to evaluate any of that. And I don't blame him. I'm not
2092940	2099660	surprised. I don't think there'd be very few lawyers in state's attorney's office who are prepared
2099660	2105660	to handle a case like this. Because of the complexities of the science, because of the
2105980	2111580	understanding, understanding where the plaintiffs, you know, where their weaknesses are, why is that?
2111580	2119900	Is the science part of it? Oh, it's both. I mean, and it's, they were claiming psychological
2119900	2127180	injuries. You know, a few of them, oh, well, my roof was injured by a hailstorm and a barn on
2127180	2134140	the neighboring property burned down from a fire and the stream dried up. And I couldn't fish in
2134140	2139900	the stream. And, you know, these were psychological injuries. But a lot of it was pre traumatic
2139900	2145740	stress syndrome, you know, the Greta Thunberg, we have no future, all of this kind of thing. So
2145740	2155020	they're very deeply depressed. So I mean, the kids have been fed this insane rhetoric, the rhetoric
2155020	2161180	targeted at kids and young adults is even worse than what we see, you know, as extinction, rebellion,
2161180	2168860	all that kind of stuff. So, you know, they just don't have the critical faculties at this point
2168860	2176380	to evaluate it. And a lot of them are depressed and upset, whatever. But, you know, we blame that on
2176380	2183100	the education system, on the advocacy groups. I mean, if they were worried about the psychological
2183100	2189020	injuries of the kids, they should have been suing extinction rebellion and Greta Thunberg and the
2189020	2195660	National Education Association, which is sort of feeding them all this stuff. But their real agenda
2195660	2205260	is just to go after the fossil fuel companies. And using kids as a prop. So it's a, you know,
2205260	2212380	it's a case that made no sense. It's a legal decision that made no sense. But like, it's not
2212460	2219820	the first thing that makes no sense and all this. So, you know, that this is really, I'm sure our
2219820	2226620	children's trust the swimming and donations after this little victory, so they can go on and keep suing
2226620	2233900	everybody. I'm looking at there, I'm looking at one of the rundowns here that they've been,
2233900	2240460	one of their funders is the Rockefeller Brothers, which is a, I don't know, there's some oil. Yeah,
2240460	2246940	okay. Well, the air to the Getty fortune is funding extinction rebellion.
2248620	2255100	You know, you've got all of these oil company fortunes now funding all this craziness, go figure.
2255900	2263100	I want to reach back to you said that there is a lot of anti-capitalist rhetoric in this,
2263100	2269900	in these discussions. Talk about that, because I believe I think you're right. And some of these
2270620	2275020	activists have been very clear about that, right, that capitalism is the problem that's driving
2275020	2280060	climate change. And therefore, we need some kind of Maoism or socialism or something that would
2280060	2286140	replace it and have some kind of authoritarian system. I was the only thing I can imagine would
2286140	2291580	be or the thing that would replace it. But talk about why, how do you see that? How do you see
2291580	2297980	this? And why do you say that it's an anti-capitalist movement? Well, okay, well, if you look at
2297980	2303500	the UN environmental program, which is, you know, really behind a lot of this UN stuff,
2303500	2307980	and you read what they write, and it comes through loud and clear, and not just anti-capitalist,
2307980	2314300	but anti-democratic, we can't trust the people or the countries to make the right decisions. So
2314300	2321100	there needs to be, you know, more coercion from the top down at the international level from the
2321100	2328140	UN. So it's a grab for power. So there's a lot of power grabbing in this, and capitalism and
2328780	2334540	democracy is inherently against, you know, centralized power. So,
2336940	2342620	yeah, there are people who've written a lot about this, but the solution is somehow more
2342620	2348460	coercion, more authoritarianism from presumably the smart people over the dumb people, right,
2348460	2351500	that they're going to be the ones that are going to make the decisions for us.
2352060	2355820	Yeah, well, President Biden is talking about declaring a climate emergency,
2356460	2362140	which would take, and it would be a long-term emergency. I mean, emergencies are for, you
2362140	2368540	know, something going on two weeks or a month or a year, but not for something that's, you know,
2368540	2374380	decades. So that would, you know, force people to do this, force people not to do this, that would
2374380	2378940	take away a lot of freedoms if he declares the climate emergency. And, you know, so there's a
2378940	2386060	lot of power grabbing going on in the name of this issue. How do you describe your politics, Judy?
2387500	2393660	Well, when I go to a ballot, I'm looking for the not, you know, a voter's ballot. I'm looking for
2393660	2402060	the none of the above box to check. Okay, that's my point. I'm not a Republican. I'm not a Democrat.
2402060	2405580	I'm disgusted, and I am disgusted, but I don't see a disgusted party. So...
2406300	2415740	Okay, yeah, I'm an independent with a libertarian streak. When I am totally disgusted with the
2415740	2422620	Republican and Democratic candidates, I'll vote libertarian by default, but I haven't had any great
2422620	2429740	enthusiasm for any of their recent candidates. But, you know, I'm hoping no party or whatever,
2429740	2436700	something can come up with something different, because, you know, another Trump Biden election,
2436700	2443020	you know, the whole country, you know, will just be tearing their hair out. So, yeah,
2443020	2450220	so I'm an independent. I'm a none of the above. I like to think things through and listen to both
2450220	2457740	sides. And, you know, a lot of these issues are just not simple, and there's clashes of values.
2457740	2463980	So, you know, I like the discussion. I like the debate. So I don't pledge allegiance to anybody
2463980	2470540	or either side, that's for sure. I'm going to go back, jump back to the just stop oil crowd and
2470540	2475020	the, you know, the climate rebellion people or whatever the extinction rebellion people,
2475980	2481260	because I find some of these people who are throwing the soup cans and blocking the traffic and the
2481260	2489740	rest of it. One, for their punishment, I want them to go and live in rural Kenya without any
2490540	2495420	hydrocarbons and be forced to stay there for two years and just tell us, you know, report back. And
2495420	2501020	maybe this has changed your mind. That's my idea for punishment. You can't use any modern energy
2501020	2506140	sources, sorry, none, zero, and then see how you like it. But I also find it somewhat depressing
2506140	2513580	when I look at them and how they feel the victim. So they feel so aggrieved. I mean, there's something
2514700	2518380	there's something deeply disgusting about it, right? Because I think I see them also as just
2518380	2523820	completely spoiled and uneducated about the world around them. But there's something pathetic about
2523820	2529980	them. Does that ring true to you? And I'm just kind of riffing here, but I see something very
2531500	2533580	deeply sad in the way they act.
2533660	2543980	Well, it's part it's a part of the broader victim culture and identity politics, you know, it's
2543980	2552540	the need to culture victim culture, right? Yeah, that whole thing. So it's it's it's a tribal thing.
2554620	2559500	And the held lawsuit is part of this, right, that this is an identity, right? This is an identity of
2559500	2564940	we've been agreed, we've been wronged, and we're going to seek redress for this, this this affront
2564940	2571100	to us in our, our, then they have somebody in authority who's going to pay the bills for them
2571100	2579740	to go out and throw, you know, cans of tomato soup. You know, it seems like win win, you know, it
2582620	2588780	they think they're saving the world. They're part of a tribe. And somebody's paying them and
2588780	2593420	encourage, you know, somebody in authority who's paying them and encourage them to do this. So
2593420	2599900	it's, you know, I think all of those things are contributing. But it is very sad that these kids
2599900	2605740	aren't doing something better with their time, more, more productive, you know, getting educated
2605740	2613820	and getting jobs. And this is personal for you. You're a grandmother. Am I right? Oh, I'm a grandmother
2613820	2621580	for sure. How many, how many grandchildren? Well, I have one grandchild and then five step
2621580	2627260	grandchildren. So we've got a nice crew and they're all of junior high and high school age.
2627980	2634300	And you talk about these kind of political issues within? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And they, and they
2634300	2641580	think, you know, I'm cool. I'm a little bit subversive. You know, that's good. Let's see what the real
2641580	2649980	truth is. So that they seem to all have healthy attitudes, you know, about the situation. And
2649980	2656540	my granddaughter, who lives in Reno, you know, close to where I live, she's very rational. She
2656540	2662380	says, Well, I just really need to learn more about this whole issue. You know, I just, I don't think
2662380	2667180	I should have a big opinion about this right now, because I just really need to learn more about this
2667500	2674220	issue. You go girl. Yeah. So let me ask you about, we just have a few more minutes. And again,
2674220	2679260	my guest is Judith Curry. She's the author of this new book, Climate Uncertainty and Risk,
2679260	2684220	Rethinking Our Response. By the paperback, it's much cheaper than the hardback. It's out by
2684220	2690540	Anthem Press. It came out in June. I'm going to ask you about the ending of that in just a minute.
2691420	2698620	But you have your own website, judithcurry.com and climate, et cetera. So you have your own
2698620	2702780	media outlet. I'm just curious. Can you give me an idea how many visitors you get there? Because
2702780	2708460	I'm increasingly convinced unless you own your own media outlet, you're not assured of a free press.
2710460	2714460	You know, I haven't joined Substack or anything else where I might get traffic. When I first
2714460	2722380	started the blog, it had huge traffic. I get less traffic these days. I think on a big day,
2722380	2729660	I might get 10,000 visitors. You know, it's and if something gets picked up.
2731260	2735980	But that's still a respectable number. It's a respectable number. And you know,
2736620	2743340	I'm not actually looking for influence. I'm just looking to engage in, you know,
2743900	2749180	in the dialogue and to set up a space where people from across the spectrum can come here
2749180	2755420	and discuss. And I also host a number of very interesting, intelligent people as guest
2756540	2763500	authors. And it's even spawned a few books, three books, in fact, you know, that have grown out
2763500	2771100	from posts on my blog. Yeah. And so, you know, I'm very happy with the blog, even though it's,
2771100	2778540	you know, not high traffic. And in all honesty, I think my lab that there was a three week period
2779180	2784460	when I didn't even post something, you know, so it's not like I'm posting four times a day and
2784460	2791660	really trying to build trap. You know, it's just my personal record of what I'm thinking about and
2791660	2798460	what I'm investigating. And it really seeded my book. I started the blog in 2010 with a series on
2799020	2805740	climate science and the uncertainty monster, which was a major theme in my book. So this blog in many
2805740	2811740	ways documented my journey in writing the book. It's an interesting way to think about it because
2811740	2816780	I'm talking with other writers and, you know, I've written six books and I don't think I have
2816780	2821340	another one in them, but that they view the their substack or even their Twitter or other places
2821340	2825740	of way that they catalog what they know, and then they come come back and use it as a resource.
2825740	2828860	So I want to we're going to close here in just a few minutes because I know you're on a tight
2828860	2833100	schedule and so am I. But at the end of the book, you have a section called toward post apocalyptic
2833100	2837500	climate policies. And you quote the economist Richard toll, who is an interesting character,
2837500	2843180	I've met him once, he said, politically correct climate change orthodoxy has completely destroyed
2843180	2849180	our ability to think rationally about the environment. I touched on this before, but I like
2849180	2853580	that because it speaks to the issues of land use, which I've been reporting on for a very long time.
2854140	2859500	And met many people in rural America in the course of my travels in Michigan and Wisconsin and all
2859500	2863420	over the world that you're fighting these encroachment of these wind and solar projects.
2864060	2869500	But it seems that that to me is the concrete example of this clouded ability to think about
2869500	2875180	the environment that this climatism has trumping all of these other concerns. I don't know.
2877260	2880860	Your book is in some ways kind of a technical book, but you also have these quotes that are
2880860	2887420	really great in each section. So you really, that was the most fun part of the book was
2889580	2893900	I think, you know, selecting quotes and figuring out where to place them. I mean, it was,
2894620	2901900	it was, I spent an awful lot of time doing it, but it was the most fun part really of writing the
2901900	2909420	book. Well, I enjoyed it as well because you have a, somebody, go ahead. From Dirty Harry and May
2909420	2916860	West, you know, Bruce Lee, you know, popular culture figures, along with philosophers and
2916940	2924140	scientists and things like that. So, but it breaks up the kind of, it made it less of a
2924140	2928940	technical way. That gave it some leavening, some, some breathing room, I guess I would say, right?
2928940	2933580	Because you have a lot of technical things that heavily footnoted and footnoted and the way you
2933580	2938540	structured it in some ways is more textbook-like. And you said that the publisher is targeting
2939340	2944620	universities and academic outlets or academic buyers, but I found that part to be good. So
2944620	2950540	let me read this one section here and then we're going to wrap up. This is in your concluding section,
2950540	2955500	you say, we need to open up space for dissent, disagreement and discussion about scientific
2955500	2960780	uncertainty and policy options so that multiple perspectives can be considered and broader support
2960780	2966860	can be built for a range of policy options. Wicked scientists are willing to become embroiled in
2966860	2972140	political debates and thorny social problems. To be effective, we need to break the hegemony of
2972140	2976940	disciplinary researchers, disciplinary researchers, particularly for those who are
2976940	2982540	strident political activists as being regarded as experts for solutions to the wicked problem of
2982540	2988620	climate change. I couldn't agree with that more. I thought that was a really good summary of, I
2988620	2993820	think of what your, your point is, we need, we need more robust debate about the best path forward.
2993820	2997180	And my thing has always been natural gas and nuclear. If we're serious about this, these are
2997180	3003260	low carbon scalable, you know, but they're just the lack of policy debate about what the way forward
3003260	3008780	to me is very, a very dangerous one. So I commend you on the book. I thought, you know, it's really
3008780	3014940	obviously an enormous amount of effort. So I have to, I wanted to draw part of our discussion to an
3014940	3019580	end there because I thought that was very well stated. So thank you for that. Last two questions.
3019580	3023180	And you know, I asked these and I asked you these before. So what are you reading? What's on the,
3023180	3028220	yeah, I know you're busy with climate forecast actions, climate forecast applications network,
3028220	3032460	your business, but I know you must be an avid reader. So what's on your bookshelf? What are you
3032460	3038780	reading on these? What's the top of the pile? Oh, gosh, I wish I could remember the name of this
3038780	3046540	book, but it's a book by Andy West. It's in the grip of culture. It's about the social psychology
3046620	3053580	of climate catastrophism, you know, the Greta phenomenon or whatever. And this is another
3053580	3059020	like scholarly book, but it's very readable. In the grip of culture, it's called? Yeah,
3059020	3067260	in the grip of culture. Okay. I think and it's about the social psychology of climate catastrophism.
3067260	3075500	I see. Something like that. So that's like, I highly recommend that. I think that's the main
3075500	3079980	one I want to recommend at this point. Okay. Last question, what gives you hope?
3081100	3093580	What gives me hope? Well, that people can be rational. And I think that we are. And I think
3093580	3100380	this in the grip of culture book explains a lot. And, you know, we just need to get out of that.
3100380	3106860	And I'm also, I mean, at some point, the weather is going to turn a little bit more favorable.
3106860	3113500	We've been in a bad place since 2017. You know, the natural climate oscillations will shift at
3113500	3119740	some point, five years, 10 years into a more favorable state. And hopefully people will calm down.
3120540	3127980	And about this problem, I think that the apocalyptic rhetoric people are realizing that
3127980	3132460	they've gone too far. I mean, having a whole generation of kids who are depressed and too
3132460	3137660	scared to do anything isn't going to help the movement. So they have to figure out how to
3138380	3146380	make their message a little bit more hopeful, and not just destroy the psyches of all these kids.
3147020	3157580	So hopefully the catastrophic rhetoric will came down. But, you know, at the end of the day,
3157660	3164380	things that don't make sense aren't going to have a long lifetime. They can cause us a lot of money,
3164380	3172060	cause us a lot of pain. But at the end of the day, you know, sense and economics will prevail.
3172060	3174140	But we're certainly not there right now.
3176940	3180940	Well, that's a good place to stop. So that's where we will, in fact, stop. My guest has been
3180940	3185820	Judith Curry. She's the author of a new book called Climate Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking
3185820	3191260	Our Response. You can find it, I'm sure, on all the major book selling outlets. She's on Twitter
3191260	3197180	at CurryJA, and you can find her on the web at JudithCurry.com. Judith, thanks a million for
3197180	3203260	coming back on The Power Hungry Podcast. A very interesting book and, you know, I applaud you
3203260	3207820	for your efforts at trying to open up the debate. And with this, if these are the most important
3207820	3212380	issues of our time, and I think they are important issues, let's have a debate about it. Let's talk
3212460	3217980	about it. Let's examine it. And your work, I think, is helping that effort. So good on you.
3218780	3221340	Okay, great. Thanks. It was great to talk to you again.
3222860	3226540	Okay, so thank you, Judy. And thanks to all of you out there in Podcast Land.
3226540	3230860	To the next episode of The Power Hungry Podcast, it might be as good as this one,
3230860	3236060	we will find out. But if you have a chance, also give us a good rating on those podcast outlets
3236060	3245580	wherever you can give us 4, 5, 6, 12 stars, whatever it is. And until next time, see you.
