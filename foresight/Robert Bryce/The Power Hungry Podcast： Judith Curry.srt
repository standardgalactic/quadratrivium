00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
Hi everyone, welcome to the Power Hungry podcast.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,480
I'm Robert Brice on this podcast.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,880
We talk about energy, power, innovation, and politics, and I'm pleased to welcome back

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,520
for the third time.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,880
That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the third time, Dr. Judith Curry.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,320
She is the author of a new book called Climate Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking Our Response.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,760
Judy, welcome back to the Power Hungry podcast.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,120
Well, thank you.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,600
I'm delighted to join you again.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,480
So your book has been out now a couple of months, and it's called, as I said, Climate

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,720
Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking Our Response.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,480
You've been on the podcast before, but guests on this podcast, I think you remember, introduced

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
themselves.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,200
So you've been on here once, but imagine you've got 30, 60 seconds, you've walked into a room,

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
you don't know anyone.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Introduce yourself, please.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Okay.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
I'm Judith Curry.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,160
I spent most of my career in academia, most recently at the Georgia Institute of Technology,

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,120
where I was chair of school of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences for 13 years.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,560
I'm currently president of Climate Forecast Applications Network.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:13,240
I'm proprietor of the blog Climate Etc. at JudithCurry.com and author of a new book,

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,840
Climate Uncertainty and Risk.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
Very succinct.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,280
Well done, Attagirl.

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,360
And you're also on Twitter, so we get this out of the way, at CurryJA.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
At CurryJA.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
Okay.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,200
Well, I'm going to just tell me, you know, I've been reading your book, give me your

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
pitch.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
What is this new book about?

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,720
We've talked before on the podcast, we've talked about climate science, media, et cetera.

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,440
What is this book and what do you hope to achieve with it?

34
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,320
Well the whole climate science issue and the policy response has been squeezed into this

35
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,960
little tiny box, you know, with everybody bouncing around inside the box dotting eyes

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,480
and crossing T's and threatening anybody who tries to go outside the box.

37
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,240
Well, I blow the lid off the box.

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,280
I look at all the other stuff that people, the inconvenient things that people are trying

39
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,840
to shove under the rug.

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,240
I look at the uncertainties.

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,640
I look at the controversies.

42
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,600
I look at why we disagree, both in the science and the policy response.

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:25,000
I talk about, you know, how politics of this has really torqued this in a very unfortunate

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
way.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,440
I talk, the middle part of the book, I look at, speculate about what we can expect in

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,280
the 21st century in terms of climate.

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,680
I mean, the climate models are deeply flawed in terms of giving us a reliable perspective

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
on this.

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,200
I speculate, you know, on a whole range of possible outcomes, including plausible worst

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,880
cases.

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,360
And the third part of the book is the most important one really, it's risk and response.

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:05,400
And this is where I talk about how we've fundamentally mischaracterized climate risk and how we've

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,960
fundamentally mismanaged our response.

54
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:16,960
And I use principles from a variety of risk science disciplines to put together a menu

55
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,760
of some other approaches that we can take that make more sense when you're dealing with

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:31,720
a very complex, deeply uncertain problem with conflicts of values and political disagreements

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,440
in play.

58
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:43,320
So, you know, it's a very different approach, and it's a very integrated approach to this

59
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:49,560
very wicked problem that I think can lead us on a path to doing sensible things and

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,640
setting our path towards a prosperous and safe 21st century.

61
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
That's a good summary.

62
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,140
Thank you.

63
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,700
Looking at the book, though, and as I've been going through it, and I don't mean this

64
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,020
as a slam, but we talked about it right before we started recording.

65
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,820
You said this was written or published by an academic press, Anthem Press, and it's heavily

66
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,820
footnoted.

67
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
And I got to say, I love me some footnotes, right?

68
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,140
I have footnote all my books.

69
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,580
It's a laborious process.

70
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,500
So well, this is a kind of a geeky question.

71
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,340
I could tally them all up here, but about how many footnotes are in this book?

72
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
Roughly.

73
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,340
About 1500.

74
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,500
1500 in 239 pages.

75
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,060
So you have your references here, which I think you made clear.

76
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,100
You wanted to publish this book before we started.

77
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,540
You said you wanted it published by an academic press, that it was peer reviewed, and everything

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,060
here you've stated is all fully cited.

79
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,780
But still, I mean, the fundamental issue that, and we've talked about this before, is that

80
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,860
we're seeing this lack of robust debate, or even any debate, really, and that most recently

81
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:08,700
John Clouser, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in just in June and August, had a speech,

82
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,180
a presentation to the International Monetary Fund that he was canceled because he's not

83
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,540
towing the line on the catastrophist orthodoxy.

84
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:23,660
If I can use that phrase, I mean, it seems rather than getting better, rather than the

85
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,300
debate getting slightly more open, it's getting even yet more constrained, or is that fair?

86
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
How have things changed?

87
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,300
Oh, that's correct.

88
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,420
I mean, we'll go back to the little box again.

89
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,580
And the reason it's all been shoved into a box, everybody has to agree, because the

90
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,180
oversimplified analysis that our brilliant policymakers have made is that we need global

91
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,700
collective action on this problem.

92
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,300
And in order to get there, everybody has to agree.

93
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:03,140
So, you know, so there's huge motivation with that framing of the problem to nuke anybody

94
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,140
who disagrees.

95
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,060
I just want to make sure you said oversimplified analysis.

96
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,580
Is that is that what you the phrase?

97
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,020
Right. So we have to nuke anyone who disagrees.

98
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:22,060
But that I think that seems to be the right right description as well, that there we will

99
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,700
not brook dissent, right?

100
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,140
But is that so you've talked about this in academic terms, because that's where you

101
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,940
come from this.

102
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,500
And I come at it from as a more, I would say just a more general reporter approach.

103
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,740
But if I were to say, well, what's driving this, I would say it's money, right?

104
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,100
That there is a lot of money at stake here for various subsidies under the Inflation

105
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,700
Reduction Act. This is one of the big drivers, of course, of the renewable energy rollout,

106
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,460
right? There are massive subsidies for wind and solar at hand.

107
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,660
So there must not be any controversy about this.

108
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,660
Otherwise, the sub that you stop the flow of the money is that an oversimplified analysis?

109
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,500
It's an oversimplified analysis.

110
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,940
I think we have to go back to the 1980s and the UN environmental program.

111
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:13,340
There was a big drive for non-governmental world control through health, environment,

112
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,900
and all these issues, and they keyed on climate change is the issue to get us there.

113
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,860
And we had a climate change treaty in 1992, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

114
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,100
This was before the temperature even started warming in a significant way,

115
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,620
and the US even signed on to that treaty.

116
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:39,740
So from the very beginning, you've had the policy card way out in front of the scientific horse.

117
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,980
And this is a UN agenda. It's degrowth. It's anti-capitalism. It's anti-democratic.

118
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,700
And in order to enforce this, they amp up the alarm.

119
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,780
I mean, the worst rhetoric, I mean, apart from extinction, rebellion, or something like that,

120
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:04,940
comes from you and officials, global boiling, code red, all of this kind of stuff over a slow creep

121
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,660
of warming. And the agenda is to kill off the fossil fuel industry. They don't like that.

122
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:18,380
They don't like nuclear either. So this is a real, it's a clash of values.

123
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,860
And there was a recent survey of university climate scientists, and they asked them a

124
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:32,780
bunch of questions. And a majority of them were in favor of degrowth, not green growth,

125
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,340
but degrowth. Okay, so you can see the perspectives of these people. I mean, it's not necessarily

126
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,300
about money. There is certainly an element of, you know, follow the money and all this.

127
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,660
But there's a whole worldview and an ideology behind all this.

128
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:57,420
That's interesting. I guess, so maybe what, I mean, in your reply, I'm not going to argue with it at all.

129
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,100
That is more on the science kind of policy side. I guess what my point about the money and the

130
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,260
subsidies is on the deployment side, right? On the amount of money that's available for the

131
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,380
mitigation side, right? Which was where there's staggering numbers, now hundreds of billions

132
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,540
of dollars, whether it's electric vehicles or solar or wind or hydrogen or carbon capture.

133
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,340
I mean, it's just a staggering amount of money. I think it's the biggest corporate giveaway in

134
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:27,020
American history, and there's no second place here. But your points are more on the policy side

135
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,540
about this ideology that's driving this alarmism, I guess, to put it, is that a fair way to

136
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,140
characterize it? Yes, yes. Oh, there's definitely money in play. And, you know, Warren Buffett

137
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:44,220
was very cynical. I mean, he was an early investor in wind power. Sure. He liked wind power, but

138
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,220
he saw it with all these subsidies and whatever, I'm going to make money. He's no dummy.

139
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,100
The only reason to build wind turbines is to collect the tax credits, right? He said that

140
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:00,140
very clearly, right? That was his famous line. Okay, well, so I live in Texas, and let me tell

141
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,580
you, it feels a little apocalyptic. And let me just tell my climate, what is my view on climate

142
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,740
change? Climate change is a concern. And I think it rhymes with what your book says. Climate change

143
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,260
is a concern. It's not our only concern. So not that I don't favor action on climate change,

144
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,900
is that it's a concern, but we have to balance our action on that against other concerns. And I

145
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,100
think if I were to boil down what I see in your book, you're saying something somewhat similar,

146
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,220
and I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. But it's been stinking hot here in Texas this summer,

147
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,420
Judy. I mean, it's just been, and I'm used to the heat. I lived in Texas, I'm from Oklahoma.

148
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:42,300
Okay, so here's the question. Is it possible that the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in January 2022

149
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,460
is in part responsible for the weather or this hot weather that we're seeing now?

150
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,940
Okay, first off, Texas is an anomaly. If you look at the average temperatures over the summer so far

151
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,740
for the US, we're slightly below normal. I mean, you look at the set. I have to move then is what

152
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:07,180
you're saying. The US has been cool. So you know, Texas is just bad luck. I did my latest blog post

153
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:15,180
that's up, looks at what is causing all this more on a global level. And it looks Hunga Tonga,

154
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:21,740
and it looks at the ship fuels, and it looks like the long wave and the radiation budget at the top

155
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,220
of the atmosphere, it looks at the surface energy balance, it looks at the internal modes of climate

156
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:32,700
variability. It's a very comprehensive discussion of what's going on. To get back to Hunga Tonga,

157
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:42,460
Hunga Tonga usually volcanoes spew particulates into the atmosphere, which in the stratosphere,

158
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:49,020
and that has a cooling effect. Well, Hunga Tonga spewed only a little bit of sulfate and a substantial

159
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:55,420
amount of water vapor into the stratosphere. So right now in the summer hemisphere, it looks

160
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:02,700
like the effects of Hunga Tonga on the radiation balance are canceling out, you know, the long

161
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,260
wave and the short wave are canceling out. But if you go to the winter hemisphere, the southern

162
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:13,100
hemisphere, we are seeing the effects of Hunga Tonga because the long wave infrared effects are

163
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:20,700
dominating. And you see it in a, this is part of the circulation pattern that's giving us an early

164
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:29,740
ozone hole and is giving us the low extent of the Antarctic sea ice this winter. So Hunga Tonga,

165
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,180
and we may see a bigger effect of Hunga Tonga in the northern hemisphere during our winter.

166
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,980
So that, but if you're interested in that, you know, check out my blog, judithcurry.com,

167
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:46,220
I've got a whole long post on all this. I see. Well, I just found it. It was posted August 14.

168
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,180
I was looking at your other blog post. It's with Jim Johnstone and Mark Jelenek, I guess,

169
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,340
is that that's the one you're talking about? Right. Yeah. Okay. I didn't have time to look at that

170
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:01,260
one. I was also looking at the post you did on the hell versus Montana lawsuit, which I want to

171
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:07,820
talk about as well. Okay. So I just want to read back. So you're saying I can't blame the hot weather

172
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:15,980
in Texas on Hunga Tonga. No, it's unfortunate circulation patterns. Okay. So well, and that's,

173
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:22,220
but isn't, I guess, me even asking this question, as I say it, am I, this is part of the issue,

174
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,380
right? Well, why can't we blame this on that? Isn't this, of course, to be due to that, that

175
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,820
there's, like everybody else, I'm like, well, tell me the cause, right? Or is this, you know,

176
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,740
and the Bill McKibbins of the world will gladly say, Oh, well, see, there you go.

177
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,860
You know, you guys in Texas, or in fact, Mark Goodell and the pages of the New York Times,

178
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,900
kind of, he said, in fact, in his piece, that this is, oh, this is like, you're getting payback.

179
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:53,100
Now, this is you're getting Texas is getting paid back for being a bad guy, right? That this is

180
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,260
like, this is the cause. Is this, is this part of the whole problem? Well, okay, here's the issue.

181
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:08,300
We're talking about a very complex, chaotic nonlinear system. And not only do we have a

182
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:14,380
chaotic atmosphere, it's coupled to a chaotic ocean. And it's subject to

183
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:23,100
changes in external forcing. And the mathematicians, you know, call this

184
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,540
pandemonium, it's even beyond chaos. And trying to unravel causes and effects

185
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:37,500
is, you know, not impossible, but it's not simple. You know, you can't do this by waving your arms.

186
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:45,740
Like the analysis in my blog, you know, it unravels a lot of things. And it gives you a sense of how

187
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:53,340
difficult it is to attribute any specific things to any specific forcing. It's very challenging.

188
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,300
Well, okay, so fair enough. And you have 17 figures in this, in this posting here.

189
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,780
But I guess maybe I'm, my, my desire for that simple solution is reflective of this kind of

190
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:15,740
broader societal design. Well, of course, this means that, and therefore, we have broad terms,

191
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:23,420
the way I see a lot of the climate apocalyptic analysis, we've sinned, now we're suffering,

192
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,180
and we're going to pay the price. And therefore, we have to repent, right? That this is,

193
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,140
there's a lot of kind of Christian echoes of what, you know, sin and redemption here, right? And

194
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,020
is that part of the narrative as well, that why this narrative is so strong?

195
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,420
This is the policymakers back in the 1990s, wanting a simple cause and effect and a simple fix.

196
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:49,260
And it was also the hubris that they can control the climate by, you know, eliminating fossil fuels.

197
00:15:49,260 --> 00:16:00,140
So it's looking for a simple solution and just a total lack of humility and thinking that we can

198
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:08,220
actually control this. So, you know, it's just, you know, human failing. It's not surprising.

199
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,420
That's why we have scientists to sort all this out. But when the scientists become political

200
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,500
activists and become active in trying to cancel anyone who disagrees with them,

201
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,660
then the whole thing falls apart. And we end up with nonsense, like we're currently facing.

202
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:33,900
And when you say the nonsense, we're currently facing, so, okay, force rank the nonsense for me,

203
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,100
if you would, then if we're looking at policy responses to climate change, and we've heard

204
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,820
repeatedly from the Biden administration, this is our main concern, right? And, you know,

205
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,940
the president, in fact, at a League of Conservation Voters meeting at a high dollar fundraiser,

206
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,740
I wrote about this on my substack, bragged about the fact that the Export-Import Bank of the United

207
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:00,620
States was giving a $900 million loan to build a solar project in Angola. Never mind that 60%

208
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,060
of the people who live in Angola don't even have electricity and we're building them a coal,

209
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,220
a solar plant, not a coal plant, not a gas-fired power plant, even though Angola has

210
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,900
all kinds of natural gas. Okay, all this nonsense. So, force rank the nonsense. If you look at this

211
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,340
survey of what our responses, our policy responses have been, what's the silliest of the silly?

212
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,900
Well, this rapid rush to wind and solar, I mean, that's the silliest of the silly. I mean, you know,

213
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:33,500
I think it makes sense to think, to look forward, you know, into the 21st century and figure out how

214
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:42,460
we can, you know, improve our energy infrastructure so that we have, you know, more abundant, cheaper,

215
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,860
cleaner energy and let's look forward and try to get there. I mean, that's just going to help

216
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,540
support our progress in the 21st century. That's going to require research and development and

217
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:01,580
learning curves and different localities and countries experimenting and, you know, at the,

218
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:09,340
by the end of the 21st century, if the market was left to, you know, take care of all this,

219
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,460
we'd probably have a much better, cleaner energy infrastructure. But now that we're,

220
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,420
you know, tearing what we have down and replacing it with wind and solar, which is totally inadequate,

221
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:27,180
I know I'm preaching to the choir here, we're setting ourselves up to make ourselves more

222
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:34,380
vulnerable to whatever weather or climate extremes nature might throw at us. I mean,

223
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:42,220
electricity helps keep us safe, you know, with desalination plants and air conditioning and on

224
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:50,540
and on it goes. And it's also electricity is the source of our, you know, innovations across

225
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:57,020
everything. So I mean, what we're doing is extremely stupid and we've got politicians in

226
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,300
charge of all this wind and solar stuff and nobody's talking to the engineers, you know,

227
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,580
people who, who design transmission lines, the grid operators, you know, they're all sort of

228
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:13,420
tearing their hair out over all this wind and solar. So what we're doing is just plain stupid.

229
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,780
And if we continue on this path, we're going to end up in a worse place at the end of the 21st

230
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:26,460
century than if we had just let market forces and our desire for innovation just to take charge

231
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:33,660
and move forward. So it's just a very bad place to be. Well, you are preaching to the choir,

232
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:41,100
but amen, sister, keep going. Hallelujah. Past the collection plate. I'd boil that down,

233
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,740
how I distill this is if, if, if we're facing more extreme weather, it's the height of foolishness

234
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,660
or the depth of foolishness to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather.

235
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:58,220
I mean, we need weather, we need weather resilient systems, not weather dependent systems. And yet

236
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,340
that is in fact what we're doing. And just in the last few days here in Texas has been insanely hot

237
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,060
and the wind is going and the wind doesn't blow when it's really hot. And so there's been a, you

238
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,700
know, wind energy, we have a huge fleet of wind energy turbines. And yet they're only producing

239
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,700
at single digit percentage outputs during times of peak demand. So anyway, I just had to had to

240
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,300
throw that in there. Okay, so let's talk about censorship because you also know a little bit

241
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:30,380
about this. We talked, I think the last time you were on the podcast, which was in December of 2022,

242
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:37,260
that in on Twitter, you, you were very pleased that Elon Musk had Elon Musk took over Twitter

243
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,420
because suddenly you got more traction there, you weren't being throttled, your content wasn't

244
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,260
being throttled. Is that still the case now? Do you, have you gotten more followers on Twitter?

245
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,900
Tell me about how you see what's going on just on that platform. And then we'll talk about other

246
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:58,060
things. Okay, just from my perspective, Twitter's going along great. I know a lot of people don't

247
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:06,060
like it. Well, they don't like, you know, the climate scientists don't want to have the rabble

248
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:12,460
questioning them. And they don't like that. And a lot of them are leaving Twitter. Also,

249
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:21,420
Elon has made a couple of changes to the functionality treat decks. Okay. And a lot of

250
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:28,780
people are very unhappy with that. So some people are leaving, but this the overall,

251
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:36,460
you know, from where I sit, I think it's so much improved. And, you know, the quality of my

252
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,500
interactions and the number of my followers has increased very substantially. So I'm happy.

253
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,460
And I have to say that's the only social media platform that I'm happy with.

254
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,300
Well, then let's talk about the others then you were on John Stossel's show. And it was,

255
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,900
was it censored on Facebook? Tell me what this has been several days ago or a couple of weeks

256
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:09,900
ago, but it was labeled as false information. And this was me talking about my experiences and

257
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:16,220
my perspective. So I don't know how you label this as false information. So, and that was,

258
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,020
you know, they still left the link where you could click there. But there was this big warning

259
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:28,620
that this was false information because everybody knows that the consensus exists 97% of climate

260
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:39,180
scientists agree or whatever. No, there's no debate. I was on a podcast earlier this year

261
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:47,900
with the Heartland Institute. Right. And this was, it was live. And they, as soon as it started,

262
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:56,140
they took it down. Facebook did Facebook and they were sensitized to me because like about

263
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:03,740
two weeks earlier, I, there was a something posted on YouTube. It was an interview by

264
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:15,580
business news in South Africa. And it went sort of viral. I mean, it got like 500,000 views

265
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:21,500
in a couple of days. And then YouTube took it down. You couldn't even search for it. Okay,

266
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,460
you couldn't search for it at all. There was no message, no nothing, you couldn't search for it.

267
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,940
So that must have raised some sort of flag to Facebook. So as soon as they saw me being a guest

268
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,500
on the Heartland podcast, they just canceled that live feed. And they, you know, so I'm being

269
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:50,140
really canceled, you know, by the Mark Zuckerberg type social media. So, you know, and what I say,

270
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:56,940
if you actually listen to what I say, it's pretty innocuous. I mean, it's not cheerleading, you know,

271
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:04,860
for the team, but you know, I'm just raising some critical questions. And that's very uncomfortable.

272
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:11,180
I mean, I'm well outside that little box. And that makes people uncomfortable. And they view me

273
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:17,900
as a threat. I mean, all those footnotes in my book, you know, it's like evidence sort of supporting

274
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:26,300
my points. And you know, they view this as sort of dangerous. Well, in the way you speak, in what

275
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,340
you're talking about it, and yes, as I've done, you know, a couple hundred podcasts, and I'm a dad,

276
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,140
and you know, been married a long time. I listen to how people listen to how they say what they're

277
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,460
talking about, right? The words matter, of course, but it's, but there was the tone in your voice

278
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:48,140
about what I describe it, disappointment, anger, frustration. Here's the, you know, the TV journalist

279
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,940
favorite, how do you feel? How do I say that? I'm just kind of joking about it. But I can sense

280
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,980
of you a kind of an outrage or just a disappointment. How does it make you feel?

281
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:07,180
Well, you know, I'm a scientist, you know, and reason, dialogue, evidence, debate, and especially

282
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,860
in universities, you know, debate and disagreement is the spice of academic life. And all that's

283
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:19,660
been canceled. You know, it's the universities which discuss me even more than social media. I mean,

284
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,460
social media is social media, but it's what's going on at the universities to me is the absolute worst.

285
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:31,020
I'm seeing a few of the universities turn around, but the overall tenor at universities is just

286
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,660
terrible. And, you know, you saw this whole dynamics play out with the COVID situation. It's

287
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:45,820
just endemic to our society right now. And it's very dangerous and free speech issue, political

288
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,420
freedom, you know, there's a lot of issues here. And unfortunately, a lot of this gets tied up in

289
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:57,020
what's going on with Donald Trump. And, you know, then it just becomes a big political mess.

290
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:05,340
But these are very serious issues. And I mean, how I mean, God bless Elon Musk for trying to open up

291
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:12,540
Twitter. He has his own quirks and whatever. But overall, this is like the one place where people

292
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,460
from across the spectrum still come and, you know, engage and look at, you know, a broad range of

293
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:25,740
material everywhere else, or most other places. It's in a pretty sad state. How are we going to

294
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,580
get anywhere if we don't think critically and engage in constructive debate and discussion?

295
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,220
You know, what you said about Twitter, I think we talked about this last time,

296
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,620
but Alina Chan and Matt Ridley, who wrote a book called Viral on COVID,

297
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,740
they said the same things about the importance of Twitter in terms of this opening the debate

298
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:51,580
around origins of COVID. And now, which clearly seems to be, as I think they suspected all along,

299
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,980
a lab leak, right? Or the result of some kind of a lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

300
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,980
But they were being censored almost everywhere else, except on Twitter. And this is before Musk took

301
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:10,380
over. But that lack of critical debate, the free and open debate, I have to agree with you. And

302
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:16,380
because we're messing with the most important system in our society, which is our energy network,

303
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,980
and we're making it, we're weakening it and spending hundreds of billions of dollars in

304
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,740
the weakening of it, right? Because of the fashion of, and it is fashion, and the way I would talk

305
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,580
about it, I guess, the, I call it climatism and renewable energy fetishism, right? That we have

306
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:38,220
this combined isms, right there that are, have replaced what has, I would call traditional

307
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,860
conservation, conservation, the traditional conservation ethic. And that's one of the things

308
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:48,140
that I'm with you exactly on wind and solar. There's this insane headlong rush toward these two

309
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:53,260
sources of intermittent weather dependent renewables. And with no regard for land use birds,

310
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,900
landscapes, view sheds, it's this, oh, well, this is the, this is the cure. And therefore,

311
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,100
anyone who stands in the way, we're going to run over. And it is almost that bold in terms of,

312
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,340
I mean, some of the states are even saying they're going to override local zoning laws to force

313
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,180
communities to take wind and solar projects they don't want, which just seems the absolute wrong

314
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:21,340
way to go in terms of democracy and process due, due process and so on. And I know I'm, I'm, I'm

315
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:27,660
rambling here, but does that ring, ring true to you? Oh, for sure. You summarized it perfectly.

316
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:34,780
I mean, this is, this whole thing is dangerous in so many different ways. I mean, not just to our

317
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:41,260
energy infrastructure, but to our freedom and our, the political way that we do things. I mean,

318
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:48,620
it's, it's a, it's a very slippery slope that we're sliding down. You said, I wrote it down,

319
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:55,500
you said the universities disgust me. And I reserve my disgust for a few things, lima beans and cauliflower

320
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:02,300
are two of them, but unpack that just a little bit for me when you say they disgust you. Why is

321
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:14,460
that? Well, because of the, the cancel, the cancel culture, all of the faculty members, you know,

322
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:21,260
very talented people can't get hired because they don't know how to write a good DEI essay, diversity,

323
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:28,140
equity and inclusion. And if you're a chemistry professor or something, what the heck, you know,

324
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,980
when you're talking about molecules, how do you bring that into your teaching? I mean, there's a

325
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:40,300
lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. They're allowing students to basically lead the charge to

326
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:46,620
get rid of faculty members that they don't like for some reason. They're interesting and provocative

327
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:54,780
speakers are getting disinvited because some students feel threatened by their words. And they,

328
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:05,820
and they pander to this, and they pander to this, people who are sort of skeptical of climate change

329
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:16,940
or in, in gen, in biology and right, all sorts of other fields. And I thought it was just really

330
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,300
climate change and biology, but people tell me it's rampant in law schools and social psychology

331
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:29,580
departments and political science departments that the same disease is rampant anywhere that

332
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:38,700
there is a that's socially relevant. When you're talking about that, it makes me automatically

333
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:47,180
think now of this held versus Montana lawsuit, which as I read the slump when I brought it up,

334
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:52,620
you were an expert witness or retained, I guess, as an expert witness in that case, and ultimately

335
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,820
did not testify. But when you're talking about the what's happening on the universities, the line

336
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,620
that comes into my head is grievance culture, right, that everyone's agreed. Everyone is a victim

337
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:09,500
somehow some way they've been offended or their future has been, been somehow clouded by this,

338
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,580
that or the other. That was in fact the claim, the legal claim that these teenagers made in

339
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:25,100
Montana that the state was injuring them and their potential, their future. And they won the

340
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:31,900
court case under the what seemed to be a fairly narrow ruling based on the Montana Constitution.

341
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,940
I know you wrote a blog post about that in June, but now we're here after the held versus Montana

342
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:41,660
litigation that they won and they Montana Attorney General said he's going to appeal.

343
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,700
How do you read that decision and how important is it?

344
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:53,180
Well, I don't think it's important. It might stand because the Montana Supreme Court

345
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:02,460
seems to be equally clueless and sympathetic to these environmental claims as the judge. So

346
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:08,380
it may not be overruled. If it stands, it's not going to have a big material

347
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:15,180
impact on what goes on in Montana in terms of changing the statute that they want to change

348
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,860
because Montana and principle, I mean, it just adds a lot of paperwork to everything Montana and

349
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:29,980
principle can still approve new power plants. It may, it may end up slowing down wind farms

350
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:35,340
by the same token with all this extra paperwork. I don't know, but it's a symbolic victory for

351
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,780
our Children's Trust, which is the advocacy group behind this case and it's given them fresh steam

352
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,980
because they've been around for 10 years and this is the first case where they got any kind of

353
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:51,900
attraction. You know, they've been thrown out. Their cases have been thrown out everywhere

354
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,340
until now. They're still pending in a few additional states, but this is the first traction that

355
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:06,140
they've gotten. And to me, the most dangerous part of this is that like the state legal systems

356
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:13,740
are ill-prepared, both the judges and the state's attorney's office to deal with an issue like this.

357
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:18,300
I mean, a technical issue like this. These things should not be decided in the courts.

358
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,060
Okay, they should be decided, you know, by the legislature, you know, elected

359
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,540
legislators and they should have hearings from people across the spectrum and, you know,

360
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:37,660
wide deliberate deliberations and whatever, not by a single judge who's sympathetic to the defendants

361
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:47,100
and doesn't have a clue about climate science. And the Montana state's attorney, I mean, I was

362
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:54,140
brought on the case at the last minute, like the end of last September. And the lawyer that

363
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:03,500
hired me, he then left a few weeks later. There was a private company who then

364
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:10,300
took legal firm that then took over and then the lawyer who was eventually in charge of the case

365
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:17,820
didn't even join it until December. And so he was left, you know, brought in at the last minute.

366
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,380
These weren't witnesses of his choosing. He didn't particularly understand the climate

367
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:30,540
change issue at all. He wanted, you know, the case to be about something different about

368
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:39,580
legal nuances. But in spite of my best efforts, I didn't convince him that this was really going

369
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:48,140
to be about climate change and that you needed to deeply challenge their witnesses and, you know,

370
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:52,940
the points. And he just didn't know how to evaluate any of that. And I don't blame him. I'm not

371
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:59,660
surprised. I don't think there'd be very few lawyers in state's attorney's office who are prepared

372
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:05,660
to handle a case like this. Because of the complexities of the science, because of the

373
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:11,580
understanding, understanding where the plaintiffs, you know, where their weaknesses are, why is that?

374
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:19,900
Is the science part of it? Oh, it's both. I mean, and it's, they were claiming psychological

375
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:27,180
injuries. You know, a few of them, oh, well, my roof was injured by a hailstorm and a barn on

376
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:34,140
the neighboring property burned down from a fire and the stream dried up. And I couldn't fish in

377
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:39,900
the stream. And, you know, these were psychological injuries. But a lot of it was pre traumatic

378
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,740
stress syndrome, you know, the Greta Thunberg, we have no future, all of this kind of thing. So

379
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:55,020
they're very deeply depressed. So I mean, the kids have been fed this insane rhetoric, the rhetoric

380
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,180
targeted at kids and young adults is even worse than what we see, you know, as extinction, rebellion,

381
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:08,860
all that kind of stuff. So, you know, they just don't have the critical faculties at this point

382
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:16,380
to evaluate it. And a lot of them are depressed and upset, whatever. But, you know, we blame that on

383
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:23,100
the education system, on the advocacy groups. I mean, if they were worried about the psychological

384
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:29,020
injuries of the kids, they should have been suing extinction rebellion and Greta Thunberg and the

385
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:35,660
National Education Association, which is sort of feeding them all this stuff. But their real agenda

386
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:45,260
is just to go after the fossil fuel companies. And using kids as a prop. So it's a, you know,

387
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:52,380
it's a case that made no sense. It's a legal decision that made no sense. But like, it's not

388
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:59,820
the first thing that makes no sense and all this. So, you know, that this is really, I'm sure our

389
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:06,620
children's trust the swimming and donations after this little victory, so they can go on and keep suing

390
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:13,900
everybody. I'm looking at there, I'm looking at one of the rundowns here that they've been,

391
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:20,460
one of their funders is the Rockefeller Brothers, which is a, I don't know, there's some oil. Yeah,

392
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:26,940
okay. Well, the air to the Getty fortune is funding extinction rebellion.

393
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:35,100
You know, you've got all of these oil company fortunes now funding all this craziness, go figure.

394
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:43,100
I want to reach back to you said that there is a lot of anti-capitalist rhetoric in this,

395
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:49,900
in these discussions. Talk about that, because I believe I think you're right. And some of these

396
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:55,020
activists have been very clear about that, right, that capitalism is the problem that's driving

397
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,060
climate change. And therefore, we need some kind of Maoism or socialism or something that would

398
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:06,140
replace it and have some kind of authoritarian system. I was the only thing I can imagine would

399
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,580
be or the thing that would replace it. But talk about why, how do you see that? How do you see

400
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,980
this? And why do you say that it's an anti-capitalist movement? Well, okay, well, if you look at

401
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:23,500
the UN environmental program, which is, you know, really behind a lot of this UN stuff,

402
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,980
and you read what they write, and it comes through loud and clear, and not just anti-capitalist,

403
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:34,300
but anti-democratic, we can't trust the people or the countries to make the right decisions. So

404
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:41,100
there needs to be, you know, more coercion from the top down at the international level from the

405
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:48,140
UN. So it's a grab for power. So there's a lot of power grabbing in this, and capitalism and

406
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:54,540
democracy is inherently against, you know, centralized power. So,

407
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:02,620
yeah, there are people who've written a lot about this, but the solution is somehow more

408
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:08,460
coercion, more authoritarianism from presumably the smart people over the dumb people, right,

409
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,500
that they're going to be the ones that are going to make the decisions for us.

410
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,820
Yeah, well, President Biden is talking about declaring a climate emergency,

411
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:22,140
which would take, and it would be a long-term emergency. I mean, emergencies are for, you

412
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:28,540
know, something going on two weeks or a month or a year, but not for something that's, you know,

413
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:34,380
decades. So that would, you know, force people to do this, force people not to do this, that would

414
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,940
take away a lot of freedoms if he declares the climate emergency. And, you know, so there's a

415
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:46,060
lot of power grabbing going on in the name of this issue. How do you describe your politics, Judy?

416
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:53,660
Well, when I go to a ballot, I'm looking for the not, you know, a voter's ballot. I'm looking for

417
00:39:53,660 --> 00:40:02,060
the none of the above box to check. Okay, that's my point. I'm not a Republican. I'm not a Democrat.

418
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,580
I'm disgusted, and I am disgusted, but I don't see a disgusted party. So...

419
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:15,740
Okay, yeah, I'm an independent with a libertarian streak. When I am totally disgusted with the

420
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:22,620
Republican and Democratic candidates, I'll vote libertarian by default, but I haven't had any great

421
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:29,740
enthusiasm for any of their recent candidates. But, you know, I'm hoping no party or whatever,

422
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:36,700
something can come up with something different, because, you know, another Trump Biden election,

423
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:43,020
you know, the whole country, you know, will just be tearing their hair out. So, yeah,

424
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:50,220
so I'm an independent. I'm a none of the above. I like to think things through and listen to both

425
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:57,740
sides. And, you know, a lot of these issues are just not simple, and there's clashes of values.

426
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,980
So, you know, I like the discussion. I like the debate. So I don't pledge allegiance to anybody

427
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:10,540
or either side, that's for sure. I'm going to go back, jump back to the just stop oil crowd and

428
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:15,020
the, you know, the climate rebellion people or whatever the extinction rebellion people,

429
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:21,260
because I find some of these people who are throwing the soup cans and blocking the traffic and the

430
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:29,740
rest of it. One, for their punishment, I want them to go and live in rural Kenya without any

431
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:35,420
hydrocarbons and be forced to stay there for two years and just tell us, you know, report back. And

432
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:41,020
maybe this has changed your mind. That's my idea for punishment. You can't use any modern energy

433
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:46,140
sources, sorry, none, zero, and then see how you like it. But I also find it somewhat depressing

434
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:53,580
when I look at them and how they feel the victim. So they feel so aggrieved. I mean, there's something

435
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,380
there's something deeply disgusting about it, right? Because I think I see them also as just

436
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,820
completely spoiled and uneducated about the world around them. But there's something pathetic about

437
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:09,980
them. Does that ring true to you? And I'm just kind of riffing here, but I see something very

438
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,580
deeply sad in the way they act.

439
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:23,980
Well, it's part it's a part of the broader victim culture and identity politics, you know, it's

440
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:32,540
the need to culture victim culture, right? Yeah, that whole thing. So it's it's it's a tribal thing.

441
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:39,500
And the held lawsuit is part of this, right, that this is an identity, right? This is an identity of

442
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,940
we've been agreed, we've been wronged, and we're going to seek redress for this, this this affront

443
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:51,100
to us in our, our, then they have somebody in authority who's going to pay the bills for them

444
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:59,740
to go out and throw, you know, cans of tomato soup. You know, it seems like win win, you know, it

445
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:08,780
they think they're saving the world. They're part of a tribe. And somebody's paying them and

446
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,420
encourage, you know, somebody in authority who's paying them and encourage them to do this. So

447
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:19,900
it's, you know, I think all of those things are contributing. But it is very sad that these kids

448
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,740
aren't doing something better with their time, more, more productive, you know, getting educated

449
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:33,820
and getting jobs. And this is personal for you. You're a grandmother. Am I right? Oh, I'm a grandmother

450
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:41,580
for sure. How many, how many grandchildren? Well, I have one grandchild and then five step

451
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:47,260
grandchildren. So we've got a nice crew and they're all of junior high and high school age.

452
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:54,300
And you talk about these kind of political issues within? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And they, and they

453
00:43:54,300 --> 00:44:01,580
think, you know, I'm cool. I'm a little bit subversive. You know, that's good. Let's see what the real

454
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:09,980
truth is. So that they seem to all have healthy attitudes, you know, about the situation. And

455
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:16,540
my granddaughter, who lives in Reno, you know, close to where I live, she's very rational. She

456
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:22,380
says, Well, I just really need to learn more about this whole issue. You know, I just, I don't think

457
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,180
I should have a big opinion about this right now, because I just really need to learn more about this

458
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:34,220
issue. You go girl. Yeah. So let me ask you about, we just have a few more minutes. And again,

459
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,260
my guest is Judith Curry. She's the author of this new book, Climate Uncertainty and Risk,

460
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:44,220
Rethinking Our Response. By the paperback, it's much cheaper than the hardback. It's out by

461
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:50,540
Anthem Press. It came out in June. I'm going to ask you about the ending of that in just a minute.

462
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:58,620
But you have your own website, judithcurry.com and climate, et cetera. So you have your own

463
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,780
media outlet. I'm just curious. Can you give me an idea how many visitors you get there? Because

464
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:08,460
I'm increasingly convinced unless you own your own media outlet, you're not assured of a free press.

465
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,460
You know, I haven't joined Substack or anything else where I might get traffic. When I first

466
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:22,380
started the blog, it had huge traffic. I get less traffic these days. I think on a big day,

467
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:29,660
I might get 10,000 visitors. You know, it's and if something gets picked up.

468
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,980
But that's still a respectable number. It's a respectable number. And you know,

469
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:43,340
I'm not actually looking for influence. I'm just looking to engage in, you know,

470
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,180
in the dialogue and to set up a space where people from across the spectrum can come here

471
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:55,420
and discuss. And I also host a number of very interesting, intelligent people as guest

472
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:03,500
authors. And it's even spawned a few books, three books, in fact, you know, that have grown out

473
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:11,100
from posts on my blog. Yeah. And so, you know, I'm very happy with the blog, even though it's,

474
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:18,540
you know, not high traffic. And in all honesty, I think my lab that there was a three week period

475
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:24,460
when I didn't even post something, you know, so it's not like I'm posting four times a day and

476
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:31,660
really trying to build trap. You know, it's just my personal record of what I'm thinking about and

477
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:38,460
what I'm investigating. And it really seeded my book. I started the blog in 2010 with a series on

478
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:45,740
climate science and the uncertainty monster, which was a major theme in my book. So this blog in many

479
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:51,740
ways documented my journey in writing the book. It's an interesting way to think about it because

480
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:56,780
I'm talking with other writers and, you know, I've written six books and I don't think I have

481
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:01,340
another one in them, but that they view the their substack or even their Twitter or other places

482
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:05,740
of way that they catalog what they know, and then they come come back and use it as a resource.

483
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,860
So I want to we're going to close here in just a few minutes because I know you're on a tight

484
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,100
schedule and so am I. But at the end of the book, you have a section called toward post apocalyptic

485
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:17,500
climate policies. And you quote the economist Richard toll, who is an interesting character,

486
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:23,180
I've met him once, he said, politically correct climate change orthodoxy has completely destroyed

487
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:29,180
our ability to think rationally about the environment. I touched on this before, but I like

488
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:33,580
that because it speaks to the issues of land use, which I've been reporting on for a very long time.

489
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:39,500
And met many people in rural America in the course of my travels in Michigan and Wisconsin and all

490
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,420
over the world that you're fighting these encroachment of these wind and solar projects.

491
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:49,500
But it seems that that to me is the concrete example of this clouded ability to think about

492
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:55,180
the environment that this climatism has trumping all of these other concerns. I don't know.

493
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,860
Your book is in some ways kind of a technical book, but you also have these quotes that are

494
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:07,420
really great in each section. So you really, that was the most fun part of the book was

495
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,900
I think, you know, selecting quotes and figuring out where to place them. I mean, it was,

496
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:21,900
it was, I spent an awful lot of time doing it, but it was the most fun part really of writing the

497
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:29,420
book. Well, I enjoyed it as well because you have a, somebody, go ahead. From Dirty Harry and May

498
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:36,860
West, you know, Bruce Lee, you know, popular culture figures, along with philosophers and

499
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:44,140
scientists and things like that. So, but it breaks up the kind of, it made it less of a

500
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,940
technical way. That gave it some leavening, some, some breathing room, I guess I would say, right?

501
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:53,580
Because you have a lot of technical things that heavily footnoted and footnoted and the way you

502
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:58,540
structured it in some ways is more textbook-like. And you said that the publisher is targeting

503
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:04,620
universities and academic outlets or academic buyers, but I found that part to be good. So

504
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:10,540
let me read this one section here and then we're going to wrap up. This is in your concluding section,

505
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,500
you say, we need to open up space for dissent, disagreement and discussion about scientific

506
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:20,780
uncertainty and policy options so that multiple perspectives can be considered and broader support

507
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:26,860
can be built for a range of policy options. Wicked scientists are willing to become embroiled in

508
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:32,140
political debates and thorny social problems. To be effective, we need to break the hegemony of

509
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:36,940
disciplinary researchers, disciplinary researchers, particularly for those who are

510
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:42,540
strident political activists as being regarded as experts for solutions to the wicked problem of

511
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:48,620
climate change. I couldn't agree with that more. I thought that was a really good summary of, I

512
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:53,820
think of what your, your point is, we need, we need more robust debate about the best path forward.

513
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,180
And my thing has always been natural gas and nuclear. If we're serious about this, these are

514
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:03,260
low carbon scalable, you know, but they're just the lack of policy debate about what the way forward

515
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:08,780
to me is very, a very dangerous one. So I commend you on the book. I thought, you know, it's really

516
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:14,940
obviously an enormous amount of effort. So I have to, I wanted to draw part of our discussion to an

517
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,580
end there because I thought that was very well stated. So thank you for that. Last two questions.

518
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:23,180
And you know, I asked these and I asked you these before. So what are you reading? What's on the,

519
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:28,220
yeah, I know you're busy with climate forecast actions, climate forecast applications network,

520
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,460
your business, but I know you must be an avid reader. So what's on your bookshelf? What are you

521
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:38,780
reading on these? What's the top of the pile? Oh, gosh, I wish I could remember the name of this

522
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:46,540
book, but it's a book by Andy West. It's in the grip of culture. It's about the social psychology

523
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:53,580
of climate catastrophism, you know, the Greta phenomenon or whatever. And this is another

524
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:59,020
like scholarly book, but it's very readable. In the grip of culture, it's called? Yeah,

525
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:07,260
in the grip of culture. Okay. I think and it's about the social psychology of climate catastrophism.

526
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:15,500
I see. Something like that. So that's like, I highly recommend that. I think that's the main

527
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,980
one I want to recommend at this point. Okay. Last question, what gives you hope?

528
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:33,580
What gives me hope? Well, that people can be rational. And I think that we are. And I think

529
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:40,380
this in the grip of culture book explains a lot. And, you know, we just need to get out of that.

530
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:46,860
And I'm also, I mean, at some point, the weather is going to turn a little bit more favorable.

531
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:53,500
We've been in a bad place since 2017. You know, the natural climate oscillations will shift at

532
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:59,740
some point, five years, 10 years into a more favorable state. And hopefully people will calm down.

533
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:07,980
And about this problem, I think that the apocalyptic rhetoric people are realizing that

534
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,460
they've gone too far. I mean, having a whole generation of kids who are depressed and too

535
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:17,660
scared to do anything isn't going to help the movement. So they have to figure out how to

536
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:26,380
make their message a little bit more hopeful, and not just destroy the psyches of all these kids.

537
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:37,580
So hopefully the catastrophic rhetoric will came down. But, you know, at the end of the day,

538
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:44,380
things that don't make sense aren't going to have a long lifetime. They can cause us a lot of money,

539
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:52,060
cause us a lot of pain. But at the end of the day, you know, sense and economics will prevail.

540
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,140
But we're certainly not there right now.

541
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,940
Well, that's a good place to stop. So that's where we will, in fact, stop. My guest has been

542
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:05,820
Judith Curry. She's the author of a new book called Climate Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking

543
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:11,260
Our Response. You can find it, I'm sure, on all the major book selling outlets. She's on Twitter

544
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:17,180
at CurryJA, and you can find her on the web at JudithCurry.com. Judith, thanks a million for

545
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:23,260
coming back on The Power Hungry Podcast. A very interesting book and, you know, I applaud you

546
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:27,820
for your efforts at trying to open up the debate. And with this, if these are the most important

547
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:32,380
issues of our time, and I think they are important issues, let's have a debate about it. Let's talk

548
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,980
about it. Let's examine it. And your work, I think, is helping that effort. So good on you.

549
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:41,340
Okay, great. Thanks. It was great to talk to you again.

550
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:46,540
Okay, so thank you, Judy. And thanks to all of you out there in Podcast Land.

551
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,860
To the next episode of The Power Hungry Podcast, it might be as good as this one,

552
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:56,060
we will find out. But if you have a chance, also give us a good rating on those podcast outlets

553
00:53:56,060 --> 00:54:05,580
wherever you can give us 4, 5, 6, 12 stars, whatever it is. And until next time, see you.
