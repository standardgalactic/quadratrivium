00:00.000 --> 00:06.600
Hi everyone, welcome to the Power Hungry podcast.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.480
I'm Robert Brice on this podcast.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.880
We talk about energy, power, innovation, and politics, and I'm pleased to welcome back

00:11.880 --> 00:13.520
for the third time.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.880
That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the third time, Dr. Judith Curry.

00:16.880 --> 00:22.320
She is the author of a new book called Climate Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking Our Response.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.760
Judy, welcome back to the Power Hungry podcast.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.120
Well, thank you.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.600
I'm delighted to join you again.

00:28.600 --> 00:33.480
So your book has been out now a couple of months, and it's called, as I said, Climate

00:33.480 --> 00:37.720
Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking Our Response.

00:37.720 --> 00:41.480
You've been on the podcast before, but guests on this podcast, I think you remember, introduced

00:41.480 --> 00:42.480
themselves.

00:42.480 --> 00:46.200
So you've been on here once, but imagine you've got 30, 60 seconds, you've walked into a room,

00:46.200 --> 00:47.200
you don't know anyone.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.200
Introduce yourself, please.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.200
Okay.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.200
I'm Judith Curry.

00:50.200 --> 00:56.160
I spent most of my career in academia, most recently at the Georgia Institute of Technology,

00:56.160 --> 01:01.120
where I was chair of school of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences for 13 years.

01:01.120 --> 01:05.560
I'm currently president of Climate Forecast Applications Network.

01:05.560 --> 01:13.240
I'm proprietor of the blog Climate Etc. at JudithCurry.com and author of a new book,

01:13.240 --> 01:15.840
Climate Uncertainty and Risk.

01:15.840 --> 01:16.840
Very succinct.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.280
Well done, Attagirl.

01:19.280 --> 01:23.360
And you're also on Twitter, so we get this out of the way, at CurryJA.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.360
At CurryJA.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.560
Okay.

01:25.560 --> 01:31.200
Well, I'm going to just tell me, you know, I've been reading your book, give me your

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
pitch.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.200
What is this new book about?

01:33.200 --> 01:37.720
We've talked before on the podcast, we've talked about climate science, media, et cetera.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.440
What is this book and what do you hope to achieve with it?

01:42.440 --> 01:48.320
Well the whole climate science issue and the policy response has been squeezed into this

01:48.320 --> 01:53.960
little tiny box, you know, with everybody bouncing around inside the box dotting eyes

01:53.960 --> 01:58.480
and crossing T's and threatening anybody who tries to go outside the box.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.240
Well, I blow the lid off the box.

02:01.240 --> 02:07.280
I look at all the other stuff that people, the inconvenient things that people are trying

02:07.280 --> 02:08.840
to shove under the rug.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.240
I look at the uncertainties.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.640
I look at the controversies.

02:11.640 --> 02:17.600
I look at why we disagree, both in the science and the policy response.

02:17.600 --> 02:25.000
I talk about, you know, how politics of this has really torqued this in a very unfortunate

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
way.

02:26.000 --> 02:34.440
I talk, the middle part of the book, I look at, speculate about what we can expect in

02:34.440 --> 02:37.280
the 21st century in terms of climate.

02:37.280 --> 02:43.680
I mean, the climate models are deeply flawed in terms of giving us a reliable perspective

02:43.680 --> 02:44.680
on this.

02:44.680 --> 02:50.200
I speculate, you know, on a whole range of possible outcomes, including plausible worst

02:50.200 --> 02:51.880
cases.

02:51.880 --> 02:57.360
And the third part of the book is the most important one really, it's risk and response.

02:57.360 --> 03:05.400
And this is where I talk about how we've fundamentally mischaracterized climate risk and how we've

03:05.400 --> 03:08.960
fundamentally mismanaged our response.

03:08.960 --> 03:16.960
And I use principles from a variety of risk science disciplines to put together a menu

03:16.960 --> 03:22.760
of some other approaches that we can take that make more sense when you're dealing with

03:22.760 --> 03:31.720
a very complex, deeply uncertain problem with conflicts of values and political disagreements

03:31.720 --> 03:33.440
in play.

03:33.440 --> 03:43.320
So, you know, it's a very different approach, and it's a very integrated approach to this

03:43.320 --> 03:49.560
very wicked problem that I think can lead us on a path to doing sensible things and

03:49.560 --> 03:57.640
setting our path towards a prosperous and safe 21st century.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.640
That's a good summary.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.140
Thank you.

04:00.540 --> 04:04.700
Looking at the book, though, and as I've been going through it, and I don't mean this

04:04.700 --> 04:07.020
as a slam, but we talked about it right before we started recording.

04:07.020 --> 04:11.820
You said this was written or published by an academic press, Anthem Press, and it's heavily

04:11.820 --> 04:12.820
footnoted.

04:12.820 --> 04:14.820
And I got to say, I love me some footnotes, right?

04:14.820 --> 04:17.140
I have footnote all my books.

04:17.140 --> 04:19.580
It's a laborious process.

04:19.580 --> 04:22.500
So well, this is a kind of a geeky question.

04:22.500 --> 04:27.340
I could tally them all up here, but about how many footnotes are in this book?

04:27.340 --> 04:28.340
Roughly.

04:28.340 --> 04:29.340
About 1500.

04:29.540 --> 04:33.500
1500 in 239 pages.

04:33.500 --> 04:40.060
So you have your references here, which I think you made clear.

04:40.060 --> 04:42.100
You wanted to publish this book before we started.

04:42.100 --> 04:46.540
You said you wanted it published by an academic press, that it was peer reviewed, and everything

04:46.540 --> 04:51.060
here you've stated is all fully cited.

04:51.060 --> 04:55.780
But still, I mean, the fundamental issue that, and we've talked about this before, is that

04:55.820 --> 05:01.860
we're seeing this lack of robust debate, or even any debate, really, and that most recently

05:01.860 --> 05:08.700
John Clouser, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in just in June and August, had a speech,

05:08.700 --> 05:13.180
a presentation to the International Monetary Fund that he was canceled because he's not

05:13.180 --> 05:17.540
towing the line on the catastrophist orthodoxy.

05:17.540 --> 05:23.660
If I can use that phrase, I mean, it seems rather than getting better, rather than the

05:23.660 --> 05:29.300
debate getting slightly more open, it's getting even yet more constrained, or is that fair?

05:29.300 --> 05:30.300
How have things changed?

05:30.300 --> 05:31.300
Oh, that's correct.

05:31.300 --> 05:35.420
I mean, we'll go back to the little box again.

05:35.420 --> 05:41.580
And the reason it's all been shoved into a box, everybody has to agree, because the

05:41.580 --> 05:48.180
oversimplified analysis that our brilliant policymakers have made is that we need global

05:48.260 --> 05:51.700
collective action on this problem.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.300
And in order to get there, everybody has to agree.

05:55.540 --> 06:03.140
So, you know, so there's huge motivation with that framing of the problem to nuke anybody

06:03.140 --> 06:04.140
who disagrees.

06:06.260 --> 06:09.060
I just want to make sure you said oversimplified analysis.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.580
Is that is that what you the phrase?

06:11.380 --> 06:15.020
Right. So we have to nuke anyone who disagrees.

06:15.420 --> 06:22.060
But that I think that seems to be the right right description as well, that there we will

06:22.060 --> 06:23.700
not brook dissent, right?

06:23.700 --> 06:28.140
But is that so you've talked about this in academic terms, because that's where you

06:28.140 --> 06:28.940
come from this.

06:28.940 --> 06:33.500
And I come at it from as a more, I would say just a more general reporter approach.

06:34.380 --> 06:37.740
But if I were to say, well, what's driving this, I would say it's money, right?

06:37.740 --> 06:43.100
That there is a lot of money at stake here for various subsidies under the Inflation

06:43.100 --> 06:46.700
Reduction Act. This is one of the big drivers, of course, of the renewable energy rollout,

06:46.700 --> 06:50.460
right? There are massive subsidies for wind and solar at hand.

06:50.460 --> 06:53.660
So there must not be any controversy about this.

06:53.660 --> 06:59.660
Otherwise, the sub that you stop the flow of the money is that an oversimplified analysis?

06:59.660 --> 07:01.500
It's an oversimplified analysis.

07:01.500 --> 07:06.940
I think we have to go back to the 1980s and the UN environmental program.

07:07.420 --> 07:13.340
There was a big drive for non-governmental world control through health, environment,

07:13.340 --> 07:17.900
and all these issues, and they keyed on climate change is the issue to get us there.

07:18.620 --> 07:24.860
And we had a climate change treaty in 1992, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

07:24.860 --> 07:29.100
This was before the temperature even started warming in a significant way,

07:29.100 --> 07:32.620
and the US even signed on to that treaty.

07:32.620 --> 07:39.740
So from the very beginning, you've had the policy card way out in front of the scientific horse.

07:39.740 --> 07:45.980
And this is a UN agenda. It's degrowth. It's anti-capitalism. It's anti-democratic.

07:46.620 --> 07:50.700
And in order to enforce this, they amp up the alarm.

07:51.260 --> 07:56.780
I mean, the worst rhetoric, I mean, apart from extinction, rebellion, or something like that,

07:56.780 --> 08:04.940
comes from you and officials, global boiling, code red, all of this kind of stuff over a slow creep

08:05.660 --> 08:11.660
of warming. And the agenda is to kill off the fossil fuel industry. They don't like that.

08:11.660 --> 08:18.380
They don't like nuclear either. So this is a real, it's a clash of values.

08:18.380 --> 08:24.860
And there was a recent survey of university climate scientists, and they asked them a

08:24.940 --> 08:32.780
bunch of questions. And a majority of them were in favor of degrowth, not green growth,

08:33.500 --> 08:39.340
but degrowth. Okay, so you can see the perspectives of these people. I mean, it's not necessarily

08:39.340 --> 08:44.300
about money. There is certainly an element of, you know, follow the money and all this.

08:44.860 --> 08:49.660
But there's a whole worldview and an ideology behind all this.

08:50.220 --> 08:57.420
That's interesting. I guess, so maybe what, I mean, in your reply, I'm not going to argue with it at all.

08:58.460 --> 09:03.100
That is more on the science kind of policy side. I guess what my point about the money and the

09:03.100 --> 09:07.260
subsidies is on the deployment side, right? On the amount of money that's available for the

09:07.260 --> 09:12.380
mitigation side, right? Which was where there's staggering numbers, now hundreds of billions

09:12.380 --> 09:16.540
of dollars, whether it's electric vehicles or solar or wind or hydrogen or carbon capture.

09:16.540 --> 09:21.340
I mean, it's just a staggering amount of money. I think it's the biggest corporate giveaway in

09:21.340 --> 09:27.020
American history, and there's no second place here. But your points are more on the policy side

09:27.020 --> 09:32.540
about this ideology that's driving this alarmism, I guess, to put it, is that a fair way to

09:32.540 --> 09:38.140
characterize it? Yes, yes. Oh, there's definitely money in play. And, you know, Warren Buffett

09:38.140 --> 09:44.220
was very cynical. I mean, he was an early investor in wind power. Sure. He liked wind power, but

09:44.220 --> 09:48.220
he saw it with all these subsidies and whatever, I'm going to make money. He's no dummy.

09:49.340 --> 09:53.100
The only reason to build wind turbines is to collect the tax credits, right? He said that

09:53.100 --> 10:00.140
very clearly, right? That was his famous line. Okay, well, so I live in Texas, and let me tell

10:00.140 --> 10:05.580
you, it feels a little apocalyptic. And let me just tell my climate, what is my view on climate

10:05.580 --> 10:09.740
change? Climate change is a concern. And I think it rhymes with what your book says. Climate change

10:09.740 --> 10:15.260
is a concern. It's not our only concern. So not that I don't favor action on climate change,

10:15.260 --> 10:19.900
is that it's a concern, but we have to balance our action on that against other concerns. And I

10:19.900 --> 10:25.100
think if I were to boil down what I see in your book, you're saying something somewhat similar,

10:25.100 --> 10:30.220
and I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. But it's been stinking hot here in Texas this summer,

10:30.220 --> 10:35.420
Judy. I mean, it's just been, and I'm used to the heat. I lived in Texas, I'm from Oklahoma.

10:35.420 --> 10:42.300
Okay, so here's the question. Is it possible that the Hunga Tonga volcano eruption in January 2022

10:42.940 --> 10:46.460
is in part responsible for the weather or this hot weather that we're seeing now?

10:47.500 --> 10:52.940
Okay, first off, Texas is an anomaly. If you look at the average temperatures over the summer so far

10:52.940 --> 10:57.740
for the US, we're slightly below normal. I mean, you look at the set. I have to move then is what

10:57.740 --> 11:07.180
you're saying. The US has been cool. So you know, Texas is just bad luck. I did my latest blog post

11:07.180 --> 11:15.180
that's up, looks at what is causing all this more on a global level. And it looks Hunga Tonga,

11:15.180 --> 11:21.740
and it looks at the ship fuels, and it looks like the long wave and the radiation budget at the top

11:21.740 --> 11:26.220
of the atmosphere, it looks at the surface energy balance, it looks at the internal modes of climate

11:26.300 --> 11:32.700
variability. It's a very comprehensive discussion of what's going on. To get back to Hunga Tonga,

11:34.060 --> 11:42.460
Hunga Tonga usually volcanoes spew particulates into the atmosphere, which in the stratosphere,

11:42.460 --> 11:49.020
and that has a cooling effect. Well, Hunga Tonga spewed only a little bit of sulfate and a substantial

11:49.020 --> 11:55.420
amount of water vapor into the stratosphere. So right now in the summer hemisphere, it looks

11:55.500 --> 12:02.700
like the effects of Hunga Tonga on the radiation balance are canceling out, you know, the long

12:02.700 --> 12:07.260
wave and the short wave are canceling out. But if you go to the winter hemisphere, the southern

12:07.260 --> 12:13.100
hemisphere, we are seeing the effects of Hunga Tonga because the long wave infrared effects are

12:13.100 --> 12:20.700
dominating. And you see it in a, this is part of the circulation pattern that's giving us an early

12:20.700 --> 12:29.740
ozone hole and is giving us the low extent of the Antarctic sea ice this winter. So Hunga Tonga,

12:30.620 --> 12:35.180
and we may see a bigger effect of Hunga Tonga in the northern hemisphere during our winter.

12:35.900 --> 12:39.980
So that, but if you're interested in that, you know, check out my blog, judithcurry.com,

12:39.980 --> 12:46.220
I've got a whole long post on all this. I see. Well, I just found it. It was posted August 14.

12:46.220 --> 12:51.180
I was looking at your other blog post. It's with Jim Johnstone and Mark Jelenek, I guess,

12:51.180 --> 12:55.340
is that that's the one you're talking about? Right. Yeah. Okay. I didn't have time to look at that

12:55.340 --> 13:01.260
one. I was also looking at the post you did on the hell versus Montana lawsuit, which I want to

13:01.260 --> 13:07.820
talk about as well. Okay. So I just want to read back. So you're saying I can't blame the hot weather

13:07.820 --> 13:15.980
in Texas on Hunga Tonga. No, it's unfortunate circulation patterns. Okay. So well, and that's,

13:16.140 --> 13:22.220
but isn't, I guess, me even asking this question, as I say it, am I, this is part of the issue,

13:22.220 --> 13:26.380
right? Well, why can't we blame this on that? Isn't this, of course, to be due to that, that

13:26.380 --> 13:31.820
there's, like everybody else, I'm like, well, tell me the cause, right? Or is this, you know,

13:31.820 --> 13:35.740
and the Bill McKibbins of the world will gladly say, Oh, well, see, there you go.

13:36.380 --> 13:40.860
You know, you guys in Texas, or in fact, Mark Goodell and the pages of the New York Times,

13:40.860 --> 13:47.900
kind of, he said, in fact, in his piece, that this is, oh, this is like, you're getting payback.

13:47.900 --> 13:53.100
Now, this is you're getting Texas is getting paid back for being a bad guy, right? That this is

13:53.100 --> 13:59.260
like, this is the cause. Is this, is this part of the whole problem? Well, okay, here's the issue.

13:59.260 --> 14:08.300
We're talking about a very complex, chaotic nonlinear system. And not only do we have a

14:08.380 --> 14:14.380
chaotic atmosphere, it's coupled to a chaotic ocean. And it's subject to

14:16.380 --> 14:23.100
changes in external forcing. And the mathematicians, you know, call this

14:23.100 --> 14:28.540
pandemonium, it's even beyond chaos. And trying to unravel causes and effects

14:30.620 --> 14:37.500
is, you know, not impossible, but it's not simple. You know, you can't do this by waving your arms.

14:38.060 --> 14:45.740
Like the analysis in my blog, you know, it unravels a lot of things. And it gives you a sense of how

14:45.740 --> 14:53.340
difficult it is to attribute any specific things to any specific forcing. It's very challenging.

14:54.540 --> 15:00.300
Well, okay, so fair enough. And you have 17 figures in this, in this posting here.

15:01.180 --> 15:08.780
But I guess maybe I'm, my, my desire for that simple solution is reflective of this kind of

15:08.780 --> 15:15.740
broader societal design. Well, of course, this means that, and therefore, we have broad terms,

15:15.740 --> 15:23.420
the way I see a lot of the climate apocalyptic analysis, we've sinned, now we're suffering,

15:23.420 --> 15:27.180
and we're going to pay the price. And therefore, we have to repent, right? That this is,

15:27.180 --> 15:32.140
there's a lot of kind of Christian echoes of what, you know, sin and redemption here, right? And

15:32.140 --> 15:35.020
is that part of the narrative as well, that why this narrative is so strong?

15:35.900 --> 15:41.420
This is the policymakers back in the 1990s, wanting a simple cause and effect and a simple fix.

15:42.140 --> 15:49.260
And it was also the hubris that they can control the climate by, you know, eliminating fossil fuels.

15:49.260 --> 16:00.140
So it's looking for a simple solution and just a total lack of humility and thinking that we can

16:01.100 --> 16:08.220
actually control this. So, you know, it's just, you know, human failing. It's not surprising.

16:08.220 --> 16:13.420
That's why we have scientists to sort all this out. But when the scientists become political

16:13.420 --> 16:19.500
activists and become active in trying to cancel anyone who disagrees with them,

16:20.300 --> 16:25.660
then the whole thing falls apart. And we end up with nonsense, like we're currently facing.

16:26.700 --> 16:33.900
And when you say the nonsense, we're currently facing, so, okay, force rank the nonsense for me,

16:33.900 --> 16:39.100
if you would, then if we're looking at policy responses to climate change, and we've heard

16:39.180 --> 16:43.820
repeatedly from the Biden administration, this is our main concern, right? And, you know,

16:43.820 --> 16:48.940
the president, in fact, at a League of Conservation Voters meeting at a high dollar fundraiser,

16:48.940 --> 16:53.740
I wrote about this on my substack, bragged about the fact that the Export-Import Bank of the United

16:53.740 --> 17:00.620
States was giving a $900 million loan to build a solar project in Angola. Never mind that 60%

17:00.620 --> 17:04.060
of the people who live in Angola don't even have electricity and we're building them a coal,

17:04.060 --> 17:08.220
a solar plant, not a coal plant, not a gas-fired power plant, even though Angola has

17:08.220 --> 17:13.900
all kinds of natural gas. Okay, all this nonsense. So, force rank the nonsense. If you look at this

17:13.900 --> 17:19.340
survey of what our responses, our policy responses have been, what's the silliest of the silly?

17:20.700 --> 17:25.900
Well, this rapid rush to wind and solar, I mean, that's the silliest of the silly. I mean, you know,

17:27.260 --> 17:33.500
I think it makes sense to think, to look forward, you know, into the 21st century and figure out how

17:33.500 --> 17:42.460
we can, you know, improve our energy infrastructure so that we have, you know, more abundant, cheaper,

17:43.580 --> 17:48.860
cleaner energy and let's look forward and try to get there. I mean, that's just going to help

17:48.860 --> 17:54.540
support our progress in the 21st century. That's going to require research and development and

17:54.540 --> 18:01.580
learning curves and different localities and countries experimenting and, you know, at the,

18:01.580 --> 18:09.340
by the end of the 21st century, if the market was left to, you know, take care of all this,

18:09.340 --> 18:14.460
we'd probably have a much better, cleaner energy infrastructure. But now that we're,

18:16.300 --> 18:21.420
you know, tearing what we have down and replacing it with wind and solar, which is totally inadequate,

18:21.420 --> 18:27.180
I know I'm preaching to the choir here, we're setting ourselves up to make ourselves more

18:27.180 --> 18:34.380
vulnerable to whatever weather or climate extremes nature might throw at us. I mean,

18:35.180 --> 18:42.220
electricity helps keep us safe, you know, with desalination plants and air conditioning and on

18:42.220 --> 18:50.540
and on it goes. And it's also electricity is the source of our, you know, innovations across

18:50.620 --> 18:57.020
everything. So I mean, what we're doing is extremely stupid and we've got politicians in

18:57.020 --> 19:02.300
charge of all this wind and solar stuff and nobody's talking to the engineers, you know,

19:02.300 --> 19:07.580
people who, who design transmission lines, the grid operators, you know, they're all sort of

19:07.580 --> 19:13.420
tearing their hair out over all this wind and solar. So what we're doing is just plain stupid.

19:13.420 --> 19:18.780
And if we continue on this path, we're going to end up in a worse place at the end of the 21st

19:18.780 --> 19:26.460
century than if we had just let market forces and our desire for innovation just to take charge

19:26.460 --> 19:33.660
and move forward. So it's just a very bad place to be. Well, you are preaching to the choir,

19:33.660 --> 19:41.100
but amen, sister, keep going. Hallelujah. Past the collection plate. I'd boil that down,

19:41.660 --> 19:47.740
how I distill this is if, if, if we're facing more extreme weather, it's the height of foolishness

19:47.740 --> 19:51.660
or the depth of foolishness to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather.

19:51.660 --> 19:58.220
I mean, we need weather, we need weather resilient systems, not weather dependent systems. And yet

19:58.220 --> 20:03.340
that is in fact what we're doing. And just in the last few days here in Texas has been insanely hot

20:03.340 --> 20:08.060
and the wind is going and the wind doesn't blow when it's really hot. And so there's been a, you

20:08.060 --> 20:12.700
know, wind energy, we have a huge fleet of wind energy turbines. And yet they're only producing

20:12.780 --> 20:18.700
at single digit percentage outputs during times of peak demand. So anyway, I just had to had to

20:18.700 --> 20:24.300
throw that in there. Okay, so let's talk about censorship because you also know a little bit

20:24.300 --> 20:30.380
about this. We talked, I think the last time you were on the podcast, which was in December of 2022,

20:31.260 --> 20:37.260
that in on Twitter, you, you were very pleased that Elon Musk had Elon Musk took over Twitter

20:37.260 --> 20:41.420
because suddenly you got more traction there, you weren't being throttled, your content wasn't

20:41.420 --> 20:45.260
being throttled. Is that still the case now? Do you, have you gotten more followers on Twitter?

20:45.260 --> 20:49.900
Tell me about how you see what's going on just on that platform. And then we'll talk about other

20:49.900 --> 20:58.060
things. Okay, just from my perspective, Twitter's going along great. I know a lot of people don't

20:58.060 --> 21:06.060
like it. Well, they don't like, you know, the climate scientists don't want to have the rabble

21:07.020 --> 21:12.460
questioning them. And they don't like that. And a lot of them are leaving Twitter. Also,

21:15.180 --> 21:21.420
Elon has made a couple of changes to the functionality treat decks. Okay. And a lot of

21:21.420 --> 21:28.780
people are very unhappy with that. So some people are leaving, but this the overall,

21:29.020 --> 21:36.460
you know, from where I sit, I think it's so much improved. And, you know, the quality of my

21:36.460 --> 21:41.500
interactions and the number of my followers has increased very substantially. So I'm happy.

21:42.060 --> 21:46.460
And I have to say that's the only social media platform that I'm happy with.

21:47.740 --> 21:52.300
Well, then let's talk about the others then you were on John Stossel's show. And it was,

21:53.660 --> 21:57.900
was it censored on Facebook? Tell me what this has been several days ago or a couple of weeks

21:57.900 --> 22:09.900
ago, but it was labeled as false information. And this was me talking about my experiences and

22:09.900 --> 22:16.220
my perspective. So I don't know how you label this as false information. So, and that was,

22:16.220 --> 22:21.020
you know, they still left the link where you could click there. But there was this big warning

22:21.020 --> 22:28.620
that this was false information because everybody knows that the consensus exists 97% of climate

22:28.620 --> 22:39.180
scientists agree or whatever. No, there's no debate. I was on a podcast earlier this year

22:39.180 --> 22:47.900
with the Heartland Institute. Right. And this was, it was live. And they, as soon as it started,

22:48.140 --> 22:56.140
they took it down. Facebook did Facebook and they were sensitized to me because like about

22:57.020 --> 23:03.740
two weeks earlier, I, there was a something posted on YouTube. It was an interview by

23:03.740 --> 23:15.580
business news in South Africa. And it went sort of viral. I mean, it got like 500,000 views

23:15.580 --> 23:21.500
in a couple of days. And then YouTube took it down. You couldn't even search for it. Okay,

23:21.500 --> 23:26.460
you couldn't search for it at all. There was no message, no nothing, you couldn't search for it.

23:26.460 --> 23:32.940
So that must have raised some sort of flag to Facebook. So as soon as they saw me being a guest

23:32.940 --> 23:39.500
on the Heartland podcast, they just canceled that live feed. And they, you know, so I'm being

23:39.500 --> 23:50.140
really canceled, you know, by the Mark Zuckerberg type social media. So, you know, and what I say,

23:50.140 --> 23:56.940
if you actually listen to what I say, it's pretty innocuous. I mean, it's not cheerleading, you know,

23:56.940 --> 24:04.860
for the team, but you know, I'm just raising some critical questions. And that's very uncomfortable.

24:04.860 --> 24:11.180
I mean, I'm well outside that little box. And that makes people uncomfortable. And they view me

24:11.180 --> 24:17.900
as a threat. I mean, all those footnotes in my book, you know, it's like evidence sort of supporting

24:17.900 --> 24:26.300
my points. And you know, they view this as sort of dangerous. Well, in the way you speak, in what

24:26.300 --> 24:31.340
you're talking about it, and yes, as I've done, you know, a couple hundred podcasts, and I'm a dad,

24:31.340 --> 24:36.140
and you know, been married a long time. I listen to how people listen to how they say what they're

24:36.140 --> 24:40.460
talking about, right? The words matter, of course, but it's, but there was the tone in your voice

24:40.460 --> 24:48.140
about what I describe it, disappointment, anger, frustration. Here's the, you know, the TV journalist

24:48.140 --> 24:52.940
favorite, how do you feel? How do I say that? I'm just kind of joking about it. But I can sense

24:52.940 --> 24:57.980
of you a kind of an outrage or just a disappointment. How does it make you feel?

24:57.980 --> 25:07.180
Well, you know, I'm a scientist, you know, and reason, dialogue, evidence, debate, and especially

25:07.180 --> 25:12.860
in universities, you know, debate and disagreement is the spice of academic life. And all that's

25:12.860 --> 25:19.660
been canceled. You know, it's the universities which discuss me even more than social media. I mean,

25:19.660 --> 25:24.460
social media is social media, but it's what's going on at the universities to me is the absolute worst.

25:25.420 --> 25:31.020
I'm seeing a few of the universities turn around, but the overall tenor at universities is just

25:31.900 --> 25:37.660
terrible. And, you know, you saw this whole dynamics play out with the COVID situation. It's

25:37.660 --> 25:45.820
just endemic to our society right now. And it's very dangerous and free speech issue, political

25:45.820 --> 25:51.420
freedom, you know, there's a lot of issues here. And unfortunately, a lot of this gets tied up in

25:51.420 --> 25:57.020
what's going on with Donald Trump. And, you know, then it just becomes a big political mess.

25:58.060 --> 26:05.340
But these are very serious issues. And I mean, how I mean, God bless Elon Musk for trying to open up

26:05.340 --> 26:12.540
Twitter. He has his own quirks and whatever. But overall, this is like the one place where people

26:12.540 --> 26:18.460
from across the spectrum still come and, you know, engage and look at, you know, a broad range of

26:18.460 --> 26:25.740
material everywhere else, or most other places. It's in a pretty sad state. How are we going to

26:25.740 --> 26:31.580
get anywhere if we don't think critically and engage in constructive debate and discussion?

26:33.260 --> 26:36.220
You know, what you said about Twitter, I think we talked about this last time,

26:36.220 --> 26:40.620
but Alina Chan and Matt Ridley, who wrote a book called Viral on COVID,

26:41.500 --> 26:45.740
they said the same things about the importance of Twitter in terms of this opening the debate

26:45.740 --> 26:51.580
around origins of COVID. And now, which clearly seems to be, as I think they suspected all along,

26:51.580 --> 26:55.980
a lab leak, right? Or the result of some kind of a lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

26:56.940 --> 27:01.980
But they were being censored almost everywhere else, except on Twitter. And this is before Musk took

27:01.980 --> 27:10.380
over. But that lack of critical debate, the free and open debate, I have to agree with you. And

27:10.380 --> 27:16.380
because we're messing with the most important system in our society, which is our energy network,

27:16.380 --> 27:19.980
and we're making it, we're weakening it and spending hundreds of billions of dollars in

27:19.980 --> 27:25.740
the weakening of it, right? Because of the fashion of, and it is fashion, and the way I would talk

27:25.740 --> 27:31.580
about it, I guess, the, I call it climatism and renewable energy fetishism, right? That we have

27:31.580 --> 27:38.220
this combined isms, right there that are, have replaced what has, I would call traditional

27:38.220 --> 27:42.860
conservation, conservation, the traditional conservation ethic. And that's one of the things

27:42.860 --> 27:48.140
that I'm with you exactly on wind and solar. There's this insane headlong rush toward these two

27:48.140 --> 27:53.260
sources of intermittent weather dependent renewables. And with no regard for land use birds,

27:54.140 --> 27:59.900
landscapes, view sheds, it's this, oh, well, this is the, this is the cure. And therefore,

27:59.900 --> 28:05.100
anyone who stands in the way, we're going to run over. And it is almost that bold in terms of,

28:05.180 --> 28:09.340
I mean, some of the states are even saying they're going to override local zoning laws to force

28:09.340 --> 28:13.180
communities to take wind and solar projects they don't want, which just seems the absolute wrong

28:13.180 --> 28:21.340
way to go in terms of democracy and process due, due process and so on. And I know I'm, I'm, I'm

28:21.340 --> 28:27.660
rambling here, but does that ring, ring true to you? Oh, for sure. You summarized it perfectly.

28:28.220 --> 28:34.780
I mean, this is, this whole thing is dangerous in so many different ways. I mean, not just to our

28:34.780 --> 28:41.260
energy infrastructure, but to our freedom and our, the political way that we do things. I mean,

28:41.260 --> 28:48.620
it's, it's a, it's a very slippery slope that we're sliding down. You said, I wrote it down,

28:48.620 --> 28:55.500
you said the universities disgust me. And I reserve my disgust for a few things, lima beans and cauliflower

28:55.500 --> 29:02.300
are two of them, but unpack that just a little bit for me when you say they disgust you. Why is

29:02.300 --> 29:14.460
that? Well, because of the, the cancel, the cancel culture, all of the faculty members, you know,

29:14.460 --> 29:21.260
very talented people can't get hired because they don't know how to write a good DEI essay, diversity,

29:21.260 --> 29:28.140
equity and inclusion. And if you're a chemistry professor or something, what the heck, you know,

29:28.140 --> 29:31.980
when you're talking about molecules, how do you bring that into your teaching? I mean, there's a

29:31.980 --> 29:40.300
lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. They're allowing students to basically lead the charge to

29:40.300 --> 29:46.620
get rid of faculty members that they don't like for some reason. They're interesting and provocative

29:46.620 --> 29:54.780
speakers are getting disinvited because some students feel threatened by their words. And they,

29:54.780 --> 30:05.820
and they pander to this, and they pander to this, people who are sort of skeptical of climate change

30:05.820 --> 30:16.940
or in, in gen, in biology and right, all sorts of other fields. And I thought it was just really

30:16.940 --> 30:22.300
climate change and biology, but people tell me it's rampant in law schools and social psychology

30:22.300 --> 30:29.580
departments and political science departments that the same disease is rampant anywhere that

30:29.580 --> 30:38.700
there is a that's socially relevant. When you're talking about that, it makes me automatically

30:38.700 --> 30:47.180
think now of this held versus Montana lawsuit, which as I read the slump when I brought it up,

30:47.180 --> 30:52.620
you were an expert witness or retained, I guess, as an expert witness in that case, and ultimately

30:52.620 --> 30:57.820
did not testify. But when you're talking about the what's happening on the universities, the line

30:57.820 --> 31:02.620
that comes into my head is grievance culture, right, that everyone's agreed. Everyone is a victim

31:03.180 --> 31:09.500
somehow some way they've been offended or their future has been, been somehow clouded by this,

31:09.500 --> 31:15.580
that or the other. That was in fact the claim, the legal claim that these teenagers made in

31:15.580 --> 31:25.100
Montana that the state was injuring them and their potential, their future. And they won the

31:25.100 --> 31:31.900
court case under the what seemed to be a fairly narrow ruling based on the Montana Constitution.

31:31.900 --> 31:36.940
I know you wrote a blog post about that in June, but now we're here after the held versus Montana

31:36.940 --> 31:41.660
litigation that they won and they Montana Attorney General said he's going to appeal.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.700
How do you read that decision and how important is it?

31:46.140 --> 31:53.180
Well, I don't think it's important. It might stand because the Montana Supreme Court

31:53.900 --> 32:02.460
seems to be equally clueless and sympathetic to these environmental claims as the judge. So

32:03.740 --> 32:08.380
it may not be overruled. If it stands, it's not going to have a big material

32:08.380 --> 32:15.180
impact on what goes on in Montana in terms of changing the statute that they want to change

32:15.180 --> 32:20.860
because Montana and principle, I mean, it just adds a lot of paperwork to everything Montana and

32:20.860 --> 32:29.980
principle can still approve new power plants. It may, it may end up slowing down wind farms

32:29.980 --> 32:35.340
by the same token with all this extra paperwork. I don't know, but it's a symbolic victory for

32:35.340 --> 32:40.780
our Children's Trust, which is the advocacy group behind this case and it's given them fresh steam

32:41.500 --> 32:45.980
because they've been around for 10 years and this is the first case where they got any kind of

32:45.980 --> 32:51.900
attraction. You know, they've been thrown out. Their cases have been thrown out everywhere

32:51.900 --> 32:57.340
until now. They're still pending in a few additional states, but this is the first traction that

32:57.340 --> 33:06.140
they've gotten. And to me, the most dangerous part of this is that like the state legal systems

33:06.940 --> 33:13.740
are ill-prepared, both the judges and the state's attorney's office to deal with an issue like this.

33:13.740 --> 33:18.300
I mean, a technical issue like this. These things should not be decided in the courts.

33:19.020 --> 33:24.060
Okay, they should be decided, you know, by the legislature, you know, elected

33:25.020 --> 33:30.540
legislators and they should have hearings from people across the spectrum and, you know,

33:30.540 --> 33:37.660
wide deliberate deliberations and whatever, not by a single judge who's sympathetic to the defendants

33:37.660 --> 33:47.100
and doesn't have a clue about climate science. And the Montana state's attorney, I mean, I was

33:47.100 --> 33:54.140
brought on the case at the last minute, like the end of last September. And the lawyer that

33:56.540 --> 34:03.500
hired me, he then left a few weeks later. There was a private company who then

34:03.500 --> 34:10.300
took legal firm that then took over and then the lawyer who was eventually in charge of the case

34:10.300 --> 34:17.820
didn't even join it until December. And so he was left, you know, brought in at the last minute.

34:17.820 --> 34:22.380
These weren't witnesses of his choosing. He didn't particularly understand the climate

34:23.020 --> 34:30.540
change issue at all. He wanted, you know, the case to be about something different about

34:32.780 --> 34:39.580
legal nuances. But in spite of my best efforts, I didn't convince him that this was really going

34:39.660 --> 34:48.140
to be about climate change and that you needed to deeply challenge their witnesses and, you know,

34:48.140 --> 34:52.940
the points. And he just didn't know how to evaluate any of that. And I don't blame him. I'm not

34:52.940 --> 34:59.660
surprised. I don't think there'd be very few lawyers in state's attorney's office who are prepared

34:59.660 --> 35:05.660
to handle a case like this. Because of the complexities of the science, because of the

35:05.980 --> 35:11.580
understanding, understanding where the plaintiffs, you know, where their weaknesses are, why is that?

35:11.580 --> 35:19.900
Is the science part of it? Oh, it's both. I mean, and it's, they were claiming psychological

35:19.900 --> 35:27.180
injuries. You know, a few of them, oh, well, my roof was injured by a hailstorm and a barn on

35:27.180 --> 35:34.140
the neighboring property burned down from a fire and the stream dried up. And I couldn't fish in

35:34.140 --> 35:39.900
the stream. And, you know, these were psychological injuries. But a lot of it was pre traumatic

35:39.900 --> 35:45.740
stress syndrome, you know, the Greta Thunberg, we have no future, all of this kind of thing. So

35:45.740 --> 35:55.020
they're very deeply depressed. So I mean, the kids have been fed this insane rhetoric, the rhetoric

35:55.020 --> 36:01.180
targeted at kids and young adults is even worse than what we see, you know, as extinction, rebellion,

36:01.180 --> 36:08.860
all that kind of stuff. So, you know, they just don't have the critical faculties at this point

36:08.860 --> 36:16.380
to evaluate it. And a lot of them are depressed and upset, whatever. But, you know, we blame that on

36:16.380 --> 36:23.100
the education system, on the advocacy groups. I mean, if they were worried about the psychological

36:23.100 --> 36:29.020
injuries of the kids, they should have been suing extinction rebellion and Greta Thunberg and the

36:29.020 --> 36:35.660
National Education Association, which is sort of feeding them all this stuff. But their real agenda

36:35.660 --> 36:45.260
is just to go after the fossil fuel companies. And using kids as a prop. So it's a, you know,

36:45.260 --> 36:52.380
it's a case that made no sense. It's a legal decision that made no sense. But like, it's not

36:52.460 --> 36:59.820
the first thing that makes no sense and all this. So, you know, that this is really, I'm sure our

36:59.820 --> 37:06.620
children's trust the swimming and donations after this little victory, so they can go on and keep suing

37:06.620 --> 37:13.900
everybody. I'm looking at there, I'm looking at one of the rundowns here that they've been,

37:13.900 --> 37:20.460
one of their funders is the Rockefeller Brothers, which is a, I don't know, there's some oil. Yeah,

37:20.460 --> 37:26.940
okay. Well, the air to the Getty fortune is funding extinction rebellion.

37:28.620 --> 37:35.100
You know, you've got all of these oil company fortunes now funding all this craziness, go figure.

37:35.900 --> 37:43.100
I want to reach back to you said that there is a lot of anti-capitalist rhetoric in this,

37:43.100 --> 37:49.900
in these discussions. Talk about that, because I believe I think you're right. And some of these

37:50.620 --> 37:55.020
activists have been very clear about that, right, that capitalism is the problem that's driving

37:55.020 --> 38:00.060
climate change. And therefore, we need some kind of Maoism or socialism or something that would

38:00.060 --> 38:06.140
replace it and have some kind of authoritarian system. I was the only thing I can imagine would

38:06.140 --> 38:11.580
be or the thing that would replace it. But talk about why, how do you see that? How do you see

38:11.580 --> 38:17.980
this? And why do you say that it's an anti-capitalist movement? Well, okay, well, if you look at

38:17.980 --> 38:23.500
the UN environmental program, which is, you know, really behind a lot of this UN stuff,

38:23.500 --> 38:27.980
and you read what they write, and it comes through loud and clear, and not just anti-capitalist,

38:27.980 --> 38:34.300
but anti-democratic, we can't trust the people or the countries to make the right decisions. So

38:34.300 --> 38:41.100
there needs to be, you know, more coercion from the top down at the international level from the

38:41.100 --> 38:48.140
UN. So it's a grab for power. So there's a lot of power grabbing in this, and capitalism and

38:48.780 --> 38:54.540
democracy is inherently against, you know, centralized power. So,

38:56.940 --> 39:02.620
yeah, there are people who've written a lot about this, but the solution is somehow more

39:02.620 --> 39:08.460
coercion, more authoritarianism from presumably the smart people over the dumb people, right,

39:08.460 --> 39:11.500
that they're going to be the ones that are going to make the decisions for us.

39:12.060 --> 39:15.820
Yeah, well, President Biden is talking about declaring a climate emergency,

39:16.460 --> 39:22.140
which would take, and it would be a long-term emergency. I mean, emergencies are for, you

39:22.140 --> 39:28.540
know, something going on two weeks or a month or a year, but not for something that's, you know,

39:28.540 --> 39:34.380
decades. So that would, you know, force people to do this, force people not to do this, that would

39:34.380 --> 39:38.940
take away a lot of freedoms if he declares the climate emergency. And, you know, so there's a

39:38.940 --> 39:46.060
lot of power grabbing going on in the name of this issue. How do you describe your politics, Judy?

39:47.500 --> 39:53.660
Well, when I go to a ballot, I'm looking for the not, you know, a voter's ballot. I'm looking for

39:53.660 --> 40:02.060
the none of the above box to check. Okay, that's my point. I'm not a Republican. I'm not a Democrat.

40:02.060 --> 40:05.580
I'm disgusted, and I am disgusted, but I don't see a disgusted party. So...

40:06.300 --> 40:15.740
Okay, yeah, I'm an independent with a libertarian streak. When I am totally disgusted with the

40:15.740 --> 40:22.620
Republican and Democratic candidates, I'll vote libertarian by default, but I haven't had any great

40:22.620 --> 40:29.740
enthusiasm for any of their recent candidates. But, you know, I'm hoping no party or whatever,

40:29.740 --> 40:36.700
something can come up with something different, because, you know, another Trump Biden election,

40:36.700 --> 40:43.020
you know, the whole country, you know, will just be tearing their hair out. So, yeah,

40:43.020 --> 40:50.220
so I'm an independent. I'm a none of the above. I like to think things through and listen to both

40:50.220 --> 40:57.740
sides. And, you know, a lot of these issues are just not simple, and there's clashes of values.

40:57.740 --> 41:03.980
So, you know, I like the discussion. I like the debate. So I don't pledge allegiance to anybody

41:03.980 --> 41:10.540
or either side, that's for sure. I'm going to go back, jump back to the just stop oil crowd and

41:10.540 --> 41:15.020
the, you know, the climate rebellion people or whatever the extinction rebellion people,

41:15.980 --> 41:21.260
because I find some of these people who are throwing the soup cans and blocking the traffic and the

41:21.260 --> 41:29.740
rest of it. One, for their punishment, I want them to go and live in rural Kenya without any

41:30.540 --> 41:35.420
hydrocarbons and be forced to stay there for two years and just tell us, you know, report back. And

41:35.420 --> 41:41.020
maybe this has changed your mind. That's my idea for punishment. You can't use any modern energy

41:41.020 --> 41:46.140
sources, sorry, none, zero, and then see how you like it. But I also find it somewhat depressing

41:46.140 --> 41:53.580
when I look at them and how they feel the victim. So they feel so aggrieved. I mean, there's something

41:54.700 --> 41:58.380
there's something deeply disgusting about it, right? Because I think I see them also as just

41:58.380 --> 42:03.820
completely spoiled and uneducated about the world around them. But there's something pathetic about

42:03.820 --> 42:09.980
them. Does that ring true to you? And I'm just kind of riffing here, but I see something very

42:11.500 --> 42:13.580
deeply sad in the way they act.

42:13.660 --> 42:23.980
Well, it's part it's a part of the broader victim culture and identity politics, you know, it's

42:23.980 --> 42:32.540
the need to culture victim culture, right? Yeah, that whole thing. So it's it's it's a tribal thing.

42:34.620 --> 42:39.500
And the held lawsuit is part of this, right, that this is an identity, right? This is an identity of

42:39.500 --> 42:44.940
we've been agreed, we've been wronged, and we're going to seek redress for this, this this affront

42:44.940 --> 42:51.100
to us in our, our, then they have somebody in authority who's going to pay the bills for them

42:51.100 --> 42:59.740
to go out and throw, you know, cans of tomato soup. You know, it seems like win win, you know, it

43:02.620 --> 43:08.780
they think they're saving the world. They're part of a tribe. And somebody's paying them and

43:08.780 --> 43:13.420
encourage, you know, somebody in authority who's paying them and encourage them to do this. So

43:13.420 --> 43:19.900
it's, you know, I think all of those things are contributing. But it is very sad that these kids

43:19.900 --> 43:25.740
aren't doing something better with their time, more, more productive, you know, getting educated

43:25.740 --> 43:33.820
and getting jobs. And this is personal for you. You're a grandmother. Am I right? Oh, I'm a grandmother

43:33.820 --> 43:41.580
for sure. How many, how many grandchildren? Well, I have one grandchild and then five step

43:41.580 --> 43:47.260
grandchildren. So we've got a nice crew and they're all of junior high and high school age.

43:47.980 --> 43:54.300
And you talk about these kind of political issues within? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And they, and they

43:54.300 --> 44:01.580
think, you know, I'm cool. I'm a little bit subversive. You know, that's good. Let's see what the real

44:01.580 --> 44:09.980
truth is. So that they seem to all have healthy attitudes, you know, about the situation. And

44:09.980 --> 44:16.540
my granddaughter, who lives in Reno, you know, close to where I live, she's very rational. She

44:16.540 --> 44:22.380
says, Well, I just really need to learn more about this whole issue. You know, I just, I don't think

44:22.380 --> 44:27.180
I should have a big opinion about this right now, because I just really need to learn more about this

44:27.500 --> 44:34.220
issue. You go girl. Yeah. So let me ask you about, we just have a few more minutes. And again,

44:34.220 --> 44:39.260
my guest is Judith Curry. She's the author of this new book, Climate Uncertainty and Risk,

44:39.260 --> 44:44.220
Rethinking Our Response. By the paperback, it's much cheaper than the hardback. It's out by

44:44.220 --> 44:50.540
Anthem Press. It came out in June. I'm going to ask you about the ending of that in just a minute.

44:51.420 --> 44:58.620
But you have your own website, judithcurry.com and climate, et cetera. So you have your own

44:58.620 --> 45:02.780
media outlet. I'm just curious. Can you give me an idea how many visitors you get there? Because

45:02.780 --> 45:08.460
I'm increasingly convinced unless you own your own media outlet, you're not assured of a free press.

45:10.460 --> 45:14.460
You know, I haven't joined Substack or anything else where I might get traffic. When I first

45:14.460 --> 45:22.380
started the blog, it had huge traffic. I get less traffic these days. I think on a big day,

45:22.380 --> 45:29.660
I might get 10,000 visitors. You know, it's and if something gets picked up.

45:31.260 --> 45:35.980
But that's still a respectable number. It's a respectable number. And you know,

45:36.620 --> 45:43.340
I'm not actually looking for influence. I'm just looking to engage in, you know,

45:43.900 --> 45:49.180
in the dialogue and to set up a space where people from across the spectrum can come here

45:49.180 --> 45:55.420
and discuss. And I also host a number of very interesting, intelligent people as guest

45:56.540 --> 46:03.500
authors. And it's even spawned a few books, three books, in fact, you know, that have grown out

46:03.500 --> 46:11.100
from posts on my blog. Yeah. And so, you know, I'm very happy with the blog, even though it's,

46:11.100 --> 46:18.540
you know, not high traffic. And in all honesty, I think my lab that there was a three week period

46:19.180 --> 46:24.460
when I didn't even post something, you know, so it's not like I'm posting four times a day and

46:24.460 --> 46:31.660
really trying to build trap. You know, it's just my personal record of what I'm thinking about and

46:31.660 --> 46:38.460
what I'm investigating. And it really seeded my book. I started the blog in 2010 with a series on

46:39.020 --> 46:45.740
climate science and the uncertainty monster, which was a major theme in my book. So this blog in many

46:45.740 --> 46:51.740
ways documented my journey in writing the book. It's an interesting way to think about it because

46:51.740 --> 46:56.780
I'm talking with other writers and, you know, I've written six books and I don't think I have

46:56.780 --> 47:01.340
another one in them, but that they view the their substack or even their Twitter or other places

47:01.340 --> 47:05.740
of way that they catalog what they know, and then they come come back and use it as a resource.

47:05.740 --> 47:08.860
So I want to we're going to close here in just a few minutes because I know you're on a tight

47:08.860 --> 47:13.100
schedule and so am I. But at the end of the book, you have a section called toward post apocalyptic

47:13.100 --> 47:17.500
climate policies. And you quote the economist Richard toll, who is an interesting character,

47:17.500 --> 47:23.180
I've met him once, he said, politically correct climate change orthodoxy has completely destroyed

47:23.180 --> 47:29.180
our ability to think rationally about the environment. I touched on this before, but I like

47:29.180 --> 47:33.580
that because it speaks to the issues of land use, which I've been reporting on for a very long time.

47:34.140 --> 47:39.500
And met many people in rural America in the course of my travels in Michigan and Wisconsin and all

47:39.500 --> 47:43.420
over the world that you're fighting these encroachment of these wind and solar projects.

47:44.060 --> 47:49.500
But it seems that that to me is the concrete example of this clouded ability to think about

47:49.500 --> 47:55.180
the environment that this climatism has trumping all of these other concerns. I don't know.

47:57.260 --> 48:00.860
Your book is in some ways kind of a technical book, but you also have these quotes that are

48:00.860 --> 48:07.420
really great in each section. So you really, that was the most fun part of the book was

48:09.580 --> 48:13.900
I think, you know, selecting quotes and figuring out where to place them. I mean, it was,

48:14.620 --> 48:21.900
it was, I spent an awful lot of time doing it, but it was the most fun part really of writing the

48:21.900 --> 48:29.420
book. Well, I enjoyed it as well because you have a, somebody, go ahead. From Dirty Harry and May

48:29.420 --> 48:36.860
West, you know, Bruce Lee, you know, popular culture figures, along with philosophers and

48:36.940 --> 48:44.140
scientists and things like that. So, but it breaks up the kind of, it made it less of a

48:44.140 --> 48:48.940
technical way. That gave it some leavening, some, some breathing room, I guess I would say, right?

48:48.940 --> 48:53.580
Because you have a lot of technical things that heavily footnoted and footnoted and the way you

48:53.580 --> 48:58.540
structured it in some ways is more textbook-like. And you said that the publisher is targeting

48:59.340 --> 49:04.620
universities and academic outlets or academic buyers, but I found that part to be good. So

49:04.620 --> 49:10.540
let me read this one section here and then we're going to wrap up. This is in your concluding section,

49:10.540 --> 49:15.500
you say, we need to open up space for dissent, disagreement and discussion about scientific

49:15.500 --> 49:20.780
uncertainty and policy options so that multiple perspectives can be considered and broader support

49:20.780 --> 49:26.860
can be built for a range of policy options. Wicked scientists are willing to become embroiled in

49:26.860 --> 49:32.140
political debates and thorny social problems. To be effective, we need to break the hegemony of

49:32.140 --> 49:36.940
disciplinary researchers, disciplinary researchers, particularly for those who are

49:36.940 --> 49:42.540
strident political activists as being regarded as experts for solutions to the wicked problem of

49:42.540 --> 49:48.620
climate change. I couldn't agree with that more. I thought that was a really good summary of, I

49:48.620 --> 49:53.820
think of what your, your point is, we need, we need more robust debate about the best path forward.

49:53.820 --> 49:57.180
And my thing has always been natural gas and nuclear. If we're serious about this, these are

49:57.180 --> 50:03.260
low carbon scalable, you know, but they're just the lack of policy debate about what the way forward

50:03.260 --> 50:08.780
to me is very, a very dangerous one. So I commend you on the book. I thought, you know, it's really

50:08.780 --> 50:14.940
obviously an enormous amount of effort. So I have to, I wanted to draw part of our discussion to an

50:14.940 --> 50:19.580
end there because I thought that was very well stated. So thank you for that. Last two questions.

50:19.580 --> 50:23.180
And you know, I asked these and I asked you these before. So what are you reading? What's on the,

50:23.180 --> 50:28.220
yeah, I know you're busy with climate forecast actions, climate forecast applications network,

50:28.220 --> 50:32.460
your business, but I know you must be an avid reader. So what's on your bookshelf? What are you

50:32.460 --> 50:38.780
reading on these? What's the top of the pile? Oh, gosh, I wish I could remember the name of this

50:38.780 --> 50:46.540
book, but it's a book by Andy West. It's in the grip of culture. It's about the social psychology

50:46.620 --> 50:53.580
of climate catastrophism, you know, the Greta phenomenon or whatever. And this is another

50:53.580 --> 50:59.020
like scholarly book, but it's very readable. In the grip of culture, it's called? Yeah,

50:59.020 --> 51:07.260
in the grip of culture. Okay. I think and it's about the social psychology of climate catastrophism.

51:07.260 --> 51:15.500
I see. Something like that. So that's like, I highly recommend that. I think that's the main

51:15.500 --> 51:19.980
one I want to recommend at this point. Okay. Last question, what gives you hope?

51:21.100 --> 51:33.580
What gives me hope? Well, that people can be rational. And I think that we are. And I think

51:33.580 --> 51:40.380
this in the grip of culture book explains a lot. And, you know, we just need to get out of that.

51:40.380 --> 51:46.860
And I'm also, I mean, at some point, the weather is going to turn a little bit more favorable.

51:46.860 --> 51:53.500
We've been in a bad place since 2017. You know, the natural climate oscillations will shift at

51:53.500 --> 51:59.740
some point, five years, 10 years into a more favorable state. And hopefully people will calm down.

52:00.540 --> 52:07.980
And about this problem, I think that the apocalyptic rhetoric people are realizing that

52:07.980 --> 52:12.460
they've gone too far. I mean, having a whole generation of kids who are depressed and too

52:12.460 --> 52:17.660
scared to do anything isn't going to help the movement. So they have to figure out how to

52:18.380 --> 52:26.380
make their message a little bit more hopeful, and not just destroy the psyches of all these kids.

52:27.020 --> 52:37.580
So hopefully the catastrophic rhetoric will came down. But, you know, at the end of the day,

52:37.660 --> 52:44.380
things that don't make sense aren't going to have a long lifetime. They can cause us a lot of money,

52:44.380 --> 52:52.060
cause us a lot of pain. But at the end of the day, you know, sense and economics will prevail.

52:52.060 --> 52:54.140
But we're certainly not there right now.

52:56.940 --> 53:00.940
Well, that's a good place to stop. So that's where we will, in fact, stop. My guest has been

53:00.940 --> 53:05.820
Judith Curry. She's the author of a new book called Climate Uncertainty and Risk, Rethinking

53:05.820 --> 53:11.260
Our Response. You can find it, I'm sure, on all the major book selling outlets. She's on Twitter

53:11.260 --> 53:17.180
at CurryJA, and you can find her on the web at JudithCurry.com. Judith, thanks a million for

53:17.180 --> 53:23.260
coming back on The Power Hungry Podcast. A very interesting book and, you know, I applaud you

53:23.260 --> 53:27.820
for your efforts at trying to open up the debate. And with this, if these are the most important

53:27.820 --> 53:32.380
issues of our time, and I think they are important issues, let's have a debate about it. Let's talk

53:32.460 --> 53:37.980
about it. Let's examine it. And your work, I think, is helping that effort. So good on you.

53:38.780 --> 53:41.340
Okay, great. Thanks. It was great to talk to you again.

53:42.860 --> 53:46.540
Okay, so thank you, Judy. And thanks to all of you out there in Podcast Land.

53:46.540 --> 53:50.860
To the next episode of The Power Hungry Podcast, it might be as good as this one,

53:50.860 --> 53:56.060
we will find out. But if you have a chance, also give us a good rating on those podcast outlets

53:56.060 --> 54:05.580
wherever you can give us 4, 5, 6, 12 stars, whatever it is. And until next time, see you.
