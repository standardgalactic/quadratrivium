0	5680	Starting this year, I announced that I would be slowing down uploads, but this was not
5680	8320	me saying that I was stepping away from Maverick files.
8320	13600	Instead, I'm diving even deeper into improving the quality of my uploads.
13600	18480	However, Patreon gets the behind-the-scenes of everything.
18480	22440	Patreon supporters, in fact, have already seen this video before it was uploaded, and
22440	27960	they see thumbnail ideas along with script updates, and if you support me on Patreon,
27960	30600	you even get to vote on upcoming videos.
30600	34600	They are the reason this video was made in the first place, as this topic won the last
34600	35960	poll that I made.
35960	40760	So, before we begin, please consider supporting me on Patreon.
40760	41760	That's all.
41760	43760	Enjoy your stay.
57960	82360	It seems so radical at first.
82360	102520	They call themselves targeted individuals, and some call themselves the chosen one.
102520	108200	People who have been marked to have their entire life racked with paranoia and fear.
108200	114040	It is them versus the world, a world that is full of demons, government agents, and
114040	129480	energized terrorism, and the world's attacks are cruel and endless.
129480	132760	Imagine you're living your day-to-day, and you're in your car getting into a heated
132760	134560	argument with a friend.
134560	138680	After the clash, you part ways and go home to go to sleep because you have work in the
138680	139680	morning.
139680	143800	On your way to work the next day, you stop to get a coffee, and while you're waiting
143800	151120	in line, somebody behind you repeats verbatim, and mockingly, the most heated moment of yesterday's
151120	152120	argument.
152120	158240	You turn around, and the person smiles, coughs twice, and they leave.
158240	162480	That first encounter seems weird, but you shrug it off.
162480	165680	You mention it to your significant other later that day.
165680	169760	Later that night, you're on your phone and you notice a story in your feed mentioning
169760	174440	how your significant other is more likely to cheat in the morning.
174440	178720	Before you go to bed, your partner will tell you that they're going to meet a friend at
178720	182960	the gym in the morning, and now you're on guard.
182960	187160	In the morning, you're driving to work in your car playing Pandora Radio, and a commercial
187160	194000	for a local private investigator that specializes in treating spouses comes on in between songs.
194000	198960	On your lunch break, you realize your partner hasn't called you all day, and as you scroll
198960	205920	your feed, you see a comment mentioning how you are abusing your mentor position at church,
205920	208040	and that no one likes you.
208040	213560	You shake it off and save the post to comment later, and then you go back to work.
213560	219120	You get to your desk, and shortly after, one of your clients calls and choose you out for
219120	221200	an unfulfilled purchase order.
221200	225680	The person yells at you, and is extremely rude, and then hangs up.
225680	230920	At the end of work, you notice your significant other still hasn't called you, which makes
230920	234680	you suspicious by this time, and so you pick up dinner.
234680	239480	Before going home and while in line at the grocery store, a stranger says your name while
239480	242200	having a conversation with another person.
242200	246360	But to mention in the conversation how her friend had to leave her church group to save
246360	247960	her marriage.
247960	253360	On your way home, your streaming service plays nothing but songs about cheating boyfriends.
253360	259200	You get home, and see your significant other with another person of the opposite sex, and
259200	263960	you get out of your car, and your spouse says that his phone didn't work all day, for
263960	268200	some reason, and his car isn't working so he couldn't buy gas.
268200	272600	That's why the person, who is also a female, drove him home.
272600	275760	Not to mention that she is a new client of his.
275760	279120	You both get into house, and an argument starts.
279120	283520	You accuse your spouse of cheating, he gets mad, and leaves.
283520	285160	You eat dinner by yourself.
285160	289600	Go back and check on that negative comment you saw online at lunch, but it's not there
289600	290600	anymore.
290600	295840	Suddenly, you're waking up, not remembering how you fell asleep.
295840	300920	You hear a noise in your house, so you call out your spouse, but there's no answer.
300920	304720	You hear a door slam, and then silence.
304720	307840	You text your partner, why'd you leave?
307840	310960	I haven't been back, and I'm still mad.
310960	313440	Talk to you later, they reply.
313440	317360	Now that you know that wasn't your spouse, you check your house.
317360	322160	You find the lights are on, and the cabinet doors are open, but nothing's missing.
322160	323160	You call the cops.
323520	327280	They check the house, and see nothing missing or out of place.
327280	332440	The police then ask you things like, if you've been abusing alcohol or drugs.
332440	337600	You reply in defense of yourself, but the cops refuse to file a report since they've
337600	342920	seen nothing like a thread, and ask if you would like to see a psychiatrist.
342920	344000	You refuse.
344000	346960	You claim you're not crazy, and they leave.
346960	351400	So now you're unable to sleep now, and go to work as the morning arrives.
351400	356680	After you arrive, your boss asks to meet you, tells you a large client that you maintain
356680	363080	had called, and is taking her business elsewhere, and because of this, you are fired.
363080	366640	You clean out your office, and now you're on your way home to a house that you don't
366640	368280	feel safe at.
368280	373360	Upon arriving, you see that your significant other is moving your stuff out while you were
373360	377720	at work, and after another fight, they leave.
377720	382880	Now, home alone in your house, stressed out, and not feeling safe.
382880	387760	You try to wind down with some wine, as you wear your Harvard college sweats, and you
387760	389240	watch some TV.
389240	393840	You pull out your phone and scroll your feed, and you begin seeing ads for the exact same
393840	396160	Harvard sweatshirt that you're wearing.
396160	399960	You're getting creeped out by that, so you go to Reddit to get away from social media,
399960	404520	and you start seeing posts about, how did you cause your breakup?
404520	408640	And then you see a post about how, unless you went to Harvard, you shouldn't wear the
408640	409940	sweatshirt.
409940	416440	And after that is another post that says, my friend, insert your name, is a fuck up,
416440	418040	how should I tell them?
418040	423120	Okay, a little creepy, but you clicked on it because you're curious.
423120	427320	You start to scroll down on the comments, which start off mentioning how horrible Heather
427320	433800	is, saying that she's a fuck up at work, and another saying that she's a whino, and
433800	436880	is never smart enough to go to Harvard.
436880	440560	You have now reached situational awareness.
440560	445400	Your watchers feel like they are in such a good position to do so, that they can directly
445400	447160	ridicule you.
447160	462840	Your phone freezes up, then turns off, but you already know that now you are being watched.
462840	468160	After reading through subreddits, tweets, and 4chan posts, it seems that these stalkers
468160	470400	want you to know that they're there.
470400	474200	They want you to be aware of the never ending looming thread.
474200	475200	Why?
475200	477840	Well, I'm going to pause here.
477840	483360	The issue with majority conspiracy theories is that they're resolved in absolutes.
483360	487280	That there is one golden answer to every matter that confuses you.
487280	492800	If you look into the corners of the web, you'll find these half brain theories scattered everywhere.
493480	503200	And if you're not careful, you may begin to believe them.
503200	508200	This individual is coming every day.
508200	513280	He's been doing this for 4 years in front of our house.
513280	521480	And I have seen him with a camera and a tripod and those woods over there.
521480	528240	When I approached to see what he was doing, he came running out of the wood, pick up the
528240	532120	tripod and went back to the wood.
532120	534840	4 years doing the same thing.
534840	537200	4 years doing the same thing.
537200	539320	This is our house over there.
539320	543000	That's what makes the idea of gangstalking so difficult.
543520	547200	I'll tell you to let your boy come in and shoot with another one.
547200	550920	And yes, I'm posted in Walmart again.
550920	557520	I may look slump or whatnot, I just left work and I only got about 3 hours of sleep last night.
557520	565320	So I'm coming in, you know, in Walmart again because these gangstalkers, these government
565320	571480	officials, these military men, these agents, they've been on their job today.
571560	575040	They've been on their job today, yesterday and, you know what I'm saying?
575040	579280	Probably pretty much going to be on their job tomorrow, pretty heavy.
579280	581480	But we're going to debunk all that shit.
581480	585600	I'm just in Walmart again because they let it be on my dig.
585600	587280	Remember I said I like New York Giants?
587280	590480	Remember I said I like New York Giants.
590480	596840	Why would the CIA go after you using the most mundane, boring tactics possible?
596840	601560	Victims of this tactic are probably now screaming at the screen.
601560	603200	That isn't that to the point.
603200	605240	It is so no one believes us.
605240	611400	But then if you ask these said victims about the possibility of why they're being gangstalked,
611400	614480	you start to get some interesting stories.
618200	623840	Menacing tales of devil worship, corporate black magic, human trafficking, celebrity
623840	630400	cults, so on and so forth, usually which the victim has been able to outsmart and escape
630400	631560	from.
631560	636360	And due to their wits of outsmarting these cults of black magic, these stalker groups
636360	640880	now follow after them as a threat.
640880	647120	A threat, if not a reminder, that if they open their mouth at any point, they will be wiped
647120	648840	off of the map.
648840	653520	Then, why aren't these people wiped off of the map?
653520	657600	These believers go across the internet shouting how they're being chased by the Rothschild
657600	661760	family for escaping an adrenochrome farming lab underground.
661760	666520	There are verified accounts on Twitter with large followers who talk endlessly about their
666520	668920	gangstalker experiences.
668920	673880	Why is it that the moment they get on the internet, they're invincible to their stalkers?
673880	678280	If that's the case, what makes them so special that they're kept alive?
678280	682400	Why would they just not get rid of you if they knew how much power you had?
684520	689720	And if you keep asking them these questions, at first you'll simply be told,
689720	690720	That's the point.
690720	692720	They are studying me.
692720	698720	But, if you keep prodding, you'll soon be faced with, well, absolutes.
698720	703720	You're a federal agent, who's a part of a gangstalking community.
703720	704720	Or?
704720	710720	It's because I am protected by angels, and the end of Christ can't harm me.
711720	716920	Okay, I know I'm tearing into this, and the problem with me and the majority of the
716920	722920	internet that does this, is that some of these victims have evidence.
725920	729920	Like, weirdly specific and rather eye-opening evidence.
729920	734320	There are users on Instagram, Reddit, and YouTube who record what they believe to be
734320	737320	genuine evidence of gangstalking activities.
737520	743520	Activities such as noise disturbances, highway stalking, and electronic probes.
743520	749520	In contrast, chosen ones will shoot down the idea of capturing evidence of them,
749520	753520	often brushing it off saying that it's simply impossible.
753520	757520	Stating that these perps hack into their phones and delete any evidence,
757520	760520	or that they break into their homes to wipe any security footage.
760520	764520	Other times, when asked if they can present evidence,
764720	767720	they will upload content of them parading around grocery stores,
767720	769720	harassing random customers.
769720	776720	So, when there's actually footage, it can be kind of... haunting.
776920	782920	Everything could have been so simple, but everybody's a meddling fool.
790920	795920	For example, there's a user on YouTube that posts video footage along with a quick summary
795920	798920	to what they were doing before the video began.
798920	802920	The first clip is of a mysterious car that speeds by their house.
803120	807120	Before, it suddenly goes in reverse all the way down the road.
807120	812120	The uploader then goes on vacation, returns home, and that very night,
812120	815120	the car suddenly returns.
815120	820120	In the video, you can hear the person having a conversation with some unidentifiable person
820120	825120	before firing a gun into the air and driving off.
832920	837920	This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.
837920	842920	This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.
842920	847920	This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.
847920	852920	This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.
852920	857920	This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.
858920	864920	Our first impression is probably...
864920	866920	Go talk to the police.
866920	869920	But according to the uploader, they tried.
869920	874920	They tried, and the police silenced them and ignored their complaints.
874920	880920	And going into the comments, you will find other commenters feeding into this idea.
880920	883920	There's echo chamber of pessimism.
883920	887920	Everyone you think can help you are all gang stalkers as well.
887920	891920	That you're just wasting your time even trying to get justice.
891920	897920	Your family, your husband or wife, the local police, everyone.
897920	901920	Just give up and stay alone.
901920	919920	They uploaded a later video displaying what they believe is evidence of them being stalked on a highway.
919920	923920	They begin driving on one lane before letting another car merge.
923920	926920	And this new car is labeled as another perp.
926920	931920	The car stays directly behind their vehicle the entire time.
931920	937920	The uploader even begins to disrupt traffic laws by going drastically under the speed limit
937920	943920	just to see if the car would go around them, reducing their speed down to 40 miles per hour on the highway.
943920	948920	A dangerous stunt, and yet the car remains behind them.
948920	955920	A part of me wonders why the uploader didn't merge into a different lane themselves to really test if the perp would follow.
955920	959920	But you can only ask so much from footage.
959920	968920	Eventually the uploader exits the highway and the stalker does not follow.
968920	972920	And then the video ends.
972920	979920	Remember earlier how I said that victims and chosen ones claim that there are energy weapons that are used to attack them?
979920	988920	The ideas behind what these weapons are vary widely from supersonic frequencies to microwave lasers that burn the victim.
988920	994920	These supposed weapons are hidden away in secret vans or houses from across the street.
994920	1001920	And yet the very same channel would post a video stating that they had evidence of these weapons in act.
1001920	1006920	They claim that there is a mechanical beeper sounding off within their walls.
1006920	1013920	I don't know if you can hear this buzzing ringing sound coming from the heater.
1013920	1016920	It's not the heater, the heater is closed.
1016920	1024920	It's this energy passing through the heater from the other side of the lake.
1024920	1030920	Making this ring sound I think is because it passed through the metal.
1030920	1032920	And her.
1040920	1043920	It just keeps on all night.
1043920	1049920	And this is what is affecting my body.
1054920	1059920	It just keeps on all night.
1084920	1089920	It just keeps on all night.
1114920	1140920	It's intriguing to say the least.
1141920	1146920	How do we know you ain't running the bluff?
1146920	1156920	What if I were to tell you that someone had once dedicated a large portion of their life to the lives of a gang stalking group.
1156920	1164920	That they supposedly discovered, infiltrated and acted amongst these perps and acted as a gang stalker themselves.
1164920	1169920	And then proceeded to document all of their findings.
1174920	1176920	Who are we?
1176920	1179920	We drive the ambulances that take you to the emergency room.
1179920	1182920	When your house is burning, we put out the fire.
1182920	1184920	We are security guards.
1184920	1186920	We protect you at night.
1186920	1189920	You only have electricity, phone and cable service.
1189920	1192920	Because of us, we are the janitors.
1192920	1194920	We have the keys.
1194920	1196920	We fix your cars.
1196920	1198920	You don't want to mess with us.
1198920	1200920	We are like the police.
1200920	1209920	Except we are above the police.
1209920	1220920	Private investigator and author David Lawson would spend an estimated 12 years of his life researching gang stalkers primarily during the 1990s.
1220920	1224920	He conducts his investigations in the United States and in Canada.
1224920	1230920	And yet his writings seem to be almost completely ignored by all parties.
1230920	1233920	I mean, this man supposedly broke the matrix here.
1233920	1235920	He cracked the code.
1235920	1238920	He broke into the secret club and documented evidence.
1238920	1240920	12 years of it.
1240920	1244920	This should be every chosen one's holiday, birthday and bible.
1244920	1249920	So, why does no one talk about it?
1249920	1253920	David would break down his documentation into two categories.
1253920	1257920	What was witnessed and his thoughts following the experiments.
1257920	1266920	And immediately, I can begin to understand why, perhaps, victims don't credit or cite his books.
1266920	1270920	I should really just say book as in one book.
1270920	1276920	Because he actually stopped printing terrorist stalking in America and updated it to cost stalking.
1276920	1279920	So, it's technically the same book.
1279920	1281920	Anyway, as I was saying.
1281920	1287920	David actually states that gang stalkers are pinned from terrorist and anti-government establishments.
1287920	1293920	A concept that is wildly in contrast to a lot of gang stalker conspiracies.
1293920	1301920	A lot of victims believe they're targeted from corporations and militant figures, but David already goes against this.
1301920	1306920	He reports even further that these victims are based around blatant white lies.
1306920	1310920	The gang actually believes they're doing good for the community.
1310920	1314920	Whether the community is a small town or an entire city.
1314920	1319920	All because they've been told that the victim has a vast criminal record.
1319920	1324920	Oftentimes, citing that the victim is a child.
1324920	1328920	This answers, to put it simply, why the victims are attacked.
1328920	1332920	These gangs generally believe that they're doing the right thing.
1332920	1335920	A vigilante group rather than a terrorist group.
1335920	1339920	Okay, but why are they chosen in the first place?
1339920	1342920	David conjures this up to multitudes of reasons.
1342920	1344920	First, being the obvious.
1344920	1349920	You're a whistleblower, you know too much, or you are too loud of an activist.
1349920	1352920	Therefore, you get followed and stalked as punishment.
1352920	1358920	But he also speculates that a victim could be, maybe, next in line for a wealthy inheritance.
1358920	1363920	Whether it being financial gain, acres of land, or a new house.
1363920	1369920	Unfortunately, David also states that some victims are merely chosen as practice.
1369920	1374920	A conspiracy theory that many victims do believe to this day.
1374920	1378920	Which may only fuel their claims of being quote-unquote studied.
1378920	1382920	David claims that he interviewed all who were involved.
1382920	1386920	From stalkers, to targeted individuals, to the local authorities.
1386920	1390920	Who, surprisingly, actually play a part in both ends.
1390920	1395920	I won't go into every single interview because, well, there's a lot.
1395920	1399920	And I have so much more to get into.
1399920	1403920	City employees can be used to harass a target in many ways.
1403920	1406920	Including tearing up the road in front of a target's home.
1406920	1410920	Employees of pest control businesses who have access to the keys for apartments.
1410920	1415920	And those who work for alarm and locksmith companies are also of interest.
1415920	1419920	Surveillance is conducted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
1419920	1423920	When a target leaves his residence, they will alert the group.
1423920	1426920	Either by cell phone, or by a business band radio.
1426920	1431920	Other members, who are patrolling the perimeter to watch for police and other vehicles driving in the area.
1431920	1434920	Will race to the location to begin pursuit.
1434920	1441920	If the target flushes a toilet, he may hear car horn, the sound of a power tool, or hammering for example.
1441920	1450920	Entry will likely be gained through a member of the janitorial staff, pest control, or alarm technicians since they all have a right to enter.
1450920	1458920	They may even be able to approach a landlord and gain his cooperation after convincing him of their quote-unquote higher purpose.
1458920	1462920	He may also cooperate out of fear.
1464920	1468920	Okay, these are some wild claims.
1468920	1472920	But how did David Lawson even become a gang stalker?
1472920	1475920	Well, rather easily he says.
1475920	1480920	In his book, he talks about how he got involved from just hearing about activity from a scanner.
1480920	1485920	He said his scanner picked up on a random woman reporting that she was now following a vehicle.
1485920	1488920	And she listed off the car model and the license plate number.
1488920	1493920	And sure enough, later that week, David would hear the same woman over a scanner.
1493920	1497920	Report on different vehicles numerous times.
1497920	1504920	Eventually, on the same frequency, he would hear murmurs about grabbing a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant.
1504920	1508920	So, he backed up his things and David had it out.
1508920	1516920	Once he was there, he states that he found the group openly discussing various activities as if they were the police.
1516920	1521920	And that the real police were also in the same vicinity as all of them.
1521920	1528920	David would discover that these groups shared an AM radio station where they broadcasted conspiracies to other willing listeners,
1528920	1531920	discussing things such as Waco or Ruby Ridge.
1531920	1533920	They called it Hate Radio.
1533920	1540920	And with this new radio station, David would tune in regularly and discover coordinates to a local group meet-up.
1540920	1546920	At the first meeting I attended, one young man flashed a phony police badge at me.
1546920	1548920	No one paid any attention.
1548920	1552920	Some of those in attendance were the people I had seen in the local restaurant.
1552920	1558920	This was my introduction to the creepy world of anti-government extremists.
1562920	1564920	An ironic twist, isn't it?
1564920	1570920	The people nowadays who claim they're targeted individuals often share anti-government extremist views,
1570920	1575920	but back in the 90s, it was the extremists who were doing the targeting.
1575920	1579920	That shouldn't come as too surprising, I guess, as even David himself
1579920	1584920	quotes that the Klan developed their own systematic abuse to silence any crimes.
1584920	1587920	So, when did it cross over?
1587920	1593920	When does it go from anti-government extremism to Big Brother is watching extremism?
1593920	1597920	Is it weird that this all feels too... easy?
1597920	1603920	But then, there's evidence written from a victim's perspective.
1603920	1606920	No, not from a 4chan post or a Reddit comment.
1606920	1611920	In fact, it's an actual documented memoir that is available on YouTube.
1611920	1615920	The memoir is called Run, Hide, Repeat.
1615920	1622920	The podcast contains five episodes, which, in total, runs close to four hours in length,
1622920	1629920	and as the description states, it's 1971, and Ruth Dawkins is going through a messy divorce
1629920	1633920	for the future of her young children, Pauline and Ted.
1633920	1637920	Pauline Dawkins' childhood was marked by unexplained events,
1637920	1643920	a sense of unseen menace, and secretive moves to new cities with no warning.
1643920	1648920	When Pauline was a young adult, her mother finally told her what they were running from.
1648920	1653920	Organized crime, secret police, and double lives.
1654920	1660920	For once, we finally get a full constructed story of gang stalking
1660920	1664920	that isn't just a quick paragraph about being microwaved by the CIA.
1664920	1668920	Her mother suffered abuse at the hands of a powerful husband,
1668920	1671920	a man who was a dominant force in the business world,
1671920	1675920	and with his power came abuse and drinking.
1675920	1681920	Eventually, they would divorce and warn was only allowed the slightest amount of time to visit his kids,
1681920	1684920	all with strict supervision by the mother.
1684920	1687920	Pauline describes early on in her memoir.
1687920	1689920	He complained that he wanted to see more of them,
1689920	1693920	but they could never tell if it was because he missed his children,
1693920	1697920	or if because he viewed it as losing his property.
1697920	1702920	Pauline discusses that after the divorce, her mother would seek help from a reverend.
1702920	1706920	He and his wife would help her mother move on, become independent,
1706920	1710920	and the reverend would even show up as a father figure for the kids,
1710920	1713920	all while being happily married himself.
1713920	1717920	But soon, Pauline's mother began to become paranoid.
1717920	1720920	They would also be forced to go on random late night hikes,
1720920	1723920	but they were told to not talk about it to anyone.
1723920	1731920	I was young, but still, I knew something about all of this behavior, this secrecy, was weird.
1731920	1735920	Still, despite that, I was happy.
1735920	1740920	I liked school, had friends, and mostly I felt stable, secure.
1740920	1745920	Until the summer of 1974, the year I turned 10.
1745920	1750920	That's the last time I thought of my family as normal.
1750920	1756920	That summer, my mom, my brother Ted and I went on a camping trip with Stan and civil seers.
1756920	1762920	We started in Vancouver and spent five weeks exploring western Canada and the prairies.
1762920	1768920	Pauline would soon discover that this camping trip was, suddenly, permanent.
1768920	1770920	They were not returning home.
1770920	1775920	And when asked, she would hear an excuse for the first of a million times.
1775920	1777920	I will explain when you're older.
1777920	1781920	She would also learn that the reverend and his wife had also moved with them as well.
1781920	1784920	This would become a staple for Pauline and her brother.
1784920	1789920	Every few months, they would suddenly abandon everything that they knew and loved,
1789920	1791920	and would move across the country.
1791920	1796920	Every location the family would arrive at, soon, letters would follow.
1796920	1801920	It would soon be revealed that Stan would have a hit placed on him by the mafia.
1801920	1807920	A hit specifically requested by none other than Warren, Pauline's father.
1807920	1812920	As it turns out, Warren had always been secretly associated with the mafia.
1812920	1818920	But the reason why Stan was targeted was he had counseled a man who was whacked by the mob,
1818920	1823920	and now they were afraid that Stan knew too much.
1823920	1827920	The story goes from paranoid mother and a reverend providing assistance
1827920	1831920	to mobster gangstalkers versus government agents.
1831920	1836920	And then it turns into a strange love story as the mother and the reverend end up falling in love.
1836920	1838920	What hell of a movie this would be?
1838920	1844920	And yet, for Pauline and her brother, this was a reality.
1844920	1848920	For over 20 years, they escaped being stalked by the mafia.
1848920	1851920	However, I can't help but feel that.
1851920	1857920	At least in my opinion, both of these documented stories are jarring in comparison.
1857920	1862920	Pauline's novel consists of this deep complex disturbing web of communications,
1862920	1866920	while Lawson's felt very simple.
1866920	1872920	He sat down, had lunch near some gangstalkers, and then joined them as if it were a book club.
1872920	1875920	It's quite the contrast.
1875920	1882920	However, anonymous stories seem to provide much more detail than published stories,
1882920	1886920	as if anonymity is where the real truth hides.
1886920	1894920	Therefore, it's time we take a look into the gross underbelly of this phenomenon.
1895920	1900920	I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked.
1902920	1904920	I'll be completely honest.
1904920	1907920	This whole section is what I was most excited for.
1907920	1913920	Internet forums allow for secrecy and privacy, more or less depending where that person is posting.
1913920	1919920	And with the illusion of anonymity comes the real tinfoil hat confessions.
1920920	1923920	July 11th, 2020.
1923920	1926920	A user would approach 4chan's paranormal board.
1926920	1930920	The user believes himself to be a part of a gangstalking initiative
1930920	1933920	and opens a thread for a Q&A.
1936920	1939920	Gangstalking coordination's expert here.
1939920	1944920	It's a private practice, kept quiet and at arm's length from triple letter agencies.
1944920	1948920	Industry term for what we do is DE, domestic espionage.
1948920	1953920	And legally, it isn't different from what a private investigator would be expected to do.
1953920	1958920	In practical terms, we get tech that you don't have access to.
1958920	1961920	And we use it to fuck people up and watch them try to fix it.
1961920	1965920	We make ourselves noticeable enough to be apparent to the target,
1965920	1968920	while still maintaining the appearance of coincidence.
1968920	1973920	An external observer sees a person making connections, where there are only a few similarities.
1973920	1977920	In my experience, it's more of an art than a science.
1977920	1981920	If you're a target, in other words, we'll make sure you notice
1981920	1984920	and that you look crazy for doing so.
1984920	1989920	How to tell the difference between a coincidence and a gangstalking incident.
1989920	1994920	Per gold finger, once is happenstance, twice is coincidence,
1994920	1997920	three times is enemy action.
1997920	2000920	A coincidence can still happen three times,
2000920	2005920	but the odds of it being just a coincidence go way down after that.
2005920	2010920	I'm basing this on how long it takes most people to notice the difference, of course.
2010920	2015920	We've had some oblivious motherfuckers who get followed for years without picking it up.
2015920	2020920	Someone in the last thread asked us if we only work for governmental organizations.
2020920	2023920	And the answer is, technically, no.
2023920	2029920	We are a private practice to keep things plausibly deniable on the parts of our employers.
2029920	2036920	So in effect, anyone who can afford our fees can employ our services, regardless of affiliation.
2036920	2042920	The trick is, anyone with that kind of money generally is either formally in the government
2042920	2046920	or so influential, they might as well be.
2046920	2051920	There have been exceptions, but they're rare enough to count with one hand.
2051920	2053920	Why do people get gangstalked?
2053920	2057920	Why did it only happen to me frequently when I was at my weakest?
2057920	2060920	Now when I'm stable, they rarely show themselves.
2060920	2066920	There are many reasons, and the rule of thumb is that, if you are, you probably know why.
2066920	2068920	Not always, of course.
2068920	2074920	And the more unstable targets will start talking astral fairy magic out of the gates.
2074920	2078920	However, anyone who says they're being followed because they know state secrets
2078920	2082920	or have other information are probably right.
2082920	2088920	From the perspective of the powerful, having someone killed or disappeared is unreliable.
2088920	2091920	People prepare for the potential of getting killed,
2091920	2097920	but what they don't prepare for is being made to look insane, far less being driven to that point.
2097920	2100920	It's a slow burn, and it risks information leak,
2100920	2107920	but it allows you to neutralize leaked information once the source starts talking about gangstalkers.
2107920	2113920	The user's thread lasts for hours, with users asking about personal connections, experiences,
2113920	2118920	and military involvement, and being given vague answers.
2118920	2120920	Can you ever retire?
2120920	2125920	If you keep your nose clean, it helps to change your name and get some distance between you and the work.
2125920	2129920	But if you make yourself not worth the money and time to go after,
2129920	2134920	you can go to your deathbed without any issues, or so I'm told.
2134920	2139920	This would be the final answer that OP would provide to this thread.
2139920	2144920	A few weeks prior to this thread, another poster would create a gangstalking thread,
2144920	2148920	a topic that isn't really uncommon for the export.
2148920	2152920	The user would start off with some, might say, gibberish rhetoric,
2152920	2158920	before suddenly spending the next several hours creating a survival guide to gangstalking,
2158920	2162920	or as they title it, Cointel Pro 2.0.
2162920	2168920	They copy and paste from a website that now laid desolate, creating his own table of contents.
2168920	2171920	In this table, we get chapters such as
2171920	2177920	Why is this happening to you? How to solve this? Microwave and radio wave radiation.
2177920	2181920	In total, the user would write 32 chapters.
2181920	2184920	If you want to listen to everything that was written,
2184920	2187920	I recommend you check out Tetsuya's video which I linked down below,
2187920	2191920	as he proceeds to read everything that this user wrote.
2192920	2202920	After this, the poster would tie gangstalking to being a tool of systematic oppression created by the FBI.
2202920	2209920	These tools were created as psychological warfare techniques to break one's mind and will.
2209920	2213920	This tool is none other than Cointel Pro.
2213920	2218920	Cointel Pro is an abbreviation for counterintelligence program,
2218920	2222920	a program that actually operated for almost two decades,
2222920	2227920	running from the 1950s up until 1971, its purpose,
2227920	2233920	to discredit, weaken, and diminish any political parties that opposed the United States government,
2233920	2237920	often known to be used against the Black Panthers, the Communist Party,
2237920	2241920	and anyone else labeled as suspects of the state.
2241920	2245920	When a target was chosen, their name would be slandered in the press.
2245920	2249920	If an outsider agreed with the views of said party,
2249920	2253920	they too would be seen as delusional or a potential suspect.
2253920	2256920	Your whole community would turn against you.
2256920	2260920	So, for peace sake, why get involved in the hassle
2260920	2263920	and just avoid the party at all means necessary?
2263920	2267920	I mean, you don't want to sound crazy, right?
2268920	2277920	It should be of little to no surprise that targeted individuals refer to Cointel Pro as evidence.
2277920	2281920	The definition is nearly word for word for what they're describing.
2281920	2287920	A group of people, especially government figures, secretly out to tarnish their reputation,
2287920	2290920	causing public dismay around their character.
2290920	2295920	It's easy to believe you're crazy if the entire town is murmuring slander behind your back.
2295920	2298920	It dissuades the majority from believing your story
2298920	2303920	and thus causing you to be more and more alone.
2303920	2308920	The end goal either drive you to madness or drive you out of town.
2308920	2311920	But what if you don't go outside?
2311920	2316920	What if you're an introvert, a recluse, someone who refuses to partake in society?
2316920	2319920	How are you targeted then?
2319920	2324920	And that is when the belief of energized weapons begins to conjure.
2324920	2328920	At first, I was going to joke about alien ray guns and all that,
2328920	2331920	but I decided to take this more seriously.
2331920	2337920	I looked into these wild claims and what I'm about to show you might seem borderline fictional,
2337920	2342920	but it is very uncomfortably real.
2354920	2367920	You are currently looking at various government documents and illustrations,
2367920	2372920	all containing research of energy and radio wave weapons.
2372920	2376920	Majority of these were top secret until 2006.
2376920	2383920	And right here is a documented annex of numerous United States patented files
2383920	2388920	that were filed and approved along with their description and inventor.
2388920	2393920	You can find companies such as Raytheon, an infamous weapons company,
2393920	2400920	which issued a patent in 2005 for a device that is able to direct high-power magnetic waves
2400920	2403920	at a target for weapon purposes.
2403920	2409920	Even Sony had issued a patent in 2008 in order to monitor community mood
2409920	2413920	by remotely analyzing voice, text, and biometrics.
2413920	2417920	I guess now is a good time to bring up another Sony patent,
2417920	2422920	a US 8246454B2,
2422920	2428920	which requires users to yield the advertiser's name in order to end a commercial.
2428920	2431920	That's great.
2431920	2433920	These patents are horrifying.
2433920	2438920	There's one that's purpose is to control human behavior with low-frequency waves.
2438920	2444920	Another one from the 80s had the purpose of controlling the mental state of subjects
2444920	2448920	by adding imperceptible subliminal messaging to audio signals.
2448920	2452920	And there is a whole list right here, full of these,
2452920	2455920	and God knows what other patents exist out there.
2455920	2457920	I found this one by accident.
2457920	2461920	Fuck, there's two separate files that both are described to
2461920	2466920	remotely cause individual to hear voice in medium f waves.
2466920	2469920	Imperceptible to everyone else.
2469920	2472920	A literal schizophrenia gun.
2472920	2477920	I mean, with all of this, it's not so hard to believe the victims.
2477920	2481920	There is documented proof that the government has had no issue
2481920	2485920	with the idea of toying with controlling thoughts and behaviors of other human beings.
2485920	2490920	There is a book that you can buy, or you can just find a PDF of it online,
2490920	2493920	called The Reality of Psychotronic Weapons Today,
2493920	2496920	written by Preston Bailey, PhD.
2496920	2501920	The book covers many different patents and weapons that the US government has funded,
2501920	2505920	including a distributed sound and light array debilitator,
2505920	2508920	also known as the puke ray.
2508920	2512920	It generates lights and sounds in a specific manner to overload the brain.
2512920	2516920	Prolonged exposure can result in even more unpleasant effects,
2516920	2518920	including nausea and vomiting.
2518920	2522920	Bailey even states that there's a machine called the Medusa,
2522920	2525920	a weapon that creates audio to disorient targets,
2525920	2529920	but it goes completely unnoticed by the human ear.
2529920	2537920	It apparently uses pulses of microwave radiation to generate shockwaves inside of a person's skull.
2537920	2541920	Okay, yes, so there's weapons made probably for wars,
2541920	2546920	but that doesn't automatically mean that they're used against citizens, right?
2546920	2549920	I mean, sure, the NSA record our every movement,
2549920	2553920	and sure, the FBI created the Counterintelligence Program,
2553920	2557920	and sure, the CIA created the Tempest Operation,
2557920	2559920	which is used to spy on your electronic device screen
2559920	2562920	by intercepting the radiation that emits from your device,
2562920	2568920	and sure, the CIA performed MK Ultra where they spent decades attempting to brainwash citizens,
2568920	2574920	and sure, the CIA performed the Stargate Project where they attempted and documented psychic abilities,
2574920	2577920	and sure, the CIA operated Project Chatter,
2577920	2581920	which was designed to obtain information from citizens against their free will,
2581920	2589920	and sure, the CIA made Project Artichoke where they attempted to create assassins through drug-induced hypnosis
2589920	2591920	and would force addicts to go into withdrawal
2591920	2595920	and attempt to create a new personality during their amnesia-like state,
2595920	2601920	and sure, they tested Project Artichoke on groups that were deemed as untrustworthy
2601920	2604920	during none other than 1950s America,
2604920	2608920	and sure, the CIA may have brainstormed Operation Northwoods,
2608920	2612920	which was the idea of CIA operatives bombing American citizens
2612920	2615920	and blaming it on Cuba so we could justify a war,
2615920	2621920	and sure, the United States government once tested a biohazard weapon spray on an entire city to study its spread.
2621920	2625920	Where was I going with this?
2625920	2627920	Wait, hold on.
2627920	2630920	Is the government difficult to trust?
2630920	2633920	No.
2633920	2639920	It's almost as if there's lots of documented evidence to back up the victim's theories and claims,
2639920	2650920	but does that mean every victim is being hunted by the CIA?
2650920	2654920	Well, no.
2654920	2663920	Do you believe in metal telepathy?
2663920	2669920	First, I want to circle back to the little rant I had prior to discussing the evidence.
2669920	2672920	I made a comment about an echo chamber,
2672920	2679920	the idea that the world is after you and you can't trust anyone to just give up and stay alone.
2679920	2687920	This right here could be, and more than likely is, causing significant damage to a lot of people's health,
2687920	2692920	to brush away any and all thoughts and title everyone as the bad guy.
2692920	2699920	First of all, that's an absolute, but above all else, it's single-minded and it's dangerous.
2699920	2705920	You can find a lot of people discussing that the end goal of gang stalking is to cause a person,
2705920	2708920	to cause a victim, to take their life.
2708920	2713920	But by simply telling everyone who suffers with these ideas,
2713920	2716920	whether they are based on documents or delusions,
2716920	2719920	that there is nowhere to go and no one to help,
2719920	2724920	it only fuels these depressing thoughts and ideations.
2724920	2728920	According to the Environmental Research and Public Health article,
2728920	2734920	the phenomenology of group stalking, a content analysis of subject experiences,
2734920	2743920	over 0.66% of adult women, along with 0.17% of adult men, report being gang stalked in the West.
2743920	2748920	By definition, stalking is often an individual who acts solely by themselves,
2748920	2756920	or in some cases, stalking through proxy, i.e. online, or by telling their peers to also go after you.
2756920	2764920	Their article decides that three or more separate individuals need to be involved in order for a case to be labeled as gang stalking.
2764920	2770920	They hosted an anonymous questionnaire online for adults, who defined themselves as victims of stalkers,
2770920	2776920	and they discovered that 12.3% of the participants claimed that they were being gang stalked.
2776920	2780920	The study then took 50 different written accounts to analyze deeper
2780920	2785920	and found that the victim's stories are something we're kind of already used to hearing.
2785920	2787920	Examples stating that,
2787920	2790920	It's a brainwashing military experiment,
2790920	2794920	where it's part of an overt agenda to create and test mind control.
2794920	2796920	They're creating weaponry, test it on us.
2796920	2798920	That sounds familiar, doesn't it?
2798920	2801920	I began driving a friend around to make his pot sales,
2801920	2804920	and I started noticing we would get tailed from time to time.
2804920	2807920	I knew this friend had connections in weird places.
2807920	2812920	He knows members of Anonymous, and he knows people who work at the Pentagon.
2812920	2818920	I also did a lot of research and was very vocal about being anti-government and anti-corporation.
2818920	2821920	This is what got me targeted.
2821920	2825920	Once you're on their list, your life can become a living hell.
2825920	2831920	Because I refused to join their devil cult and become an operative, I would become a victim.
2831920	2836920	My invitation to join came at an early stage via voice to skull.
2836920	2840920	This article even boils down similar traits between each victim's story.
2840920	2844920	94% of the stories mentioned being followed are surveilled.
2844920	2849920	80% mentions a conspiracy theory, normally involving government agents.
2849920	2853920	66% shared direct physical interference and harassment.
2853920	2860920	44% mentioned being targeted via noise, and 40% of victims mentioned mind control.
2860920	2868920	In the end, the article seems to acknowledge that there is a gangstalking experience happening.
2868920	2873920	Although it's seemingly impossible to determine why there's one happening.
2873920	2880920	The possibilities aren't necessarily endless, but with the little to no evidence besides word of mouth,
2880920	2886920	it's difficult, if not impossible, to proceed further with a conclusion.
2886920	2892920	Something you'll notice quickly after reading online is the concept of schizophrenia,
2892920	2896920	an unfortunate disability that millions around the globe deal with.
2896920	2901920	But targeted individuals don't see schizophrenia as just a disability.
2901920	2903920	They see it as a slur.
2903920	2907920	If you bring up the possibility of a targeted individual having schizophrenic symptoms,
2907920	2910920	they barrage you with insults.
2910920	2914920	When I posted on Patreon that I was working on a gangstalking video,
2914920	2917920	a supporter reached out and recommended a channel to me.
2917920	2922920	And after only one single video, the idea of schizophrenia is already mentioned.
2922920	2924920	Obviously, negatively.
2924920	2931920	And the uploader responds to that comment, stating that every single person who thinks that they have schizophrenia
2931920	2934920	is actually a targeted individual.
2934920	2939920	Yet, when we look into the medical field for this very concept,
2939920	2942920	the results are staggeringly different.
2942920	2945920	I mean, wow, who would have guessed?
2945920	2952920	At one point in all of our lives, we've believed in a story even before discovering if it were true or false.
2952920	2955920	This is simply a human experience that most of us have.
2955920	2959920	We hear of something that fits a personal agenda of ours,
2959920	2962920	and if it fits what we're subconsciously seeking,
2962920	2965920	then we don't always seek verification.
2965920	2971920	So it's up to each and every one of us to keep ourselves accountable for when information is proven to be false.
2971920	2975920	Except, have you ever heard of delusional disorder?
2975920	2980920	It is when a person's brain actively struggles with facts, logic, and reasoning.
2980920	2983920	And of course, it's much more complex than that.
2983920	2988920	Humans with delusional disorder struggle to balance their beliefs between real and fictional.
2988920	2992920	And what makes it worse is that, if you discuss this with them,
2992920	2996920	their disorder leads them to believe that you are wrong,
2996920	3001920	and secondly, you're actively conspiring and working against them.
3001920	3006920	The disorder isn't always associated with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disabilities.
3006920	3009920	Sometimes, it can be trauma induced,
3009920	3014920	whether from emotional manipulation, family history, or even substance abuse.
3014920	3016920	But the disorder remains the same.
3016920	3019920	Victims struggle to believe when someone's helping them,
3019920	3023920	and struggle to grasp between reality and imagination.
3023920	3029920	Similarly to schizophrenia, if gone unchecked or against medical orders,
3029920	3031920	the symptoms may increase.
3031920	3038920	Symptoms like hallucinations, psychotic depression, or manic episodes of bipolar disorder are just some ideas.
3038920	3042920	But the delusions can spread into other areas.
3042920	3049920	There is delusional jealousy, where you believe your partner is unfaithful, regardless of the lack of evidence.
3049920	3056920	There's grandiose delusions, where you believe yourself to be deserving of a crown you're all powerful and you're immensely rich,
3056920	3059920	despite your social status.
3059920	3062920	And then, there are persecutory delusions.
3062920	3069920	To suffer with persecutory delusions is to believe that you are at the end of a developed, evil plot.
3069920	3074920	You're being tracked, followed, you're being spied on and lied to,
3074920	3077920	and all of this will result in harm.
3077920	3083920	These symptoms can lead a victim to have anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and if gone untreated,
3083920	3085920	it can lead to a state of mental impairment.
3085920	3093920	The severe damage is not instantaneous and most, with many people maintaining a high level of functionality for years.
3093920	3101920	But their delusions, these hallucinations and obsessions, often resort the person to their own personal prison.
3101920	3105920	But of course, to the individual, it's more of a personal solitude.
3105920	3109920	No one can be trusted, and no one is allowed inside of their shelter.
3109920	3114920	These individuals could become too frightened to step outside of their shelter, even for work.
3114920	3123920	This act of solitude and seclusion only heightens their depression, with some cases, even facing suicidal behaviors.
3123920	3127920	This is why it's dangerous to just go online and trust what others say.
3127920	3133920	I mean, you can apply that to anything, but you could be hearing stories of pure hallucination
3133920	3140920	and getting advice from victims who have all but completely shut out every individual of their life.
3140920	3144920	Advice such as, give up and don't even try.
3144920	3151920	Advice that completely rejects the medical field and looks down upon health specialists.
3151920	3157920	There are special forms of treatment if you feel that you have symptoms which last for weeks at a time,
3157920	3161920	and if you're willing to ignore internet form moderators.
3161920	3166920	I'm not going to sit here and say the cliche, take meds, get so?
3166920	3174920	As professionals have even heavily stated that medical supplements alone are not effective towards helping with the symptoms.
3174920	3178920	The best recommendation is to seek a professional to talk to.
3182920	3185920	Do I believe gang stalking is real?
3185920	3187920	Honestly, yeah.
3187920	3193920	But that's with the inclusion of cartel members, grassroots drama, and other criminal activities.
3193920	3200920	However, the chance of everyone on the internet who claims they're being stalked by alphabet agencies and shadow governments
3200920	3204920	is next to, if not entirely, laughable.
3204920	3207920	That's just my personal opinion, though.
3207920	3211920	I will admit, there is something I did not discuss.
3211920	3217920	There are people who believe they're gang stalked by demons and demonic energy, but I'll be honest.
3217920	3222920	The idea of gang stalking spiritual warfare is far from my niche.
3222920	3230920	I attempted looking into the idea, but a lot of the videos I've watched seem to be more of support groups rather than information pieces.
3230920	3235920	So, that's a topic I'll leave for the more spiritually involved.
3235920	3241920	I hope you enjoyed this video, although I'm sure there will be some angry comments.
3241920	3247920	It felt nice returning back to the channel's roots when I plan on covering more topics like this.
3247920	3255920	Thank you all. I hope you have a great night, and as always, this has been the Maverick Files.
3277920	3282920	Thank you for watching.
3307920	3312920	I hope you enjoyed this video.
3312920	3317920	I hope you enjoyed this video.
3317920	3322920	I hope you enjoyed this video.
3322920	3327920	I hope you enjoyed this video.
3327920	3332920	I hope you enjoyed this video.
3332920	3338920	I hope you enjoyed this video.
