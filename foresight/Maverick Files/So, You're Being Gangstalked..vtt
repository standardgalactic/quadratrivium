WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Starting this year, I announced that I would be slowing down uploads, but this was not

00:05.680 --> 00:08.320
me saying that I was stepping away from Maverick files.

00:08.320 --> 00:13.600
Instead, I'm diving even deeper into improving the quality of my uploads.

00:13.600 --> 00:18.480
However, Patreon gets the behind-the-scenes of everything.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.440
Patreon supporters, in fact, have already seen this video before it was uploaded, and

00:22.440 --> 00:27.960
they see thumbnail ideas along with script updates, and if you support me on Patreon,

00:27.960 --> 00:30.600
you even get to vote on upcoming videos.

00:30.600 --> 00:34.600
They are the reason this video was made in the first place, as this topic won the last

00:34.600 --> 00:35.960
poll that I made.

00:35.960 --> 00:40.760
So, before we begin, please consider supporting me on Patreon.

00:40.760 --> 00:41.760
That's all.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.760
Enjoy your stay.

00:57.960 --> 01:22.360
It seems so radical at first.

01:22.360 --> 01:42.520
They call themselves targeted individuals, and some call themselves the chosen one.

01:42.520 --> 01:48.200
People who have been marked to have their entire life racked with paranoia and fear.

01:48.200 --> 01:54.040
It is them versus the world, a world that is full of demons, government agents, and

01:54.040 --> 02:09.480
energized terrorism, and the world's attacks are cruel and endless.

02:09.480 --> 02:12.760
Imagine you're living your day-to-day, and you're in your car getting into a heated

02:12.760 --> 02:14.560
argument with a friend.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.680
After the clash, you part ways and go home to go to sleep because you have work in the

02:18.680 --> 02:19.680
morning.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.800
On your way to work the next day, you stop to get a coffee, and while you're waiting

02:23.800 --> 02:31.120
in line, somebody behind you repeats verbatim, and mockingly, the most heated moment of yesterday's

02:31.120 --> 02:32.120
argument.

02:32.120 --> 02:38.240
You turn around, and the person smiles, coughs twice, and they leave.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.480
That first encounter seems weird, but you shrug it off.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.680
You mention it to your significant other later that day.

02:45.680 --> 02:49.760
Later that night, you're on your phone and you notice a story in your feed mentioning

02:49.760 --> 02:54.440
how your significant other is more likely to cheat in the morning.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.720
Before you go to bed, your partner will tell you that they're going to meet a friend at

02:58.720 --> 03:02.960
the gym in the morning, and now you're on guard.

03:02.960 --> 03:07.160
In the morning, you're driving to work in your car playing Pandora Radio, and a commercial

03:07.160 --> 03:14.000
for a local private investigator that specializes in treating spouses comes on in between songs.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.960
On your lunch break, you realize your partner hasn't called you all day, and as you scroll

03:18.960 --> 03:25.920
your feed, you see a comment mentioning how you are abusing your mentor position at church,

03:25.920 --> 03:28.040
and that no one likes you.

03:28.040 --> 03:33.560
You shake it off and save the post to comment later, and then you go back to work.

03:33.560 --> 03:39.120
You get to your desk, and shortly after, one of your clients calls and choose you out for

03:39.120 --> 03:41.200
an unfulfilled purchase order.

03:41.200 --> 03:45.680
The person yells at you, and is extremely rude, and then hangs up.

03:45.680 --> 03:50.920
At the end of work, you notice your significant other still hasn't called you, which makes

03:50.920 --> 03:54.680
you suspicious by this time, and so you pick up dinner.

03:54.680 --> 03:59.480
Before going home and while in line at the grocery store, a stranger says your name while

03:59.480 --> 04:02.200
having a conversation with another person.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.360
But to mention in the conversation how her friend had to leave her church group to save

04:06.360 --> 04:07.960
her marriage.

04:07.960 --> 04:13.360
On your way home, your streaming service plays nothing but songs about cheating boyfriends.

04:13.360 --> 04:19.200
You get home, and see your significant other with another person of the opposite sex, and

04:19.200 --> 04:23.960
you get out of your car, and your spouse says that his phone didn't work all day, for

04:23.960 --> 04:28.200
some reason, and his car isn't working so he couldn't buy gas.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.600
That's why the person, who is also a female, drove him home.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.760
Not to mention that she is a new client of his.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.120
You both get into house, and an argument starts.

04:39.120 --> 04:43.520
You accuse your spouse of cheating, he gets mad, and leaves.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.160
You eat dinner by yourself.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.600
Go back and check on that negative comment you saw online at lunch, but it's not there

04:49.600 --> 04:50.600
anymore.

04:50.600 --> 04:55.840
Suddenly, you're waking up, not remembering how you fell asleep.

04:55.840 --> 05:00.920
You hear a noise in your house, so you call out your spouse, but there's no answer.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.720
You hear a door slam, and then silence.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.840
You text your partner, why'd you leave?

05:07.840 --> 05:10.960
I haven't been back, and I'm still mad.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.440
Talk to you later, they reply.

05:13.440 --> 05:17.360
Now that you know that wasn't your spouse, you check your house.

05:17.360 --> 05:22.160
You find the lights are on, and the cabinet doors are open, but nothing's missing.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.160
You call the cops.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.280
They check the house, and see nothing missing or out of place.

05:27.280 --> 05:32.440
The police then ask you things like, if you've been abusing alcohol or drugs.

05:32.440 --> 05:37.600
You reply in defense of yourself, but the cops refuse to file a report since they've

05:37.600 --> 05:42.920
seen nothing like a thread, and ask if you would like to see a psychiatrist.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.000
You refuse.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.960
You claim you're not crazy, and they leave.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.400
So now you're unable to sleep now, and go to work as the morning arrives.

05:51.400 --> 05:56.680
After you arrive, your boss asks to meet you, tells you a large client that you maintain

05:56.680 --> 06:03.080
had called, and is taking her business elsewhere, and because of this, you are fired.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.640
You clean out your office, and now you're on your way home to a house that you don't

06:06.640 --> 06:08.280
feel safe at.

06:08.280 --> 06:13.360
Upon arriving, you see that your significant other is moving your stuff out while you were

06:13.360 --> 06:17.720
at work, and after another fight, they leave.

06:17.720 --> 06:22.880
Now, home alone in your house, stressed out, and not feeling safe.

06:22.880 --> 06:27.760
You try to wind down with some wine, as you wear your Harvard college sweats, and you

06:27.760 --> 06:29.240
watch some TV.

06:29.240 --> 06:33.840
You pull out your phone and scroll your feed, and you begin seeing ads for the exact same

06:33.840 --> 06:36.160
Harvard sweatshirt that you're wearing.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.960
You're getting creeped out by that, so you go to Reddit to get away from social media,

06:39.960 --> 06:44.520
and you start seeing posts about, how did you cause your breakup?

06:44.520 --> 06:48.640
And then you see a post about how, unless you went to Harvard, you shouldn't wear the

06:48.640 --> 06:49.940
sweatshirt.

06:49.940 --> 06:56.440
And after that is another post that says, my friend, insert your name, is a fuck up,

06:56.440 --> 06:58.040
how should I tell them?

06:58.040 --> 07:03.120
Okay, a little creepy, but you clicked on it because you're curious.

07:03.120 --> 07:07.320
You start to scroll down on the comments, which start off mentioning how horrible Heather

07:07.320 --> 07:13.800
is, saying that she's a fuck up at work, and another saying that she's a whino, and

07:13.800 --> 07:16.880
is never smart enough to go to Harvard.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.560
You have now reached situational awareness.

07:20.560 --> 07:25.400
Your watchers feel like they are in such a good position to do so, that they can directly

07:25.400 --> 07:27.160
ridicule you.

07:27.160 --> 07:42.840
Your phone freezes up, then turns off, but you already know that now you are being watched.

07:42.840 --> 07:48.160
After reading through subreddits, tweets, and 4chan posts, it seems that these stalkers

07:48.160 --> 07:50.400
want you to know that they're there.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.200
They want you to be aware of the never ending looming thread.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.200
Why?

07:55.200 --> 07:57.840
Well, I'm going to pause here.

07:57.840 --> 08:03.360
The issue with majority conspiracy theories is that they're resolved in absolutes.

08:03.360 --> 08:07.280
That there is one golden answer to every matter that confuses you.

08:07.280 --> 08:12.800
If you look into the corners of the web, you'll find these half brain theories scattered everywhere.

08:13.480 --> 08:23.200
And if you're not careful, you may begin to believe them.

08:23.200 --> 08:28.200
This individual is coming every day.

08:28.200 --> 08:33.280
He's been doing this for 4 years in front of our house.

08:33.280 --> 08:41.480
And I have seen him with a camera and a tripod and those woods over there.

08:41.480 --> 08:48.240
When I approached to see what he was doing, he came running out of the wood, pick up the

08:48.240 --> 08:52.120
tripod and went back to the wood.

08:52.120 --> 08:54.840
4 years doing the same thing.

08:54.840 --> 08:57.200
4 years doing the same thing.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.320
This is our house over there.

08:59.320 --> 09:03.000
That's what makes the idea of gangstalking so difficult.

09:03.520 --> 09:07.200
I'll tell you to let your boy come in and shoot with another one.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.920
And yes, I'm posted in Walmart again.

09:10.920 --> 09:17.520
I may look slump or whatnot, I just left work and I only got about 3 hours of sleep last night.

09:17.520 --> 09:25.320
So I'm coming in, you know, in Walmart again because these gangstalkers, these government

09:25.320 --> 09:31.480
officials, these military men, these agents, they've been on their job today.

09:31.560 --> 09:35.040
They've been on their job today, yesterday and, you know what I'm saying?

09:35.040 --> 09:39.280
Probably pretty much going to be on their job tomorrow, pretty heavy.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.480
But we're going to debunk all that shit.

09:41.480 --> 09:45.600
I'm just in Walmart again because they let it be on my dig.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.280
Remember I said I like New York Giants?

09:47.280 --> 09:50.480
Remember I said I like New York Giants.

09:50.480 --> 09:56.840
Why would the CIA go after you using the most mundane, boring tactics possible?

09:56.840 --> 10:01.560
Victims of this tactic are probably now screaming at the screen.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.200
That isn't that to the point.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.240
It is so no one believes us.

10:05.240 --> 10:11.400
But then if you ask these said victims about the possibility of why they're being gangstalked,

10:11.400 --> 10:14.480
you start to get some interesting stories.

10:18.200 --> 10:23.840
Menacing tales of devil worship, corporate black magic, human trafficking, celebrity

10:23.840 --> 10:30.400
cults, so on and so forth, usually which the victim has been able to outsmart and escape

10:30.400 --> 10:31.560
from.

10:31.560 --> 10:36.360
And due to their wits of outsmarting these cults of black magic, these stalker groups

10:36.360 --> 10:40.880
now follow after them as a threat.

10:40.880 --> 10:47.120
A threat, if not a reminder, that if they open their mouth at any point, they will be wiped

10:47.120 --> 10:48.840
off of the map.

10:48.840 --> 10:53.520
Then, why aren't these people wiped off of the map?

10:53.520 --> 10:57.600
These believers go across the internet shouting how they're being chased by the Rothschild

10:57.600 --> 11:01.760
family for escaping an adrenochrome farming lab underground.

11:01.760 --> 11:06.520
There are verified accounts on Twitter with large followers who talk endlessly about their

11:06.520 --> 11:08.920
gangstalker experiences.

11:08.920 --> 11:13.880
Why is it that the moment they get on the internet, they're invincible to their stalkers?

11:13.880 --> 11:18.280
If that's the case, what makes them so special that they're kept alive?

11:18.280 --> 11:22.400
Why would they just not get rid of you if they knew how much power you had?

11:24.520 --> 11:29.720
And if you keep asking them these questions, at first you'll simply be told,

11:29.720 --> 11:30.720
That's the point.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.720
They are studying me.

11:32.720 --> 11:38.720
But, if you keep prodding, you'll soon be faced with, well, absolutes.

11:38.720 --> 11:43.720
You're a federal agent, who's a part of a gangstalking community.

11:43.720 --> 11:44.720
Or?

11:44.720 --> 11:50.720
It's because I am protected by angels, and the end of Christ can't harm me.

11:51.720 --> 11:56.920
Okay, I know I'm tearing into this, and the problem with me and the majority of the

11:56.920 --> 12:02.920
internet that does this, is that some of these victims have evidence.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.920
Like, weirdly specific and rather eye-opening evidence.

12:09.920 --> 12:14.320
There are users on Instagram, Reddit, and YouTube who record what they believe to be

12:14.320 --> 12:17.320
genuine evidence of gangstalking activities.

12:17.520 --> 12:23.520
Activities such as noise disturbances, highway stalking, and electronic probes.

12:23.520 --> 12:29.520
In contrast, chosen ones will shoot down the idea of capturing evidence of them,

12:29.520 --> 12:33.520
often brushing it off saying that it's simply impossible.

12:33.520 --> 12:37.520
Stating that these perps hack into their phones and delete any evidence,

12:37.520 --> 12:40.520
or that they break into their homes to wipe any security footage.

12:40.520 --> 12:44.520
Other times, when asked if they can present evidence,

12:44.720 --> 12:47.720
they will upload content of them parading around grocery stores,

12:47.720 --> 12:49.720
harassing random customers.

12:49.720 --> 12:56.720
So, when there's actually footage, it can be kind of... haunting.

12:56.920 --> 13:02.920
Everything could have been so simple, but everybody's a meddling fool.

13:10.920 --> 13:15.920
For example, there's a user on YouTube that posts video footage along with a quick summary

13:15.920 --> 13:18.920
to what they were doing before the video began.

13:18.920 --> 13:22.920
The first clip is of a mysterious car that speeds by their house.

13:23.120 --> 13:27.120
Before, it suddenly goes in reverse all the way down the road.

13:27.120 --> 13:32.120
The uploader then goes on vacation, returns home, and that very night,

13:32.120 --> 13:35.120
the car suddenly returns.

13:35.120 --> 13:40.120
In the video, you can hear the person having a conversation with some unidentifiable person

13:40.120 --> 13:45.120
before firing a gun into the air and driving off.

13:52.920 --> 13:57.920
This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.

13:57.920 --> 14:02.920
This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.

14:02.920 --> 14:07.920
This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.

14:07.920 --> 14:12.920
This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.

14:12.920 --> 14:17.920
This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.

14:18.920 --> 14:24.920
Our first impression is probably...

14:24.920 --> 14:26.920
Go talk to the police.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.920
But according to the uploader, they tried.

14:29.920 --> 14:34.920
They tried, and the police silenced them and ignored their complaints.

14:34.920 --> 14:40.920
And going into the comments, you will find other commenters feeding into this idea.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.920
There's echo chamber of pessimism.

14:43.920 --> 14:47.920
Everyone you think can help you are all gang stalkers as well.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.920
That you're just wasting your time even trying to get justice.

14:51.920 --> 14:57.920
Your family, your husband or wife, the local police, everyone.

14:57.920 --> 15:01.920
Just give up and stay alone.

15:01.920 --> 15:19.920
They uploaded a later video displaying what they believe is evidence of them being stalked on a highway.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.920
They begin driving on one lane before letting another car merge.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.920
And this new car is labeled as another perp.

15:26.920 --> 15:31.920
The car stays directly behind their vehicle the entire time.

15:31.920 --> 15:37.920
The uploader even begins to disrupt traffic laws by going drastically under the speed limit

15:37.920 --> 15:43.920
just to see if the car would go around them, reducing their speed down to 40 miles per hour on the highway.

15:43.920 --> 15:48.920
A dangerous stunt, and yet the car remains behind them.

15:48.920 --> 15:55.920
A part of me wonders why the uploader didn't merge into a different lane themselves to really test if the perp would follow.

15:55.920 --> 15:59.920
But you can only ask so much from footage.

15:59.920 --> 16:08.920
Eventually the uploader exits the highway and the stalker does not follow.

16:08.920 --> 16:12.920
And then the video ends.

16:12.920 --> 16:19.920
Remember earlier how I said that victims and chosen ones claim that there are energy weapons that are used to attack them?

16:19.920 --> 16:28.920
The ideas behind what these weapons are vary widely from supersonic frequencies to microwave lasers that burn the victim.

16:28.920 --> 16:34.920
These supposed weapons are hidden away in secret vans or houses from across the street.

16:34.920 --> 16:41.920
And yet the very same channel would post a video stating that they had evidence of these weapons in act.

16:41.920 --> 16:46.920
They claim that there is a mechanical beeper sounding off within their walls.

16:46.920 --> 16:53.920
I don't know if you can hear this buzzing ringing sound coming from the heater.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.920
It's not the heater, the heater is closed.

16:56.920 --> 17:04.920
It's this energy passing through the heater from the other side of the lake.

17:04.920 --> 17:10.920
Making this ring sound I think is because it passed through the metal.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.920
And her.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.920
It just keeps on all night.

17:23.920 --> 17:29.920
And this is what is affecting my body.

17:34.920 --> 17:39.920
It just keeps on all night.

18:04.920 --> 18:09.920
It just keeps on all night.

18:34.920 --> 19:00.920
It's intriguing to say the least.

19:01.920 --> 19:06.920
How do we know you ain't running the bluff?

19:06.920 --> 19:16.920
What if I were to tell you that someone had once dedicated a large portion of their life to the lives of a gang stalking group.

19:16.920 --> 19:24.920
That they supposedly discovered, infiltrated and acted amongst these perps and acted as a gang stalker themselves.

19:24.920 --> 19:29.920
And then proceeded to document all of their findings.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.920
Who are we?

19:36.920 --> 19:39.920
We drive the ambulances that take you to the emergency room.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.920
When your house is burning, we put out the fire.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.920
We are security guards.

19:44.920 --> 19:46.920
We protect you at night.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.920
You only have electricity, phone and cable service.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.920
Because of us, we are the janitors.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.920
We have the keys.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.920
We fix your cars.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.920
You don't want to mess with us.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.920
We are like the police.

20:00.920 --> 20:09.920
Except we are above the police.

20:09.920 --> 20:20.920
Private investigator and author David Lawson would spend an estimated 12 years of his life researching gang stalkers primarily during the 1990s.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.920
He conducts his investigations in the United States and in Canada.

20:24.920 --> 20:30.920
And yet his writings seem to be almost completely ignored by all parties.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.920
I mean, this man supposedly broke the matrix here.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.920
He cracked the code.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.920
He broke into the secret club and documented evidence.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.920
12 years of it.

20:40.920 --> 20:44.920
This should be every chosen one's holiday, birthday and bible.

20:44.920 --> 20:49.920
So, why does no one talk about it?

20:49.920 --> 20:53.920
David would break down his documentation into two categories.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.920
What was witnessed and his thoughts following the experiments.

20:57.920 --> 21:06.920
And immediately, I can begin to understand why, perhaps, victims don't credit or cite his books.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.920
I should really just say book as in one book.

21:10.920 --> 21:16.920
Because he actually stopped printing terrorist stalking in America and updated it to cost stalking.

21:16.920 --> 21:19.920
So, it's technically the same book.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.920
Anyway, as I was saying.

21:21.920 --> 21:27.920
David actually states that gang stalkers are pinned from terrorist and anti-government establishments.

21:27.920 --> 21:33.920
A concept that is wildly in contrast to a lot of gang stalker conspiracies.

21:33.920 --> 21:41.920
A lot of victims believe they're targeted from corporations and militant figures, but David already goes against this.

21:41.920 --> 21:46.920
He reports even further that these victims are based around blatant white lies.

21:46.920 --> 21:50.920
The gang actually believes they're doing good for the community.

21:50.920 --> 21:54.920
Whether the community is a small town or an entire city.

21:54.920 --> 21:59.920
All because they've been told that the victim has a vast criminal record.

21:59.920 --> 22:04.920
Oftentimes, citing that the victim is a child.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.920
This answers, to put it simply, why the victims are attacked.

22:08.920 --> 22:12.920
These gangs generally believe that they're doing the right thing.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.920
A vigilante group rather than a terrorist group.

22:15.920 --> 22:19.920
Okay, but why are they chosen in the first place?

22:19.920 --> 22:22.920
David conjures this up to multitudes of reasons.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.920
First, being the obvious.

22:24.920 --> 22:29.920
You're a whistleblower, you know too much, or you are too loud of an activist.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.920
Therefore, you get followed and stalked as punishment.

22:32.920 --> 22:38.920
But he also speculates that a victim could be, maybe, next in line for a wealthy inheritance.

22:38.920 --> 22:43.920
Whether it being financial gain, acres of land, or a new house.

22:43.920 --> 22:49.920
Unfortunately, David also states that some victims are merely chosen as practice.

22:49.920 --> 22:54.920
A conspiracy theory that many victims do believe to this day.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.920
Which may only fuel their claims of being quote-unquote studied.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.920
David claims that he interviewed all who were involved.

23:02.920 --> 23:06.920
From stalkers, to targeted individuals, to the local authorities.

23:06.920 --> 23:10.920
Who, surprisingly, actually play a part in both ends.

23:10.920 --> 23:15.920
I won't go into every single interview because, well, there's a lot.

23:15.920 --> 23:19.920
And I have so much more to get into.

23:19.920 --> 23:23.920
City employees can be used to harass a target in many ways.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.920
Including tearing up the road in front of a target's home.

23:26.920 --> 23:30.920
Employees of pest control businesses who have access to the keys for apartments.

23:30.920 --> 23:35.920
And those who work for alarm and locksmith companies are also of interest.

23:35.920 --> 23:39.920
Surveillance is conducted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

23:39.920 --> 23:43.920
When a target leaves his residence, they will alert the group.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.920
Either by cell phone, or by a business band radio.

23:46.920 --> 23:51.920
Other members, who are patrolling the perimeter to watch for police and other vehicles driving in the area.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.920
Will race to the location to begin pursuit.

23:54.920 --> 24:01.920
If the target flushes a toilet, he may hear car horn, the sound of a power tool, or hammering for example.

24:01.920 --> 24:10.920
Entry will likely be gained through a member of the janitorial staff, pest control, or alarm technicians since they all have a right to enter.

24:10.920 --> 24:18.920
They may even be able to approach a landlord and gain his cooperation after convincing him of their quote-unquote higher purpose.

24:18.920 --> 24:22.920
He may also cooperate out of fear.

24:24.920 --> 24:28.920
Okay, these are some wild claims.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.920
But how did David Lawson even become a gang stalker?

24:32.920 --> 24:35.920
Well, rather easily he says.

24:35.920 --> 24:40.920
In his book, he talks about how he got involved from just hearing about activity from a scanner.

24:40.920 --> 24:45.920
He said his scanner picked up on a random woman reporting that she was now following a vehicle.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.920
And she listed off the car model and the license plate number.

24:48.920 --> 24:53.920
And sure enough, later that week, David would hear the same woman over a scanner.

24:53.920 --> 24:57.920
Report on different vehicles numerous times.

24:57.920 --> 25:04.920
Eventually, on the same frequency, he would hear murmurs about grabbing a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.920
So, he backed up his things and David had it out.

25:08.920 --> 25:16.920
Once he was there, he states that he found the group openly discussing various activities as if they were the police.

25:16.920 --> 25:21.920
And that the real police were also in the same vicinity as all of them.

25:21.920 --> 25:28.920
David would discover that these groups shared an AM radio station where they broadcasted conspiracies to other willing listeners,

25:28.920 --> 25:31.920
discussing things such as Waco or Ruby Ridge.

25:31.920 --> 25:33.920
They called it Hate Radio.

25:33.920 --> 25:40.920
And with this new radio station, David would tune in regularly and discover coordinates to a local group meet-up.

25:40.920 --> 25:46.920
At the first meeting I attended, one young man flashed a phony police badge at me.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.920
No one paid any attention.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.920
Some of those in attendance were the people I had seen in the local restaurant.

25:52.920 --> 25:58.920
This was my introduction to the creepy world of anti-government extremists.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.920
An ironic twist, isn't it?

26:04.920 --> 26:10.920
The people nowadays who claim they're targeted individuals often share anti-government extremist views,

26:10.920 --> 26:15.920
but back in the 90s, it was the extremists who were doing the targeting.

26:15.920 --> 26:19.920
That shouldn't come as too surprising, I guess, as even David himself

26:19.920 --> 26:24.920
quotes that the Klan developed their own systematic abuse to silence any crimes.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.920
So, when did it cross over?

26:27.920 --> 26:33.920
When does it go from anti-government extremism to Big Brother is watching extremism?

26:33.920 --> 26:37.920
Is it weird that this all feels too... easy?

26:37.920 --> 26:43.920
But then, there's evidence written from a victim's perspective.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.920
No, not from a 4chan post or a Reddit comment.

26:46.920 --> 26:51.920
In fact, it's an actual documented memoir that is available on YouTube.

26:51.920 --> 26:55.920
The memoir is called Run, Hide, Repeat.

26:55.920 --> 27:02.920
The podcast contains five episodes, which, in total, runs close to four hours in length,

27:02.920 --> 27:09.920
and as the description states, it's 1971, and Ruth Dawkins is going through a messy divorce

27:09.920 --> 27:13.920
for the future of her young children, Pauline and Ted.

27:13.920 --> 27:17.920
Pauline Dawkins' childhood was marked by unexplained events,

27:17.920 --> 27:23.920
a sense of unseen menace, and secretive moves to new cities with no warning.

27:23.920 --> 27:28.920
When Pauline was a young adult, her mother finally told her what they were running from.

27:28.920 --> 27:33.920
Organized crime, secret police, and double lives.

27:34.920 --> 27:40.920
For once, we finally get a full constructed story of gang stalking

27:40.920 --> 27:44.920
that isn't just a quick paragraph about being microwaved by the CIA.

27:44.920 --> 27:48.920
Her mother suffered abuse at the hands of a powerful husband,

27:48.920 --> 27:51.920
a man who was a dominant force in the business world,

27:51.920 --> 27:55.920
and with his power came abuse and drinking.

27:55.920 --> 28:01.920
Eventually, they would divorce and warn was only allowed the slightest amount of time to visit his kids,

28:01.920 --> 28:04.920
all with strict supervision by the mother.

28:04.920 --> 28:07.920
Pauline describes early on in her memoir.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.920
He complained that he wanted to see more of them,

28:09.920 --> 28:13.920
but they could never tell if it was because he missed his children,

28:13.920 --> 28:17.920
or if because he viewed it as losing his property.

28:17.920 --> 28:22.920
Pauline discusses that after the divorce, her mother would seek help from a reverend.

28:22.920 --> 28:26.920
He and his wife would help her mother move on, become independent,

28:26.920 --> 28:30.920
and the reverend would even show up as a father figure for the kids,

28:30.920 --> 28:33.920
all while being happily married himself.

28:33.920 --> 28:37.920
But soon, Pauline's mother began to become paranoid.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.920
They would also be forced to go on random late night hikes,

28:40.920 --> 28:43.920
but they were told to not talk about it to anyone.

28:43.920 --> 28:51.920
I was young, but still, I knew something about all of this behavior, this secrecy, was weird.

28:51.920 --> 28:55.920
Still, despite that, I was happy.

28:55.920 --> 29:00.920
I liked school, had friends, and mostly I felt stable, secure.

29:00.920 --> 29:05.920
Until the summer of 1974, the year I turned 10.

29:05.920 --> 29:10.920
That's the last time I thought of my family as normal.

29:10.920 --> 29:16.920
That summer, my mom, my brother Ted and I went on a camping trip with Stan and civil seers.

29:16.920 --> 29:22.920
We started in Vancouver and spent five weeks exploring western Canada and the prairies.

29:22.920 --> 29:28.920
Pauline would soon discover that this camping trip was, suddenly, permanent.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.920
They were not returning home.

29:30.920 --> 29:35.920
And when asked, she would hear an excuse for the first of a million times.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.920
I will explain when you're older.

29:37.920 --> 29:41.920
She would also learn that the reverend and his wife had also moved with them as well.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.920
This would become a staple for Pauline and her brother.

29:44.920 --> 29:49.920
Every few months, they would suddenly abandon everything that they knew and loved,

29:49.920 --> 29:51.920
and would move across the country.

29:51.920 --> 29:56.920
Every location the family would arrive at, soon, letters would follow.

29:56.920 --> 30:01.920
It would soon be revealed that Stan would have a hit placed on him by the mafia.

30:01.920 --> 30:07.920
A hit specifically requested by none other than Warren, Pauline's father.

30:07.920 --> 30:12.920
As it turns out, Warren had always been secretly associated with the mafia.

30:12.920 --> 30:18.920
But the reason why Stan was targeted was he had counseled a man who was whacked by the mob,

30:18.920 --> 30:23.920
and now they were afraid that Stan knew too much.

30:23.920 --> 30:27.920
The story goes from paranoid mother and a reverend providing assistance

30:27.920 --> 30:31.920
to mobster gangstalkers versus government agents.

30:31.920 --> 30:36.920
And then it turns into a strange love story as the mother and the reverend end up falling in love.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.920
What hell of a movie this would be?

30:38.920 --> 30:44.920
And yet, for Pauline and her brother, this was a reality.

30:44.920 --> 30:48.920
For over 20 years, they escaped being stalked by the mafia.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.920
However, I can't help but feel that.

30:51.920 --> 30:57.920
At least in my opinion, both of these documented stories are jarring in comparison.

30:57.920 --> 31:02.920
Pauline's novel consists of this deep complex disturbing web of communications,

31:02.920 --> 31:06.920
while Lawson's felt very simple.

31:06.920 --> 31:12.920
He sat down, had lunch near some gangstalkers, and then joined them as if it were a book club.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.920
It's quite the contrast.

31:15.920 --> 31:22.920
However, anonymous stories seem to provide much more detail than published stories,

31:22.920 --> 31:26.920
as if anonymity is where the real truth hides.

31:26.920 --> 31:34.920
Therefore, it's time we take a look into the gross underbelly of this phenomenon.

31:35.920 --> 31:40.920
I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.920
I'll be completely honest.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.920
This whole section is what I was most excited for.

31:47.920 --> 31:53.920
Internet forums allow for secrecy and privacy, more or less depending where that person is posting.

31:53.920 --> 31:59.920
And with the illusion of anonymity comes the real tinfoil hat confessions.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.920
July 11th, 2020.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.920
A user would approach 4chan's paranormal board.

32:06.920 --> 32:10.920
The user believes himself to be a part of a gangstalking initiative

32:10.920 --> 32:13.920
and opens a thread for a Q&A.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.920
Gangstalking coordination's expert here.

32:19.920 --> 32:24.920
It's a private practice, kept quiet and at arm's length from triple letter agencies.

32:24.920 --> 32:28.920
Industry term for what we do is DE, domestic espionage.

32:28.920 --> 32:33.920
And legally, it isn't different from what a private investigator would be expected to do.

32:33.920 --> 32:38.920
In practical terms, we get tech that you don't have access to.

32:38.920 --> 32:41.920
And we use it to fuck people up and watch them try to fix it.

32:41.920 --> 32:45.920
We make ourselves noticeable enough to be apparent to the target,

32:45.920 --> 32:48.920
while still maintaining the appearance of coincidence.

32:48.920 --> 32:53.920
An external observer sees a person making connections, where there are only a few similarities.

32:53.920 --> 32:57.920
In my experience, it's more of an art than a science.

32:57.920 --> 33:01.920
If you're a target, in other words, we'll make sure you notice

33:01.920 --> 33:04.920
and that you look crazy for doing so.

33:04.920 --> 33:09.920
How to tell the difference between a coincidence and a gangstalking incident.

33:09.920 --> 33:14.920
Per gold finger, once is happenstance, twice is coincidence,

33:14.920 --> 33:17.920
three times is enemy action.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.920
A coincidence can still happen three times,

33:20.920 --> 33:25.920
but the odds of it being just a coincidence go way down after that.

33:25.920 --> 33:30.920
I'm basing this on how long it takes most people to notice the difference, of course.

33:30.920 --> 33:35.920
We've had some oblivious motherfuckers who get followed for years without picking it up.

33:35.920 --> 33:40.920
Someone in the last thread asked us if we only work for governmental organizations.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.920
And the answer is, technically, no.

33:43.920 --> 33:49.920
We are a private practice to keep things plausibly deniable on the parts of our employers.

33:49.920 --> 33:56.920
So in effect, anyone who can afford our fees can employ our services, regardless of affiliation.

33:56.920 --> 34:02.920
The trick is, anyone with that kind of money generally is either formally in the government

34:02.920 --> 34:06.920
or so influential, they might as well be.

34:06.920 --> 34:11.920
There have been exceptions, but they're rare enough to count with one hand.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.920
Why do people get gangstalked?

34:13.920 --> 34:17.920
Why did it only happen to me frequently when I was at my weakest?

34:17.920 --> 34:20.920
Now when I'm stable, they rarely show themselves.

34:20.920 --> 34:26.920
There are many reasons, and the rule of thumb is that, if you are, you probably know why.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.920
Not always, of course.

34:28.920 --> 34:34.920
And the more unstable targets will start talking astral fairy magic out of the gates.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.920
However, anyone who says they're being followed because they know state secrets

34:38.920 --> 34:42.920
or have other information are probably right.

34:42.920 --> 34:48.920
From the perspective of the powerful, having someone killed or disappeared is unreliable.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.920
People prepare for the potential of getting killed,

34:51.920 --> 34:57.920
but what they don't prepare for is being made to look insane, far less being driven to that point.

34:57.920 --> 35:00.920
It's a slow burn, and it risks information leak,

35:00.920 --> 35:07.920
but it allows you to neutralize leaked information once the source starts talking about gangstalkers.

35:07.920 --> 35:13.920
The user's thread lasts for hours, with users asking about personal connections, experiences,

35:13.920 --> 35:18.920
and military involvement, and being given vague answers.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.920
Can you ever retire?

35:20.920 --> 35:25.920
If you keep your nose clean, it helps to change your name and get some distance between you and the work.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.920
But if you make yourself not worth the money and time to go after,

35:29.920 --> 35:34.920
you can go to your deathbed without any issues, or so I'm told.

35:34.920 --> 35:39.920
This would be the final answer that OP would provide to this thread.

35:39.920 --> 35:44.920
A few weeks prior to this thread, another poster would create a gangstalking thread,

35:44.920 --> 35:48.920
a topic that isn't really uncommon for the export.

35:48.920 --> 35:52.920
The user would start off with some, might say, gibberish rhetoric,

35:52.920 --> 35:58.920
before suddenly spending the next several hours creating a survival guide to gangstalking,

35:58.920 --> 36:02.920
or as they title it, Cointel Pro 2.0.

36:02.920 --> 36:08.920
They copy and paste from a website that now laid desolate, creating his own table of contents.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.920
In this table, we get chapters such as

36:11.920 --> 36:17.920
Why is this happening to you? How to solve this? Microwave and radio wave radiation.

36:17.920 --> 36:21.920
In total, the user would write 32 chapters.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.920
If you want to listen to everything that was written,

36:24.920 --> 36:27.920
I recommend you check out Tetsuya's video which I linked down below,

36:27.920 --> 36:31.920
as he proceeds to read everything that this user wrote.

36:32.920 --> 36:42.920
After this, the poster would tie gangstalking to being a tool of systematic oppression created by the FBI.

36:42.920 --> 36:49.920
These tools were created as psychological warfare techniques to break one's mind and will.

36:49.920 --> 36:53.920
This tool is none other than Cointel Pro.

36:53.920 --> 36:58.920
Cointel Pro is an abbreviation for counterintelligence program,

36:58.920 --> 37:02.920
a program that actually operated for almost two decades,

37:02.920 --> 37:07.920
running from the 1950s up until 1971, its purpose,

37:07.920 --> 37:13.920
to discredit, weaken, and diminish any political parties that opposed the United States government,

37:13.920 --> 37:17.920
often known to be used against the Black Panthers, the Communist Party,

37:17.920 --> 37:21.920
and anyone else labeled as suspects of the state.

37:21.920 --> 37:25.920
When a target was chosen, their name would be slandered in the press.

37:25.920 --> 37:29.920
If an outsider agreed with the views of said party,

37:29.920 --> 37:33.920
they too would be seen as delusional or a potential suspect.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.920
Your whole community would turn against you.

37:36.920 --> 37:40.920
So, for peace sake, why get involved in the hassle

37:40.920 --> 37:43.920
and just avoid the party at all means necessary?

37:43.920 --> 37:47.920
I mean, you don't want to sound crazy, right?

37:48.920 --> 37:57.920
It should be of little to no surprise that targeted individuals refer to Cointel Pro as evidence.

37:57.920 --> 38:01.920
The definition is nearly word for word for what they're describing.

38:01.920 --> 38:07.920
A group of people, especially government figures, secretly out to tarnish their reputation,

38:07.920 --> 38:10.920
causing public dismay around their character.

38:10.920 --> 38:15.920
It's easy to believe you're crazy if the entire town is murmuring slander behind your back.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.920
It dissuades the majority from believing your story

38:18.920 --> 38:23.920
and thus causing you to be more and more alone.

38:23.920 --> 38:28.920
The end goal either drive you to madness or drive you out of town.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.920
But what if you don't go outside?

38:31.920 --> 38:36.920
What if you're an introvert, a recluse, someone who refuses to partake in society?

38:36.920 --> 38:39.920
How are you targeted then?

38:39.920 --> 38:44.920
And that is when the belief of energized weapons begins to conjure.

38:44.920 --> 38:48.920
At first, I was going to joke about alien ray guns and all that,

38:48.920 --> 38:51.920
but I decided to take this more seriously.

38:51.920 --> 38:57.920
I looked into these wild claims and what I'm about to show you might seem borderline fictional,

38:57.920 --> 39:02.920
but it is very uncomfortably real.

39:14.920 --> 39:27.920
You are currently looking at various government documents and illustrations,

39:27.920 --> 39:32.920
all containing research of energy and radio wave weapons.

39:32.920 --> 39:36.920
Majority of these were top secret until 2006.

39:36.920 --> 39:43.920
And right here is a documented annex of numerous United States patented files

39:43.920 --> 39:48.920
that were filed and approved along with their description and inventor.

39:48.920 --> 39:53.920
You can find companies such as Raytheon, an infamous weapons company,

39:53.920 --> 40:00.920
which issued a patent in 2005 for a device that is able to direct high-power magnetic waves

40:00.920 --> 40:03.920
at a target for weapon purposes.

40:03.920 --> 40:09.920
Even Sony had issued a patent in 2008 in order to monitor community mood

40:09.920 --> 40:13.920
by remotely analyzing voice, text, and biometrics.

40:13.920 --> 40:17.920
I guess now is a good time to bring up another Sony patent,

40:17.920 --> 40:22.920
a US 8246454B2,

40:22.920 --> 40:28.920
which requires users to yield the advertiser's name in order to end a commercial.

40:28.920 --> 40:31.920
That's great.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.920
These patents are horrifying.

40:33.920 --> 40:38.920
There's one that's purpose is to control human behavior with low-frequency waves.

40:38.920 --> 40:44.920
Another one from the 80s had the purpose of controlling the mental state of subjects

40:44.920 --> 40:48.920
by adding imperceptible subliminal messaging to audio signals.

40:48.920 --> 40:52.920
And there is a whole list right here, full of these,

40:52.920 --> 40:55.920
and God knows what other patents exist out there.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.920
I found this one by accident.

40:57.920 --> 41:01.920
Fuck, there's two separate files that both are described to

41:01.920 --> 41:06.920
remotely cause individual to hear voice in medium f waves.

41:06.920 --> 41:09.920
Imperceptible to everyone else.

41:09.920 --> 41:12.920
A literal schizophrenia gun.

41:12.920 --> 41:17.920
I mean, with all of this, it's not so hard to believe the victims.

41:17.920 --> 41:21.920
There is documented proof that the government has had no issue

41:21.920 --> 41:25.920
with the idea of toying with controlling thoughts and behaviors of other human beings.

41:25.920 --> 41:30.920
There is a book that you can buy, or you can just find a PDF of it online,

41:30.920 --> 41:33.920
called The Reality of Psychotronic Weapons Today,

41:33.920 --> 41:36.920
written by Preston Bailey, PhD.

41:36.920 --> 41:41.920
The book covers many different patents and weapons that the US government has funded,

41:41.920 --> 41:45.920
including a distributed sound and light array debilitator,

41:45.920 --> 41:48.920
also known as the puke ray.

41:48.920 --> 41:52.920
It generates lights and sounds in a specific manner to overload the brain.

41:52.920 --> 41:56.920
Prolonged exposure can result in even more unpleasant effects,

41:56.920 --> 41:58.920
including nausea and vomiting.

41:58.920 --> 42:02.920
Bailey even states that there's a machine called the Medusa,

42:02.920 --> 42:05.920
a weapon that creates audio to disorient targets,

42:05.920 --> 42:09.920
but it goes completely unnoticed by the human ear.

42:09.920 --> 42:17.920
It apparently uses pulses of microwave radiation to generate shockwaves inside of a person's skull.

42:17.920 --> 42:21.920
Okay, yes, so there's weapons made probably for wars,

42:21.920 --> 42:26.920
but that doesn't automatically mean that they're used against citizens, right?

42:26.920 --> 42:29.920
I mean, sure, the NSA record our every movement,

42:29.920 --> 42:33.920
and sure, the FBI created the Counterintelligence Program,

42:33.920 --> 42:37.920
and sure, the CIA created the Tempest Operation,

42:37.920 --> 42:39.920
which is used to spy on your electronic device screen

42:39.920 --> 42:42.920
by intercepting the radiation that emits from your device,

42:42.920 --> 42:48.920
and sure, the CIA performed MK Ultra where they spent decades attempting to brainwash citizens,

42:48.920 --> 42:54.920
and sure, the CIA performed the Stargate Project where they attempted and documented psychic abilities,

42:54.920 --> 42:57.920
and sure, the CIA operated Project Chatter,

42:57.920 --> 43:01.920
which was designed to obtain information from citizens against their free will,

43:01.920 --> 43:09.920
and sure, the CIA made Project Artichoke where they attempted to create assassins through drug-induced hypnosis

43:09.920 --> 43:11.920
and would force addicts to go into withdrawal

43:11.920 --> 43:15.920
and attempt to create a new personality during their amnesia-like state,

43:15.920 --> 43:21.920
and sure, they tested Project Artichoke on groups that were deemed as untrustworthy

43:21.920 --> 43:24.920
during none other than 1950s America,

43:24.920 --> 43:28.920
and sure, the CIA may have brainstormed Operation Northwoods,

43:28.920 --> 43:32.920
which was the idea of CIA operatives bombing American citizens

43:32.920 --> 43:35.920
and blaming it on Cuba so we could justify a war,

43:35.920 --> 43:41.920
and sure, the United States government once tested a biohazard weapon spray on an entire city to study its spread.

43:41.920 --> 43:45.920
Where was I going with this?

43:45.920 --> 43:47.920
Wait, hold on.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.920
Is the government difficult to trust?

43:50.920 --> 43:53.920
No.

43:53.920 --> 43:59.920
It's almost as if there's lots of documented evidence to back up the victim's theories and claims,

43:59.920 --> 44:10.920
but does that mean every victim is being hunted by the CIA?

44:10.920 --> 44:14.920
Well, no.

44:14.920 --> 44:23.920
Do you believe in metal telepathy?

44:23.920 --> 44:29.920
First, I want to circle back to the little rant I had prior to discussing the evidence.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.920
I made a comment about an echo chamber,

44:32.920 --> 44:39.920
the idea that the world is after you and you can't trust anyone to just give up and stay alone.

44:39.920 --> 44:47.920
This right here could be, and more than likely is, causing significant damage to a lot of people's health,

44:47.920 --> 44:52.920
to brush away any and all thoughts and title everyone as the bad guy.

44:52.920 --> 44:59.920
First of all, that's an absolute, but above all else, it's single-minded and it's dangerous.

44:59.920 --> 45:05.920
You can find a lot of people discussing that the end goal of gang stalking is to cause a person,

45:05.920 --> 45:08.920
to cause a victim, to take their life.

45:08.920 --> 45:13.920
But by simply telling everyone who suffers with these ideas,

45:13.920 --> 45:16.920
whether they are based on documents or delusions,

45:16.920 --> 45:19.920
that there is nowhere to go and no one to help,

45:19.920 --> 45:24.920
it only fuels these depressing thoughts and ideations.

45:24.920 --> 45:28.920
According to the Environmental Research and Public Health article,

45:28.920 --> 45:34.920
the phenomenology of group stalking, a content analysis of subject experiences,

45:34.920 --> 45:43.920
over 0.66% of adult women, along with 0.17% of adult men, report being gang stalked in the West.

45:43.920 --> 45:48.920
By definition, stalking is often an individual who acts solely by themselves,

45:48.920 --> 45:56.920
or in some cases, stalking through proxy, i.e. online, or by telling their peers to also go after you.

45:56.920 --> 46:04.920
Their article decides that three or more separate individuals need to be involved in order for a case to be labeled as gang stalking.

46:04.920 --> 46:10.920
They hosted an anonymous questionnaire online for adults, who defined themselves as victims of stalkers,

46:10.920 --> 46:16.920
and they discovered that 12.3% of the participants claimed that they were being gang stalked.

46:16.920 --> 46:20.920
The study then took 50 different written accounts to analyze deeper

46:20.920 --> 46:25.920
and found that the victim's stories are something we're kind of already used to hearing.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.920
Examples stating that,

46:27.920 --> 46:30.920
It's a brainwashing military experiment,

46:30.920 --> 46:34.920
where it's part of an overt agenda to create and test mind control.

46:34.920 --> 46:36.920
They're creating weaponry, test it on us.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.920
That sounds familiar, doesn't it?

46:38.920 --> 46:41.920
I began driving a friend around to make his pot sales,

46:41.920 --> 46:44.920
and I started noticing we would get tailed from time to time.

46:44.920 --> 46:47.920
I knew this friend had connections in weird places.

46:47.920 --> 46:52.920
He knows members of Anonymous, and he knows people who work at the Pentagon.

46:52.920 --> 46:58.920
I also did a lot of research and was very vocal about being anti-government and anti-corporation.

46:58.920 --> 47:01.920
This is what got me targeted.

47:01.920 --> 47:05.920
Once you're on their list, your life can become a living hell.

47:05.920 --> 47:11.920
Because I refused to join their devil cult and become an operative, I would become a victim.

47:11.920 --> 47:16.920
My invitation to join came at an early stage via voice to skull.

47:16.920 --> 47:20.920
This article even boils down similar traits between each victim's story.

47:20.920 --> 47:24.920
94% of the stories mentioned being followed are surveilled.

47:24.920 --> 47:29.920
80% mentions a conspiracy theory, normally involving government agents.

47:29.920 --> 47:33.920
66% shared direct physical interference and harassment.

47:33.920 --> 47:40.920
44% mentioned being targeted via noise, and 40% of victims mentioned mind control.

47:40.920 --> 47:48.920
In the end, the article seems to acknowledge that there is a gangstalking experience happening.

47:48.920 --> 47:53.920
Although it's seemingly impossible to determine why there's one happening.

47:53.920 --> 48:00.920
The possibilities aren't necessarily endless, but with the little to no evidence besides word of mouth,

48:00.920 --> 48:06.920
it's difficult, if not impossible, to proceed further with a conclusion.

48:06.920 --> 48:12.920
Something you'll notice quickly after reading online is the concept of schizophrenia,

48:12.920 --> 48:16.920
an unfortunate disability that millions around the globe deal with.

48:16.920 --> 48:21.920
But targeted individuals don't see schizophrenia as just a disability.

48:21.920 --> 48:23.920
They see it as a slur.

48:23.920 --> 48:27.920
If you bring up the possibility of a targeted individual having schizophrenic symptoms,

48:27.920 --> 48:30.920
they barrage you with insults.

48:30.920 --> 48:34.920
When I posted on Patreon that I was working on a gangstalking video,

48:34.920 --> 48:37.920
a supporter reached out and recommended a channel to me.

48:37.920 --> 48:42.920
And after only one single video, the idea of schizophrenia is already mentioned.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.920
Obviously, negatively.

48:44.920 --> 48:51.920
And the uploader responds to that comment, stating that every single person who thinks that they have schizophrenia

48:51.920 --> 48:54.920
is actually a targeted individual.

48:54.920 --> 48:59.920
Yet, when we look into the medical field for this very concept,

48:59.920 --> 49:02.920
the results are staggeringly different.

49:02.920 --> 49:05.920
I mean, wow, who would have guessed?

49:05.920 --> 49:12.920
At one point in all of our lives, we've believed in a story even before discovering if it were true or false.

49:12.920 --> 49:15.920
This is simply a human experience that most of us have.

49:15.920 --> 49:19.920
We hear of something that fits a personal agenda of ours,

49:19.920 --> 49:22.920
and if it fits what we're subconsciously seeking,

49:22.920 --> 49:25.920
then we don't always seek verification.

49:25.920 --> 49:31.920
So it's up to each and every one of us to keep ourselves accountable for when information is proven to be false.

49:31.920 --> 49:35.920
Except, have you ever heard of delusional disorder?

49:35.920 --> 49:40.920
It is when a person's brain actively struggles with facts, logic, and reasoning.

49:40.920 --> 49:43.920
And of course, it's much more complex than that.

49:43.920 --> 49:48.920
Humans with delusional disorder struggle to balance their beliefs between real and fictional.

49:48.920 --> 49:52.920
And what makes it worse is that, if you discuss this with them,

49:52.920 --> 49:56.920
their disorder leads them to believe that you are wrong,

49:56.920 --> 50:01.920
and secondly, you're actively conspiring and working against them.

50:01.920 --> 50:06.920
The disorder isn't always associated with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disabilities.

50:06.920 --> 50:09.920
Sometimes, it can be trauma induced,

50:09.920 --> 50:14.920
whether from emotional manipulation, family history, or even substance abuse.

50:14.920 --> 50:16.920
But the disorder remains the same.

50:16.920 --> 50:19.920
Victims struggle to believe when someone's helping them,

50:19.920 --> 50:23.920
and struggle to grasp between reality and imagination.

50:23.920 --> 50:29.920
Similarly to schizophrenia, if gone unchecked or against medical orders,

50:29.920 --> 50:31.920
the symptoms may increase.

50:31.920 --> 50:38.920
Symptoms like hallucinations, psychotic depression, or manic episodes of bipolar disorder are just some ideas.

50:38.920 --> 50:42.920
But the delusions can spread into other areas.

50:42.920 --> 50:49.920
There is delusional jealousy, where you believe your partner is unfaithful, regardless of the lack of evidence.

50:49.920 --> 50:56.920
There's grandiose delusions, where you believe yourself to be deserving of a crown you're all powerful and you're immensely rich,

50:56.920 --> 50:59.920
despite your social status.

50:59.920 --> 51:02.920
And then, there are persecutory delusions.

51:02.920 --> 51:09.920
To suffer with persecutory delusions is to believe that you are at the end of a developed, evil plot.

51:09.920 --> 51:14.920
You're being tracked, followed, you're being spied on and lied to,

51:14.920 --> 51:17.920
and all of this will result in harm.

51:17.920 --> 51:23.920
These symptoms can lead a victim to have anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and if gone untreated,

51:23.920 --> 51:25.920
it can lead to a state of mental impairment.

51:25.920 --> 51:33.920
The severe damage is not instantaneous and most, with many people maintaining a high level of functionality for years.

51:33.920 --> 51:41.920
But their delusions, these hallucinations and obsessions, often resort the person to their own personal prison.

51:41.920 --> 51:45.920
But of course, to the individual, it's more of a personal solitude.

51:45.920 --> 51:49.920
No one can be trusted, and no one is allowed inside of their shelter.

51:49.920 --> 51:54.920
These individuals could become too frightened to step outside of their shelter, even for work.

51:54.920 --> 52:03.920
This act of solitude and seclusion only heightens their depression, with some cases, even facing suicidal behaviors.

52:03.920 --> 52:07.920
This is why it's dangerous to just go online and trust what others say.

52:07.920 --> 52:13.920
I mean, you can apply that to anything, but you could be hearing stories of pure hallucination

52:13.920 --> 52:20.920
and getting advice from victims who have all but completely shut out every individual of their life.

52:20.920 --> 52:24.920
Advice such as, give up and don't even try.

52:24.920 --> 52:31.920
Advice that completely rejects the medical field and looks down upon health specialists.

52:31.920 --> 52:37.920
There are special forms of treatment if you feel that you have symptoms which last for weeks at a time,

52:37.920 --> 52:41.920
and if you're willing to ignore internet form moderators.

52:41.920 --> 52:46.920
I'm not going to sit here and say the cliche, take meds, get so?

52:46.920 --> 52:54.920
As professionals have even heavily stated that medical supplements alone are not effective towards helping with the symptoms.

52:54.920 --> 52:58.920
The best recommendation is to seek a professional to talk to.

53:02.920 --> 53:05.920
Do I believe gang stalking is real?

53:05.920 --> 53:07.920
Honestly, yeah.

53:07.920 --> 53:13.920
But that's with the inclusion of cartel members, grassroots drama, and other criminal activities.

53:13.920 --> 53:20.920
However, the chance of everyone on the internet who claims they're being stalked by alphabet agencies and shadow governments

53:20.920 --> 53:24.920
is next to, if not entirely, laughable.

53:24.920 --> 53:27.920
That's just my personal opinion, though.

53:27.920 --> 53:31.920
I will admit, there is something I did not discuss.

53:31.920 --> 53:37.920
There are people who believe they're gang stalked by demons and demonic energy, but I'll be honest.

53:37.920 --> 53:42.920
The idea of gang stalking spiritual warfare is far from my niche.

53:42.920 --> 53:50.920
I attempted looking into the idea, but a lot of the videos I've watched seem to be more of support groups rather than information pieces.

53:50.920 --> 53:55.920
So, that's a topic I'll leave for the more spiritually involved.

53:55.920 --> 54:01.920
I hope you enjoyed this video, although I'm sure there will be some angry comments.

54:01.920 --> 54:07.920
It felt nice returning back to the channel's roots when I plan on covering more topics like this.

54:07.920 --> 54:15.920
Thank you all. I hope you have a great night, and as always, this has been the Maverick Files.

54:37.920 --> 54:42.920
Thank you for watching.

55:07.920 --> 55:12.920
I hope you enjoyed this video.

55:12.920 --> 55:17.920
I hope you enjoyed this video.

55:17.920 --> 55:22.920
I hope you enjoyed this video.

55:22.920 --> 55:27.920
I hope you enjoyed this video.

55:27.920 --> 55:32.920
I hope you enjoyed this video.

55:32.920 --> 55:38.920
I hope you enjoyed this video.
