1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Starting this year, I announced that I would be slowing down uploads, but this was not

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,320
me saying that I was stepping away from Maverick files.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,600
Instead, I'm diving even deeper into improving the quality of my uploads.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,480
However, Patreon gets the behind-the-scenes of everything.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,440
Patreon supporters, in fact, have already seen this video before it was uploaded, and

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,960
they see thumbnail ideas along with script updates, and if you support me on Patreon,

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,600
you even get to vote on upcoming videos.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,600
They are the reason this video was made in the first place, as this topic won the last

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,960
poll that I made.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,760
So, before we begin, please consider supporting me on Patreon.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
That's all.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,760
Enjoy your stay.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:22,360
It seems so radical at first.

14
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:42,520
They call themselves targeted individuals, and some call themselves the chosen one.

15
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,200
People who have been marked to have their entire life racked with paranoia and fear.

16
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,040
It is them versus the world, a world that is full of demons, government agents, and

17
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:09,480
energized terrorism, and the world's attacks are cruel and endless.

18
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,760
Imagine you're living your day-to-day, and you're in your car getting into a heated

19
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,560
argument with a friend.

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,680
After the clash, you part ways and go home to go to sleep because you have work in the

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
morning.

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,800
On your way to work the next day, you stop to get a coffee, and while you're waiting

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:31,120
in line, somebody behind you repeats verbatim, and mockingly, the most heated moment of yesterday's

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
argument.

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,240
You turn around, and the person smiles, coughs twice, and they leave.

26
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,480
That first encounter seems weird, but you shrug it off.

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,680
You mention it to your significant other later that day.

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
Later that night, you're on your phone and you notice a story in your feed mentioning

29
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,440
how your significant other is more likely to cheat in the morning.

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,720
Before you go to bed, your partner will tell you that they're going to meet a friend at

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,960
the gym in the morning, and now you're on guard.

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,160
In the morning, you're driving to work in your car playing Pandora Radio, and a commercial

33
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:14,000
for a local private investigator that specializes in treating spouses comes on in between songs.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,960
On your lunch break, you realize your partner hasn't called you all day, and as you scroll

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,920
your feed, you see a comment mentioning how you are abusing your mentor position at church,

36
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,040
and that no one likes you.

37
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,560
You shake it off and save the post to comment later, and then you go back to work.

38
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,120
You get to your desk, and shortly after, one of your clients calls and choose you out for

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,200
an unfulfilled purchase order.

40
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,680
The person yells at you, and is extremely rude, and then hangs up.

41
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,920
At the end of work, you notice your significant other still hasn't called you, which makes

42
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,680
you suspicious by this time, and so you pick up dinner.

43
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,480
Before going home and while in line at the grocery store, a stranger says your name while

44
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,200
having a conversation with another person.

45
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,360
But to mention in the conversation how her friend had to leave her church group to save

46
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,960
her marriage.

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,360
On your way home, your streaming service plays nothing but songs about cheating boyfriends.

48
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,200
You get home, and see your significant other with another person of the opposite sex, and

49
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,960
you get out of your car, and your spouse says that his phone didn't work all day, for

50
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,200
some reason, and his car isn't working so he couldn't buy gas.

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,600
That's why the person, who is also a female, drove him home.

52
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,760
Not to mention that she is a new client of his.

53
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,120
You both get into house, and an argument starts.

54
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,520
You accuse your spouse of cheating, he gets mad, and leaves.

55
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,160
You eat dinner by yourself.

56
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,600
Go back and check on that negative comment you saw online at lunch, but it's not there

57
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
anymore.

58
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,840
Suddenly, you're waking up, not remembering how you fell asleep.

59
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,920
You hear a noise in your house, so you call out your spouse, but there's no answer.

60
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,720
You hear a door slam, and then silence.

61
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,840
You text your partner, why'd you leave?

62
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,960
I haven't been back, and I'm still mad.

63
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,440
Talk to you later, they reply.

64
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,360
Now that you know that wasn't your spouse, you check your house.

65
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,160
You find the lights are on, and the cabinet doors are open, but nothing's missing.

66
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
You call the cops.

67
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,280
They check the house, and see nothing missing or out of place.

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,440
The police then ask you things like, if you've been abusing alcohol or drugs.

69
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,600
You reply in defense of yourself, but the cops refuse to file a report since they've

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,920
seen nothing like a thread, and ask if you would like to see a psychiatrist.

71
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,000
You refuse.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
You claim you're not crazy, and they leave.

73
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,400
So now you're unable to sleep now, and go to work as the morning arrives.

74
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,680
After you arrive, your boss asks to meet you, tells you a large client that you maintain

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,080
had called, and is taking her business elsewhere, and because of this, you are fired.

76
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,640
You clean out your office, and now you're on your way home to a house that you don't

77
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,280
feel safe at.

78
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,360
Upon arriving, you see that your significant other is moving your stuff out while you were

79
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,720
at work, and after another fight, they leave.

80
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,880
Now, home alone in your house, stressed out, and not feeling safe.

81
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,760
You try to wind down with some wine, as you wear your Harvard college sweats, and you

82
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,240
watch some TV.

83
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,840
You pull out your phone and scroll your feed, and you begin seeing ads for the exact same

84
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,160
Harvard sweatshirt that you're wearing.

85
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,960
You're getting creeped out by that, so you go to Reddit to get away from social media,

86
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,520
and you start seeing posts about, how did you cause your breakup?

87
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,640
And then you see a post about how, unless you went to Harvard, you shouldn't wear the

88
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,940
sweatshirt.

89
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:56,440
And after that is another post that says, my friend, insert your name, is a fuck up,

90
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,040
how should I tell them?

91
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,120
Okay, a little creepy, but you clicked on it because you're curious.

92
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,320
You start to scroll down on the comments, which start off mentioning how horrible Heather

93
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,800
is, saying that she's a fuck up at work, and another saying that she's a whino, and

94
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,880
is never smart enough to go to Harvard.

95
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,560
You have now reached situational awareness.

96
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,400
Your watchers feel like they are in such a good position to do so, that they can directly

97
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,160
ridicule you.

98
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:42,840
Your phone freezes up, then turns off, but you already know that now you are being watched.

99
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,160
After reading through subreddits, tweets, and 4chan posts, it seems that these stalkers

100
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,400
want you to know that they're there.

101
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,200
They want you to be aware of the never ending looming thread.

102
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Why?

103
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,840
Well, I'm going to pause here.

104
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,360
The issue with majority conspiracy theories is that they're resolved in absolutes.

105
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,280
That there is one golden answer to every matter that confuses you.

106
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,800
If you look into the corners of the web, you'll find these half brain theories scattered everywhere.

107
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:23,200
And if you're not careful, you may begin to believe them.

108
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,200
This individual is coming every day.

109
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,280
He's been doing this for 4 years in front of our house.

110
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:41,480
And I have seen him with a camera and a tripod and those woods over there.

111
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:48,240
When I approached to see what he was doing, he came running out of the wood, pick up the

112
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,120
tripod and went back to the wood.

113
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,840
4 years doing the same thing.

114
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,200
4 years doing the same thing.

115
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,320
This is our house over there.

116
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,000
That's what makes the idea of gangstalking so difficult.

117
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,200
I'll tell you to let your boy come in and shoot with another one.

118
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,920
And yes, I'm posted in Walmart again.

119
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,520
I may look slump or whatnot, I just left work and I only got about 3 hours of sleep last night.

120
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:25,320
So I'm coming in, you know, in Walmart again because these gangstalkers, these government

121
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,480
officials, these military men, these agents, they've been on their job today.

122
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,040
They've been on their job today, yesterday and, you know what I'm saying?

123
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,280
Probably pretty much going to be on their job tomorrow, pretty heavy.

124
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,480
But we're going to debunk all that shit.

125
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm just in Walmart again because they let it be on my dig.

126
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,280
Remember I said I like New York Giants?

127
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,480
Remember I said I like New York Giants.

128
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,840
Why would the CIA go after you using the most mundane, boring tactics possible?

129
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,560
Victims of this tactic are probably now screaming at the screen.

130
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,200
That isn't that to the point.

131
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,240
It is so no one believes us.

132
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,400
But then if you ask these said victims about the possibility of why they're being gangstalked,

133
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,480
you start to get some interesting stories.

134
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,840
Menacing tales of devil worship, corporate black magic, human trafficking, celebrity

135
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,400
cults, so on and so forth, usually which the victim has been able to outsmart and escape

136
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,560
from.

137
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,360
And due to their wits of outsmarting these cults of black magic, these stalker groups

138
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,880
now follow after them as a threat.

139
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,120
A threat, if not a reminder, that if they open their mouth at any point, they will be wiped

140
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,840
off of the map.

141
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,520
Then, why aren't these people wiped off of the map?

142
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,600
These believers go across the internet shouting how they're being chased by the Rothschild

143
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,760
family for escaping an adrenochrome farming lab underground.

144
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,520
There are verified accounts on Twitter with large followers who talk endlessly about their

145
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,920
gangstalker experiences.

146
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,880
Why is it that the moment they get on the internet, they're invincible to their stalkers?

147
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,280
If that's the case, what makes them so special that they're kept alive?

148
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,400
Why would they just not get rid of you if they knew how much power you had?

149
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,720
And if you keep asking them these questions, at first you'll simply be told,

150
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
That's the point.

151
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
They are studying me.

152
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,720
But, if you keep prodding, you'll soon be faced with, well, absolutes.

153
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,720
You're a federal agent, who's a part of a gangstalking community.

154
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Or?

155
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,720
It's because I am protected by angels, and the end of Christ can't harm me.

156
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,920
Okay, I know I'm tearing into this, and the problem with me and the majority of the

157
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:02,920
internet that does this, is that some of these victims have evidence.

158
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Like, weirdly specific and rather eye-opening evidence.

159
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,320
There are users on Instagram, Reddit, and YouTube who record what they believe to be

160
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,320
genuine evidence of gangstalking activities.

161
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Activities such as noise disturbances, highway stalking, and electronic probes.

162
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,520
In contrast, chosen ones will shoot down the idea of capturing evidence of them,

163
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,520
often brushing it off saying that it's simply impossible.

164
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Stating that these perps hack into their phones and delete any evidence,

165
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,520
or that they break into their homes to wipe any security footage.

166
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Other times, when asked if they can present evidence,

167
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,720
they will upload content of them parading around grocery stores,

168
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
harassing random customers.

169
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,720
So, when there's actually footage, it can be kind of... haunting.

170
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Everything could have been so simple, but everybody's a meddling fool.

171
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,920
For example, there's a user on YouTube that posts video footage along with a quick summary

172
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,920
to what they were doing before the video began.

173
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,920
The first clip is of a mysterious car that speeds by their house.

174
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Before, it suddenly goes in reverse all the way down the road.

175
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,120
The uploader then goes on vacation, returns home, and that very night,

176
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,120
the car suddenly returns.

177
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,120
In the video, you can hear the person having a conversation with some unidentifiable person

178
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,120
before firing a gun into the air and driving off.

179
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,920
This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.

180
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,920
This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.

181
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,920
This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.

182
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,920
This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.

183
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,920
This is the first time I've ever seen a car like this.

184
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Our first impression is probably...

185
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Go talk to the police.

186
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,920
But according to the uploader, they tried.

187
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,920
They tried, and the police silenced them and ignored their complaints.

188
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,920
And going into the comments, you will find other commenters feeding into this idea.

189
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,920
There's echo chamber of pessimism.

190
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Everyone you think can help you are all gang stalkers as well.

191
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,920
That you're just wasting your time even trying to get justice.

192
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Your family, your husband or wife, the local police, everyone.

193
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Just give up and stay alone.

194
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:19,920
They uploaded a later video displaying what they believe is evidence of them being stalked on a highway.

195
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,920
They begin driving on one lane before letting another car merge.

196
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,920
And this new car is labeled as another perp.

197
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,920
The car stays directly behind their vehicle the entire time.

198
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,920
The uploader even begins to disrupt traffic laws by going drastically under the speed limit

199
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,920
just to see if the car would go around them, reducing their speed down to 40 miles per hour on the highway.

200
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,920
A dangerous stunt, and yet the car remains behind them.

201
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,920
A part of me wonders why the uploader didn't merge into a different lane themselves to really test if the perp would follow.

202
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,920
But you can only ask so much from footage.

203
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Eventually the uploader exits the highway and the stalker does not follow.

204
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,920
And then the video ends.

205
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Remember earlier how I said that victims and chosen ones claim that there are energy weapons that are used to attack them?

206
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:28,920
The ideas behind what these weapons are vary widely from supersonic frequencies to microwave lasers that burn the victim.

207
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,920
These supposed weapons are hidden away in secret vans or houses from across the street.

208
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,920
And yet the very same channel would post a video stating that they had evidence of these weapons in act.

209
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,920
They claim that there is a mechanical beeper sounding off within their walls.

210
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:53,920
I don't know if you can hear this buzzing ringing sound coming from the heater.

211
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,920
It's not the heater, the heater is closed.

212
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:04,920
It's this energy passing through the heater from the other side of the lake.

213
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,920
Making this ring sound I think is because it passed through the metal.

214
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
And her.

215
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,920
It just keeps on all night.

216
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,920
And this is what is affecting my body.

217
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,920
It just keeps on all night.

218
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,920
It just keeps on all night.

219
00:18:34,920 --> 00:19:00,920
It's intriguing to say the least.

220
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,920
How do we know you ain't running the bluff?

221
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:16,920
What if I were to tell you that someone had once dedicated a large portion of their life to the lives of a gang stalking group.

222
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:24,920
That they supposedly discovered, infiltrated and acted amongst these perps and acted as a gang stalker themselves.

223
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,920
And then proceeded to document all of their findings.

224
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,920
Who are we?

225
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,920
We drive the ambulances that take you to the emergency room.

226
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,920
When your house is burning, we put out the fire.

227
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
We are security guards.

228
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
We protect you at night.

229
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,920
You only have electricity, phone and cable service.

230
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Because of us, we are the janitors.

231
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
We have the keys.

232
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
We fix your cars.

233
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
You don't want to mess with us.

234
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
We are like the police.

235
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Except we are above the police.

236
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Private investigator and author David Lawson would spend an estimated 12 years of his life researching gang stalkers primarily during the 1990s.

237
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,920
He conducts his investigations in the United States and in Canada.

238
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,920
And yet his writings seem to be almost completely ignored by all parties.

239
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,920
I mean, this man supposedly broke the matrix here.

240
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
He cracked the code.

241
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,920
He broke into the secret club and documented evidence.

242
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
12 years of it.

243
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,920
This should be every chosen one's holiday, birthday and bible.

244
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:49,920
So, why does no one talk about it?

245
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,920
David would break down his documentation into two categories.

246
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,920
What was witnessed and his thoughts following the experiments.

247
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:06,920
And immediately, I can begin to understand why, perhaps, victims don't credit or cite his books.

248
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,920
I should really just say book as in one book.

249
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,920
Because he actually stopped printing terrorist stalking in America and updated it to cost stalking.

250
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,920
So, it's technically the same book.

251
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Anyway, as I was saying.

252
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,920
David actually states that gang stalkers are pinned from terrorist and anti-government establishments.

253
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,920
A concept that is wildly in contrast to a lot of gang stalker conspiracies.

254
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:41,920
A lot of victims believe they're targeted from corporations and militant figures, but David already goes against this.

255
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,920
He reports even further that these victims are based around blatant white lies.

256
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,920
The gang actually believes they're doing good for the community.

257
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,920
Whether the community is a small town or an entire city.

258
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,920
All because they've been told that the victim has a vast criminal record.

259
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Oftentimes, citing that the victim is a child.

260
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,920
This answers, to put it simply, why the victims are attacked.

261
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,920
These gangs generally believe that they're doing the right thing.

262
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,920
A vigilante group rather than a terrorist group.

263
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Okay, but why are they chosen in the first place?

264
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,920
David conjures this up to multitudes of reasons.

265
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
First, being the obvious.

266
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,920
You're a whistleblower, you know too much, or you are too loud of an activist.

267
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Therefore, you get followed and stalked as punishment.

268
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,920
But he also speculates that a victim could be, maybe, next in line for a wealthy inheritance.

269
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,920
Whether it being financial gain, acres of land, or a new house.

270
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,920
Unfortunately, David also states that some victims are merely chosen as practice.

271
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,920
A conspiracy theory that many victims do believe to this day.

272
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Which may only fuel their claims of being quote-unquote studied.

273
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,920
David claims that he interviewed all who were involved.

274
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,920
From stalkers, to targeted individuals, to the local authorities.

275
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Who, surprisingly, actually play a part in both ends.

276
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,920
I won't go into every single interview because, well, there's a lot.

277
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,920
And I have so much more to get into.

278
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,920
City employees can be used to harass a target in many ways.

279
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Including tearing up the road in front of a target's home.

280
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,920
Employees of pest control businesses who have access to the keys for apartments.

281
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,920
And those who work for alarm and locksmith companies are also of interest.

282
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Surveillance is conducted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

283
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,920
When a target leaves his residence, they will alert the group.

284
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,920
Either by cell phone, or by a business band radio.

285
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,920
Other members, who are patrolling the perimeter to watch for police and other vehicles driving in the area.

286
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Will race to the location to begin pursuit.

287
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:01,920
If the target flushes a toilet, he may hear car horn, the sound of a power tool, or hammering for example.

288
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Entry will likely be gained through a member of the janitorial staff, pest control, or alarm technicians since they all have a right to enter.

289
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:18,920
They may even be able to approach a landlord and gain his cooperation after convincing him of their quote-unquote higher purpose.

290
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,920
He may also cooperate out of fear.

291
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,920
Okay, these are some wild claims.

292
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,920
But how did David Lawson even become a gang stalker?

293
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,920
Well, rather easily he says.

294
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,920
In his book, he talks about how he got involved from just hearing about activity from a scanner.

295
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,920
He said his scanner picked up on a random woman reporting that she was now following a vehicle.

296
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,920
And she listed off the car model and the license plate number.

297
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,920
And sure enough, later that week, David would hear the same woman over a scanner.

298
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Report on different vehicles numerous times.

299
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:04,920
Eventually, on the same frequency, he would hear murmurs about grabbing a bite to eat at a nearby restaurant.

300
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,920
So, he backed up his things and David had it out.

301
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:16,920
Once he was there, he states that he found the group openly discussing various activities as if they were the police.

302
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,920
And that the real police were also in the same vicinity as all of them.

303
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,920
David would discover that these groups shared an AM radio station where they broadcasted conspiracies to other willing listeners,

304
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,920
discussing things such as Waco or Ruby Ridge.

305
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
They called it Hate Radio.

306
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:40,920
And with this new radio station, David would tune in regularly and discover coordinates to a local group meet-up.

307
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:46,920
At the first meeting I attended, one young man flashed a phony police badge at me.

308
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
No one paid any attention.

309
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Some of those in attendance were the people I had seen in the local restaurant.

310
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,920
This was my introduction to the creepy world of anti-government extremists.

311
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
An ironic twist, isn't it?

312
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,920
The people nowadays who claim they're targeted individuals often share anti-government extremist views,

313
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,920
but back in the 90s, it was the extremists who were doing the targeting.

314
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,920
That shouldn't come as too surprising, I guess, as even David himself

315
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,920
quotes that the Klan developed their own systematic abuse to silence any crimes.

316
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,920
So, when did it cross over?

317
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,920
When does it go from anti-government extremism to Big Brother is watching extremism?

318
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Is it weird that this all feels too... easy?

319
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:43,920
But then, there's evidence written from a victim's perspective.

320
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,920
No, not from a 4chan post or a Reddit comment.

321
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,920
In fact, it's an actual documented memoir that is available on YouTube.

322
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,920
The memoir is called Run, Hide, Repeat.

323
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,920
The podcast contains five episodes, which, in total, runs close to four hours in length,

324
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:09,920
and as the description states, it's 1971, and Ruth Dawkins is going through a messy divorce

325
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,920
for the future of her young children, Pauline and Ted.

326
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,920
Pauline Dawkins' childhood was marked by unexplained events,

327
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,920
a sense of unseen menace, and secretive moves to new cities with no warning.

328
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,920
When Pauline was a young adult, her mother finally told her what they were running from.

329
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Organized crime, secret police, and double lives.

330
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,920
For once, we finally get a full constructed story of gang stalking

331
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,920
that isn't just a quick paragraph about being microwaved by the CIA.

332
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Her mother suffered abuse at the hands of a powerful husband,

333
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,920
a man who was a dominant force in the business world,

334
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,920
and with his power came abuse and drinking.

335
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Eventually, they would divorce and warn was only allowed the slightest amount of time to visit his kids,

336
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,920
all with strict supervision by the mother.

337
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Pauline describes early on in her memoir.

338
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,920
He complained that he wanted to see more of them,

339
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,920
but they could never tell if it was because he missed his children,

340
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,920
or if because he viewed it as losing his property.

341
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,920
Pauline discusses that after the divorce, her mother would seek help from a reverend.

342
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,920
He and his wife would help her mother move on, become independent,

343
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,920
and the reverend would even show up as a father figure for the kids,

344
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,920
all while being happily married himself.

345
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,920
But soon, Pauline's mother began to become paranoid.

346
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,920
They would also be forced to go on random late night hikes,

347
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,920
but they were told to not talk about it to anyone.

348
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:51,920
I was young, but still, I knew something about all of this behavior, this secrecy, was weird.

349
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Still, despite that, I was happy.

350
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,920
I liked school, had friends, and mostly I felt stable, secure.

351
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,920
Until the summer of 1974, the year I turned 10.

352
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,920
That's the last time I thought of my family as normal.

353
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:16,920
That summer, my mom, my brother Ted and I went on a camping trip with Stan and civil seers.

354
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:22,920
We started in Vancouver and spent five weeks exploring western Canada and the prairies.

355
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Pauline would soon discover that this camping trip was, suddenly, permanent.

356
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,920
They were not returning home.

357
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,920
And when asked, she would hear an excuse for the first of a million times.

358
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
I will explain when you're older.

359
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,920
She would also learn that the reverend and his wife had also moved with them as well.

360
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,920
This would become a staple for Pauline and her brother.

361
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Every few months, they would suddenly abandon everything that they knew and loved,

362
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
and would move across the country.

363
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,920
Every location the family would arrive at, soon, letters would follow.

364
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,920
It would soon be revealed that Stan would have a hit placed on him by the mafia.

365
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,920
A hit specifically requested by none other than Warren, Pauline's father.

366
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,920
As it turns out, Warren had always been secretly associated with the mafia.

367
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,920
But the reason why Stan was targeted was he had counseled a man who was whacked by the mob,

368
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,920
and now they were afraid that Stan knew too much.

369
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,920
The story goes from paranoid mother and a reverend providing assistance

370
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,920
to mobster gangstalkers versus government agents.

371
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:36,920
And then it turns into a strange love story as the mother and the reverend end up falling in love.

372
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
What hell of a movie this would be?

373
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:44,920
And yet, for Pauline and her brother, this was a reality.

374
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,920
For over 20 years, they escaped being stalked by the mafia.

375
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,920
However, I can't help but feel that.

376
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,920
At least in my opinion, both of these documented stories are jarring in comparison.

377
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,920
Pauline's novel consists of this deep complex disturbing web of communications,

378
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,920
while Lawson's felt very simple.

379
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:12,920
He sat down, had lunch near some gangstalkers, and then joined them as if it were a book club.

380
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,920
It's quite the contrast.

381
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:22,920
However, anonymous stories seem to provide much more detail than published stories,

382
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,920
as if anonymity is where the real truth hides.

383
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Therefore, it's time we take a look into the gross underbelly of this phenomenon.

384
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,920
I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked.

385
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,920
I'll be completely honest.

386
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,920
This whole section is what I was most excited for.

387
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:53,920
Internet forums allow for secrecy and privacy, more or less depending where that person is posting.

388
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,920
And with the illusion of anonymity comes the real tinfoil hat confessions.

389
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,920
July 11th, 2020.

390
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,920
A user would approach 4chan's paranormal board.

391
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,920
The user believes himself to be a part of a gangstalking initiative

392
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,920
and opens a thread for a Q&A.

393
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,920
Gangstalking coordination's expert here.

394
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,920
It's a private practice, kept quiet and at arm's length from triple letter agencies.

395
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,920
Industry term for what we do is DE, domestic espionage.

396
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,920
And legally, it isn't different from what a private investigator would be expected to do.

397
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,920
In practical terms, we get tech that you don't have access to.

398
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,920
And we use it to fuck people up and watch them try to fix it.

399
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,920
We make ourselves noticeable enough to be apparent to the target,

400
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,920
while still maintaining the appearance of coincidence.

401
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,920
An external observer sees a person making connections, where there are only a few similarities.

402
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,920
In my experience, it's more of an art than a science.

403
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,920
If you're a target, in other words, we'll make sure you notice

404
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,920
and that you look crazy for doing so.

405
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,920
How to tell the difference between a coincidence and a gangstalking incident.

406
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Per gold finger, once is happenstance, twice is coincidence,

407
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,920
three times is enemy action.

408
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,920
A coincidence can still happen three times,

409
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,920
but the odds of it being just a coincidence go way down after that.

410
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,920
I'm basing this on how long it takes most people to notice the difference, of course.

411
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,920
We've had some oblivious motherfuckers who get followed for years without picking it up.

412
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,920
Someone in the last thread asked us if we only work for governmental organizations.

413
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,920
And the answer is, technically, no.

414
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,920
We are a private practice to keep things plausibly deniable on the parts of our employers.

415
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:56,920
So in effect, anyone who can afford our fees can employ our services, regardless of affiliation.

416
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:02,920
The trick is, anyone with that kind of money generally is either formally in the government

417
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,920
or so influential, they might as well be.

418
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,920
There have been exceptions, but they're rare enough to count with one hand.

419
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
Why do people get gangstalked?

420
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,920
Why did it only happen to me frequently when I was at my weakest?

421
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Now when I'm stable, they rarely show themselves.

422
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,920
There are many reasons, and the rule of thumb is that, if you are, you probably know why.

423
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Not always, of course.

424
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:34,920
And the more unstable targets will start talking astral fairy magic out of the gates.

425
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,920
However, anyone who says they're being followed because they know state secrets

426
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,920
or have other information are probably right.

427
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:48,920
From the perspective of the powerful, having someone killed or disappeared is unreliable.

428
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,920
People prepare for the potential of getting killed,

429
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:57,920
but what they don't prepare for is being made to look insane, far less being driven to that point.

430
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,920
It's a slow burn, and it risks information leak,

431
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:07,920
but it allows you to neutralize leaked information once the source starts talking about gangstalkers.

432
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,920
The user's thread lasts for hours, with users asking about personal connections, experiences,

433
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,920
and military involvement, and being given vague answers.

434
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Can you ever retire?

435
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,920
If you keep your nose clean, it helps to change your name and get some distance between you and the work.

436
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,920
But if you make yourself not worth the money and time to go after,

437
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,920
you can go to your deathbed without any issues, or so I'm told.

438
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,920
This would be the final answer that OP would provide to this thread.

439
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,920
A few weeks prior to this thread, another poster would create a gangstalking thread,

440
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,920
a topic that isn't really uncommon for the export.

441
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,920
The user would start off with some, might say, gibberish rhetoric,

442
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,920
before suddenly spending the next several hours creating a survival guide to gangstalking,

443
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,920
or as they title it, Cointel Pro 2.0.

444
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,920
They copy and paste from a website that now laid desolate, creating his own table of contents.

445
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,920
In this table, we get chapters such as

446
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Why is this happening to you? How to solve this? Microwave and radio wave radiation.

447
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,920
In total, the user would write 32 chapters.

448
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,920
If you want to listen to everything that was written,

449
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,920
I recommend you check out Tetsuya's video which I linked down below,

450
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,920
as he proceeds to read everything that this user wrote.

451
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:42,920
After this, the poster would tie gangstalking to being a tool of systematic oppression created by the FBI.

452
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:49,920
These tools were created as psychological warfare techniques to break one's mind and will.

453
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,920
This tool is none other than Cointel Pro.

454
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,920
Cointel Pro is an abbreviation for counterintelligence program,

455
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,920
a program that actually operated for almost two decades,

456
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,920
running from the 1950s up until 1971, its purpose,

457
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,920
to discredit, weaken, and diminish any political parties that opposed the United States government,

458
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,920
often known to be used against the Black Panthers, the Communist Party,

459
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,920
and anyone else labeled as suspects of the state.

460
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,920
When a target was chosen, their name would be slandered in the press.

461
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,920
If an outsider agreed with the views of said party,

462
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,920
they too would be seen as delusional or a potential suspect.

463
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,920
Your whole community would turn against you.

464
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,920
So, for peace sake, why get involved in the hassle

465
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,920
and just avoid the party at all means necessary?

466
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,920
I mean, you don't want to sound crazy, right?

467
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:57,920
It should be of little to no surprise that targeted individuals refer to Cointel Pro as evidence.

468
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,920
The definition is nearly word for word for what they're describing.

469
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,920
A group of people, especially government figures, secretly out to tarnish their reputation,

470
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,920
causing public dismay around their character.

471
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,920
It's easy to believe you're crazy if the entire town is murmuring slander behind your back.

472
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,920
It dissuades the majority from believing your story

473
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,920
and thus causing you to be more and more alone.

474
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,920
The end goal either drive you to madness or drive you out of town.

475
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,920
But what if you don't go outside?

476
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,920
What if you're an introvert, a recluse, someone who refuses to partake in society?

477
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,920
How are you targeted then?

478
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,920
And that is when the belief of energized weapons begins to conjure.

479
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,920
At first, I was going to joke about alien ray guns and all that,

480
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,920
but I decided to take this more seriously.

481
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,920
I looked into these wild claims and what I'm about to show you might seem borderline fictional,

482
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,920
but it is very uncomfortably real.

483
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:27,920
You are currently looking at various government documents and illustrations,

484
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,920
all containing research of energy and radio wave weapons.

485
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,920
Majority of these were top secret until 2006.

486
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,920
And right here is a documented annex of numerous United States patented files

487
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,920
that were filed and approved along with their description and inventor.

488
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,920
You can find companies such as Raytheon, an infamous weapons company,

489
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,920
which issued a patent in 2005 for a device that is able to direct high-power magnetic waves

490
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,920
at a target for weapon purposes.

491
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Even Sony had issued a patent in 2008 in order to monitor community mood

492
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,920
by remotely analyzing voice, text, and biometrics.

493
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,920
I guess now is a good time to bring up another Sony patent,

494
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,920
a US 8246454B2,

495
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,920
which requires users to yield the advertiser's name in order to end a commercial.

496
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,920
That's great.

497
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,920
These patents are horrifying.

498
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,920
There's one that's purpose is to control human behavior with low-frequency waves.

499
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,920
Another one from the 80s had the purpose of controlling the mental state of subjects

500
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,920
by adding imperceptible subliminal messaging to audio signals.

501
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,920
And there is a whole list right here, full of these,

502
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,920
and God knows what other patents exist out there.

503
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
I found this one by accident.

504
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Fuck, there's two separate files that both are described to

505
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,920
remotely cause individual to hear voice in medium f waves.

506
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,920
Imperceptible to everyone else.

507
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,920
A literal schizophrenia gun.

508
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,920
I mean, with all of this, it's not so hard to believe the victims.

509
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,920
There is documented proof that the government has had no issue

510
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,920
with the idea of toying with controlling thoughts and behaviors of other human beings.

511
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,920
There is a book that you can buy, or you can just find a PDF of it online,

512
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,920
called The Reality of Psychotronic Weapons Today,

513
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,920
written by Preston Bailey, PhD.

514
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,920
The book covers many different patents and weapons that the US government has funded,

515
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,920
including a distributed sound and light array debilitator,

516
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,920
also known as the puke ray.

517
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,920
It generates lights and sounds in a specific manner to overload the brain.

518
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,920
Prolonged exposure can result in even more unpleasant effects,

519
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,920
including nausea and vomiting.

520
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Bailey even states that there's a machine called the Medusa,

521
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,920
a weapon that creates audio to disorient targets,

522
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,920
but it goes completely unnoticed by the human ear.

523
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:17,920
It apparently uses pulses of microwave radiation to generate shockwaves inside of a person's skull.

524
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Okay, yes, so there's weapons made probably for wars,

525
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,920
but that doesn't automatically mean that they're used against citizens, right?

526
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,920
I mean, sure, the NSA record our every movement,

527
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,920
and sure, the FBI created the Counterintelligence Program,

528
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,920
and sure, the CIA created the Tempest Operation,

529
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
which is used to spy on your electronic device screen

530
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,920
by intercepting the radiation that emits from your device,

531
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,920
and sure, the CIA performed MK Ultra where they spent decades attempting to brainwash citizens,

532
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:54,920
and sure, the CIA performed the Stargate Project where they attempted and documented psychic abilities,

533
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,920
and sure, the CIA operated Project Chatter,

534
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,920
which was designed to obtain information from citizens against their free will,

535
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:09,920
and sure, the CIA made Project Artichoke where they attempted to create assassins through drug-induced hypnosis

536
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,920
and would force addicts to go into withdrawal

537
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,920
and attempt to create a new personality during their amnesia-like state,

538
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,920
and sure, they tested Project Artichoke on groups that were deemed as untrustworthy

539
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,920
during none other than 1950s America,

540
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,920
and sure, the CIA may have brainstormed Operation Northwoods,

541
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,920
which was the idea of CIA operatives bombing American citizens

542
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,920
and blaming it on Cuba so we could justify a war,

543
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,920
and sure, the United States government once tested a biohazard weapon spray on an entire city to study its spread.

544
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,920
Where was I going with this?

545
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Wait, hold on.

546
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,920
Is the government difficult to trust?

547
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,920
No.

548
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,920
It's almost as if there's lots of documented evidence to back up the victim's theories and claims,

549
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:10,920
but does that mean every victim is being hunted by the CIA?

550
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,920
Well, no.

551
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Do you believe in metal telepathy?

552
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,920
First, I want to circle back to the little rant I had prior to discussing the evidence.

553
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,920
I made a comment about an echo chamber,

554
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:39,920
the idea that the world is after you and you can't trust anyone to just give up and stay alone.

555
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:47,920
This right here could be, and more than likely is, causing significant damage to a lot of people's health,

556
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,920
to brush away any and all thoughts and title everyone as the bad guy.

557
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,920
First of all, that's an absolute, but above all else, it's single-minded and it's dangerous.

558
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,920
You can find a lot of people discussing that the end goal of gang stalking is to cause a person,

559
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,920
to cause a victim, to take their life.

560
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,920
But by simply telling everyone who suffers with these ideas,

561
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,920
whether they are based on documents or delusions,

562
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,920
that there is nowhere to go and no one to help,

563
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,920
it only fuels these depressing thoughts and ideations.

564
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,920
According to the Environmental Research and Public Health article,

565
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,920
the phenomenology of group stalking, a content analysis of subject experiences,

566
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:43,920
over 0.66% of adult women, along with 0.17% of adult men, report being gang stalked in the West.

567
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,920
By definition, stalking is often an individual who acts solely by themselves,

568
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:56,920
or in some cases, stalking through proxy, i.e. online, or by telling their peers to also go after you.

569
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:04,920
Their article decides that three or more separate individuals need to be involved in order for a case to be labeled as gang stalking.

570
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:10,920
They hosted an anonymous questionnaire online for adults, who defined themselves as victims of stalkers,

571
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,920
and they discovered that 12.3% of the participants claimed that they were being gang stalked.

572
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,920
The study then took 50 different written accounts to analyze deeper

573
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,920
and found that the victim's stories are something we're kind of already used to hearing.

574
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,920
Examples stating that,

575
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,920
It's a brainwashing military experiment,

576
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,920
where it's part of an overt agenda to create and test mind control.

577
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
They're creating weaponry, test it on us.

578
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,920
That sounds familiar, doesn't it?

579
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,920
I began driving a friend around to make his pot sales,

580
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,920
and I started noticing we would get tailed from time to time.

581
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,920
I knew this friend had connections in weird places.

582
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,920
He knows members of Anonymous, and he knows people who work at the Pentagon.

583
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,920
I also did a lot of research and was very vocal about being anti-government and anti-corporation.

584
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,920
This is what got me targeted.

585
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,920
Once you're on their list, your life can become a living hell.

586
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,920
Because I refused to join their devil cult and become an operative, I would become a victim.

587
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,920
My invitation to join came at an early stage via voice to skull.

588
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,920
This article even boils down similar traits between each victim's story.

589
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,920
94% of the stories mentioned being followed are surveilled.

590
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,920
80% mentions a conspiracy theory, normally involving government agents.

591
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,920
66% shared direct physical interference and harassment.

592
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:40,920
44% mentioned being targeted via noise, and 40% of victims mentioned mind control.

593
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:48,920
In the end, the article seems to acknowledge that there is a gangstalking experience happening.

594
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,920
Although it's seemingly impossible to determine why there's one happening.

595
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:00,920
The possibilities aren't necessarily endless, but with the little to no evidence besides word of mouth,

596
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,920
it's difficult, if not impossible, to proceed further with a conclusion.

597
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,920
Something you'll notice quickly after reading online is the concept of schizophrenia,

598
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,920
an unfortunate disability that millions around the globe deal with.

599
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,920
But targeted individuals don't see schizophrenia as just a disability.

600
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,920
They see it as a slur.

601
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,920
If you bring up the possibility of a targeted individual having schizophrenic symptoms,

602
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,920
they barrage you with insults.

603
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,920
When I posted on Patreon that I was working on a gangstalking video,

604
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,920
a supporter reached out and recommended a channel to me.

605
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,920
And after only one single video, the idea of schizophrenia is already mentioned.

606
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,920
Obviously, negatively.

607
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:51,920
And the uploader responds to that comment, stating that every single person who thinks that they have schizophrenia

608
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,920
is actually a targeted individual.

609
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,920
Yet, when we look into the medical field for this very concept,

610
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,920
the results are staggeringly different.

611
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,920
I mean, wow, who would have guessed?

612
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,920
At one point in all of our lives, we've believed in a story even before discovering if it were true or false.

613
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,920
This is simply a human experience that most of us have.

614
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,920
We hear of something that fits a personal agenda of ours,

615
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,920
and if it fits what we're subconsciously seeking,

616
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,920
then we don't always seek verification.

617
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,920
So it's up to each and every one of us to keep ourselves accountable for when information is proven to be false.

618
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,920
Except, have you ever heard of delusional disorder?

619
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,920
It is when a person's brain actively struggles with facts, logic, and reasoning.

620
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,920
And of course, it's much more complex than that.

621
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,920
Humans with delusional disorder struggle to balance their beliefs between real and fictional.

622
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,920
And what makes it worse is that, if you discuss this with them,

623
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,920
their disorder leads them to believe that you are wrong,

624
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,920
and secondly, you're actively conspiring and working against them.

625
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,920
The disorder isn't always associated with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disabilities.

626
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,920
Sometimes, it can be trauma induced,

627
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,920
whether from emotional manipulation, family history, or even substance abuse.

628
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,920
But the disorder remains the same.

629
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,920
Victims struggle to believe when someone's helping them,

630
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,920
and struggle to grasp between reality and imagination.

631
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Similarly to schizophrenia, if gone unchecked or against medical orders,

632
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,920
the symptoms may increase.

633
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:38,920
Symptoms like hallucinations, psychotic depression, or manic episodes of bipolar disorder are just some ideas.

634
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,920
But the delusions can spread into other areas.

635
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:49,920
There is delusional jealousy, where you believe your partner is unfaithful, regardless of the lack of evidence.

636
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:56,920
There's grandiose delusions, where you believe yourself to be deserving of a crown you're all powerful and you're immensely rich,

637
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,920
despite your social status.

638
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,920
And then, there are persecutory delusions.

639
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:09,920
To suffer with persecutory delusions is to believe that you are at the end of a developed, evil plot.

640
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,920
You're being tracked, followed, you're being spied on and lied to,

641
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,920
and all of this will result in harm.

642
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,920
These symptoms can lead a victim to have anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and if gone untreated,

643
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,920
it can lead to a state of mental impairment.

644
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:33,920
The severe damage is not instantaneous and most, with many people maintaining a high level of functionality for years.

645
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:41,920
But their delusions, these hallucinations and obsessions, often resort the person to their own personal prison.

646
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,920
But of course, to the individual, it's more of a personal solitude.

647
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,920
No one can be trusted, and no one is allowed inside of their shelter.

648
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,920
These individuals could become too frightened to step outside of their shelter, even for work.

649
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:03,920
This act of solitude and seclusion only heightens their depression, with some cases, even facing suicidal behaviors.

650
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,920
This is why it's dangerous to just go online and trust what others say.

651
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,920
I mean, you can apply that to anything, but you could be hearing stories of pure hallucination

652
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:20,920
and getting advice from victims who have all but completely shut out every individual of their life.

653
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,920
Advice such as, give up and don't even try.

654
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:31,920
Advice that completely rejects the medical field and looks down upon health specialists.

655
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,920
There are special forms of treatment if you feel that you have symptoms which last for weeks at a time,

656
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,920
and if you're willing to ignore internet form moderators.

657
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,920
I'm not going to sit here and say the cliche, take meds, get so?

658
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:54,920
As professionals have even heavily stated that medical supplements alone are not effective towards helping with the symptoms.

659
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,920
The best recommendation is to seek a professional to talk to.

660
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,920
Do I believe gang stalking is real?

661
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,920
Honestly, yeah.

662
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,920
But that's with the inclusion of cartel members, grassroots drama, and other criminal activities.

663
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:20,920
However, the chance of everyone on the internet who claims they're being stalked by alphabet agencies and shadow governments

664
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,920
is next to, if not entirely, laughable.

665
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,920
That's just my personal opinion, though.

666
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,920
I will admit, there is something I did not discuss.

667
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,920
There are people who believe they're gang stalked by demons and demonic energy, but I'll be honest.

668
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,920
The idea of gang stalking spiritual warfare is far from my niche.

669
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:50,920
I attempted looking into the idea, but a lot of the videos I've watched seem to be more of support groups rather than information pieces.

670
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,920
So, that's a topic I'll leave for the more spiritually involved.

671
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:01,920
I hope you enjoyed this video, although I'm sure there will be some angry comments.

672
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,920
It felt nice returning back to the channel's roots when I plan on covering more topics like this.

673
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:15,920
Thank you all. I hope you have a great night, and as always, this has been the Maverick Files.

674
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,920
Thank you for watching.

675
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,920
I hope you enjoyed this video.

676
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:17,920
I hope you enjoyed this video.

677
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,920
I hope you enjoyed this video.

678
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,920
I hope you enjoyed this video.

679
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,920
I hope you enjoyed this video.

680
