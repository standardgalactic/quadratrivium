0	5880	And I think one of the reasons that chat GPT and stuff have been so hyped recently is because most people don't know what it is.
5880	11880	And so when you see it doing what it does, you think this thing must basically be a person, right?
11880	13240	Because it's acting like one.
13240	18000	And I should carry out this by saying I'm not selling short these incredible technologies.
18000	22400	I'm just saying that it would be very silly to just completely use them blind and never check what they do, right?
22400	24560	Because we know they just make stuff up a lot of the time.
24560	26080	I'm glad you mentioned computer science.
26160	34960	Do you think it's time for more of us to learn computer science-type stuff because of AI, like maths and all these computer science stuff and not really?
40760	44040	I've been saying that you need to learn artificial intelligence or AI.
44040	48040	Question that a lot of you have been asking me is, OK, so how do I learn that?
48040	49480	So let's ask another friend.
51680	52120	David.
52120	52720	Yes.
52720	58560	You've mentioned this before, but remind me which place do you recommend that I learn and others learn AI?
58560	60120	I really like Brilliant.
60120	70200	It's one of those places where you can go and a visual gamified way to learn concepts and mathematics behind AI and machine learning.
70200	72560	You've recommended this a few times to me.
72560	78640	The way you said it was, David, if you want to learn AI, I need to learn like statistics and stuff like that, right?
78640	89280	Yes, they've got these roadmaps that actually helps you with calculus and learning statistics and linear algebra, all the stuff that you need to know for AI.
89280	89840	I'll say this.
89840	92200	David is on my team, really glad that he is.
92200	96160	David has strengths that I don't have, and I think that's what's really important in life.
96160	97840	You need to learn from others.
97840	99880	David, well, tell us, you've done a lot of maths.
99880	101360	You've done a lot of computer science.
101360	103080	You've actually worked with AI stuff, right?
103080	107520	I worked in the medical field for data science stuff.
108400	120440	I really think you need to know all the statistics and calculus and linear algebra and the discrete mathematics that you need to learn, which actually makes a lot of coding a lot easier for you.
120440	120960	That's brilliant.
120960	122880	So I'm looking on their website now.
122880	127400	The one that you've recommended that I go through is the Data Science Foundations, right?
127400	134320	That's like probability, applied probability, statistics, fundamentals, and then an introduction to neural networks.
134320	136480	And obviously, me being me, I just skipped all of that.
136480	138240	They went straight to learning neural networks.
138240	142000	But as David said, what I really like about this website is it's gamified, as he said.
142000	143840	So really great way to get started.
143840	146080	Really want to thank Brilliant for sponsoring this video.
146080	147560	Brilliant, as they say in the UK.
147560	148080	Thanks.
148080	151560	Everyone, it's David Bombal back with Dr. Mike Pound.
151560	152280	Mike, welcome.
152280	154160	Thanks for having me back again.
154160	157000	Mike, it feels like the sky's falling again.
157000	163840	You know, we had this interview previously and it was all this hype about AI, but it seems to just be getting hotter and hotter.
163880	165160	So tell me, is the sky falling?
165160	166080	Am I going to lose my job?
166080	166960	Is the future bleak?
166960	168440	I think I think it'll be all right.
168440	170440	Just relax.
170440	172240	Relax.
172240	175360	Um, just bring me into calm everything down a bit.
175360	182480	That's, that's, you know, I think that the last six months particularly have been, you know, both unbelievable in terms of genuine hype,
182480	190200	like things that are really exciting appearing and also obviously totally overboard hype that's just getting really quite silly and everyone needs to calm down.
190200	190480	Right.
190480	193000	So I think there's a bit of everything going on.
193000	197600	Chat and GPT is an incredibly impressive tool that works very, very well.
197600	202160	I've done some really fun tests of it where I push to see what it will do.
202160	205480	And some of the things it will do are quite amazing, right?
205480	209240	On the other hand, there are lots of things it doesn't do very well.
209240	214000	And one of the big problems we have at the moment is it won't always tell you it's one of those things.
214000	217000	And that's, I think, where we have something that needs addressing.
217000	220760	I've done some tests and I mean, a lot of people I know have done tests.
220760	224560	And it's amazing what it seems to be able to produce.
224560	229760	I think the concern a lot of people have is like, Mike, I'm 18 years old or let's say I'm older.
229760	237000	I want to switch careers to become a programmer or I want to get into cybersecurity or I want to be a network engineer, whatever, some technical role.
237000	242240	And it feels like I'm just going to waste my time because Chat GPT is just going to obliterate jobs.
242240	250240	The first thing I would observe is that it's very nice for some of these big tech companies, if that's the perception, because it makes them look very, very impressive, right?
250240	256760	And so I think that the cynic in me a little bit is like, this is, you know, no PR is bad PR kind of a situation.
256760	263400	They like to drop, you know, these tools get dropped as incredibly impressive tech demos and I'm not selling them short, right?
263400	269000	Very impressive, but maybe not quite as impressive as they first appear on a service when you start to dig in.
269000	270480	And I think that's what's really important.
270480	275520	You know, in science, we spend a lot of time checking things and rechecking them, at least that's what we're supposed to do, right?
275560	281520	So I, you know, a PhD student comes to my office with some results and they say, oh, we've got 95% accuracy on some task.
281520	288760	And I think, OK, let's talk about which data you used and whether that's really true and whether when you use it on this new data, you're going to get that same result.
288760	295120	And we spend ages going over and over the data again to make sure that when we actually publish it, it's really as accurate as possible.
295120	298720	Large language models are maybe not operating in quite that same way.
298720	305480	Yes, they release papers from time to time, but mostly they release these big websites where you can try them out and they do incredibly impressive stuff.
305720	308640	And then and they lie very impressively as well, right?
308640	312080	And I think that's the thing that we haven't quite got around.
312080	317000	So, you know, suppose you're a programmer and you've been using co-pilot and you've been using chat.
317000	322080	GPT also does code and you're a bit worried because it's just producing pretty decent code.
322080	326960	Maybe you don't see it replacing you right now, but you could see in 10 years, maybe that's going to be a problem.
327200	330520	I think the problem is at the moment is it's very difficult to know where it's going.
330600	338040	I think a lot of researchers are suspicious of the idea that we can just make it continually bigger and bigger and more impressive and it will just get better and better.
338040	344480	You know, when we talked about how these models work, they don't really have an internal model of what it is they're trying to do or anything, really.
344480	346400	They just map text to other texts.
346400	355080	You know, when I write a piece of computer code, what I'm really hoping to do is in my mind come up with an idea of the problem that needs to be solved
355160	364120	and what the variables and things that I'm going to need start to get them down on paper and then start thinking about how would I manipulate those variables using code to produce the result that I want.
364120	365920	Chat GPT doesn't really work that way.
365920	369720	It just spits out code and it happens a lot of the time to look pretty good.
369720	373560	At the moment, it's a tool to be used quite carefully, particularly with code.
373560	381880	I wouldn't push anything chat GPT has written straight into production without, you know, quite a few tests because at the moment there's no grounding in reality.
381960	388200	The reality is for training data, but once it's finished training, it's kind of random what it gets.
388200	394360	And these things actually, I don't know if you've noticed this, David, but when you run it, it can produce different answers each time.
394360	399040	And that's because it uses something called temperature to somewhat randomize its output.
399040	408000	So instead of saying, OK, the next word in my output is going to be there, it will say, I think there's an 80% chance that it's there, but it's a 20% chance that it's so.
408000	412840	And then what what the machine will do is say, well, OK, 20% of the time, then we'll pick a different word.
412840	418480	And that way you can go in slightly different directions because if you didn't do that, it will just produce a save output every time.
418480	423320	It's not it's not a random object, so it's not a random network in that sense.
423320	430080	And so you can imagine a situation where there is a really good version of this program that it could write, but it randomly didn't and produce one below the bugs.
430080	432120	So, you know, I mean, that's what I've experienced.
432360	439200	Yeah. And you know, I suppose there's a question in my mind about how is there an efficiency saving if you have to order everything you're reading, right?
439200	442800	Is reading code as fast as writing code or slower or faster?
442800	444520	I'm I don't know, right?
444520	448920	I'm undecided. I think sometimes for boilerplate code, probably pretty effective.
448920	457120	If it's a sort of code, you know, write me a for loop to do X, Y and Z, probably works pretty well, as long as you're capable of quickly checking that.
457120	459280	But then it didn't take me very long to write a for loop anyway.
459360	463840	I'm undecided, I suppose, as to how much of a game change that will be.
463840	471360	This said, I know there are developers that use it, and I know that the developers who claim, or at least they think they're much more efficient.
471360	480800	I don't spend as much time coding as I'd like, because I'm I see, you know, as a professor in a university, I spend a lot of time teaching, a lot of time mentoring others and teaching people.
480800	484920	So they do the coding and I sit there and look at it.
484920	487160	I haven't had as much experience as some.
487200	494920	Yeah, I mean, I think the concern is always, you know, younger young people are people trying to switch careers is, you know, I want to have a job for more than a year or five years.
496160	499880	Is it worth putting all the effort in to learn this stuff if AI is just going to take it away?
499880	508160	My gut tells me that AI isn't going to take it away anytime soon, because I think that I would argue that you need something more fundamental to understanding some of these problems.
508160	516360	If you're going to write code to solve them than just a text production mechanism, that isn't to say that what it doesn't do, it's very impressive what it does.
516360	520840	But I think that as you start to build up, you know, it's very, it's all very well saying like me a for loop to do this.
520840	530240	But if you want to write your class structure and they and a really complicated system, that's such a more difficult, you know, it's like the difference between lane assist and self driving, right?
530240	538400	And that's why we can we see lane assist exist, but self driving seems to be so hard to get to because of how much harder that is as a problem.
538400	542160	And I think that it's very easy to fit a straight line upwards to these things.
542160	546440	You say, well, they didn't do anything and now they're doing this, which means they're going to be doing this.
546440	549080	It may get a lot harder and plateau out, right?
549080	552040	We, you know, it's difficult to say for sure.
552040	558120	I think that there's going to be a very strong need for people in the loop for a long time further.
558120	571680	I mean, as an example, outside of programming in medical science, AI is obviously used quite a lot to help with diagnosis and things, but almost no AI systems are used just on their own with no human oversight.
571680	573800	Because for a start, because we don't trust them yet.
573800	575600	And also because patients don't trust them.
575600	580680	Patients don't want an AI, even if it's good, making their health decisions, right?
580680	582640	Like not yet, you know.
582640	585720	And so I think also culturally, we're not quite ready.
585720	593280	And I know a few companies that are not using co-pilot because they're not absolutely sure of the copyright on the code and think, you know, there's questions that haven't been answered.
593280	600680	I think if you're looking for it to be a software developer or you're looking for a career in security or career in AI, there's still plenty of things to do.
600680	602640	So I wouldn't personally worry about that.
602640	611280	I think we mentioned this last time, and I want to give people firstly, you know, a way to make themselves more valuable and then a path to get there.
611280	618200	You mentioned that, you know, if you attach AI to any skill that you've got, it's going to make you more valuable.
618200	619840	I assume that's still the case.
619840	621880	And then I want to ask you, Mike, how do I get there?
621880	624640	And it also makes you more experienced at dealing with things like this.
624640	628880	When something comes along, you can sit back and you can say, OK, how impressive is this?
628880	631160	Let's think about what it's doing and how it works.
631160	639400	And, you know, some understanding of how these things work, you don't have to understand deep down transformer networks if you want to understand roughly what they're doing and how they've been trained.
639400	645720	Yeah, I would say some knowledge of statistical analysis and data, data processing in general is really, really important, right?
645720	646960	People mock Excel.
646960	649120	Excel is, I think, one of the best products ever written.
649120	650880	It's totally ubiquitous.
650880	655800	It's very powerful and it underpins the huge amounts of, you know, financial systems and other systems.
655800	658720	I use it all the time for student marks, right?
658720	665320	So, you know, you get a table of data that comes in and it doesn't make any sense what we're going to look at, how we're going to deal with this, right?
665320	667800	And how we're going to make decisions based on this data.
667800	672480	And things like data science and machine learning will help you deal with some of these problems.
672480	676160	People who want to become experts in AI obviously need to delve a bit deeper.
676160	681920	But I think for a lot of people, AI can just solve small problems in your pipeline that might make things a little bit easier.
681920	685520	Having that extra string in your bow is not a terrible idea.
685520	690960	So, in the previous videos, I told people you need to learn AI and it's something that I want to really focus on this year.
690960	694680	And this is why I'm talking to you, you know, right in the beginning of the year.
694680	699800	Have you got, like, courses, places that I can go to, books that I can read?
699800	707320	Any recommendations of how do I go from, like, where I am now, zero knowledge to at least, you know, getting down that path to be able to put it on my resume?
707320	712960	There are loads, there's loads of books and resources in Python to learn machine learning and data science.
712960	715160	And that would be a great place to start.
715160	718680	You know, I've said it before, many times, I have a love-hate relationship with Python.
718680	720760	I like it sometimes and I don't like it other times.
720760	726280	At the end of the day, there are libraries in Python that do quite incredible machine learning and make your life a lot easier.
726280	730560	Right, so we've got things like scikit-learn, we've got TensorFlow and PyTorch, of course.
730560	736200	But there are tutorials and books written around these things and they take you from, I don't know what this network is,
736200	739360	to I can actually get one of these networks running on a machine.
739360	743080	And it's often not that much code because of these libraries do a lot of heavy lifting for you.
743120	748200	Often it becomes more plug-in building books together than it does writing your network layers from scratch,
748200	749800	which we don't do anymore.
749800	753960	You know, so you can start by just plugging some things together and I've got a rudimentary network
753960	756720	that I don't really understand that's doing this classification.
756720	759760	And before long, you've made your classification problem a little bit more complicated
759760	761320	and you've got multi-class classification.
761320	764960	I mean, you've got a slightly different data set and then you've solved a data augmentation problem
764960	769000	and you can add these things in and slowly work towards a bit more experience.
769000	772880	You know, I have a number of undergraduate project students every year.
772880	781040	So in university, in the third year, you often do a dissertation, which is like a focused project over a whole year.
781040	785720	Often most of my dissertation projects are going to be on AI and something like this.
785720	790040	And, you know, these are students who've done some, you know, machine learning, maybe a little bit in their modules
790040	792320	throughout their undergraduate and they know how to code.
792320	796640	But a lot of it's new, you know, we pick it up and we run with it and we do some great stuff.
796640	800640	I've got some students in the second year solving Rubik's cubes,
800680	803400	using machine learning to detect where the colors are and things like this.
803400	804680	And this is from scratch, right?
804680	809120	So this is people who haven't done machine learning before and I can point them in the right direction.
809120	813080	I think it is very doable and I think it's, you know, it's fun as well, right?
813080	816080	There's nothing more satisfying to me than you've trained a network
816080	819640	and it's just classifying really accurately whatever it was you wanted to do.
819640	823200	Basically, my job is looking at numbers go up and I like when they go up.
823200	827520	So Mike, I mean, I'd love to come to Nottingham University and attend your courses,
827520	830520	but obviously I can't and so can, you know, most of us can't.
831960	836680	Do you have any like resources or ideas that things, places I can go to to learn?
836680	840960	Often the first course I recommend for everyone is to take Andrew Ung's Coursera course, right?
840960	841840	Very popular.
841840	844960	I mean, I don't know how many times it's been taken now, millions of times.
844960	847360	It's Andrew Ung's course, a course on machine learning.
847360	850000	There is a deep learning follow up to it, which I haven't I haven't done
850000	852200	because probably I actually already know deep learning.
852200	854880	But the machine learning course is really good.
854920	859160	It's a good understanding of some of the key concepts in machine learning
859160	860840	and not specifically about it.
860840	863400	Yes, a little bit about how neural networks work and things like this.
863400	866280	And it can be a little bit mathematical is my experience of it.
866280	870240	But if you if you watch it anyway, you're going to pick up a lot of tips and tricks.
870240	873880	So things like watching your network train over time
873880	877840	and reacting to how that works and doesn't work and making decisions based on this.
877840	881120	These are the things really I think that people who want to do machine learning
881160	885160	in an applied way in a in a in a in a in a business or in an industry.
885480	886720	That's what they need to be able to do.
886720	890120	A lot of them are not going to be writing neural networks from scratch
890120	892520	or designing the number of layers in your network.
892720	895920	They're going to take a network that we know works and run it on some new data.
896000	898760	And if that works great the first time, then that's fabulous.
898760	900800	But if it doesn't, what do you do then?
900960	904720	And these are things that you're going to learn and start learning that Coursera course.
904720	908600	Joshua Bengio and others have written a book just called Deep Learning,
908600	909680	which is very popular.
909680	913160	Again, obviously, it can go into a little bit of heavy math detail,
913440	914760	but it's very popular.
914760	916400	I would say don't read it end to end.
916400	918760	It's one to dip into while you're doing some tutorials
918760	920400	to understand a bit more about the theory.
920400	924360	And after that, personally, I would get I would do the PyTorch tutorials
924480	926160	or the psychic learn tutorials.
926160	929680	They can be directed at your own pace and they will include
929880	932200	they'll give you experience in all those different things, right?
932200	934760	There's there's tutorials on things like reinforcement learning,
934760	937920	but also just standard CNNs and transformers and things like this.
938000	941440	You know, and don't don't worry about you don't have to do all of those on day one.
941520	944320	On day one, we're talking about what is classification?
944320	945400	What is regression?
945400	947440	Maybe get something little going, right?
947440	949080	Really, you know, start yourself off
949080	951920	size and slow and build up the complexity as we go, right?
952040	954160	It's the same with any subject in computer science.
954160	955720	You can't learn everything on the first day.
955720	957680	So you just have to take it a little bit at a time.
957680	960320	I'm glad you mentioned computer science.
960320	965760	Do you think it's time to for more of us to learn computer science type stuff
965760	969920	because of AI like maths and all these computer science stuff and not really?
969920	973120	I think that it's it wouldn't it's not necessary for everyone to do that.
973120	976320	I think that, you know, I would encourage everyone to do computer science,
976320	980760	because I would, but I think that sometimes both computer science
980760	984160	and industry have a sort of reverse snobbery about each other, right?
984160	985320	Which I don't like very much.
985320	988160	So, for example, computer scientists might say, well, if someone didn't do a degree,
988160	990200	you know, what do we know about computers, right?
990200	991080	Which is not true.
991080	994800	And someone who's who got on fine without a degree might go,
994800	997960	why will I go and get student loans and do a degree?
997960	999800	And different paths are all valid.
999800	1002240	I don't know why we're having this conversation.
1002240	1005960	And I think there are there are elements of maths in machine learning,
1005960	1009560	which help, I suppose, me to understand it a bit better
1009560	1012560	when someone comes with a particularly weird problem that doesn't, you know,
1012560	1014920	they've added another layer and it's not training. Why is that?
1015280	1018040	They also help me sometimes when I'm reading papers,
1018040	1020800	because papers, they can have a lot of mathematical notation in.
1020800	1023360	And sometimes that's not necessary and they've just added it in.
1023360	1026960	But often it's just it's just to be absolutely clear about what they've done.
1026960	1030160	And often the mathematical notation is necessary to achieve that
1030160	1032720	rather than writing it in sort of flavourful text.
1032720	1036840	But to begin with machine learning, you don't necessarily need to know those things.
1036840	1039680	You know, you can train a network in PyTorch with a knowledge,
1039680	1042840	a rudimentary knowledge of Python and following some tutorials,
1042840	1044640	and you'll pick up the rest as you go.
1044640	1048240	The really complicated maths like back propagation, which is how we train it,
1048240	1051040	that's all taken care of under the hood. You don't see that.
1051040	1052880	It's not something unless you're really interested.
1052880	1054520	It's not something to concern yourself with.
1054520	1058080	But I mean, the great thing is if I'm in industry, or I'm into cyber,
1058080	1064080	or dev or whatever, I can really enhance my career prospects
1064080	1067600	and the future by just adding this on to my skills.
1067640	1070360	Yeah, but I also think that, and I mentioned it before,
1070520	1074760	I think the other thing is it makes you much more resistant to hype
1074760	1076560	and to concerns over things.
1076560	1079040	And also when someone comes to you and says, oh, yeah, I've trained a neural network
1079040	1081160	to do X, Y and Z, you can start to think,
1081240	1082480	doesn't sound very likely, right?
1082480	1085800	That sounds like the sort of thing that maybe is a bit fanciful, right?
1085800	1089080	Let's deal with, let's look at their data and see if that's actually true,
1089080	1089680	what they've done.
1089680	1093480	And I think one of the reasons that chat GPT and stuff have been so hyped recently
1093480	1095520	is because most people don't know what it is.
1095520	1097480	And so when you see it doing what it does,
1097480	1101520	you think this thing must basically be a person, right?
1101520	1102880	Because it's acting like one.
1102880	1106120	But actually, it's only acting like one in a very narrow thing.
1106440	1109120	And we know how it's trained and how it's trained
1109120	1113560	doesn't imply necessarily that it's got any human qualities, right?
1113560	1117440	It might, but I don't, gut tells me not quite, right?
1117440	1121040	But the point is that I can, I'm sort of more resistant to that in some sense,
1121040	1124160	because I know how it works underneath.
1124160	1126520	And I sort of think I've trained all these networks
1126520	1129200	and this is a bigger version of networks that I've trained myself.
1129200	1131400	I don't see what's different about,
1131400	1133680	but so different about that that it would suddenly be
1133680	1136640	unbelievable, be intelligent compared to anything else, if that makes sense.
1136680	1139480	Some knowledge of how what some of these technologies are,
1139480	1144760	just like knowledge of, you know, some companies trying to sell you a new firewall
1144760	1149360	with next generation antivirus on it that has all kinds of machine learning.
1149360	1151200	Well, if you understand a bit about machine learning,
1151200	1153160	you'll know what it will and won't do, right?
1153160	1155800	And that will allow you to make a better informed purchase decision.
1155800	1157880	And the answer is it'll work pretty well, right?
1157880	1161920	But nothing's perfect and machine learning is only as good as a training day to and so on.
1161920	1163680	So there's lots of things you can ask.
1163680	1165160	And you can ask really difficult questions
1165160	1167080	instead of people that come and try and sell it to you.
1167080	1169000	Especially with things like Twitter and the news,
1169000	1171800	it's very easy to get carried away in this hype cycle, right?
1171800	1173280	Lots of technologies have this.
1173280	1175760	It's in the interest of these companies to make these massive models
1175760	1177760	of incredibly impressive performance.
1177760	1181520	I think we're a long way from full automation of a lot of these tasks,
1181520	1184680	even if it might appear that way at a sort of superficial level.
1184680	1187320	But on the other hand, they're really promising in some other ways, right?
1187320	1190640	So one of the things that I found that chat GPT is really good at
1190640	1193400	is paraphrasing text and vice versa.
1193440	1195760	So you have a text that you don't quite understand,
1195760	1198440	say, please can you read this and tell me what it means?
1198440	1202080	Or please can you summarize these bullet points in an email or something like this?
1202080	1206160	You know, these kind of functions, I think, are actually working really well, right?
1206160	1210480	Because those are functions that rely on their text to text.
1210480	1212040	They're meant for text to text, right?
1212040	1213920	They are, that's kind of what they're for.
1213920	1216240	And I think that those are ones that are really, really good.
1216240	1220000	I think co-completion is useful when you're asking limited things
1220000	1222320	that you can carefully check quite quickly.
1222320	1224520	Don't ask it to produce a thousand lines of code
1224520	1227680	that you expect them to all be perfect, because that's not what it will do, right?
1227680	1229960	And you'll end up with a lot of weird bugs.
1229960	1232680	Or, I mean, there was this paper that was released just the other day, actually,
1232680	1238160	from Stanford that said that they audited code from about 30 to 35 researchers
1238160	1242320	who some of them were using AI to produce some of the code
1242320	1243520	and some of them weren't.
1243520	1246880	And the AI produced code had more vulnerabilities in it.
1246880	1251000	And that's because when the AI produces code that works,
1251040	1254040	but let's say it uses ECB mode in AS,
1254040	1257360	or it uses a slightly weak key derivation or something, I don't know,
1257360	1260400	something subtle, if they don't know about that subject already,
1260400	1262600	they might accept that change, if that makes sense, right?
1262600	1266400	And actually, so this is why you need to still be an expert in your field,
1266400	1269440	because you can't just rely on it to do it for you yet.
1269440	1271120	You've got to be there saying,
1271120	1273800	I think that's okay, or I don't think that's okay,
1273800	1275240	and make those decisions for yourself.
1275240	1278680	Yeah, I mean, it's a limited study, but it's not that limited,
1278680	1280240	and it makes a very valid point.
1280240	1282760	I think the real danger is people who...
1282760	1284600	And I should carry out this by saying,
1284600	1287480	I'm not selling short these incredible technologies.
1287480	1289000	I'm just saying that it would be very silly
1289000	1291840	to just completely use them blind and never check what they do, right?
1291840	1294080	Because we know they just make stuff up a lot of the time.
1294080	1296560	I think a bit of domain knowledge is always going to help.
1296560	1299760	Yeah, I mean, it's interesting, because I did some tests with Cisco devices,
1299760	1301480	and it's amazing.
1301480	1304960	Like, first time it got it perfect, then I wanted to do it for a video,
1304960	1308280	and then it wasn't good, and I did like five or six attempts,
1308280	1309760	and none of them were perfect.
1309760	1310600	Yeah, I think...
1310600	1313320	And if I didn't know what it was doing, I would have accepted it.
1313320	1313920	Sorry, go on.
1313920	1315800	Yeah, and the other thing is that, you know,
1315800	1317440	if you think about the data that it's trained on,
1317440	1320640	it's got some 40 plus billion tokens, right?
1320640	1323120	It's just internet text, we'll just leave it at that, right?
1323120	1324360	Loads and loads of text.
1324360	1328840	Cisco-related text is only going to form a very, very small fraction of that.
1328840	1331200	There is very little evidence, because it's not got a world model,
1331200	1333040	because it's not got an understanding of the world,
1333040	1336200	where it can bring Cisco in and add it to its model.
1336200	1337840	It's just doing text completion.
1337880	1340760	And so, when something is underrepresented in the training set,
1340760	1343160	it's going to probably be worse performing
1343160	1345560	when it comes to actually running it later, right?
1345560	1349240	So when you say, write me something in the style of Shakespeare,
1349240	1350480	it's going to do really well,
1350480	1352880	because there's Shakespeare all over the internet, right?
1352880	1355360	Some tasks are going to be very solvable,
1355360	1356080	because they're just...
1356080	1358000	They're hugely represented in the training set,
1358000	1359080	they work really well.
1359080	1361040	And some tasks are really niche,
1361040	1362400	and you probably don't know which ones are niche,
1362400	1363800	because you haven't seen the training set.
1363800	1366840	I say, write me a link expression, and it does it really well.
1366840	1368840	And when I say, write me a link expression using some other thing,
1368840	1371440	and that isn't in the training set, and it produces me a wrong answer.
1371440	1373760	And I don't know until I run it whether that's the case.
1373760	1377160	So I have to understand and be able to read that code,
1377160	1379600	because otherwise I can't possibly put it into my system.
1379600	1382560	And it goes back to the exact same problem with medicine, right?
1382560	1385240	It might be that we're absolutely confident that this AI
1385240	1387400	will look at this image and make the correct decision,
1387400	1388800	but we're not absolutely sure.
1388800	1390560	And while we're not absolutely sure,
1390560	1393120	do we want to completely take a human out of a loop there?
1393120	1395000	There's questions that we have to think about.
1395000	1399640	So do you think it'll become like the AI might do a lot of the low-level donkey...
1399640	1403760	I think that's much closer to what will happen.
1403760	1408600	So I think there's a phrase in medicine called CAD, or computer-aided diagnosis.
1408600	1411560	And the idea is that instead of the doctor not making a decision,
1411560	1414480	the doctor will be guided into a decision by the AI saying,
1414480	1417840	we've noticed these spots over here in this image, is that relevant to you?
1417840	1419080	And it will speed them up, right?
1419080	1424240	And if we can make doctors or medics 50% more efficient, that's a huge boost.
1424240	1426280	Rather than try and put it all on the AI.
1426280	1427760	And similarly, it works in code.
1427760	1429280	If you can produce boilerplate code,
1429280	1433040	if you can get it to bootstrap, spring boot, configuration files for you,
1433040	1434600	fabulous, do that, right?
1434600	1438680	And then that saves you half an hour to an hour of doing some actual code
1438680	1439800	or making sure that it works.
1439800	1445200	But what I would avoid doing is trying to have it write everything for you
1445200	1447560	and replace yourself because I don't think it'll work.
1447560	1452280	I think you'll end up really frustrated that your code doesn't get past any of your reviews
1452280	1454160	because it doesn't work, right?
1454160	1455560	I was going to say, I love what you said, though,
1455560	1457960	because with that example at Stanford,
1457960	1461600	if people had just accepted the code,
1461600	1465760	there's hidden vulnerabilities in the code that wouldn't have been picked up.
1465760	1468480	Yeah, and then there's a combination of issues, right?
1468480	1470880	Is it that the developer needs to know more about these subjects
1470880	1473280	or is it that there's someone that would normally be on that team
1473280	1474480	that wasn't auditing that code,
1474480	1476600	that would have been auditing that code at that time, you know?
1476600	1478920	Because you have security teams sometimes who are specialists in this.
1478920	1480520	But I think it's that same argument.
1480520	1484720	In some ways, if someone has a small amount of knowledge of computer security,
1484720	1488000	that might allow them to be more resistant when code appears that does this.
1488000	1489320	And that's the same thing with the AI.
1489320	1493440	If you know a little bit about AI, maybe you can better deal with it when something comes along.
1493440	1497680	So I think a little bit of knowledge in lots of these things is often useful for that reason.
1497680	1499920	Mike, so how has this affected like university life?
1499920	1506680	Because I've heard people talk about how students can just get chat GPT to write their essays and stuff like that.
1506760	1510920	And you can't see the difference between a student and a human, sorry, and a chat GPT.
1510920	1513560	Yeah, I think it's very subject dependent.
1513560	1514480	I think that's one thing.
1514480	1518640	So what we've done is we've actually been running some tests, right?
1518640	1520720	Because so, you know, it was very kind of open,
1520720	1522600	they had to drop this tool just before exams.
1523280	1524480	Yeah, exactly.
1525480	1527720	Yeah, we've run some tests and I think it depends on it.
1527720	1532240	If I show, I suppose we're doing a computer security exam, which actually I teach.
1532240	1535400	So, you know, and I ask a very simple question,
1535640	1538560	a question like what's a good encryption algorithm to use?
1538560	1540040	Chat GPT can answer that.
1540040	1543880	So it would be unwise of me to ask that question in an exam, I suppose, what we say.
1543880	1547080	In some sense, I think it's another variant of a search engine.
1547080	1550120	So if a student could, you know, we call it academic misconduct, right?
1550120	1552080	If a student was going to use a search engine to do that,
1552080	1554400	they could also have a go at using chat GPT.
1554400	1558840	It has the advantage for that student that it's generating very plausible looking answers.
1558840	1560800	Sometimes they're completely wrong, right?
1560800	1565000	And those answers are going to get marked very far down when they come in front of a convenience.
1565000	1567080	So I think your mileage may vary
1567080	1571080	if you think you can get through a university degree using just AI tools.
1571080	1572720	It's something we have to consider, right?
1572720	1574400	Now, some of our exams are face-to-face.
1574400	1575720	They aren't really affected, right?
1575720	1577320	You know, we're talking about coursework essays,
1577320	1582560	and I don't know, I haven't spoken too much to other schools in university and other subject areas,
1582560	1585200	but obviously there are lots of essay-based subjects,
1585200	1587960	but they require very well-written essays.
1587960	1591760	Chat GPT has a habit of producing general answers to things,
1592000	1595040	which are sometimes very detailed, but sometimes not quite so detailed.
1595040	1598480	Again, I think that your mileage would vary if you tried this.
1598480	1603080	I suspect that it is possible to tell that they're written by Chat GPT to an extent
1603080	1605840	because it has a way of phrasing things that's quite common.
1605840	1608040	I've noticed as I produce answers,
1608040	1612680	but that isn't necessarily all the time, but that's going to be a problem.
1612680	1615960	It's something that every university on earth is now looking at.
1615960	1618960	Well, yeah, it's had a big impact.
1619040	1622240	And you know, when you consider that this is just version one,
1622240	1624920	and you know, there's going to be a Chat GPT 2 probably,
1624920	1629440	and Microsoft might release one, and Google release one, and so on and so forth,
1629440	1631720	there's always going to be one of these tools floating about.
1631720	1635480	That we have to just be prepared and think about how that's going to work.
1635480	1638440	I think, I mean, the examples I've seen which have worked really well is like,
1638440	1641360	if I'm asked to write an essay about something,
1641360	1644240	I can get it to write something that gives me a lot of ideas,
1644240	1646640	and then I can just rephrase it in my own voice.
1646680	1649760	But it helps you a lot from a study point of view, I suppose.
1649760	1651080	Yeah, and I think it actually does.
1651080	1653160	And I think, so anyway, that's a big positive, right?
1653160	1656200	And there are some academics in this school, for example,
1656200	1661880	and across the world, who operate in a kind of human computer interaction area,
1661880	1665200	who are very interested in, could you end up writing a better essay
1665200	1667520	if you worked with a computer to help you out, right?
1667520	1671720	And in a way, is that not a win for the lecturers as well, if that's the case?
1671720	1673480	Now, I agree with that to an extent.
1673480	1674760	I think that's absolutely right.
1674760	1677640	I think that maybe we can't solve that whole discussion in a month,
1677640	1679480	right, which is how long it is until our exams.
1679480	1682600	So, you know, the clock is ticking in somewhat,
1682600	1685520	it's somewhat in the short term for these issues.
1685520	1689080	But in the longer term, I think they're going to be really transformative in helping.
1689080	1692040	You know, there are students who have, who are very, very intelligent,
1692040	1694600	and they know all the subject area, but they're just not good at exams,
1694600	1696920	they really struggle to get their thoughts down on paper.
1696920	1699720	Maybe those students could really be helped by something like this,
1699720	1703080	because if you give really specific prompts to chat GPT,
1703080	1704360	you get much better answers.
1704360	1707400	If a student knows what they're doing and can work with the AI,
1707400	1708960	I think that's going to be much better.
1708960	1712280	I mean, I suppose you could have said the same thing for Google,
1712280	1714240	or, you know, using search engines for...
1714240	1717040	Yeah, yeah, that's the point that's been made.
1717040	1721200	I mean, in some ways, I see on Twitter a lot people compare these things to Google.
1721200	1723880	I would not, because they're very different,
1723880	1725880	and they don't have no source of actual data.
1725880	1727640	That's a really important thing to remember.
1727640	1730880	But they are a complementary tool in many ways,
1730880	1732440	and they operate in a similar way.
1732480	1734280	If you were going to try and answer an exam,
1734280	1736600	you know, you would put the question in, you'd rephrase it,
1736600	1738280	you'd see what came out, you'd see,
1738280	1741320	does that look plausible, I'm going to try again, I'm going to edit it, and so on.
1741320	1745080	In the same way that you would if you were using a search engine to write an essay as well.
1745080	1747240	And using a search engine to write an essay,
1747240	1749440	and I don't want to speak for every academic on the planet, right,
1749440	1752840	but it's not necessarily plagiarism or misconduct,
1752840	1754200	it depends on how you use it, right.
1754200	1756960	You know, looking up sources online is absolutely to be encouraged.
1756960	1759880	It depends on how you're doing this.
1759880	1762880	I think in the long term we will get a nice balance, actually,
1762880	1765680	between using it too much and not using it enough.
1765680	1767800	And I think actually there's another thing, there's another aspect,
1767800	1769800	which is I think this is plays into your,
1769800	1772480	this is relevant to your channel's viewers,
1772480	1776000	is that you shouldn't think of doing a degree or writing a coursework
1776000	1777640	as just about getting a mark, right.
1777640	1779000	That's very easy to think about that,
1779000	1782960	but actually it's about learning something that you can then take and use in your career,
1782960	1783680	or something like that, right.
1783680	1786080	We don't teach people to programme, so they pass the exams.
1786080	1788560	We teach them the programme so that they can go off and be software developers.
1788560	1790760	If you used AI to write all your work for you,
1790760	1792360	then you'd get out and you wouldn't be able to get a job
1792360	1793600	and you wouldn't be able to work in that job
1793600	1796040	because you wouldn't be able to do any of the computer science.
1796040	1798040	Actually, I think that if you've got a lot,
1798040	1799320	because I have quite a lot of learning
1799320	1801080	and I love to learn about new topics,
1801080	1803000	particularly, you know, about computer science,
1803000	1805000	I would never use chat GPT to cheat
1805000	1807360	because I wouldn't know any of it then, right.
1807360	1809920	And you know, and I like to learn about these things.
1809920	1811600	Now, if you want to become an expert in something,
1811600	1812920	then you're going to need to learn it.
1812920	1815560	You can't read what chat GPT wrote.
1815560	1817600	A lot of it comes down to hoping that students
1817640	1819000	and trying to encourage students to think
1819000	1820840	that it's about the process of learning
1820840	1822280	and where they get to at the end,
1822280	1826080	rather than specifically about a series of kind of barriers
1826080	1828080	of exams that they have to get through,
1828080	1832280	which I think is not a good way to look at a degree or any course, really.
1832280	1835400	You know, it's much better to think about where you'll be at the end, right,
1835400	1838360	and you'll be in that much better position to do what you want to do next.
1838360	1841240	That's exactly right. I mean, it's like certification exams.
1841240	1842840	Same thing, you know, you can go and get all the answers
1842840	1845240	or the cheater sites or you can actually learn something.
1845240	1847680	And you haven't done yourself any favours if you get it off,
1847680	1849120	because you might get a job based on that.
1849120	1850360	It's not going to go well, right?
1850360	1852560	Because you don't have any of the knowledge.
1852560	1855120	You'll always feel like you don't have any of the knowledge as well, right?
1855120	1857880	You know, actually, you don't take that long to learn these things
1857880	1859560	if you really put yourself to it,
1859560	1861880	and you'll be in such a much better position afterwards.
1861880	1865160	Mike, as always, I really want to thank you for, you know, sharing your knowledge
1865160	1871440	and, you know, separating the hype from, like, the worries about people's futures.
1871440	1872720	Thanks so much for making a drill.
1872720	1874480	Yeah, it's no problem. I'm glad to be on again.
1874520	1875640	It's been really, really, really good.
1875640	1876920	Brilliant. Thanks, Mike. Thanks.
