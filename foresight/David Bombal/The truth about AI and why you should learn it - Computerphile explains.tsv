0	6160	This is a fascinating story we have for you of a senior Google engineer who says one of
6160	11080	the company's artificial intelligence systems has become a sentient being.
11080	16160	He believed one of the company's artificial intelligence chatbots had become sentient.
16160	22640	Engineer Blake Lemoine says a chatbot project he was working on called Lambda can express
22640	26160	thoughts and feelings equivalent to that of a child.
26240	32080	Google has rejected claims that one of its programs had advanced so much that it had become sentient.
32080	37040	That's I think the big issue right is that a lot of people get bogged down deciding well what
37040	38640	does sentient actually mean?
46320	49520	Hey everyone it's David Bombal back with a very special guest Mike welcome.
49520	50640	Oh thanks for having me.
50640	55760	So Mike I've seen a lot of your videos on YouTube computer file millions of views on
55760	59520	some of the topics that you've done but can you just introduce yourself to the audience
59520	62960	for people who might not have seen those videos or don't know what you're doing because you're
62960	66800	telling me offline YouTube isn't your main thing you do more than that.
66800	70640	That's right yeah so actually in some sense YouTube isn't a side for me right it's just
70640	72480	something I did because I thought it would be fun.
72480	77680	I'm an academic at Nottingham associate professor and I work teaching security.
77680	80480	I research teaching AI and computer vision.
80480	87200	It just happened that we have some ties at Nottingham to Brady and Sean who do things like
87200	91920	number file and computer file and so computer file was kind of fledgling it had a bit of it
91920	96320	was a bit established when I when I started doing them and it kind of just took took off really.
97520	102000	I think because I did topics on security and AI and things people thought those were interesting
102000	106000	and so I get you know a lot of views on those now but it is still a bit peculiar when people
106000	111600	say hello to me you know because I just turn up and do normal things the rest of the time.
111600	116640	So you get stopped in the street and it has happened yeah my wife is never impressed when
116640	122320	that happens she thinks this is ridiculous but you know it happens from time to time I do I do
122320	126320	really enjoy it I get lots of emails from people saying thanks for your videos I enjoy them and
126320	130080	that's that's why I do it that's that's what it's for for me.
130080	135360	I loved what you said offline you know you someone said that they started computer science because
135360	139920	of you. I've had a couple of emails like that and that's the those are the best emails right because
139920	144720	I want people to learn about computer science I love computers I'm a massive geek basically
144720	150480	I program for fun and the more people do that the more it's a win for me so you know if I can
150480	154000	encourage a few people by doing videos but that's what I really want to do.
154000	158800	That's fantastic one of the videos I watched obviously in preparation for this interview
158800	165760	is this recent video that you put out about AI and that's going to be the topic that we
165760	171520	want to talk about today so let me lead with this I get this these kind of emails all the time
172080	177760	David is it worth me studying cyber security David is it worth me studying computers because AI
177760	183600	are going to take all the jobs away and I think movies over the years like you know there's been
183600	190000	so many of these movies where the robots take over and this can you talk about this and you can go
190000	196240	into the details if you like but I think this this this sort of recent event that you spoke about
196240	200800	in your video hasn't helped the conversation at all so can you tell us about that yeah in what your
200800	205200	thoughts are about you know what happened yeah so no I absolutely agree but it didn't help the
205200	209280	conversation about was okay I think in my video about was kind of what I tried to end with was
209280	214720	basically it doesn't you know in some sense the nuances of where this AI is doesn't interest me that
214720	219760	much all I know is it's not where they're suggesting it is at least that's you know that's what I think
219760	225840	I suppose at the moment AI is very application driven right so a lot of it is supervised there
225840	229760	are other ways of doing it but a lot of it's supervised which means that you have some kind
229760	233440	of training set with some inputs and some outputs that you're trying to get the model to learn and
233440	238320	then you just train the model until that happens that can work really really really well and so
238400	242720	from my own research I do this on things like image segmentation where I'm trying to find objects
242720	247840	in images and you know medical image segmentation and things like this but you know in practice if
247840	251440	I then take that network and try and run it on street scenes it won't work because it's not
251440	256240	trained on street scenes it doesn't know what they are it hasn't got any ability to go oh it's a street
256240	260880	now you know and take what it's learned somewhere and apply it somewhere else you know retraining
260880	267200	a network is really the only way to do it and that involves even more data right so I don't think
267200	270880	at the moment it's realistic to suggest that there's going to be some general
270880	275600	intelligence that can just do all of our jobs right you know you've seen github co-pilot that
275600	280800	just produces text code and sometimes it will produce a useful function and sometimes it will
280800	285040	produce a function full of bugs that you've got to then spend time fixing and have you actually
285040	290720	saved any time I don't know the jury's out I think so I wouldn't worry at the moment I'm not worried
290720	296080	I mean maybe designing things to replace myself is a huge mistake but I don't think we're there yet
296080	299760	so I mean tell us just for people who haven't seen it um haven't seen your video and like haven't
299760	306000	read perhaps what's going on there's this google person lambda yeah so what is lambda and what is
306560	311760	what what what what was he basically saying um google lambda is a um it's what we call a large
311760	317360	language model so it's basically a a very very large neural network designed in a certain way
317360	322000	they're all designed in a very similar way and it has more parameters in it than we've ever seen
322000	327040	really in a model right or GPT-3 is also very very big and so really what this brings to the
327040	332320	table is not so much something new that we've never seen before in AI it's just it's just huge
332320	335360	you know orders of magnitude bigger than the kind of networks I would use to do
336080	340240	you know complex imaging tasks and what they've basically done is they've trained this this model
340240	345200	to read a sentence and then predict what the next word will be and so you could imagine but if you
345200	348800	wanted to do this by hand and you had infinite resources you could just look at every sentence
348800	354240	that's ever been written by humans and work out for any given let's say 10 words what the next word
354240	359040	will always be and if you did that and you had that list of all the possible inputs you do pretty
359040	363440	well at generating sentences because at the end of the day that's what people say right this is
363440	367360	you've got it on record as what they've said in the past you can just say those things again and so
367360	371280	this model is one of those this model is one where you put in some sentences so you might put in a
371280	376640	sentence that says what do you think about quantum physics and then what the model will do is predict
376640	383440	the next likely word and it will probably say well I'm going to start by saying what I think is
383440	389680	and then generate some plausible text on quantum physics because people have written about quantum
389680	394720	physics before and that data is in the training set what it hasn't done is learned what quantum
394720	398960	physics is or connected to an internet resource that has information on quantum physics and looked
398960	404000	it up so in some sense it's a bit like the you know in Star Trek you've got the computer you can
404000	408240	talk to and they often ask the computer to do things like you know put the shields up or whatever
408240	415200	yeah computer dim lights it's like that but it's not connected to any kind of anything on the ship
415200	421520	so it just talks to you and talks back but it never actions anything it never it never has you
421520	426560	know it's just going from the text in the training set and I think that's something that's perhaps
426560	431920	lost a bit in in when it when it's discussed it's but it's not connected to anything it doesn't even
431920	438000	have a memory basically and so it can't reflect on past experience because it has no place to store
438000	443120	past experience it has no record of those events and so when it produces sentences that look really
443120	448160	really interesting they're actually just really interesting sounding sentences you know and I
448160	452960	think so anyway I mean if I if I sort of digress slightly but you know in this particular case
452960	457360	what happened was someone from Google who I think was in the ethics department I don't think he was
457360	463120	actually responsible for developing this AI basically said look at this chat I've had with it
463120	467920	don't you think it's sentient basically is what he said and the answer I think from me and pretty
467920	472720	much everyone who understands these models was no it's no it's not and what and I think the thing
472720	477120	that bothered me most about it was not particularly one person saying this because he's very entitled
477120	482400	to his opinion right you know I think I think it was that the media took it massively seriously and
482400	487520	it was all over everywhere is this the next thing and that bugs me somewhat because I don't think it
487520	493120	helps for conversation like you say right people start people who don't know what a big a big model
493120	496800	a big language model is are going to be a bit worried about this and there's really no reason
496800	501680	at this time to be worried and like that bothers me slightly which is why I do my videos to try and
501680	507840	tell people about it I mean the problem is the movies predict this happening and then people
507840	514160	see this stuff in the news and it's like it's the end of the world and end of my job Arnold and the
514160	519440	robots are going to take over so it really doesn't happen it doesn't it really doesn't help and I
519440	522560	like what you said I mean in your video which I'll link below you said something that I thought was
522560	530160	hilarious you said can python functions get lonely yeah can you explain what you were saying by that
530160	535280	yeah so one of the one of the comments in the original chat transcript between this researcher
535280	541040	and his friend and his colleague and this lambda AI was do you get lonely and it's spouted off a whole
541040	547440	paragraph about how lonely it is and it doesn't make any sense because it's a function call right so
547440	552560	you put in your words at the top it runs of what is essentially a big transformer network which is
552560	557840	pre-trained on all this data and then it spits out words at the bottom which you read and then it
557840	562160	stops executing right because there's no kind of ongoing process like there is in my I mean I like
562240	565120	to think that when I'm not immediately saying something to you I'm still there's something
565120	570720	going on in there right maybe I mean you know I can't prove it to you but but this is not the
570720	574960	case you know and it's just like when you run I mean I made a joke about it but when you run
574960	579200	you know reverse string in python you don't worry that it gets lonely the rest of time because it's
579200	584160	not executing that's just some code that executed it finished executing and it just lies dormant
584160	589520	in memory doing absolutely nothing of interest and that's for me kind of what this model is doing
590080	595280	if they developed a model that was always on in some way like maybe it was always doing something
595280	600240	and it had memory and it had storage I could I still probably would think I would need some
600240	605120	convincing but it had any kind of you know higher level thought process but at least it would be
605120	609760	plausible you know it would sort of think well at least it's got something going on in there
609760	615120	but I just don't think it's designed that way it's designed as a very very big reverse string
615120	619680	and you know I don't worry about those things being sentient yeah but it's crazy I mean I mean
619680	626720	the well I mean in my opinion because they kind of they were implying that this AI or whatever
626720	630400	was like a human or equivalent to a human and it seems like that's quite a stretch
630400	636480	but in you know popular popular culture that's what people equate to AI it seems yeah that that
636480	641680	really that that's I think the big issue right is is that a lot of people get bogged down deciding
641680	645520	well what does sentient actually mean and that doesn't interest me because when anyone uses the
645520	649760	word they're not using it in a different definition they're using it in the definition we think of
649760	655040	as like termination and sky net right you know this this researcher wasn't saying I think it's
655040	659680	sentient but I define sentience as something like a slightly combinated if statement right he was
659680	664240	saying I think it's like a person and it's got memories and it's got experiences and it gets
664240	669600	lonely and it needs a lot of feelings and yeah and and without with any with zero evidence to
669600	673360	support this and indeed not so much evidence is just it doesn't even make sense so I think you have
673360	677520	to be extremely careful using the word sentient not because you might have a different definition
677520	683360	but because everyone has the actual same definition right which is actual you know human level
683360	688320	cognitive ability but you know which so I don't spend a lot of time worrying about what the
688320	692720	definition of sentience is because if I go to someone in the conversation and say this is sentient
692720	698000	I think we both understand implicitly what that means to me to say that and so I don't I I think
698000	702720	we're arguing about the definition is a bit silly because we actually all secretly agree on the
702720	707920	definition yeah I mean I think for the general population I mean I'm not I'm not into the AI
707920	712240	piece like you are and that's why you I want to talk to you about it you know I just think people
712240	717040	go off movies and popular culture that's sort of what what people that's the impression they get
717040	723200	and that's why it was so big on the news perhaps but can you explain AI versus machine learning and
723200	728320	like what is machine learning what is AI and perhaps just take us down the road now yeah okay
728320	733840	like teach us you know sort of the basics of the stuff yeah so AI is misused in the sense that it's
733840	739200	now a catchall right and I will admit I do that to an extent myself and it's partly because I'm
739200	743920	lazy right I think I think it's because it means I don't have to define the exact thing that I'm
743920	748400	doing yeah at any given time car engines are slightly different but they all at the moment I
748400	753760	mean I say they will the combustion engines all do much the same thing even though one's got more
753760	758000	cylinders and one's got fewer cylinders and one has a turbo and one doesn't you don't say I you
758000	762000	don't miss it well I don't go on about those details I just say I've got a car and it goes
762000	766960	so AI I think is a catchall that includes machine learning so you've got AI as a big kind of
767600	772800	thing of stuff with loads of stuff in it and even my maze solving video where I just do very simple
773360	779040	looking around the corridors of the maze would be defined in some sense as AI right but the
779040	784320	Dijkstra algorithm that we use to do network routing and things and other similar algorithms
784320	789280	you could define them in some ways as AI because they adapt to messages coming in and they change
789280	795120	weights and paths and things but we wouldn't go as far as to say they were you know anyway you know
795120	800320	smart in some sense right so I think AI is quite a broad term and then there are things like genetic
800320	805120	algorithms evolutionary algorithms which do slightly different things they are arguably less
805120	809840	popular or less prevalent perhaps will be the right way to put it but they also come under the
809840	815440	umbrella of AI so AI is this very big umbrella term which basically encompasses most most things
815440	820160	where you could imagine it was sort of intelligence and then in that you've got machine learning and
820160	825040	machine learning is just the idea that you want to try and program a computer without having to
825040	829760	program it essentially you want to give it some examples or some other mechanism from which to
829760	835920	learn and it comes up with its own rules for what it's going to do so a decision tree is a good
835920	841680	example of a very simple you know conceptually simple machine learning approach where you have
841680	847440	some kind of data and every time you make a decision you just you just split it in two so maybe you're
847440	852400	trying to analyze financial data decide whether people get a new credit card right so the first
852400	857280	decision you make is have they ever defaulted on a credit card yes goes this way no goes this way
857360	862240	and then the next decision is okay what's their current credit limit it's it's above 7000 it goes
862240	867440	this way below 7000 goes this way and you just split this data into two and two and two until at
867440	872160	the end you get the actual nodes that have the decisions on right and it's machine learning
872160	876560	because what you can do is you can you can basically create this tree but actually change
876560	882320	the numbers and values in it and the decisions based on the data so you can say well actually
882400	888320	maybe 7000 doesn't work that well we're going to have it at 6500 and change the thresholds and things
888320	892480	and you can do this all automatically in the training process so that's the kind of thing
892480	897120	we're talking about with machine learning now what happens of course is there's a big push in
897120	901040	deep learning which I you know I can also talk about but yeah be great yeah because I mean we just
901040	904480	hear the you know I just hear these buzzwords I mean preparing for this interview just like
904480	908880	buzzword after buzzword after buzzword and I think a lot of us you know who are not in this sort of
908880	913840	field but are interested in it you know so yeah if you can define as much and like yeah yeah sure so
913840	918960	I mean so you've got yeah sorry you've got you've got ai right which is which is right here in some
918960	922800	subset of actors machine learning which includes what I would kind of call traditional machine
922800	927600	learning like support vector machines decision trees random forests right these are all linear
927600	932480	regression even right where you're just fitting a line to us to some data and then we have things
932480	938720	like slightly more complicated algorithms like artificial neural networks which they I mean they
938720	944880	kind of take some inspiration from our brains but I would I would be very careful saying that to me
944880	952160	I think you know to suggest it's like our brain is is is is iffy and so yeah yeah but they have
952160	956800	their name yeah like that's what they're called and then what we've basically done recently
957680	961600	is we've made them much much bigger right and we've introduced other terms like convolutional
961600	967440	networks and transformers and things but for the sake of you know this sentence they're just bigger
967440	972720	deeper networks that can learn more impressive functions so they can map that input to that
972720	977120	output more effectively right because that's what you want to try and do you've got some data
977120	981600	you've got some predictions you need to make on that data and your hope is that once you've trained
981600	986320	it some new data comes along and you can make some good predictions right I mean let's think of an
986320	994480	example suppose suppose I want to you know do um MRI segmentation for medical imaging right so I have
994560	998480	50 patients some of whom unfortunately have some kind of illness some of whom don't
998480	1003440	and I train the network to try and find the ones that have illness my hope is that when I then
1003440	1008960	sort of fix that network in place and bring in some new patients it will be able to say whether
1008960	1014320	they have that illness or not that's the idea and we'll have done that by basically reconfiguring
1014320	1020000	itself based on the examples I gave it to begin with so doing a technology example it could be
1020000	1025200	something like spotting is this a virus or is it just yeah exactly right and in fact you know
1025200	1029600	modern antiviruses will include some kind of machine learning element probably so you know you
1029600	1034160	might have features derived from so what we what we usually put into the front of a network is
1034160	1040560	something we call features which is um our way of just saying input data right so sometimes you've
1040560	1044400	crafted those features like you've chosen what you think is interesting features to give the network
1044400	1048800	and sometimes you'll just shove something in like you know in antivirus you could you could choose
1048880	1053440	things like how many system calls does it make or you know how many how many bytes is the executable
1053440	1057840	or how many of this particular character does it have in the executable and you could choose those
1057840	1062880	features because you think they are indicative sometimes of malware or not malware you stick
1062880	1069760	them in some kind of a machine learning approach with a load of examples and then say right now
1069760	1076400	change your weights and change your rules internally so that on this training set your prediction is
1076480	1083520	accurate as possible right and so let's say you do that you have 100 000 malware and regular samples
1083520	1088400	you give it to your AI and you just over and over again say right you got that one wrong
1089280	1093520	reconfigure yourself so that next time you get a bit better at predicting it you do that over
1093520	1098080	and over again and the hope is then that when a new virus comes along that you've never seen
1098880	1104400	those same sort of should we say suspicious things exist in it and the network flags that up
1104400	1109200	that's the idea so the the training data is like the the stuff you give it initially which would be
1109200	1115040	this 100 000 like virus and not virus yeah and then you when you say weights you like it's basically
1115040	1120960	saying like if it makes like a hundred system calls rather than 10 or you said some kind of
1120960	1125440	threshold is that right yeah so okay so in a decision tree or something like that that's what
1125440	1129280	would happen there would be some kind of threshold decision based at some point during it for a
1129280	1132320	neural network it's a little bit more complicated and it's what you actually do is you treat all
1132320	1136640	these weights just as numbers and you just calculate mathematical functions based on those
1136640	1141760	numbers so what you might do is multiply all of those numbers that come in by some weights
1141760	1146640	let's say you multiply one of them by two and one of them by negative four one of them by a half
1146640	1150400	and then you add them all up and what that does is take a different amount of each one
1150400	1154720	and then you and then you repeat that process over and over again to try and basically learn a
1154720	1159040	complicated mathematical function that's really the only thing it does you know you're essentially
1159040	1163600	trying to fit a really complicated curve through the data essentially so that you can distinguish
1163600	1173040	between real and fake malware or you know regular executables and malware and and so the weight
1173040	1177200	when I say weight what I'm really talking about is the parameters of my model which influence
1177200	1182560	this mathematical function so the and then you would adjust the the the weights and the mathematical
1182560	1188560	functions based on the result did it get did it's correctly determine that this was malware
1188880	1193360	exactly so so let's suppose we were doing malware right so we think one an output of one means it's
1193360	1198480	definitely malware and an output of zero means it's definitely not malware an output of 0.5 is
1198480	1205120	not very useful to us because we don't know um what we do is we put in a piece of malware or many
1205120	1210000	pieces of malware we run through let's say our deep neural network or whatever it is we're running
1210000	1214800	and it will produce a value between zero and one and then we say well look you gave us a value of
1214800	1221120	0.7 but actually it was malware this time so you've got an error of 0.3 I wanted you to produce
1221120	1227120	0.3 higher for that one than you did so can you adjust your mathematical function to next time when
1227120	1232480	I put that malware in produce a value of one and not a value of 0.7 now if you do that for one malware
1232480	1236720	sample it's going to be the worst machine learning ever because you're just going to give it something
1236720	1240880	else and it's going to go I don't know what you mean right because this is nonsense so you have to
1240960	1245680	give it a lot of data and and I guess what you're trying to do is calculate the best average
1245680	1251840	mathematical function that does the best job it can in the general case of all of these malware's
1251840	1257520	right massively optimizing one malware is not useful because it's not going to generalize it's
1257520	1263600	not going to apply in real world to some new malware so you put in 10, 20, 100 different
1263600	1268640	malware at the same time and all of them are trying to go to one or go to zero and you're
1268640	1273360	trying to change the weights to simultaneously do all of those at the same time that's that's what
1273360	1278800	machine learning does basically for a neural network the process for actually doing this it's
1278800	1284240	it's complicated to describe but it's it's fairly intuitive what you do is you because all these
1284240	1288800	weights are involved in the calculation you put your features in for your malware you go all the
1288800	1294560	way forward through the deep learning or the network then you calculate your error and then
1294560	1299680	you go backwards adjusting the weights based on what you just found out right essentially and so
1299680	1304000	if a weight doesn't have any impact on the decision because let's say it just sets everything to zero
1304000	1307520	you won't adjust that weight because it's not useful you will only adjust the ones because
1307520	1311680	you're calculating the influence that each of these weights has on the error you adjust all
1311680	1317840	the ones that have the biggest impact and so the network will kind of try and find its way
1317840	1322800	towards a good function you know and we use a process called stochastic gradient descent often
1322800	1327200	to train this so what we're doing is we're picking random malwares and putting them in
1327200	1331200	and that will often it will often get them wrong right because it's never seen any of these things
1331200	1337520	before and so over time maybe you just nudge it slightly in a better direction and then over many
1337520	1343200	thousands of looks it slowly converges on something that actually makes reasonable decisions that's
1343200	1348240	you know that's the idea so it's a long process and is this what you would call supervised or is it
1348960	1354080	this is definitely supervised so supervised is where you have your your your label ground truth
1354080	1358160	what we was you know our we have labels for data so we're putting our data in we have some labels
1358160	1362800	against which we can compare and that means that we have some idea of how right or wrong
1362800	1367360	the network is in any given case right and that's very very useful and the majority despite what
1367360	1373200	people might say the majority of deep learning or machine learning is supervised learning because
1373200	1379920	it gets results the quickest if I want to detect some illness in MRI having examples of that illness
1380560	1386320	is going to be much much easier so Mike supervised learning if I understand it right is you giving
1386320	1393600	it examples of like you said actual malware or actual like in your MRI scans problems yeah and
1393600	1398080	then you're supervising that it got it right and then you're correcting it yeah and it makes
1398080	1402800	things much easier right so the majority of machine learning is supervised because it is
1402800	1406960	simpler and easier to do if you work in applied areas like me where you're trying to get things to
1406960	1411040	work really really well if you work in industry a lot of what you're trying to do is just minimize
1411040	1415840	that error term you're trying to get as close to good predictions in for the majority of cases
1415840	1420560	so getting some examples is going to get you to converge on that much much more quickly this is
1420560	1424640	you know distinct from something like weakly supervised or unsupervised learning and there's
1424640	1428880	lots of different variants so unsupervised learning is you don't have any labels right maybe
1428880	1435120	the data is too big or the data is too hard to annotate or no one can agree on what the labels are
1435120	1439280	and so the best you're going to be able to do is kind of partition the data into plausible groups
1439920	1443600	so you can say well look we don't know exactly what all these things are but we know that this
1443600	1447760	group is distinct from this group and that's unsupervised so an example would be suppose
1447760	1452560	suppose you work for an online shop and you have a load of data on what different customers have bought
1453200	1458160	one thing you might do is start trying to group customers into some kind of plausible groups
1458160	1461440	based on roughly the things they they're not all going to have bought the exact same thing right
1461440	1466000	so it's not going to be trivial but they might have bought so someone's buying mostly dog related
1466000	1470000	stuff and someone's buying mostly technical gadgets and then what you can do is say well look
1470000	1474000	I put all these people in the tech group and this guy bought this really nice new microphone or
1474000	1478640	news camera so I'm going to recommend that now to other people in the group and maybe I get a few
1478640	1483760	hits and I and I sell a few cameras that way um you can get much more complicatedness but that is
1483760	1489280	an example of perhaps unsupervised learning where you don't need to have some kind of label
1489280	1493040	for everyone you don't need to have labeled me ahead of time as a tech enthusiast you just need
1493040	1497440	to look at the stuff I've been buying I know it's the same as always other people and know
1497440	1501680	that that's interesting right rather than we know exactly what it means that's a great example so in
1501680	1508080	other words you didn't tell the machine who the people were it discovered that based on the
1508160	1512400	patterns of data right yeah and it didn't really even discover who they were it mostly just grouped
1512400	1516800	them and that allowed us to make decisions based on the fact they were grouped now as that happens
1516800	1521520	I've given this group a label of tech enthusiasts but of course you don't need to even know that
1521520	1525600	you just need to know but on average they buy more TVs than everyone else so maybe send them
1525600	1530560	emails about TVs you know it's that kind of idea you can still do supervised learning and other
1530560	1535200	forms of learning with stuff like marketing and and recommender systems and things but you might
1535200	1540400	imagine that that could be one way you would do it and I think it's a good example the problem I see
1540400	1545840	like from listening to you is reality versus the movies or reality versus the news cycle
1545840	1552480	because you always hear about google doing like um like teaching a machine to play chess or whatever
1552480	1558800	the games are and it just like magically gets this done um and it teaches itself kind of like not
1558800	1563200	even knowing what the the rules of the game are so that is a that's something called reinforcement
1563200	1568480	learning a lot of the time reinforcement learning is still supervised learning okay it's just that
1568480	1574080	you get the labels as you go from playing the game so the way it works is you know what you might do
1574080	1578880	is you play a random game of chess where you literally move at random right and you lose
1578880	1583440	and so you get a strong suggestion that maybe next time don't do that like that was stupid
1583440	1587840	so now you move slightly less at random than you did before but it's still pretty bad
1587840	1591760	and you lose again but you know learn a bit and this is basically how they train it so what you
1591760	1596320	do is you play millions and millions and millions of games of chess and every time it goes well
1596960	1601440	you just learn a little something about what was better than that time than what's the time before
1601440	1605600	we're still talking about a network which is a big mathematical function right so we're still
1605600	1610560	talking about something that has weights that you adjust so that when you put an input state in
1610560	1615360	you get the best desirable output state which in this case of course is you won more often than you
1615360	1620160	didn't for me I mean these are fascinating because they're trained in a very different way to the
1620240	1624800	way I would train the network I come up with labeled data and I put it in like and I use the
1624800	1630000	examples with reinforcement learning you have to start trying to give it rewards which is where it
1630000	1637440	gets its labeled data from so is it is it is it is it better that you go 25 moves in chess before
1637440	1641600	you lose or is it better that you checkmate regardless of how long it takes right you know
1641600	1646880	because you might end up in a stalemate you know there's things with playing chess where you might
1646880	1650400	say well look these other goals are also important or something like this and so you can spend a lot
1650400	1654800	of time thinking about different ways you could train the network which I think I think is really
1654800	1661040	interesting perhaps I'm misinterpreting it but it sounds like the hype cycle versus reality
1661040	1667040	there's a big disconnect like the people have this vision that the robots are going to take over
1667040	1671520	but you don't think that's going to happen like anytime soon right yeah I mean I well the funny
1671520	1676800	thing is like I did a lecture once where where I said to everyone you know the char one hash function
1676800	1683360	is absolutely fine right and then the next the next day yeah google released their their two pdfs
1683360	1687520	that had the same char one hash right now that's embarrassing when that happens as a lecturer you
1687520	1692240	know um so you know I don't want to say you know I don't want to say it could never happen what I
1692240	1695840	would say is that the something that's really really good at go or something that's really really
1695840	1703040	good at chess is really really good at chess and that is it right it will do nothing else right
1703040	1708800	as far as I can tell human chess players are also good at other things and we we don't have that
1708800	1716640	generalizability yet is this the age the difference between like specialized knowledge and yeah I mean
1716640	1720560	again we could get bought we could get bogged down and what what the definition means but I think
1720560	1725120	that our official general's urgency to most people watching is just something that kind of is a bit
1725120	1731040	like a human right and certainly is very very general so you could say right this now is a totally
1731040	1734560	different game learn to play it and it will go off and play it and it would still remember how to
1734560	1738560	play chess and it could play all the games you know and it's just super it's super impressive
1738560	1744080	though that doesn't exist will it exist I don't know I mean I think that if we keep making these
1744080	1750000	models bigger we'll probably get to a point within a few decades where they are very impressive at a
1750000	1756320	lot of different tasks but I still am not convinced yet that we've got any real strategy to get past
1756320	1760800	the idea of just you need to like have a load of data right or a load of play a load of games
1760800	1767280	my daughter can have a go at playing a semi-coherent game of chess just having been told the rules of
1767280	1771280	chess and she didn't you know let's say she's not winning any competitions right not yet
1771280	1774960	but she didn't need to play a million games against herself to work out what to do right
1774960	1780800	there's something that she is doing but is much much more impressive than what this AI is doing
1780800	1784800	that isn't to say the AI isn't incredibly impressive it's just very different I do think
1784800	1789200	that the hype cycle is very different to what we actually see on the ground which is that basically
1789200	1794720	a lot of the time I mean you know aside from playing games and reinforcement learning and large
1794720	1799520	language models the majority of what people are doing is trying to find objects segment images
1800240	1804720	and these things are mostly done in a supervised way and they don't generalize but we don't
1804720	1808560	care because we were trying to find those specific objects so that's good and if we need them to do
1808560	1812080	something else we'll retrain them to do something else yeah because my next question I think you've
1812080	1816400	you've already given us the answer and maybe you can just elaborate is what is AI really good at
1816400	1822240	compared and you know it just seems like it's like automation automation has its place but you still
1822240	1826720	it takes like it's just correct me if I'm wrong but it seems to take away like low level tasks that
1826720	1830880	are boring and monotonous or difficult for a human to do and then humans can concentrate on other
1830880	1837040	things yeah what is AI really good at and where do you see it going yeah so AI is that automation
1837040	1841200	is exactly what you what what you write on but with the caveat that you've got to have found a good
1841200	1845840	way to train it to automate it won't just automate stuff you can't just stick it on a on a on a
1845840	1850720	production line and say automate that for me because it did we won't know what to do so yeah
1850720	1855440	from my point of view what AI is really good at is so before I worked in you know at machine
1855440	1859520	learning and deep learning this was a normal computer vision researcher right and so I was
1859600	1864320	you know this is like you know early 2010 something like this time before I mean literally deep
1864320	1869760	learning appeared in about 2014 and before that we didn't have it right there were some networks
1869760	1873520	but no one was really paying attention to them and everyone was just doing normal stuff right and
1873520	1877680	what I would describe as image processing so if I wanted to find something in an image what I would
1877680	1883200	be trying to do is come up with rules in my head about what I needed to do to that image to find
1883200	1887440	those objects and then I would implement those rules and code so I'd say okay first of all go
1887520	1891280	like we're trying to find you know something in MRI so first find all the bright pixels
1891280	1897360	now find all the bright pixels but form a continuous blob that's of this size you know and I start
1897360	1903760	and I try and design an algorithm to find whatever it was I was finding through these if statements
1903760	1908160	and rules right it's just code and what machine learning lets me do is not worry about the the
1908160	1912560	rules because the problem you have if you do if you do it by just coding is you get stuck in edge
1912560	1918880	cases you get stuck on the you know you solve 90% of the issues pretty quickly because 90%
1918880	1924160	of the images are trivial and then that 10% you just will never solve because they're just they
1924160	1929040	don't apply the normal rules that everything else does and you know if you're looking at a sort of
1929040	1934800	medical diagnosis AI or program that's a huge problem but you're just going to miss 10% because
1934800	1940320	you couldn't deal with the edge cases and so from my point of view coming from image analysis
1940320	1944400	that was what it let us solve it allows you because this mathematical function is very very
1944400	1949680	complicated it can learn the edge cases if you give it sufficient numbers of them so you just so
1949680	1954640	actually a lot of the time when I work with biologists or medics and and and they present the
1954640	1958800	images I'll say these are all very nice but have you got any worse ones have you got any really
1958800	1964320	bad ones because the more because the more bad stuff we give it the better it will get at at
1964320	1970320	working when those things come along if you train your AI on a on a 3 or a 7 tesla MRI scanner
1970320	1975360	which is super clear it won't work when you run it on a 1.5 you know so maybe you want to get
1975360	1978800	samples from all the different scanners you know what I mean there's these kind of decisions
1978800	1983920	it actually means that the problem is no longer one of which if statements do I need to write to
1983920	1989440	get this to work it's now what kind of data and how do I present the data to this network to get
1989440	1994160	it to work all right and that so it becomes much more about the input and output problem
1994160	1998320	than it becomes about what you do in the middle which it just learns that's great I mean I just
1998320	2002560	wanted to see if I understand the terms I see terms like artificial intelligence machine learning
2002560	2006480	neural networks and deep learning we've covered all of those is that right yeah so I mean to go into
2006480	2012640	some deep learning what I would say in terms of definition of deep learning is you know earlier
2012640	2016720	I said that you might do I features for your problem right so suppose you're trying to sell
2016960	2021840	cars what you might do is you might come up with some properties of cars that are relevant to its
2021840	2026240	purchase price so you might say okay how many cylinders has it got how many how much horsepower
2026240	2030480	has it got has it got leather seats right as it got air conditioning and you would have all these
2030480	2034240	features and you come up with a list of let's say a hundred different properties of a car and you
2034240	2039280	would stick them in some AI decision tree neural network doesn't matter and then it would spit out
2039280	2043600	a value for you and you would train it on a bunch of examples and you would hopefully have a system
2043600	2048960	that could really nicely predict the value of cars right now the problem is that suppose I've
2048960	2054000	missed out a feature that's absolutely crucial to the value of cars suppose I forgot to put in
2054000	2058400	the engine size and it turns out that 90 percent of the car's value is on how big the engine is
2058400	2062880	right and so I've given it bad data then right and and then I have to go back and have to put
2062880	2066400	data in again and I have to train it all again and you know it's a waste of time and what will
2066400	2070480	actually happen if you try to implement a system where you missed out features is it would never
2070480	2077200	work as well as you hoped and a car would come along that looked good on the features I did give it
2077200	2081440	but actually had a really small engine and it would massively overvalue it or something like this
2081440	2085680	right or undervalue it and you give away a really nice car for almost free what deep learning does
2085680	2091200	is something called representation learning that's the because it's deeper it has the power to also
2091200	2095840	learn the features as well as the decision based on those features so you might say well I can't
2095840	2100800	bother to decide to decide all these features so I'm just going to dump the raw specs or a picture
2100800	2106960	of the car in at the front and have it determine for me the value right and it would be looking at
2106960	2112000	the size and model shape the color the size of the wheels and it would do all this and it would
2112000	2118000	extract the features first inside the network and then it would use that to make a decision so deep
2118000	2124000	learning is often described as just the same network but deeper but actually it's a different I
2124000	2129840	think a different paradigm where you're basically no longer hand crafting what you put in you're
2129840	2134960	just shoving all of it in and it works out what's useful and what's not and so you've explained
2134960	2140160	neural networks already is all right yeah I mean so a neural network yeah so I we talked about how
2140160	2146240	a neural network calculates a weighted sum so it takes some features at one layer and it waits
2146240	2149680	them and then it calculates the sum of those for the next layer and we have something called an
2149680	2154480	activation function in there as well which allows the basically it makes the function a lot more
2154480	2160480	complex right it makes it non-linear makes it learn more powerful things modern deep networks
2160480	2167120	actually have additional operations like convolutions and pooling operations which work on
2167120	2171920	grids of data often right it doesn't have to but you know often they do so what you might do
2172560	2177760	is instead of calculating a weighted sum of all the features you might slide a filter over the
2177760	2184720	image to calculate filters at every location and so it's like a sort of a map of activations
2184720	2189600	and then you might repeat that process over and over again so what what um deep networks are capable
2189600	2195920	of doing convolutional networks is determining features across the whole image right or across
2195920	2200560	the whole of the data stream and then repeating that process over and over again that's how they
2200560	2205360	develop that's how they develop their representation learning right they use the filters to create
2205360	2210560	interesting information before they make a decision you teach security at university but
2210560	2216240	you're doing a lot of the ai side ai stuff as well um i think the the question a lot of people will
2216240	2220880	be asking including myself is do i need to learn some kind of programming language and which language
2220880	2224880	would it be would you recommend and do i need to learn like a whole bunch of math because it sounds
2224880	2228800	like you know math is one of the or maths as we say in the uk is something that you have to
2229600	2237680	it because you have to learn is that right to you know having having some idea of what's going
2237680	2242000	on mathematically helps you from an intuition point of view right because i understand the back
2242000	2245920	propagation process which is how the actual weights have adjusted and that allows me to
2245920	2250000	understand what would happen if i connect two bits of network together in a weird shape or
2250000	2255600	something like this but in practice actually day to day running of a deep network doesn't really
2255600	2261520	involve any maths and and and there is some disagreement in the community about whether
2261520	2265360	you really need to know math at all right you know i'm i sort of go back and forth i sometimes
2265360	2268720	think it's useful and i sometimes think it's not i certainly don't think people should be if they
2268720	2273840	don't like maths should be put off from having a go because i'm always an advocate for have a go at
2273840	2278800	something you might really enjoy it right what i would say is that actually running a neural network
2278800	2283520	doesn't require a lot of maths it just requires a bit of python basically so that's the language
2283520	2288320	you normally use python um i have a love hate relationship with python i think but sometimes
2288320	2292640	sometimes i just want to declare what my types are and stop having runtime errors for half an hour
2292640	2296720	into something but what what they've done is they've got a lot of libraries like tensorflow and
2296720	2302960	pytorch that operate but sit in python and then they they very very quickly go go down into C
2302960	2308320	and CUDA for fast matrix multiplications which is all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes
2308320	2312560	in your neural network so they're very very quick because they're not implemented end to end in python
2313120	2319520	but python gives you a very convenient and nice way of doing all this you know loading the images
2319520	2323600	it just appears as a kind of array you know you might have a list of images that you use for
2323600	2328400	your data set and then you put that into a network and so on right you know a lot of it's just inputting
2328400	2332880	out putting lists and dictionaries like the rest of python and so it makes things quite easy to use
2332880	2337040	you know you'll have had a look at python but python for me is is a is a nice enough language
2337040	2340560	in the sense that it's fairly easy to pick up particularly if you already know a language
2340640	2345360	it's often language people recommend you start with anyway because it's fairly relaxed about
2345360	2351760	syntax and just you making a total mess of it so that's you know that's always good um but doing
2351760	2356720	going from knowledge of python to having implemented a deep network will not take you very long you
2356720	2361040	will understand everything the first time but you can get give it a go and you can watch it training
2361040	2365680	and you can start to you can start to pick up on what's going on and then you can make a change
2365680	2369520	to the network and maybe improve your performance slightly do you have to write it from scratch
2369520	2374000	or is like it's it's TensorFlow or something that like Google have created exactly they do
2374000	2378080	a huge amount of heavy lifting right which is one of the reasons why you can kind of get away
2378080	2385040	with not having always mathematical background so I mean I use PyTorch mainly and in PyTorch
2385040	2391200	it handles all the weights and learning for you so you say I want my network to have this many
2391200	2395440	layers and I want my layers to be like this and I want it to take an image of this size and turn it
2395440	2401200	into a 10 class classification problem where I'm picking cats and dogs and airplanes or what have
2401200	2406960	you and then it just trots off and does it and it just goes it goes puts the images in it it
2406960	2411120	retrains the network and it puts the images in it retrains the network and it iterates and you can
2411120	2416800	watch your learning rate really watch your loss function go down as it gets better and better
2416800	2421040	every iteration instead eventually you can then just deploy it in some sort of production code or
2421040	2427280	whatever and maybe without maybe test it first so but um you know like it does a huge amount
2427280	2431920	there's a lot of mathematics behind the scenes not all of it particularly complicated but it's
2431920	2438160	definitely a lot of it and it's all massively parallelized on a GPU and you know so you can
2438160	2444720	actually get away with a few dozen lines of code to get a pretty nifty neural network going
2444720	2448000	let's see that that's good to hear because you know when you start talking about the ins and
2448000	2452560	outs it's like this sounds so complicated so it's like PyTorch just a library or something that you
2452560	2457200	would import and then just you just send some commands to it yeah Torch started off as a
2457200	2463360	machine learning library in um well it was written in C presumably but and CUDA but it was it was for
2463360	2468160	Lua and again that's another language I have a should we say a very strong mixed opinions about
2468880	2473600	however since then TensorFlow came along in Python I think it was seen as Python's more
2473680	2479200	convenient for the majority of developers and so PyTorch spawned off Torch basically and is now
2479200	2487520	the dominant library for this so TensorFlow is Google and PyTorch is Facebook AI or meta AI I
2487520	2492480	suppose it is now and that's the one you would start with here if you were starting I yeah so
2492480	2496400	this is it people have different opinions on this I think that the just give us your opinion
2496400	2501280	because you know we I just sorry to interrupt I just want to put it this way I like to have
2501280	2506960	parts like when I talk to experts like yourself it's like okay I'm new now how do I go from like
2506960	2511200	knowing nothing to like at least getting started if so if you anything you can help me yeah well I
2511200	2515280	mean I tell you what knowledge whatever yeah yeah yeah I would start with PyTorch personally
2515280	2520160	right from a research point of view PyTorch is more flexible which helps me but it also doesn't
2520160	2526640	require a lot of lines of code um to get running and it also does a nice thing where it doesn't hide
2526640	2530560	away all of the details there's just enough detail in there that you can kind of type away and it'll
2530560	2536000	kind of work but you do see the network going forward and learning and optimizing the weights
2536000	2539920	and things like this there's a few lines of code but do that that you can kind of look at and go
2540400	2546480	and then you kind of pick these things up right it's not a case that you just type PyTorch.train
2546480	2550960	and pass it your input data and then it just does it and you have no idea what happened
2550960	2556880	which I like because that wouldn't be fun right but also you wouldn't learn anything so I like
2556880	2563280	PyTorch from that for that reason it also has a load of examples so if you go on the um if you
2563280	2568000	go on the github repository for PyTorch or Torchvision you get the the whole you've got all the like
2568000	2573920	core networks that are big from the literature in there and you've also got some examples of simple
2573920	2577600	data problems and things like this that you can run from end to end and just basically run the
2577600	2581040	file and it will start training a network and then you can delve in and see what it is it's
2581040	2585200	actually doing. Do you need I think you mentioned a GPU do you need specific hardware or can you
2585200	2592000	just run this on your laptop? You need you really need a um so PyTorch uses CUDA right so you really
2592000	2596960	could do with using a um I don't know if PyTorch supports OpenCL I can't remember ideally you
2596960	2603040	would have access to a CUDA enabled GPU that would make this process much much faster so as I mentioned
2603040	2608800	the back end of of PyTorch and most of these deep learning libraries is written in C and CUDA and it's
2608800	2614000	just massively parallelized matrix modifications most of the time and that is something that you
2614000	2618560	don't want to be doing on a CPU right you can for very small networks run it on a CPU so if you
2618560	2623840	download the simplest PyTorch example when you run it on a CPU it will run okay and you'll be able to
2623840	2629200	see what happens. Anything with images anything where the dimensionality is high you're going to be
2629200	2633760	waiting half an hour for it just to finish one pass and it won't get anything done. One other
2633760	2641440	thing you might like to try is Google Colab so Google Colab is um is Google's public Jupiter
2641440	2646960	notebook style laboratory environment that actually provides limited time but fair use
2646960	2652080	access to GPUs to to have a go at these things right it's a it's a great place to go and you
2652080	2657200	can also download loads of Colab notebooks existing implementations to test them out that's a great
2657200	2662320	place to start you know I'm a big fan of Google Colab I think that as a platform it's really really
2662320	2667200	useful um and you can actually pay us I mean I'm not I don't work for Google Colab you can pay a
2667280	2673920	small subscription to get access to higher access or more preference more um should we say higher
2673920	2679040	priority access to GPUs right that's what you know you can get um so it's it's like fair use
2679040	2682960	normally so if you if you use it a lot you might have to wait for half a day or something.
2682960	2687840	I mean in the best case scenario I'd come and attend one of your classes um but not everyone's
2687840	2693040	going to be able to do that um do you have books or online courses or stuff that you would personally
2693760	2698560	yeah so I mean what I always recommend to people is Andrew Ung's Coursera course on
2698560	2703360	machine learning is a great place to start right now it's lower it's lower level so Andrew Ung is
2703360	2708400	is is very well known in the machine learning community he's you know he's he's done a load
2708400	2713360	of great work um his Coursera course is really good it's quite mathematical right so that isn't
2713360	2717200	necessarily a problem you just have to go in knowing that's going to happen right but what it
2717200	2722240	does do is it gives you a lot of information on stuff that we haven't really talked about so things
2722240	2726800	like watching your learning rate your loss your your loss function go down right so if you if you
2726800	2731760	draw a graph of your loss which is your error at the end of your network over time what should
2731760	2735680	happen is it gets better and better right it goes down but it might not go down it might
2735680	2739760	sort of do this a lot of machine learning is understanding what that means and what you could
2739760	2743520	try and do to rectify that problem you know for the first for your first day of machine learning
2743520	2748160	it's not important but over time some of the concepts that you talk about in this machine
2748240	2754160	learning course will come in handy and there's a book by Yoshua Benjo called Deep Learning which
2754160	2759760	also again a lot of maths in it but it covers a lot of the core concepts personally i'm a kind of
2759760	2765840	i've always been a kind of learn by doing kind of a person right and so in what i like to do is just
2765840	2770000	get on the pie torch or the TensorFlow tutorials and just start running some stuff and see what
2770000	2774720	happens and if you know python or you know any language that's even plausibly similar to python
2774720	2778080	you're you know you're going to have you're going to have a great time doing that i think
2778640	2782000	especially for a lot of the audience if they starting out with us let's say there's younger
2782000	2786320	people who starting their careers and i spoke about this in the beginning about you know people
2786320	2790960	are worrying that this will take their jobs away but i'm assuming there's whenever i see the hype
2790960	2797920	cycle there seems to be a lot of demand for ai skills huge demand yeah yeah there's a huge
2797920	2801040	demand so i would say there's there's kind of you know you've got your different levels of
2801040	2805120	sort of data analysts right so you've got people who are pretty good with a spreadsheet up to people
2805120	2809840	who are working trying to train self-driving cars and things i suppose if i'm being sort of a bit
2809840	2814160	bit random in my choices of job description and you know you've got anywhere in between there's
2814160	2819600	huge demand everywhere so you know if you have any kind of data analysis ability if you can look at
2819600	2824320	a table of data and start to pick out patterns and start to work out what's going on and make
2824320	2829360	predictions on that data that's a really useful skill to have in lots and lots of jobs it's a very
2829360	2834720	very um very very popular thing that people have so a lot we have a lot of graduates who graduate
2834720	2839760	with a few modules in machine learning and a few modules in data analysis and things like this and
2839760	2843680	they and they're in a really strong position these things are not you know you can learn these things
2843680	2847520	yourself so you know you can go in i've got a data analysis course it's not very long obviously
2847520	2852160	because you know youtube videos but i have some data analysis videos there are lots of data analysis
2852160	2856160	videos on your youtube channel yeah yeah on our youtube channel computer file we have like a 10
2856160	2860480	part series on data analysis which is just kind of like a taster but you can have a go at that
2860480	2866240	there's lots of stuff on data analysis data analysis and uh modeling and machine learning in some
2866240	2870640	ways go hand in hand it's often good to have a little bit of a look at both of them because
2871360	2876080	you know cleaning data for example like you get you get a spreadsheet of data but doesn't make any
2876080	2880560	sense it's unwise just to stick that straight into a neural network and see what you get out because
2880560	2885360	there could be some complete you know it could be missing values there could be errors they could
2885360	2890080	all just have hugely different scales of data these are all things to think about so some knowledge
2890080	2894640	of how to prepare that data for let's say a downstream task like machine learning it's a
2894640	2898960	really useful thing to know how to do as well i love that you're teaching at the university you're
2898960	2904480	teaching security cybersecurity type stuff but you're also doing AI so there you see that like
2904480	2909040	that's a really good mix and i'm assuming based on what you've just said you know it's a really good
2909040	2913200	idea if you if you if you're into cyber or want to get into cyber to you know add this to your
2913280	2917120	skill set yeah i mean i would be hard pressed to find any career that wouldn't be at least helped
2917120	2920960	a little bit by knowing some data analysis of machine learning because just it just comes up a
2920960	2927120	lot right you know and and also i mean as you know we already spoke about how people can be misled
2927120	2932640	by the hype cycle right and and you will be much more resistant to this if you understand how these
2932640	2938320	things work and that's going to put you in a good position i yeah i i think that um so i as it happens
2938320	2942240	i teach security i partly i find it really interesting so i try and cling on to that module
2942240	2948560	with you know with a with a vice grip and not let anyone else have it um i also teach cryptography
2948560	2954000	uh at at university as well and get you back for some more interviews man yeah right so yeah by
2954000	2959040	all means but so those are subjects i find i don't actively research day to day but i do find very
2959040	2962960	very interesting and i do have some collaborations with because we have actual security researchers
2962960	2966960	working at nottingham in lots of places we have good collaborations with them there is obviously
2966960	2972000	machine learning involved in quite a lot of security because it's a it's a it's one of many
2972000	2978160	strategies for detecting malware or for anomaly detection or you know any smart system that's
2978160	2982560	doing something but hopefully you don't have to program all the rules yourself so yeah it does it
2982560	2986800	does help i've got i think i've got a project uh an undergraduate student starting who's going to
2986800	2990560	look at malware detection with a bit of machine learning as well and so she can bring the knowledge
2990560	2995200	of the malware i can bring the knowledge of the uh of mostly the ai you know and it'll be it'll be
2995200	2999760	great mic i always like to ask this question um if you were talking to your younger self let's say
2999760	3005360	you were 18 or you know i don't know let's say not everyone is 18 who watches these videos but let's
3005360	3010160	say they were 25 30 whatever yeah what would you advise someone to do based on you know what you've
3010160	3015440	seen i think if you're if you're really interested in it in a career in cyber security or a career in
3015440	3020960	uh machine learning it's worth noting that not everyone has a degree that does those things and
3020960	3025520	that's fine right it's also fine if you do have a degree i see people saying well you don't need a
3025520	3030320	degree for this or you do need a degree for this i actually think learn the skills right and then
3030320	3034400	you get a job based on your experience it's you know and you're going to have a great time i think
3034400	3037760	that again it's not one of these debates i like to get into because everyone has their own career
3037760	3041600	path that they want to follow if you're if you're if you did a degree in something completely different
3041600	3044720	and you've worked in a job you're not really enjoying and you want to try something new i think
3044720	3050720	that's absolutely fine have a go there's so many resources online that there weren't 20 30 years ago
3051280	3055280	that there are you know people doing interviews and videos on different topics that you can just
3055280	3060720	watch and learn about and as i say i'm a very hands-on person if i want to try and learn a skill
3060720	3066480	i'm just going to try and do it and it will probably go really wrong the first time um so i think that
3067120	3073120	practice right and this is true of coding as well i think i'm big big um believer but coding is
3073200	3076960	mostly practice people say like how did you know that was going to be a bug because i've seen it
3076960	3081600	so many times before you know like because it happens all the time i think yeah that would be
3081600	3086400	what i would do find something you love doing and do more of that you know i program at home for fun
3086400	3090640	and it's partly because i find it fun and also sometimes i want to learn something new i did a
3090640	3095760	video a year or two ago on the enigma machine right i don't need to program the enigma machine
3095760	3099440	for my job i just thought it was super interesting and i just sat at home and did it and i learned
3099440	3103760	quite a lot actually about the whole process and the history of it by just having to implement the
3103760	3109200	thing and so i think yeah i think crack on and learn would be what i would do i love that i mean
3109200	3116400	and i just have to say this you are doctor uh mike you you you got phd yeah is that right in
3116400	3121280	what in what was it in computer vision so i mean what i really love about this and um this is just
3121280	3128080	my opinion so i don't want to put you on the spot but um i love that you as someone with a phd
3128880	3134320	are not excluding excluding people who perhaps never had that opportunity and i love that you're
3134320	3139840	encouraging everyone you know just to go for it don't let your limitations or yeah lack of resources
3139840	3144240	stop you sorry i mean as it happens like i wasn't i was a pretty average student at school right i
3144240	3150000	mean i i didn't i didn't do much much there wasn't much in terms of computer science um in at school
3150000	3155600	when i was younger it was it was you know let's use microsoft word and and and let's try that out
3155600	3159520	and so i didn't i barely did any computing at all i could only a little i could only a program
3159520	3165200	a tiny bit when i arrived at university loads of people arrive at university with huge programming
3165200	3169840	experience but and loads of people arrive with no programming experience and we always say to them
3169840	3174640	you'll all be the same in the end right like that's the whole point of a degree and it's a whole
3174640	3179280	point of what we teach i think that it's never too late to get to get into computers and learn
3179280	3182800	about programming and stuff i try and teach people to program all the time i mean not all of them
3182800	3188240	were interested which is annoying um but you know so like if it was up to me all my family
3188240	3191760	would be able to program because i'd be giving them extra lessons but some of them want to do
3191760	3196160	other things apparently but yeah i'm not i'm not a gate i don't want to be a gatekeeper because
3196960	3201280	that's not going to get more people doing cool computer stuff there are some things where a
3201280	3205600	massive specialism is important right you know i'm not proposing to go into a hospital and start
3205600	3209440	surgery on people because you need a lot of training to do these things but i also think
3209440	3213840	that if someone wanted to be a surgeon they should crack on and do the training right you know you
3213840	3219760	know i think you can learn those skills um and you know we require if you're going to work at
3219760	3225040	university we usually require a phd and that's something that universities require but there's
3225040	3228720	a great deal i don't know about the real world and industry about people who are watching will
3228720	3233600	know way more about than me and that's also fine right you know everyone's got their own expertise
3233600	3238400	so i like to learn from those people and hope i can teach them a bit about the things i know about
3238400	3243920	i love that i love that another thing i mean i i said 18 but i i get a lot of pushback sometimes
3243920	3249120	on these videos and i'm not sure if you've heard this question before am i too old to start learning
3249120	3255920	ai no um no i mean consider also that the majority of academics who are using ai aren't
3256560	3262560	18 year old fresh graduates they are researchers that have been doing it for decades because you
3262560	3266320	know so we've all had to learn it from scratch as well right like i say deep learning only appeared
3266320	3272400	in 2014 so it's been a mad rush since then there's loads of scope to learn um and i don't think it
3272400	3276480	takes to get a little bit going it doesn't take that many hours you know if you want to do something
3276480	3280880	you know around your job or whatever it is your current life situation is i think it's doable
3280880	3286720	i love that any closing thoughts no i think um i hope people found it interesting right and i
3286720	3291840	happy to come back and talk about more topics in detail but i think that you know i love um i love
3291840	3295680	my job and telling people about stuff that i think is interesting so i would encourage
3295680	3299600	those people to go off and and look into it in a bit more detail and have a go to download a
3299600	3303200	pie talk tutorial and start running it and you'll train a deep network and then when someone goes
3303200	3306400	all this deep learning is a bit scary you can go well actually i did that last week and it wasn't
3306400	3311280	that wasn't that difficult yeah that that's what i'd suggest so for everyone watching please put
3311280	3315760	in the comments below topics that you would like us to discuss definitely want to try and get mic
3315760	3320880	back so um let us know what you want us to talk about uh computer file has a lot of fantastic
3320880	3324880	videos that mic has created um so go and have a look at those i'll i'll link some of those below
3325680	3336800	please give us your feedback mic thanks so much thanks so much love to be here
