0	6520	I'm just going to share my screen as well.
6520	7520	Excellent.
7520	11480	Well, thank you so much for joining me today.
11480	13080	My name is Amber Daines.
13080	18000	If you haven't heard of me on the podcast waves before or worked with me, I've got a
18000	20320	few clients here today.
20320	23320	My podcast actually launched just over five years ago.
23320	25920	It's called The Politics of Everything.
25920	28720	And despite its title, it's actually not about politics.
28720	34920	If you look at the true definition of politics, that is, in fact, the nuances and the things
34920	37560	that make it work in society.
37560	43640	So I've been a journalist, so I understood, I guess, how to have a catchy title.
43640	46120	Some people, the hardest thing is thinking, I've got an idea.
46120	49360	I'd like to have a podcast, but how do I how do I have the name?
49360	53640	So I kind of got the name very early, but then didn't know how to do any of it.
53640	57960	So my podcast is about five and a bit years old.
57960	60560	I have had a couple of breaks from it as well.
60560	64640	And we'll talk about how you manage that around your other commitments as well.
64640	66760	But it's actually a passion project.
66760	68240	I love it.
68240	70040	I don't really make lots of money out of it.
70040	75120	I have a small sponsor that covers costs, but certainly it's something I love to do.
75120	79560	So if you don't love doing podcasting like anything, it will become a chore.
79560	81240	That's how I felt about my blog.
81240	85320	So I stopped blogging and started podcasting.
85320	89360	Just an quick acknowledgement of country for anyone that is in Australia today.
89360	90560	You'll understand what this is.
90560	94880	We do have some overseas audience members with us today as well.
94880	97680	But I just like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land
97680	104280	in which I'm running this webinar today and pay my respects to elders past, present and emerging.
106640	112520	OK, what we are going to cover in our time today, and we obviously have a limited amount of time together.
112520	117360	And I want to get to some of your questions is, I guess, the technical basics for a lot of people.
117360	122720	This is the biggest, I guess, roadblock or barrier for you to actually kick off your podcast.
122720	124320	What do you need to do?
124320	131160	And the reality is when I started my podcast in 2017, it was a very opaque process.
131160	133160	There wasn't a million platforms.
133160	134520	Zoom barely existed.
134520	136480	So we didn't think about using that.
136480	142160	Maybe people were talking about podcasting on Skype and working out how that might all go together.
142240	148160	The editing process was either having to hire a studio and getting somebody else to kind of edit it for you
148160	155680	or perhaps having to buy some equipment, if you like, literally some equipment to actually edit your podcast.
155680	157040	So it sounded OK.
157040	158680	And of course, buying all the bits and pieces.
158680	163440	I've got my podcasting earphones on today and I also have a road microphone,
163440	168240	which I've had for the entire time just because it's so simple, it's plug and play.
168240	171240	So we'll go through some of the technical stuff, including your room set up.
171240	174840	So you certainly don't want to be sitting in a concrete bunker doing a podcast.
174840	177960	Sound is everything when it comes to this particular medium.
177960	179640	The second thing we're going to have a little think about.
179640	183800	And if you don't have your laptop with you or you prefer pen and paper,
183800	189960	maybe just pull that together, a bit of a heads up that we're going to get you to start to think about your actual podcast idea,
189960	198760	if that's where you're at, how to plan your podcast niche, if you like, why you're doing a podcast and I guess your goals for the podcast.
198760	200880	So we only do what we measure.
200880	207960	So if you have a goal of what you'd like to do, it might even be the deadline to start and record your first episode by the end of the year.
207960	211520	Actually, having that written down by the end of this session will help you get started.
211520	218720	And then I guess the final bit is the bits that I guess I've learned the hard way when I've made all the rookie errors that you possibly can,
218720	226440	including not pressing record when you have a guest on the line and having to ask them to come back and record all those bits and pieces.
226440	229280	But also a bit of a VIP offer for you today.
229280	235080	If you do want to work with me, I'm going to be launching a new online course, which gives you kind of all the templates and the details.
235080	242080	So this is very much the what and then the how would be something which we could talk about after this particular session today.
242080	244840	So hopefully that meets your expectations.
244840	249960	And if you've got any questions, as I mentioned, we can cover those in the chat box.
249960	256040	Otherwise, we might do some questions at the end where you can unmute yourself and ask me.
256040	259000	OK, this was my first podcast image.
259000	262920	I've evolved it since then, but the graphics are very much the same.
262920	265400	It's called the Politics of Everything, as I mentioned.
265400	270840	I have had a career in journalism, so I probably have a slight content advantage
270840	275800	when it comes to understanding how to interview people because I interview guests on my show.
275800	282920	I am the solo host, but I have guests from all walks of life, all ages and stages and all industries.
282960	287200	And that was really important to me because I wanted to be really enjoy the conversations I was having.
287200	292640	So I wanted to be able to curate, I guess, guests and topics, which I thought other people wanted to hear about,
292640	296720	but also that I would enjoy actually speaking to people about.
296720	299120	I spent a number of years in journalism about a decade.
299120	302480	I started off my career in Australia in newspapers when those existed.
302480	304800	There's not so many of those around today.
304800	309360	But then I worked in Hong Kong and London as a correspondent in the business space.
309480	315640	I've also had a brief career in TV journalism and have never actually been a radio journalist.
315640	320360	So even though I understood journalism, I wasn't a broadcast radio journalist.
320360	324640	So that's why the tech stuff for me was probably my biggest barrier to getting started,
324640	326800	even though I had an idea for a show.
326800	330200	I now run a couple of agencies in PR and communications,
330200	335400	anything from ASX listed companies through to small startups and entrepreneurs.
335400	340040	I helped them with reputation or management, crisis comms and media training work.
340040	346040	So my podcast was really just a seed of an idea, literally thought of just driving along in the car,
346040	347640	listening to other podcasts.
347640	351480	But I guess what it did for me reflected my areas of interest.
351480	354000	And this is what I would encourage everyone to do.
354000	359720	I could have done a podcast about PR and communications, but that would have bored me senseless.
359720	364120	And I figured, you know what, I'm not doing this to purely attract clients.
364120	367600	In fact, I rarely interview clients on my show.
367600	371800	There's a little bit of a kind of decision I made that if you're great, what you do,
371800	372600	I will have you on.
372600	376480	But it's certainly not something that I offer to my clients that I do PR work for.
376480	377760	But I really love business.
377760	379520	I love economics.
379520	381960	I love modern society and I love people.
381960	385480	So putting all of that together really made my show sing.
385480	389280	So one of the things you need to think about is what do you love to talk about
389280	391080	or do you like to find out about?
391080	395000	Because at the end of the day, your podcast is not about you.
395000	398080	It's very much about your audience and finding an audience.
398080	402560	So making sure what you've got to share and what questions you're asking people,
402560	407360	illicit answers that other people are going to get something from is really, really important.
407360	412920	It's important not to just have it as opinion, but very much as a conversation where possible.
412920	416040	If you want to kind of keep going with a particular podcast idea.
418200	419160	This is my show now.
419160	422200	So I sort of I took an 18 month break.
422200	427320	I was working full time in a in a government role and didn't have that flexibility to record
427320	430360	because, of course, you've got to find time to actually record.
430360	432040	And all my recording is done remotely.
432040	433520	I don't go into a studio.
433520	437480	My guests could be anywhere from Sydney, me, where I live, to New York,
437480	440640	to I've had guests in Germany, Israel, all around the world.
440640	442080	So that means different time zones.
442080	445440	So you do need flexibility if you want to have a global show.
445440	448760	But the idea being that if you do have that time commitment,
448760	453560	you can actually produce a show in less than an hour a week if you are very organized
453560	457240	and you know exactly what you're doing, which is what I'm here to help you to do today.
457240	464440	So I launched in May 2017 and I went IRL as the kids say in real life to visit my guests.
464440	468760	Because back then, I guess we didn't really do all that Zoom stuff.
468760	473160	It was all a bit nerve wracking for the guests as well to go, what do I need?
473160	474440	Do I need your phones?
474440	478600	How do I am I going to sound making sure that they didn't have to worry about that?
478600	485480	So I would actually schlep around to guest offices or before work or wherever they wanted to meet me
485480	489640	and actually go in there and record on my laptop with Zencaster,
489640	491520	which is the program I've used since the beginning.
491520	496080	And it's come a long way and we'll have a little chat about that when we get to the technical stuff.
496080	498400	But the sound quality was awful.
498400	503200	I'm going to tell you if you listen to my first episode, episode one May 2017,
503200	505080	I do sound like I'm in a concrete bunker.
505080	512320	And that's because the office that we recorded in where my guest worked was a very echoey, cool warehouse environment.
512320	517440	But it had that sort of reverberating sound and in journalism, we call that live sound.
517440	522720	So if you clap your hands and you can hear echoing, that means it's not the right room to do that in.
522720	524800	But I couldn't control the environment.
524800	526200	And so I just went with it.
526200	531040	But I'm very much aware that that my early episodes do not sound as good as my ones do now.
531040	535560	The other mistake I made was not having my sound quality volume at the right level.
535560	541760	So in my earphones, it sounded fine, but then it was either too soft or too loud.
541760	545040	And that's when you get kind of variations between you and your guests.
545040	550880	So I might be really loudly asking the questions and then they are kind of really softly speaking.
550880	559640	Now, my audio team could fix that to an extent, but it's much better to have fantastic, you know, sound from the beginning.
559640	564800	You know, you can get your editor to do what you like, but they can only make it sound so good.
564800	566800	And I had very few downloads.
566800	571920	So I knew this would be a little bit of a long process that I also really didn't know what I was in for.
571920	576360	So I think I had an average of 10 downloads, which is a little bit disheartening.
576360	583720	And over time, of course, with my guest sharing the show with, you know, obviously getting good ratings on iTunes and things like that.
583720	588560	I have between 10,000, 25,000 downloads per episode.
588600	592640	It interestingly depends on not only the guest, but the topic.
592640	596920	So people often ask me, you know, do you have someone famous?
596920	598360	Is that the biggest downloads?
598360	599400	Often it's not.
599400	601080	Often it's just the topic.
601080	605000	So something like cryptocurrency, if it's really topical, might attract a lot of listeners,
605000	609000	even if that person is not the most famous person in that space.
609000	613560	So I think it just depends where we are at the time when we're listening to the show.
613560	615840	And I get a lot of historical listens as well.
615840	619320	So that week, I might get 10,000 downloads.
619320	626520	But then if I look back at the the recording a month or two later, there's people who've gone back and listened to episodes.
626520	636040	So even though I released them once a week on a Wednesday, I actually know that people aren't, you know, necessarily binge listening to my show the day it launches.
636040	644160	But maybe finding time to listen to it at a later period or searching for the topic or the guest name and it comes up in their feed as well.
644280	645720	And it's very organic, my show.
645720	651320	So I've had up to three million downloads, I think just over three million this week.
651320	652320	It's all organic.
652320	658400	So what I mean by that is I don't charge my guests to come on the show.
658400	660520	They don't pay me to be on the show.
660520	665880	And I haven't taken out Facebook ads or LinkedIn ads or any of those things.
665880	673760	This is just purely through doing it in many ways, the hard way, but the way in which I think was a good sort of investment of my time
673760	680520	and limited money when I when I started and the show has kind of gone from strength to strength in that regard.
680520	687280	OK, this is the bit where I want you to grab your pen and paper, your laptops or your notes on your phone, whatever it would be.
687280	698840	And if you are thinking about doing a podcast or you have started one and you just want to really, I guess, spend this this mindful time we have together today actually focusing on how that could be better.
698840	702560	These are the things I would want you to answer for yourself.
702560	705920	And you don't have to put them in the chat, although you can, if you want to.
705920	710120	What is a topic you could talk about for at least a year?
710120	716680	So my show, I record 44 episodes a year and I have an eight week break over the Australian summer.
716680	721440	So I need enough topics and ideas to sustain that.
721440	723600	Now, people often change their podcast show.
723600	725560	They might do it for a year.
725560	731040	Then they have a different podcast or multiple podcasts, if that's kind of the thing they want to be doing.
731040	735560	But for me and my show, that's partly why I didn't do a communications and PR show.
735560	740120	Because I probably can think of 20 episodes and then it's going to get really boring and repetitive.
740120	744600	So thinking about what could I talk about once a week for a year?
744600	747200	If you just want to do one year and see what it's like, that's fine.
747200	749360	But you do need some longevity in your podcast.
749360	751320	It's kind of like posting on social.
751320	754680	You can't just do five episodes and think that's going to be enough.
754680	759000	What is your unique selling proposition and does your show title reflect that?
759000	764240	So I feel a little bit lucky in some ways that I got into podcasting quite early
764240	768800	because there are so many shows now and I have a catalogue of content.
768800	773640	But if you have a show title, making sure that you sound a little bit different
773640	777080	or very specific to what you want to talk about.
777080	779960	It can be cheeky, it can be quirky, whatever.
779960	782520	But I always encourage you to be relatively short and brief.
782520	784000	It's kind of like a headline.
784000	788160	And then obviously your guests and so forth will define some of that content.
788200	789880	So have a think about that.
789880	791760	And who is your audience?
791760	793880	Who do you want to speak to?
793880	797680	Now, I have a podcast information pack, I send all my guests and I.
797680	799880	My audience has kind of found me.
799880	801800	So I've probably done it the wrong way.
801800	807240	But the way I thought of it was, well, I'm not doing this to create client base.
807240	812280	So I'm not talking to, you know, clients who necessarily want communications,
812280	815600	expertise and in a higher me in my day job.
815600	818240	But I very much thought, well, who do I want to speak to?
818240	820360	And I think it was kind of people like me.
820360	823880	But then I realized I actually want to talk to people who were older,
823880	827640	who were younger, who were different parts of the world, who had different experiences.
827640	833960	So my audience has kind of evolved as my guest catalogue has evolved, if that makes sense.
833960	837720	So I would definitely say for the first two years in my show,
838000	842920	80 percent of my guests and the audience that listened to them were in Australia
842920	845800	because that's where the show is is done.
845800	847760	And that's where most of my guests came from.
847760	853080	As I've attracted or sought guests from around the world, obviously, that's grown.
853080	859440	So at the moment, I think about 35 percent of my audience is actually from the United States,
859440	863040	which kind of blows my mind a bit because a lot of the topics and the guests
863040	866360	that we speak to are still predominantly in this this part of the world.
866360	870960	But I do have a number of US guests I've had on the last year or so.
871160	874600	And I think it's great to have a global perspective and it keeps the show fresh
874600	879760	and interesting and relevant to more than people that just would be my everyday circle.
880760	883360	Also do a little bit of research of who your competitor shows.
883360	887160	And when I say competitor, I don't mean, well, you need to try and outrank them,
887160	890640	although I'm sure that would be one of your goals, but much more.
891520	892920	Who else is doing something similar?
892920	898600	So the inspiration for my show initially, despite the fact I had an idea,
898840	903240	the style of interview that I wanted to elicit, but in a much shorter form.
903240	908920	And not all people would necessarily know the show was an ABC radio in Sydney.
909520	913880	There's an interviewer called Richard Fidler, who does a show called Conversations with Richard Fidler.
914600	918240	It's it's very much, you know, a middle class, middle age show,
918240	920360	reflecting, I guess, my own demographic.
920360	924720	But in many ways, the style of interview is what I wanted to elicit.
924760	930440	So have a little bit of depth, have some consistency to some of the questions in the style.
930440	934840	And then obviously, other questions will be dependent on that guest's experience
934840	937000	or things that I think the audience want to hear about.
937000	941160	Maybe their top three tips on a particular topic or the biggest lesson
941160	944040	that they might have learned from perhaps a business failure,
944040	946240	if that's something that they've experienced.
946240	948120	So I listened to his show a lot.
948120	951640	I try to think about how I could inject my own style into that.
952280	957880	And there was another show in the US that used to have a similar format,
957880	961560	but on a TV show where it was called the Actors Studio.
961560	962640	It doesn't exist anymore.
962640	967760	And the host would get actors on famous actors to come in
967760	970400	and answer very detailed questions over an hour or so.
970400	972600	My show is a bit less than that's about 30 minutes
972600	976080	and then actually have some consistency in the question.
976080	980480	So that particular show, it would ask a question, which I don't ask in my show
980480	981480	to give you an example.
981480	984520	It would say, you know, if you if you were to pass away today
984520	986320	and you were to go to the pearly gates of heaven,
986320	989080	what would you what would you imagine God would say to you?
989080	992760	And I just thought that was so playful and fun and and deep,
992760	996600	but something that people in the audience would actually always want to hear
996600	998200	because you don't often hear that kind of thing.
998200	1000760	So I think a little bit about when I say competitors,
1000760	1003280	maybe complimentary and competitor shows.
1003280	1006320	And I guess the style of interview you want to come across.
1006320	1010480	Are you trying to, I guess, be quirky and funny?
1010480	1012680	Are you trying to be deep?
1012680	1014920	Is it always going to be serious topics?
1014920	1017440	Or can you do things that are a little bit fun as well?
1018040	1021160	And having a think about who else you love listening to and why?
1021440	1023760	So do some research before you get started.
1023760	1025400	The other questions to ask yourself is,
1025400	1027720	are you going to be the only host on the show?
1028160	1030800	Or are you going to have alternative hosts?
1030800	1034000	And that frequency and consistency matters.
1034040	1036880	So I've always hosted my show myself.
1037440	1038600	I've never had a co-host.
1038600	1042960	I've had duo guests on the show because sometimes that's really important
1042960	1047320	because the type of business that they have, it means that they, you know,
1047320	1049000	they they're a duo and they work together.
1049000	1051120	And it's important to have both people on that program
1051120	1052920	and I guess alternate questions.
1052920	1056000	But deciding if you're going to do that, or are you going to rotate hosts?
1056000	1059400	So sometimes some of the clients that I work with,
1059400	1063800	they might actually have seasons where a particular people in their company
1063800	1067240	for example, if they're doing a business podcast will host the show
1067240	1069920	for that season and then they'll move on to somebody else.
1070160	1072200	But a little bit of frequency and consistency matters.
1072200	1075480	And what I mean by that is my show is always under 30 minutes.
1075800	1078000	The former journalist to me is very good at that.
1078520	1082120	I just know how to wrap it up and also guide the question
1082120	1085640	so that the depth of question is not so so much that, you know,
1085640	1088120	one answer is taking 10 minutes of the show,
1088480	1092000	but allowing you to the audience to know what to expect in the show.
1092280	1095120	And the other thing is really important just to think about
1095120	1097120	is that podcasts do not make you lots of money.
1097120	1098560	OK, it's like books.
1098560	1101360	If you produce a business book, it's like an expensive business card.
1101360	1104360	I know I've written a couple, but it gives you a platform.
1104360	1108680	So to give you a ballpark idea, each episode to produce,
1108680	1111280	and that includes all the tech bits that I need to have it happen,
1111880	1114080	is around one hundred and fifty US dollars a week.
1114080	1115680	And I have a 44 week show.
1115680	1119800	So you can do the maths up and after, you know, a period of time,
1119800	1123160	you might get sponsors and ways in which you can cut those costs down.
1123440	1127200	I don't edit my own show because I love content and I don't want to do that.
1127200	1130520	And I figure my time is spent better any money in my day job.
1130520	1132080	So that's not something I fiddle around with.
1132080	1134200	I have a team that do that for me.
1134200	1136280	But generally speaking, there are some things,
1136280	1140640	subscription things that you need to sign up for to actually host your platform
1141280	1145120	to record on, to be able to actually get it into iTunes, Spotify
1145120	1147600	and all the places that you need it to be.
1147640	1150720	But as I said, you can monetize them as as you go along,
1150880	1152440	but you can't monetize them in the beginning.
1152440	1157160	OK, so most, you know, organisations like Zencast is my sponsor,
1157160	1161680	who's who I use and I have used since the beginning of my show to record on
1161680	1163720	is now kind of expanded its offering.
1164000	1168280	It it very much, you know, has a fixed subscription model,
1168280	1170200	which you have to subscribe to for a year.
1170200	1173640	So just just be aware there are a few set up costs regardless.
1175080	1176840	OK, have you all had a couple of minutes
1176840	1180200	to think about what some of these things are for you?
1180200	1185520	Does anyone want to chuck anything in the chat about maybe an idea that they've got
1185520	1189680	or, you know, something that they want to ask about how to get started?
1194160	1196520	No, just happy to hear. OK, great.
1196520	1197880	I'll keep going.
1197880	1200360	These are the tech bits. OK, so these are the basics.
1200360	1204040	This is the minimum stuff you are probably going to have to invest in
1204040	1205360	if you haven't already.
1205360	1206600	And these are ballpark figures.
1206600	1209120	So it's kind of like buying a new car.
1209120	1211360	You could buy the Toyota, you could buy the BMW.
1211360	1215920	So I would just start off with something pretty basic if and that's easy to use.
1215920	1217320	I'm not the most technical person.
1217320	1220480	And as I said, I love content, but I don't want to sit there editing
1221080	1223200	soundbites and putting my intros in every week.
1223320	1225040	It's not doesn't spark joy for me.
1225040	1226480	And it's not something I do.
1226480	1230800	But my microphone and headset combination, I think, was about four hundred dollars
1230800	1232280	at the time.
1232280	1234360	I've only had to replace the headset once.
1234400	1235760	So that's a pretty good investment.
1235760	1240200	And I use road just because they really are designed for newbies
1240200	1243400	and are very easy and compatible with all sorts of systems.
1244000	1244960	You can buy a bundle.
1244960	1246520	You can buy them individually.
1246520	1249840	You might have to buy them secondhand if you go to Gumtree or something like that.
1250840	1253160	A laptop, you need to record on something.
1253520	1256720	As I mentioned to you in the beginning, when I started podcasting,
1256720	1258280	it was so very opaque.
1258280	1260560	People would actually say to me, oh, you need to hire a studio
1260560	1263320	and you need to like have all the sound equipment and all the stuff
1263360	1266040	which obviously it's going to add to your expenses.
1266040	1269280	But it also reduces your flexibility because you then you wedded to one place
1269280	1272640	and you have to get guests to try and come in and and people still do that.
1272640	1276480	But that also limits, I guess, how and when you can actually podcast.
1276920	1280400	The other thing to invest in if you haven't already in the past couple of years
1280400	1284800	of work from home for most of us during the pandemic is a standing desk.
1284800	1289400	So I'm seated today to present this to you because I'm recording with video on
1289400	1290720	but a standing desk.
1290720	1293920	I would never record my podcast sitting down.
1294520	1298560	OK, so even though I haven't been a broadcast radio journalist,
1298560	1303520	if you looked at any radio studio today, you would have all the presenters standing
1304240	1306200	and there's some very good reasons for that.
1306200	1309880	It's very much about how you access light and shade in your voice.
1310360	1311800	It's about breathing.
1311800	1316160	It's about mindfulness, being very present in your body and not distracted
1316160	1319360	when we're seated, we're a little bit sedentary, obviously.
1319360	1324680	So being able to, you know, actually stand and feel in that moment is great.
1324680	1328400	But for me, it's just a bit of a habit and I've got used to doing it that way.
1328400	1331400	So I don't know if my guests are standing or seated
1331400	1333480	because I don't record them with video on.
1333480	1336160	But I very much find the standing desk helps me.
1336600	1340640	The other thing is just being able to test the sound in your room.
1340640	1344000	So if you're going to record, you know, we're all limited.
1344000	1347120	Some people might live in an apartment that has wooden floors, for example.
1347840	1350760	But you might actually have to, initially,
1350760	1353560	and I know guests that have had to do this because I've had flatmates
1353560	1356760	or they've had something else happening is actually sit in the cupboard
1356920	1358440	and actually record in there.
1358440	1360520	It's pretty uncomfortable. It's pretty hot.
1360520	1362920	But what you will get is great sound.
1362920	1365560	You will get fully directional sound
1365560	1370520	that will make sure that we're not getting, you know, the sound of the birds chirping
1370520	1374360	or, you know, your flatmate vacuuming or the doorbell ringing.
1374360	1377880	So that's kind of what I encourage people to make sure you sound as good.
1377880	1381120	And if you can see in this little setup here, what they've got on the walls
1381520	1384840	and I've seen people do this in their home studios is sound barriers.
1384840	1388320	So they're just literally foam, but curtains and rugs
1388320	1390680	and things like that can actually help as well.
1391280	1394400	You just don't want that as I showed you before with the clapping,
1394400	1398160	that alive sound and that some of the mistakes that I made in the beginning
1398160	1400520	when I wasn't so in control of my environment.
1400520	1403760	So just record yourself and see what it sounds like.
1403760	1407280	But of course, the headphones and the mic really, really help you.
1407880	1409280	The other question I often get from people is,
1409280	1411280	does it do you guess need to have all that stuff?
1411280	1413560	Well, I just give them some tips of how to sound great.
1413560	1416720	But at the end of the day, they can actually when they are recording,
1417240	1419880	you know, they can just use their normal earbuds that they would would use.
1419880	1424520	I'd never let them record just with the laptop mic.
1424520	1426880	My laptop mic is pretty echoey
1426880	1430520	and also means all that non directional sound will pick up as well.
1430520	1433800	So if you do have the guy next door suddenly designed to mow the lawns,
1434080	1436040	that's going to be just as loud as their voice.
1436040	1438600	So just try and encourage your guests to always have some earbuds
1438600	1442640	and, you know, be able to actually block out the other sounds as best as possible
1442640	1445600	because you want them to sound as good as you sound as well.
1447160	1449320	Any questions on that?
1451080	1455480	Great. OK, so here we get into the platform stuff.
1456080	1460080	So we all know, right, you could record your podcast tomorrow on Zoom.
1460120	1463600	I've never done that, as I said, I use Encaster,
1463600	1464920	but you could technically speaking.
1464920	1469080	But what you really need to do is find a way to get that to then be edited
1469080	1471800	and then get into what we call the RSS feed.
1472200	1475520	Now, this is a little graphic of the RSS feed.
1475520	1477880	So that's the RSS feed. There you are. You've recorded.
1477880	1480920	That's great. You've got your RSS feed.
1480920	1483400	So you kind of have to get that set up.
1483400	1488280	I use something called Libsyn, which is probably one of the early ways to do that.
1488280	1490240	There are probably others out there as well.
1490240	1493240	And it's kind of what we call your hosting platform.
1493240	1497720	So it's where your edited product, if you like, your finished podcast
1497720	1502520	with its intro, its outro, its level has been checked, all bits and pieces
1502840	1504880	goes and lives forever.
1504880	1508560	So I can go back and have a look on Libsyn, for example, statistically,
1508800	1511080	you know, what's been my most downloaded episode?
1511080	1512640	What's been my longest episode?
1512640	1517520	Which weeks did that episode peak historically over the last five years?
1517760	1523000	But then what Libsyn also does is it says, you know, hey, there's podcasts here.
1523200	1524400	These are all the details.
1524400	1529440	And I get it out there to all of these platforms, Apple podcasts,
1529440	1534120	you know, Spotify, Castro, Breaker, Google Podcast, whatever it might be.
1535480	1536600	And it does that for you.
1536600	1538080	You need somebody to host it.
1538080	1541440	It can't live on your computer because that is just yours.
1541920	1545600	This is kind of like taking it, you know, down to Grand Central Station
1545680	1548400	in New York and actually blasting it everywhere.
1548400	1552040	So that allows those other platforms to actually pick up on that.
1552600	1553600	I've just done a screenshot there.
1553600	1556440	That's on iTunes, kind of what my podcast will look like.
1556440	1560680	It'll have the guests kind of title episode and then how long it was.
1560680	1562280	And it just it just feeds it every week.
1562280	1564000	And I kind of don't even have to think about it.
1564000	1565400	It's it's semi magic.
1565400	1571120	But Libsyn subscriptions, I think mine's about 20 US dollars a month.
1571600	1574880	And it's all based on storage levels like a lot of those programs are.
1574880	1578520	So if you're going to record a show every day, you'll belt through your storage.
1578520	1580280	So you might need a more expensive package
1580280	1582040	because I only do one show once a week.
1582040	1584080	That's half an hour over a year.
1584080	1587720	It's not not as much storage to actually host that show over time.
1589360	1592880	So there's just some ideas of how that that actually might work.
1593040	1595200	As I mentioned, there probably are others out there.
1595200	1597440	I'm a little bit of a it works for me.
1597440	1600760	And it's it's the right price and my team know how to use it.
1600760	1603240	So I just kind of have stuck with Libsyn from the beginning.
1603240	1607760	And they're the ones I think that most platforms will interact with as well.
1607760	1609960	So you just need to check out, you know, for example,
1609960	1612320	can I get this on Spotify and iTunes and everywhere else
1612320	1614240	that this needs to be downloaded from?
1614240	1615840	So there's some pricing.
1615840	1618880	But I think I use the twenty dollar one, which is the most popular
1618880	1621720	because I just like the flexibility of additional storage.
1621720	1623720	And also, I don't like to delete any episodes.
1623720	1626360	I want to make sure that the catalog can't kind of live there
1626360	1628760	for as long as it needs to as well.
1628760	1629960	So that's Libsyn for you.
1629960	1630960	Have a look at that.
1633280	1636640	So some of my hacks, which I, as I mentioned to you,
1636640	1639520	I made all the rookie mistakes of terrible sound.
1639880	1641280	How am I going to find guests?
1641280	1644680	Will people say yes to a show where, you know, I literally have an audience
1644680	1647200	of 10 or maybe an audience of one some weeks.
1647880	1652360	But very much when I started, I kind of knew from my broadcast
1652360	1656480	journalism days that if something's not breaking news, which my story,
1656480	1660600	my podcast isn't, I'm not doing a daily show about what's happening
1660600	1662280	in the world of politics in Australia today.
1662280	1665640	That would have to be recorded, you know, every day at a certain time.
1665960	1667480	But I batch my shows.
1667480	1672000	So I can tell you today, I have either scheduled or finished
1672000	1674680	every single episode of my podcast for the rest of the year.
1674680	1676560	And it's the second of September.
1676560	1678920	So I never without a show every week.
1679520	1681240	And that is because things happen.
1681240	1685280	People get the flu, they get covered, their planes are late, I get sick.
1685280	1687360	Something happens. My internet.
