1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
I'm just going to share my screen as well.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
Excellent.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,480
Well, thank you so much for joining me today.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,080
My name is Amber Daines.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,000
If you haven't heard of me on the podcast waves before or worked with me, I've got a

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,320
few clients here today.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,320
My podcast actually launched just over five years ago.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,920
It's called The Politics of Everything.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,720
And despite its title, it's actually not about politics.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,920
If you look at the true definition of politics, that is, in fact, the nuances and the things

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,560
that make it work in society.

12
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,640
So I've been a journalist, so I understood, I guess, how to have a catchy title.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,120
Some people, the hardest thing is thinking, I've got an idea.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,360
I'd like to have a podcast, but how do I how do I have the name?

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,640
So I kind of got the name very early, but then didn't know how to do any of it.

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,960
So my podcast is about five and a bit years old.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,560
I have had a couple of breaks from it as well.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,640
And we'll talk about how you manage that around your other commitments as well.

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,760
But it's actually a passion project.

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,240
I love it.

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,040
I don't really make lots of money out of it.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,120
I have a small sponsor that covers costs, but certainly it's something I love to do.

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,560
So if you don't love doing podcasting like anything, it will become a chore.

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,240
That's how I felt about my blog.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,320
So I stopped blogging and started podcasting.

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,360
Just an quick acknowledgement of country for anyone that is in Australia today.

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,560
You'll understand what this is.

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,880
We do have some overseas audience members with us today as well.

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,680
But I just like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,280
in which I'm running this webinar today and pay my respects to elders past, present and emerging.

31
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,520
OK, what we are going to cover in our time today, and we obviously have a limited amount of time together.

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,360
And I want to get to some of your questions is, I guess, the technical basics for a lot of people.

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,720
This is the biggest, I guess, roadblock or barrier for you to actually kick off your podcast.

34
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,320
What do you need to do?

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,160
And the reality is when I started my podcast in 2017, it was a very opaque process.

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,160
There wasn't a million platforms.

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,520
Zoom barely existed.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,480
So we didn't think about using that.

39
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,160
Maybe people were talking about podcasting on Skype and working out how that might all go together.

40
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,160
The editing process was either having to hire a studio and getting somebody else to kind of edit it for you

41
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,680
or perhaps having to buy some equipment, if you like, literally some equipment to actually edit your podcast.

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,040
So it sounded OK.

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,680
And of course, buying all the bits and pieces.

44
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,440
I've got my podcasting earphones on today and I also have a road microphone,

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,240
which I've had for the entire time just because it's so simple, it's plug and play.

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
So we'll go through some of the technical stuff, including your room set up.

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,840
So you certainly don't want to be sitting in a concrete bunker doing a podcast.

48
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,960
Sound is everything when it comes to this particular medium.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,640
The second thing we're going to have a little think about.

50
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,800
And if you don't have your laptop with you or you prefer pen and paper,

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,960
maybe just pull that together, a bit of a heads up that we're going to get you to start to think about your actual podcast idea,

52
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:18,760
if that's where you're at, how to plan your podcast niche, if you like, why you're doing a podcast and I guess your goals for the podcast.

53
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,880
So we only do what we measure.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,960
So if you have a goal of what you'd like to do, it might even be the deadline to start and record your first episode by the end of the year.

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,520
Actually, having that written down by the end of this session will help you get started.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,720
And then I guess the final bit is the bits that I guess I've learned the hard way when I've made all the rookie errors that you possibly can,

57
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,440
including not pressing record when you have a guest on the line and having to ask them to come back and record all those bits and pieces.

58
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,280
But also a bit of a VIP offer for you today.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,080
If you do want to work with me, I'm going to be launching a new online course, which gives you kind of all the templates and the details.

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,080
So this is very much the what and then the how would be something which we could talk about after this particular session today.

61
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,840
So hopefully that meets your expectations.

62
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,960
And if you've got any questions, as I mentioned, we can cover those in the chat box.

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,040
Otherwise, we might do some questions at the end where you can unmute yourself and ask me.

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,000
OK, this was my first podcast image.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,920
I've evolved it since then, but the graphics are very much the same.

66
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,400
It's called the Politics of Everything, as I mentioned.

67
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,840
I have had a career in journalism, so I probably have a slight content advantage

68
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,800
when it comes to understanding how to interview people because I interview guests on my show.

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,920
I am the solo host, but I have guests from all walks of life, all ages and stages and all industries.

70
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,200
And that was really important to me because I wanted to be really enjoy the conversations I was having.

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,640
So I wanted to be able to curate, I guess, guests and topics, which I thought other people wanted to hear about,

72
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,720
but also that I would enjoy actually speaking to people about.

73
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,120
I spent a number of years in journalism about a decade.

74
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,480
I started off my career in Australia in newspapers when those existed.

75
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,800
There's not so many of those around today.

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,360
But then I worked in Hong Kong and London as a correspondent in the business space.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,640
I've also had a brief career in TV journalism and have never actually been a radio journalist.

78
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,360
So even though I understood journalism, I wasn't a broadcast radio journalist.

79
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,640
So that's why the tech stuff for me was probably my biggest barrier to getting started,

80
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,800
even though I had an idea for a show.

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,200
I now run a couple of agencies in PR and communications,

82
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,400
anything from ASX listed companies through to small startups and entrepreneurs.

83
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,040
I helped them with reputation or management, crisis comms and media training work.

84
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,040
So my podcast was really just a seed of an idea, literally thought of just driving along in the car,

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,640
listening to other podcasts.

86
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,480
But I guess what it did for me reflected my areas of interest.

87
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,000
And this is what I would encourage everyone to do.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,720
I could have done a podcast about PR and communications, but that would have bored me senseless.

89
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,120
And I figured, you know what, I'm not doing this to purely attract clients.

90
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,600
In fact, I rarely interview clients on my show.

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,800
There's a little bit of a kind of decision I made that if you're great, what you do,

92
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,600
I will have you on.

93
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,480
But it's certainly not something that I offer to my clients that I do PR work for.

94
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,760
But I really love business.

95
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,520
I love economics.

96
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,960
I love modern society and I love people.

97
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,480
So putting all of that together really made my show sing.

98
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,280
So one of the things you need to think about is what do you love to talk about

99
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,080
or do you like to find out about?

100
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,000
Because at the end of the day, your podcast is not about you.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,080
It's very much about your audience and finding an audience.

102
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,560
So making sure what you've got to share and what questions you're asking people,

103
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,360
illicit answers that other people are going to get something from is really, really important.

104
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,920
It's important not to just have it as opinion, but very much as a conversation where possible.

105
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,040
If you want to kind of keep going with a particular podcast idea.

106
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,160
This is my show now.

107
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,200
So I sort of I took an 18 month break.

108
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,320
I was working full time in a in a government role and didn't have that flexibility to record

109
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,360
because, of course, you've got to find time to actually record.

110
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,040
And all my recording is done remotely.

111
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,520
I don't go into a studio.

112
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,480
My guests could be anywhere from Sydney, me, where I live, to New York,

113
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,640
to I've had guests in Germany, Israel, all around the world.

114
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,080
So that means different time zones.

115
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,440
So you do need flexibility if you want to have a global show.

116
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,760
But the idea being that if you do have that time commitment,

117
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,560
you can actually produce a show in less than an hour a week if you are very organized

118
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,240
and you know exactly what you're doing, which is what I'm here to help you to do today.

119
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,440
So I launched in May 2017 and I went IRL as the kids say in real life to visit my guests.

120
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,760
Because back then, I guess we didn't really do all that Zoom stuff.

121
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,160
It was all a bit nerve wracking for the guests as well to go, what do I need?

122
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,440
Do I need your phones?

123
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,600
How do I am I going to sound making sure that they didn't have to worry about that?

124
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:05,480
So I would actually schlep around to guest offices or before work or wherever they wanted to meet me

125
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,640
and actually go in there and record on my laptop with Zencaster,

126
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,520
which is the program I've used since the beginning.

127
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,080
And it's come a long way and we'll have a little chat about that when we get to the technical stuff.

128
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
But the sound quality was awful.

129
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,200
I'm going to tell you if you listen to my first episode, episode one May 2017,

130
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,080
I do sound like I'm in a concrete bunker.

131
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:32,320
And that's because the office that we recorded in where my guest worked was a very echoey, cool warehouse environment.

132
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,440
But it had that sort of reverberating sound and in journalism, we call that live sound.

133
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,720
So if you clap your hands and you can hear echoing, that means it's not the right room to do that in.

134
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,800
But I couldn't control the environment.

135
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,200
And so I just went with it.

136
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,040
But I'm very much aware that that my early episodes do not sound as good as my ones do now.

137
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,560
The other mistake I made was not having my sound quality volume at the right level.

138
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,760
So in my earphones, it sounded fine, but then it was either too soft or too loud.

139
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,040
And that's when you get kind of variations between you and your guests.

140
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,880
So I might be really loudly asking the questions and then they are kind of really softly speaking.

141
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:19,640
Now, my audio team could fix that to an extent, but it's much better to have fantastic, you know, sound from the beginning.

142
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,800
You know, you can get your editor to do what you like, but they can only make it sound so good.

143
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
And I had very few downloads.

144
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,920
So I knew this would be a little bit of a long process that I also really didn't know what I was in for.

145
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,360
So I think I had an average of 10 downloads, which is a little bit disheartening.

146
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,720
And over time, of course, with my guest sharing the show with, you know, obviously getting good ratings on iTunes and things like that.

147
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,560
I have between 10,000, 25,000 downloads per episode.

148
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,640
It interestingly depends on not only the guest, but the topic.

149
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,920
So people often ask me, you know, do you have someone famous?

150
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,360
Is that the biggest downloads?

151
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,400
Often it's not.

152
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,080
Often it's just the topic.

153
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,000
So something like cryptocurrency, if it's really topical, might attract a lot of listeners,

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
even if that person is not the most famous person in that space.

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,560
So I think it just depends where we are at the time when we're listening to the show.

156
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,840
And I get a lot of historical listens as well.

157
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,320
So that week, I might get 10,000 downloads.

158
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:26,520
But then if I look back at the the recording a month or two later, there's people who've gone back and listened to episodes.

159
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:36,040
So even though I released them once a week on a Wednesday, I actually know that people aren't, you know, necessarily binge listening to my show the day it launches.

160
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:44,160
But maybe finding time to listen to it at a later period or searching for the topic or the guest name and it comes up in their feed as well.

161
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,720
And it's very organic, my show.

162
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,320
So I've had up to three million downloads, I think just over three million this week.

163
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
It's all organic.

164
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,400
So what I mean by that is I don't charge my guests to come on the show.

165
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,520
They don't pay me to be on the show.

166
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,880
And I haven't taken out Facebook ads or LinkedIn ads or any of those things.

167
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:13,760
This is just purely through doing it in many ways, the hard way, but the way in which I think was a good sort of investment of my time

168
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,520
and limited money when I when I started and the show has kind of gone from strength to strength in that regard.

169
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:27,280
OK, this is the bit where I want you to grab your pen and paper, your laptops or your notes on your phone, whatever it would be.

170
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:38,840
And if you are thinking about doing a podcast or you have started one and you just want to really, I guess, spend this this mindful time we have together today actually focusing on how that could be better.

171
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,560
These are the things I would want you to answer for yourself.

172
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,920
And you don't have to put them in the chat, although you can, if you want to.

173
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,120
What is a topic you could talk about for at least a year?

174
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,680
So my show, I record 44 episodes a year and I have an eight week break over the Australian summer.

175
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,440
So I need enough topics and ideas to sustain that.

176
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,600
Now, people often change their podcast show.

177
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,560
They might do it for a year.

178
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:11,040
Then they have a different podcast or multiple podcasts, if that's kind of the thing they want to be doing.

179
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,560
But for me and my show, that's partly why I didn't do a communications and PR show.

180
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,120
Because I probably can think of 20 episodes and then it's going to get really boring and repetitive.

181
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,600
So thinking about what could I talk about once a week for a year?

182
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,200
If you just want to do one year and see what it's like, that's fine.

183
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
But you do need some longevity in your podcast.

184
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,320
It's kind of like posting on social.

185
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,680
You can't just do five episodes and think that's going to be enough.

186
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,000
What is your unique selling proposition and does your show title reflect that?

187
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,240
So I feel a little bit lucky in some ways that I got into podcasting quite early

188
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,800
because there are so many shows now and I have a catalogue of content.

189
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,640
But if you have a show title, making sure that you sound a little bit different

190
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,080
or very specific to what you want to talk about.

191
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,960
It can be cheeky, it can be quirky, whatever.

192
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,520
But I always encourage you to be relatively short and brief.

193
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,000
It's kind of like a headline.

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,160
And then obviously your guests and so forth will define some of that content.

195
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,880
So have a think about that.

196
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,760
And who is your audience?

197
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,880
Who do you want to speak to?

198
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,680
Now, I have a podcast information pack, I send all my guests and I.

199
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,880
My audience has kind of found me.

200
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,800
So I've probably done it the wrong way.

201
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,240
But the way I thought of it was, well, I'm not doing this to create client base.

202
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,280
So I'm not talking to, you know, clients who necessarily want communications,

203
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,600
expertise and in a higher me in my day job.

204
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,240
But I very much thought, well, who do I want to speak to?

205
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,360
And I think it was kind of people like me.

206
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,880
But then I realized I actually want to talk to people who were older,

207
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,640
who were younger, who were different parts of the world, who had different experiences.

208
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,960
So my audience has kind of evolved as my guest catalogue has evolved, if that makes sense.

209
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,720
So I would definitely say for the first two years in my show,

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,920
80 percent of my guests and the audience that listened to them were in Australia

211
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,800
because that's where the show is is done.

212
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,760
And that's where most of my guests came from.

213
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,080
As I've attracted or sought guests from around the world, obviously, that's grown.

214
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:19,440
So at the moment, I think about 35 percent of my audience is actually from the United States,

215
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,040
which kind of blows my mind a bit because a lot of the topics and the guests

216
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,360
that we speak to are still predominantly in this this part of the world.

217
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,960
But I do have a number of US guests I've had on the last year or so.

218
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,600
And I think it's great to have a global perspective and it keeps the show fresh

219
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,760
and interesting and relevant to more than people that just would be my everyday circle.

220
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,360
Also do a little bit of research of who your competitor shows.

221
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,160
And when I say competitor, I don't mean, well, you need to try and outrank them,

222
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,640
although I'm sure that would be one of your goals, but much more.

223
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,920
Who else is doing something similar?

224
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,600
So the inspiration for my show initially, despite the fact I had an idea,

225
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,240
the style of interview that I wanted to elicit, but in a much shorter form.

226
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,920
And not all people would necessarily know the show was an ABC radio in Sydney.

227
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,880
There's an interviewer called Richard Fidler, who does a show called Conversations with Richard Fidler.

228
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,240
It's it's very much, you know, a middle class, middle age show,

229
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,360
reflecting, I guess, my own demographic.

230
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,720
But in many ways, the style of interview is what I wanted to elicit.

231
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,440
So have a little bit of depth, have some consistency to some of the questions in the style.

232
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,840
And then obviously, other questions will be dependent on that guest's experience

233
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,000
or things that I think the audience want to hear about.

234
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,160
Maybe their top three tips on a particular topic or the biggest lesson

235
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,040
that they might have learned from perhaps a business failure,

236
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,240
if that's something that they've experienced.

237
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,120
So I listened to his show a lot.

238
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,640
I try to think about how I could inject my own style into that.

239
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,880
And there was another show in the US that used to have a similar format,

240
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,560
but on a TV show where it was called the Actors Studio.

241
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,640
It doesn't exist anymore.

242
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,760
And the host would get actors on famous actors to come in

243
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,400
and answer very detailed questions over an hour or so.

244
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,600
My show is a bit less than that's about 30 minutes

245
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,080
and then actually have some consistency in the question.

246
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,480
So that particular show, it would ask a question, which I don't ask in my show

247
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
to give you an example.

248
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,520
It would say, you know, if you if you were to pass away today

249
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,320
and you were to go to the pearly gates of heaven,

250
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,080
what would you what would you imagine God would say to you?

251
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,760
And I just thought that was so playful and fun and and deep,

252
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,600
but something that people in the audience would actually always want to hear

253
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,200
because you don't often hear that kind of thing.

254
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,760
So I think a little bit about when I say competitors,

255
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,280
maybe complimentary and competitor shows.

256
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,320
And I guess the style of interview you want to come across.

257
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,480
Are you trying to, I guess, be quirky and funny?

258
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,680
Are you trying to be deep?

259
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,920
Is it always going to be serious topics?

260
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,440
Or can you do things that are a little bit fun as well?

261
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,160
And having a think about who else you love listening to and why?

262
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,760
So do some research before you get started.

263
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,400
The other questions to ask yourself is,

264
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,720
are you going to be the only host on the show?

265
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,800
Or are you going to have alternative hosts?

266
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,000
And that frequency and consistency matters.

267
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,880
So I've always hosted my show myself.

268
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,600
I've never had a co-host.

269
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,960
I've had duo guests on the show because sometimes that's really important

270
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,320
because the type of business that they have, it means that they, you know,

271
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,000
they they're a duo and they work together.

272
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,120
And it's important to have both people on that program

273
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,920
and I guess alternate questions.

274
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,000
But deciding if you're going to do that, or are you going to rotate hosts?

275
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,400
So sometimes some of the clients that I work with,

276
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,800
they might actually have seasons where a particular people in their company

277
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,240
for example, if they're doing a business podcast will host the show

278
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,920
for that season and then they'll move on to somebody else.

279
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,200
But a little bit of frequency and consistency matters.

280
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,480
And what I mean by that is my show is always under 30 minutes.

281
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,000
The former journalist to me is very good at that.

282
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,120
I just know how to wrap it up and also guide the question

283
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,640
so that the depth of question is not so so much that, you know,

284
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,120
one answer is taking 10 minutes of the show,

285
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,000
but allowing you to the audience to know what to expect in the show.

286
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,120
And the other thing is really important just to think about

287
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
is that podcasts do not make you lots of money.

288
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,560
OK, it's like books.

289
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,360
If you produce a business book, it's like an expensive business card.

290
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,360
I know I've written a couple, but it gives you a platform.

291
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,680
So to give you a ballpark idea, each episode to produce,

292
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,280
and that includes all the tech bits that I need to have it happen,

293
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,080
is around one hundred and fifty US dollars a week.

294
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,680
And I have a 44 week show.

295
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,800
So you can do the maths up and after, you know, a period of time,

296
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,160
you might get sponsors and ways in which you can cut those costs down.

297
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,200
I don't edit my own show because I love content and I don't want to do that.

298
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,520
And I figure my time is spent better any money in my day job.

299
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,080
So that's not something I fiddle around with.

300
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,200
I have a team that do that for me.

301
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,280
But generally speaking, there are some things,

302
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,640
subscription things that you need to sign up for to actually host your platform

303
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,120
to record on, to be able to actually get it into iTunes, Spotify

304
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,600
and all the places that you need it to be.

305
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,720
But as I said, you can monetize them as as you go along,

306
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,440
but you can't monetize them in the beginning.

307
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,160
OK, so most, you know, organisations like Zencast is my sponsor,

308
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,680
who's who I use and I have used since the beginning of my show to record on

309
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,720
is now kind of expanded its offering.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,280
It it very much, you know, has a fixed subscription model,

311
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,200
which you have to subscribe to for a year.

312
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,640
So just just be aware there are a few set up costs regardless.

313
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,840
OK, have you all had a couple of minutes

314
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,200
to think about what some of these things are for you?

315
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,520
Does anyone want to chuck anything in the chat about maybe an idea that they've got

316
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,680
or, you know, something that they want to ask about how to get started?

317
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,520
No, just happy to hear. OK, great.

318
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,880
I'll keep going.

319
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,360
These are the tech bits. OK, so these are the basics.

320
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,040
This is the minimum stuff you are probably going to have to invest in

321
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,360
if you haven't already.

322
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,600
And these are ballpark figures.

323
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,120
So it's kind of like buying a new car.

324
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,360
You could buy the Toyota, you could buy the BMW.

325
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,920
So I would just start off with something pretty basic if and that's easy to use.

326
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,320
I'm not the most technical person.

327
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,480
And as I said, I love content, but I don't want to sit there editing

328
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,200
soundbites and putting my intros in every week.

329
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,040
It's not doesn't spark joy for me.

330
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,480
And it's not something I do.

331
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,800
But my microphone and headset combination, I think, was about four hundred dollars

332
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,280
at the time.

333
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,360
I've only had to replace the headset once.

334
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,760
So that's a pretty good investment.

335
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,200
And I use road just because they really are designed for newbies

336
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,400
and are very easy and compatible with all sorts of systems.

337
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,960
You can buy a bundle.

338
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,520
You can buy them individually.

339
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,840
You might have to buy them secondhand if you go to Gumtree or something like that.

340
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,160
A laptop, you need to record on something.

341
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,720
As I mentioned to you in the beginning, when I started podcasting,

342
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,280
it was so very opaque.

343
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,560
People would actually say to me, oh, you need to hire a studio

344
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,320
and you need to like have all the sound equipment and all the stuff

345
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,040
which obviously it's going to add to your expenses.

346
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,280
But it also reduces your flexibility because you then you wedded to one place

347
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,640
and you have to get guests to try and come in and and people still do that.

348
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,480
But that also limits, I guess, how and when you can actually podcast.

349
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,400
The other thing to invest in if you haven't already in the past couple of years

350
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,800
of work from home for most of us during the pandemic is a standing desk.

351
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,400
So I'm seated today to present this to you because I'm recording with video on

352
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,720
but a standing desk.

353
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,920
I would never record my podcast sitting down.

354
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,560
OK, so even though I haven't been a broadcast radio journalist,

355
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,520
if you looked at any radio studio today, you would have all the presenters standing

356
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,200
and there's some very good reasons for that.

357
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,880
It's very much about how you access light and shade in your voice.

358
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,800
It's about breathing.

359
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,160
It's about mindfulness, being very present in your body and not distracted

360
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,360
when we're seated, we're a little bit sedentary, obviously.

361
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,680
So being able to, you know, actually stand and feel in that moment is great.

362
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,400
But for me, it's just a bit of a habit and I've got used to doing it that way.

363
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,400
So I don't know if my guests are standing or seated

364
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,480
because I don't record them with video on.

365
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,160
But I very much find the standing desk helps me.

366
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,640
The other thing is just being able to test the sound in your room.

367
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
So if you're going to record, you know, we're all limited.

368
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,120
Some people might live in an apartment that has wooden floors, for example.

369
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,760
But you might actually have to, initially,

370
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,560
and I know guests that have had to do this because I've had flatmates

371
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,760
or they've had something else happening is actually sit in the cupboard

372
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,440
and actually record in there.

373
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,520
It's pretty uncomfortable. It's pretty hot.

374
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,920
But what you will get is great sound.

375
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,560
You will get fully directional sound

376
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,520
that will make sure that we're not getting, you know, the sound of the birds chirping

377
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,360
or, you know, your flatmate vacuuming or the doorbell ringing.

378
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,880
So that's kind of what I encourage people to make sure you sound as good.

379
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,120
And if you can see in this little setup here, what they've got on the walls

380
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,840
and I've seen people do this in their home studios is sound barriers.

381
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,320
So they're just literally foam, but curtains and rugs

382
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,680
and things like that can actually help as well.

383
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,400
You just don't want that as I showed you before with the clapping,

384
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,160
that alive sound and that some of the mistakes that I made in the beginning

385
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,520
when I wasn't so in control of my environment.

386
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,760
So just record yourself and see what it sounds like.

387
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,280
But of course, the headphones and the mic really, really help you.

388
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,280
The other question I often get from people is,

389
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
does it do you guess need to have all that stuff?

390
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,560
Well, I just give them some tips of how to sound great.

391
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,720
But at the end of the day, they can actually when they are recording,

392
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,880
you know, they can just use their normal earbuds that they would would use.

393
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,520
I'd never let them record just with the laptop mic.

394
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,880
My laptop mic is pretty echoey

395
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,520
and also means all that non directional sound will pick up as well.

396
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,800
So if you do have the guy next door suddenly designed to mow the lawns,

397
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,040
that's going to be just as loud as their voice.

398
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,600
So just try and encourage your guests to always have some earbuds

399
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,640
and, you know, be able to actually block out the other sounds as best as possible

400
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,600
because you want them to sound as good as you sound as well.

401
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,320
Any questions on that?

402
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,480
Great. OK, so here we get into the platform stuff.

403
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,080
So we all know, right, you could record your podcast tomorrow on Zoom.

404
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,600
I've never done that, as I said, I use Encaster,

405
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,920
but you could technically speaking.

406
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,080
But what you really need to do is find a way to get that to then be edited

407
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,800
and then get into what we call the RSS feed.

408
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,520
Now, this is a little graphic of the RSS feed.

409
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,880
So that's the RSS feed. There you are. You've recorded.

410
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,920
That's great. You've got your RSS feed.

411
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,400
So you kind of have to get that set up.

412
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,280
I use something called Libsyn, which is probably one of the early ways to do that.

413
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,240
There are probably others out there as well.

414
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,240
And it's kind of what we call your hosting platform.

415
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,720
So it's where your edited product, if you like, your finished podcast

416
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,520
with its intro, its outro, its level has been checked, all bits and pieces

417
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,880
goes and lives forever.

418
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,560
So I can go back and have a look on Libsyn, for example, statistically,

419
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,080
you know, what's been my most downloaded episode?

420
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,640
What's been my longest episode?

421
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,520
Which weeks did that episode peak historically over the last five years?

422
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,000
But then what Libsyn also does is it says, you know, hey, there's podcasts here.

423
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
These are all the details.

424
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,440
And I get it out there to all of these platforms, Apple podcasts,

425
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,120
you know, Spotify, Castro, Breaker, Google Podcast, whatever it might be.

426
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,600
And it does that for you.

427
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,080
You need somebody to host it.

428
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,440
It can't live on your computer because that is just yours.

429
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,600
This is kind of like taking it, you know, down to Grand Central Station

430
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,400
in New York and actually blasting it everywhere.

431
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,040
So that allows those other platforms to actually pick up on that.

432
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
I've just done a screenshot there.

433
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,440
That's on iTunes, kind of what my podcast will look like.

434
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,680
It'll have the guests kind of title episode and then how long it was.

435
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,280
And it just it just feeds it every week.

436
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,000
And I kind of don't even have to think about it.

437
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,400
It's it's semi magic.

438
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,120
But Libsyn subscriptions, I think mine's about 20 US dollars a month.

439
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,880
And it's all based on storage levels like a lot of those programs are.

440
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,520
So if you're going to record a show every day, you'll belt through your storage.

441
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,280
So you might need a more expensive package

442
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,040
because I only do one show once a week.

443
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,080
That's half an hour over a year.

444
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,720
It's not not as much storage to actually host that show over time.

445
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,880
So there's just some ideas of how that that actually might work.

446
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,200
As I mentioned, there probably are others out there.

447
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,440
I'm a little bit of a it works for me.

448
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,760
And it's it's the right price and my team know how to use it.

449
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,240
So I just kind of have stuck with Libsyn from the beginning.

450
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,760
And they're the ones I think that most platforms will interact with as well.

451
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,960
So you just need to check out, you know, for example,

452
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,320
can I get this on Spotify and iTunes and everywhere else

453
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,240
that this needs to be downloaded from?

454
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,840
So there's some pricing.

455
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,880
But I think I use the twenty dollar one, which is the most popular

456
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,720
because I just like the flexibility of additional storage.

457
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
And also, I don't like to delete any episodes.

458
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,360
I want to make sure that the catalog can't kind of live there

459
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,760
for as long as it needs to as well.

460
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,960
So that's Libsyn for you.

461
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
Have a look at that.

462
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,640
So some of my hacks, which I, as I mentioned to you,

463
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,520
I made all the rookie mistakes of terrible sound.

464
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,280
How am I going to find guests?

465
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,680
Will people say yes to a show where, you know, I literally have an audience

466
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,200
of 10 or maybe an audience of one some weeks.

467
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,360
But very much when I started, I kind of knew from my broadcast

468
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,480
journalism days that if something's not breaking news, which my story,

469
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,600
my podcast isn't, I'm not doing a daily show about what's happening

470
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,280
in the world of politics in Australia today.

471
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,640
That would have to be recorded, you know, every day at a certain time.

472
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,480
But I batch my shows.

473
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,000
So I can tell you today, I have either scheduled or finished

474
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,680
every single episode of my podcast for the rest of the year.

475
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,560
And it's the second of September.

476
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,920
So I never without a show every week.

477
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,240
And that is because things happen.

478
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,280
People get the flu, they get covered, their planes are late, I get sick.
