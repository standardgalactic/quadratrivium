WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.520
I'm just going to share my screen as well.

00:06.520 --> 00:07.520
Excellent.

00:07.520 --> 00:11.480
Well, thank you so much for joining me today.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.080
My name is Amber Daines.

00:13.080 --> 00:18.000
If you haven't heard of me on the podcast waves before or worked with me, I've got a

00:18.000 --> 00:20.320
few clients here today.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.320
My podcast actually launched just over five years ago.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.920
It's called The Politics of Everything.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.720
And despite its title, it's actually not about politics.

00:28.720 --> 00:34.920
If you look at the true definition of politics, that is, in fact, the nuances and the things

00:34.920 --> 00:37.560
that make it work in society.

00:37.560 --> 00:43.640
So I've been a journalist, so I understood, I guess, how to have a catchy title.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.120
Some people, the hardest thing is thinking, I've got an idea.

00:46.120 --> 00:49.360
I'd like to have a podcast, but how do I how do I have the name?

00:49.360 --> 00:53.640
So I kind of got the name very early, but then didn't know how to do any of it.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.960
So my podcast is about five and a bit years old.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.560
I have had a couple of breaks from it as well.

01:00.560 --> 01:04.640
And we'll talk about how you manage that around your other commitments as well.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.760
But it's actually a passion project.

01:06.760 --> 01:08.240
I love it.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.040
I don't really make lots of money out of it.

01:10.040 --> 01:15.120
I have a small sponsor that covers costs, but certainly it's something I love to do.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.560
So if you don't love doing podcasting like anything, it will become a chore.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.240
That's how I felt about my blog.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.320
So I stopped blogging and started podcasting.

01:25.320 --> 01:29.360
Just an quick acknowledgement of country for anyone that is in Australia today.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.560
You'll understand what this is.

01:30.560 --> 01:34.880
We do have some overseas audience members with us today as well.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.680
But I just like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land

01:37.680 --> 01:44.280
in which I'm running this webinar today and pay my respects to elders past, present and emerging.

01:46.640 --> 01:52.520
OK, what we are going to cover in our time today, and we obviously have a limited amount of time together.

01:52.520 --> 01:57.360
And I want to get to some of your questions is, I guess, the technical basics for a lot of people.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.720
This is the biggest, I guess, roadblock or barrier for you to actually kick off your podcast.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.320
What do you need to do?

02:04.320 --> 02:11.160
And the reality is when I started my podcast in 2017, it was a very opaque process.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.160
There wasn't a million platforms.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.520
Zoom barely existed.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.480
So we didn't think about using that.

02:16.480 --> 02:22.160
Maybe people were talking about podcasting on Skype and working out how that might all go together.

02:22.240 --> 02:28.160
The editing process was either having to hire a studio and getting somebody else to kind of edit it for you

02:28.160 --> 02:35.680
or perhaps having to buy some equipment, if you like, literally some equipment to actually edit your podcast.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.040
So it sounded OK.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.680
And of course, buying all the bits and pieces.

02:38.680 --> 02:43.440
I've got my podcasting earphones on today and I also have a road microphone,

02:43.440 --> 02:48.240
which I've had for the entire time just because it's so simple, it's plug and play.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.240
So we'll go through some of the technical stuff, including your room set up.

02:51.240 --> 02:54.840
So you certainly don't want to be sitting in a concrete bunker doing a podcast.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.960
Sound is everything when it comes to this particular medium.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.640
The second thing we're going to have a little think about.

02:59.640 --> 03:03.800
And if you don't have your laptop with you or you prefer pen and paper,

03:03.800 --> 03:09.960
maybe just pull that together, a bit of a heads up that we're going to get you to start to think about your actual podcast idea,

03:09.960 --> 03:18.760
if that's where you're at, how to plan your podcast niche, if you like, why you're doing a podcast and I guess your goals for the podcast.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.880
So we only do what we measure.

03:20.880 --> 03:27.960
So if you have a goal of what you'd like to do, it might even be the deadline to start and record your first episode by the end of the year.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.520
Actually, having that written down by the end of this session will help you get started.

03:31.520 --> 03:38.720
And then I guess the final bit is the bits that I guess I've learned the hard way when I've made all the rookie errors that you possibly can,

03:38.720 --> 03:46.440
including not pressing record when you have a guest on the line and having to ask them to come back and record all those bits and pieces.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.280
But also a bit of a VIP offer for you today.

03:49.280 --> 03:55.080
If you do want to work with me, I'm going to be launching a new online course, which gives you kind of all the templates and the details.

03:55.080 --> 04:02.080
So this is very much the what and then the how would be something which we could talk about after this particular session today.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.840
So hopefully that meets your expectations.

04:04.840 --> 04:09.960
And if you've got any questions, as I mentioned, we can cover those in the chat box.

04:09.960 --> 04:16.040
Otherwise, we might do some questions at the end where you can unmute yourself and ask me.

04:16.040 --> 04:19.000
OK, this was my first podcast image.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.920
I've evolved it since then, but the graphics are very much the same.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.400
It's called the Politics of Everything, as I mentioned.

04:25.400 --> 04:30.840
I have had a career in journalism, so I probably have a slight content advantage

04:30.840 --> 04:35.800
when it comes to understanding how to interview people because I interview guests on my show.

04:35.800 --> 04:42.920
I am the solo host, but I have guests from all walks of life, all ages and stages and all industries.

04:42.960 --> 04:47.200
And that was really important to me because I wanted to be really enjoy the conversations I was having.

04:47.200 --> 04:52.640
So I wanted to be able to curate, I guess, guests and topics, which I thought other people wanted to hear about,

04:52.640 --> 04:56.720
but also that I would enjoy actually speaking to people about.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.120
I spent a number of years in journalism about a decade.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.480
I started off my career in Australia in newspapers when those existed.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.800
There's not so many of those around today.

05:04.800 --> 05:09.360
But then I worked in Hong Kong and London as a correspondent in the business space.

05:09.480 --> 05:15.640
I've also had a brief career in TV journalism and have never actually been a radio journalist.

05:15.640 --> 05:20.360
So even though I understood journalism, I wasn't a broadcast radio journalist.

05:20.360 --> 05:24.640
So that's why the tech stuff for me was probably my biggest barrier to getting started,

05:24.640 --> 05:26.800
even though I had an idea for a show.

05:26.800 --> 05:30.200
I now run a couple of agencies in PR and communications,

05:30.200 --> 05:35.400
anything from ASX listed companies through to small startups and entrepreneurs.

05:35.400 --> 05:40.040
I helped them with reputation or management, crisis comms and media training work.

05:40.040 --> 05:46.040
So my podcast was really just a seed of an idea, literally thought of just driving along in the car,

05:46.040 --> 05:47.640
listening to other podcasts.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.480
But I guess what it did for me reflected my areas of interest.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.000
And this is what I would encourage everyone to do.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.720
I could have done a podcast about PR and communications, but that would have bored me senseless.

05:59.720 --> 06:04.120
And I figured, you know what, I'm not doing this to purely attract clients.

06:04.120 --> 06:07.600
In fact, I rarely interview clients on my show.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.800
There's a little bit of a kind of decision I made that if you're great, what you do,

06:11.800 --> 06:12.600
I will have you on.

06:12.600 --> 06:16.480
But it's certainly not something that I offer to my clients that I do PR work for.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.760
But I really love business.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.520
I love economics.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.960
I love modern society and I love people.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.480
So putting all of that together really made my show sing.

06:25.480 --> 06:29.280
So one of the things you need to think about is what do you love to talk about

06:29.280 --> 06:31.080
or do you like to find out about?

06:31.080 --> 06:35.000
Because at the end of the day, your podcast is not about you.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.080
It's very much about your audience and finding an audience.

06:38.080 --> 06:42.560
So making sure what you've got to share and what questions you're asking people,

06:42.560 --> 06:47.360
illicit answers that other people are going to get something from is really, really important.

06:47.360 --> 06:52.920
It's important not to just have it as opinion, but very much as a conversation where possible.

06:52.920 --> 06:56.040
If you want to kind of keep going with a particular podcast idea.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.160
This is my show now.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.200
So I sort of I took an 18 month break.

07:02.200 --> 07:07.320
I was working full time in a in a government role and didn't have that flexibility to record

07:07.320 --> 07:10.360
because, of course, you've got to find time to actually record.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.040
And all my recording is done remotely.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.520
I don't go into a studio.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.480
My guests could be anywhere from Sydney, me, where I live, to New York,

07:17.480 --> 07:20.640
to I've had guests in Germany, Israel, all around the world.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.080
So that means different time zones.

07:22.080 --> 07:25.440
So you do need flexibility if you want to have a global show.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.760
But the idea being that if you do have that time commitment,

07:28.760 --> 07:33.560
you can actually produce a show in less than an hour a week if you are very organized

07:33.560 --> 07:37.240
and you know exactly what you're doing, which is what I'm here to help you to do today.

07:37.240 --> 07:44.440
So I launched in May 2017 and I went IRL as the kids say in real life to visit my guests.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.760
Because back then, I guess we didn't really do all that Zoom stuff.

07:48.760 --> 07:53.160
It was all a bit nerve wracking for the guests as well to go, what do I need?

07:53.160 --> 07:54.440
Do I need your phones?

07:54.440 --> 07:58.600
How do I am I going to sound making sure that they didn't have to worry about that?

07:58.600 --> 08:05.480
So I would actually schlep around to guest offices or before work or wherever they wanted to meet me

08:05.480 --> 08:09.640
and actually go in there and record on my laptop with Zencaster,

08:09.640 --> 08:11.520
which is the program I've used since the beginning.

08:11.520 --> 08:16.080
And it's come a long way and we'll have a little chat about that when we get to the technical stuff.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.400
But the sound quality was awful.

08:18.400 --> 08:23.200
I'm going to tell you if you listen to my first episode, episode one May 2017,

08:23.200 --> 08:25.080
I do sound like I'm in a concrete bunker.

08:25.080 --> 08:32.320
And that's because the office that we recorded in where my guest worked was a very echoey, cool warehouse environment.

08:32.320 --> 08:37.440
But it had that sort of reverberating sound and in journalism, we call that live sound.

08:37.440 --> 08:42.720
So if you clap your hands and you can hear echoing, that means it's not the right room to do that in.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.800
But I couldn't control the environment.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.200
And so I just went with it.

08:46.200 --> 08:51.040
But I'm very much aware that that my early episodes do not sound as good as my ones do now.

08:51.040 --> 08:55.560
The other mistake I made was not having my sound quality volume at the right level.

08:55.560 --> 09:01.760
So in my earphones, it sounded fine, but then it was either too soft or too loud.

09:01.760 --> 09:05.040
And that's when you get kind of variations between you and your guests.

09:05.040 --> 09:10.880
So I might be really loudly asking the questions and then they are kind of really softly speaking.

09:10.880 --> 09:19.640
Now, my audio team could fix that to an extent, but it's much better to have fantastic, you know, sound from the beginning.

09:19.640 --> 09:24.800
You know, you can get your editor to do what you like, but they can only make it sound so good.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.800
And I had very few downloads.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.920
So I knew this would be a little bit of a long process that I also really didn't know what I was in for.

09:31.920 --> 09:36.360
So I think I had an average of 10 downloads, which is a little bit disheartening.

09:36.360 --> 09:43.720
And over time, of course, with my guest sharing the show with, you know, obviously getting good ratings on iTunes and things like that.

09:43.720 --> 09:48.560
I have between 10,000, 25,000 downloads per episode.

09:48.600 --> 09:52.640
It interestingly depends on not only the guest, but the topic.

09:52.640 --> 09:56.920
So people often ask me, you know, do you have someone famous?

09:56.920 --> 09:58.360
Is that the biggest downloads?

09:58.360 --> 09:59.400
Often it's not.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.080
Often it's just the topic.

10:01.080 --> 10:05.000
So something like cryptocurrency, if it's really topical, might attract a lot of listeners,

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
even if that person is not the most famous person in that space.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.560
So I think it just depends where we are at the time when we're listening to the show.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.840
And I get a lot of historical listens as well.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.320
So that week, I might get 10,000 downloads.

10:19.320 --> 10:26.520
But then if I look back at the the recording a month or two later, there's people who've gone back and listened to episodes.

10:26.520 --> 10:36.040
So even though I released them once a week on a Wednesday, I actually know that people aren't, you know, necessarily binge listening to my show the day it launches.

10:36.040 --> 10:44.160
But maybe finding time to listen to it at a later period or searching for the topic or the guest name and it comes up in their feed as well.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.720
And it's very organic, my show.

10:45.720 --> 10:51.320
So I've had up to three million downloads, I think just over three million this week.

10:51.320 --> 10:52.320
It's all organic.

10:52.320 --> 10:58.400
So what I mean by that is I don't charge my guests to come on the show.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.520
They don't pay me to be on the show.

11:00.520 --> 11:05.880
And I haven't taken out Facebook ads or LinkedIn ads or any of those things.

11:05.880 --> 11:13.760
This is just purely through doing it in many ways, the hard way, but the way in which I think was a good sort of investment of my time

11:13.760 --> 11:20.520
and limited money when I when I started and the show has kind of gone from strength to strength in that regard.

11:20.520 --> 11:27.280
OK, this is the bit where I want you to grab your pen and paper, your laptops or your notes on your phone, whatever it would be.

11:27.280 --> 11:38.840
And if you are thinking about doing a podcast or you have started one and you just want to really, I guess, spend this this mindful time we have together today actually focusing on how that could be better.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.560
These are the things I would want you to answer for yourself.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.920
And you don't have to put them in the chat, although you can, if you want to.

11:45.920 --> 11:50.120
What is a topic you could talk about for at least a year?

11:50.120 --> 11:56.680
So my show, I record 44 episodes a year and I have an eight week break over the Australian summer.

11:56.680 --> 12:01.440
So I need enough topics and ideas to sustain that.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.600
Now, people often change their podcast show.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.560
They might do it for a year.

12:05.560 --> 12:11.040
Then they have a different podcast or multiple podcasts, if that's kind of the thing they want to be doing.

12:11.040 --> 12:15.560
But for me and my show, that's partly why I didn't do a communications and PR show.

12:15.560 --> 12:20.120
Because I probably can think of 20 episodes and then it's going to get really boring and repetitive.

12:20.120 --> 12:24.600
So thinking about what could I talk about once a week for a year?

12:24.600 --> 12:27.200
If you just want to do one year and see what it's like, that's fine.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.360
But you do need some longevity in your podcast.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.320
It's kind of like posting on social.

12:31.320 --> 12:34.680
You can't just do five episodes and think that's going to be enough.

12:34.680 --> 12:39.000
What is your unique selling proposition and does your show title reflect that?

12:39.000 --> 12:44.240
So I feel a little bit lucky in some ways that I got into podcasting quite early

12:44.240 --> 12:48.800
because there are so many shows now and I have a catalogue of content.

12:48.800 --> 12:53.640
But if you have a show title, making sure that you sound a little bit different

12:53.640 --> 12:57.080
or very specific to what you want to talk about.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.960
It can be cheeky, it can be quirky, whatever.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.520
But I always encourage you to be relatively short and brief.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.000
It's kind of like a headline.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.160
And then obviously your guests and so forth will define some of that content.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.880
So have a think about that.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.760
And who is your audience?

13:11.760 --> 13:13.880
Who do you want to speak to?

13:13.880 --> 13:17.680
Now, I have a podcast information pack, I send all my guests and I.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.880
My audience has kind of found me.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.800
So I've probably done it the wrong way.

13:21.800 --> 13:27.240
But the way I thought of it was, well, I'm not doing this to create client base.

13:27.240 --> 13:32.280
So I'm not talking to, you know, clients who necessarily want communications,

13:32.280 --> 13:35.600
expertise and in a higher me in my day job.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.240
But I very much thought, well, who do I want to speak to?

13:38.240 --> 13:40.360
And I think it was kind of people like me.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.880
But then I realized I actually want to talk to people who were older,

13:43.880 --> 13:47.640
who were younger, who were different parts of the world, who had different experiences.

13:47.640 --> 13:53.960
So my audience has kind of evolved as my guest catalogue has evolved, if that makes sense.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.720
So I would definitely say for the first two years in my show,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.920
80 percent of my guests and the audience that listened to them were in Australia

14:02.920 --> 14:05.800
because that's where the show is is done.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.760
And that's where most of my guests came from.

14:07.760 --> 14:13.080
As I've attracted or sought guests from around the world, obviously, that's grown.

14:13.080 --> 14:19.440
So at the moment, I think about 35 percent of my audience is actually from the United States,

14:19.440 --> 14:23.040
which kind of blows my mind a bit because a lot of the topics and the guests

14:23.040 --> 14:26.360
that we speak to are still predominantly in this this part of the world.

14:26.360 --> 14:30.960
But I do have a number of US guests I've had on the last year or so.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.600
And I think it's great to have a global perspective and it keeps the show fresh

14:34.600 --> 14:39.760
and interesting and relevant to more than people that just would be my everyday circle.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.360
Also do a little bit of research of who your competitor shows.

14:43.360 --> 14:47.160
And when I say competitor, I don't mean, well, you need to try and outrank them,

14:47.160 --> 14:50.640
although I'm sure that would be one of your goals, but much more.

14:51.520 --> 14:52.920
Who else is doing something similar?

14:52.920 --> 14:58.600
So the inspiration for my show initially, despite the fact I had an idea,

14:58.840 --> 15:03.240
the style of interview that I wanted to elicit, but in a much shorter form.

15:03.240 --> 15:08.920
And not all people would necessarily know the show was an ABC radio in Sydney.

15:09.520 --> 15:13.880
There's an interviewer called Richard Fidler, who does a show called Conversations with Richard Fidler.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.240
It's it's very much, you know, a middle class, middle age show,

15:18.240 --> 15:20.360
reflecting, I guess, my own demographic.

15:20.360 --> 15:24.720
But in many ways, the style of interview is what I wanted to elicit.

15:24.760 --> 15:30.440
So have a little bit of depth, have some consistency to some of the questions in the style.

15:30.440 --> 15:34.840
And then obviously, other questions will be dependent on that guest's experience

15:34.840 --> 15:37.000
or things that I think the audience want to hear about.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.160
Maybe their top three tips on a particular topic or the biggest lesson

15:41.160 --> 15:44.040
that they might have learned from perhaps a business failure,

15:44.040 --> 15:46.240
if that's something that they've experienced.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.120
So I listened to his show a lot.

15:48.120 --> 15:51.640
I try to think about how I could inject my own style into that.

15:52.280 --> 15:57.880
And there was another show in the US that used to have a similar format,

15:57.880 --> 16:01.560
but on a TV show where it was called the Actors Studio.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.640
It doesn't exist anymore.

16:02.640 --> 16:07.760
And the host would get actors on famous actors to come in

16:07.760 --> 16:10.400
and answer very detailed questions over an hour or so.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.600
My show is a bit less than that's about 30 minutes

16:12.600 --> 16:16.080
and then actually have some consistency in the question.

16:16.080 --> 16:20.480
So that particular show, it would ask a question, which I don't ask in my show

16:20.480 --> 16:21.480
to give you an example.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.520
It would say, you know, if you if you were to pass away today

16:24.520 --> 16:26.320
and you were to go to the pearly gates of heaven,

16:26.320 --> 16:29.080
what would you what would you imagine God would say to you?

16:29.080 --> 16:32.760
And I just thought that was so playful and fun and and deep,

16:32.760 --> 16:36.600
but something that people in the audience would actually always want to hear

16:36.600 --> 16:38.200
because you don't often hear that kind of thing.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.760
So I think a little bit about when I say competitors,

16:40.760 --> 16:43.280
maybe complimentary and competitor shows.

16:43.280 --> 16:46.320
And I guess the style of interview you want to come across.

16:46.320 --> 16:50.480
Are you trying to, I guess, be quirky and funny?

16:50.480 --> 16:52.680
Are you trying to be deep?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.920
Is it always going to be serious topics?

16:54.920 --> 16:57.440
Or can you do things that are a little bit fun as well?

16:58.040 --> 17:01.160
And having a think about who else you love listening to and why?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.760
So do some research before you get started.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.400
The other questions to ask yourself is,

17:05.400 --> 17:07.720
are you going to be the only host on the show?

17:08.160 --> 17:10.800
Or are you going to have alternative hosts?

17:10.800 --> 17:14.000
And that frequency and consistency matters.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.880
So I've always hosted my show myself.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.600
I've never had a co-host.

17:18.600 --> 17:22.960
I've had duo guests on the show because sometimes that's really important

17:22.960 --> 17:27.320
because the type of business that they have, it means that they, you know,

17:27.320 --> 17:29.000
they they're a duo and they work together.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.120
And it's important to have both people on that program

17:31.120 --> 17:32.920
and I guess alternate questions.

17:32.920 --> 17:36.000
But deciding if you're going to do that, or are you going to rotate hosts?

17:36.000 --> 17:39.400
So sometimes some of the clients that I work with,

17:39.400 --> 17:43.800
they might actually have seasons where a particular people in their company

17:43.800 --> 17:47.240
for example, if they're doing a business podcast will host the show

17:47.240 --> 17:49.920
for that season and then they'll move on to somebody else.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.200
But a little bit of frequency and consistency matters.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.480
And what I mean by that is my show is always under 30 minutes.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.000
The former journalist to me is very good at that.

17:58.520 --> 18:02.120
I just know how to wrap it up and also guide the question

18:02.120 --> 18:05.640
so that the depth of question is not so so much that, you know,

18:05.640 --> 18:08.120
one answer is taking 10 minutes of the show,

18:08.480 --> 18:12.000
but allowing you to the audience to know what to expect in the show.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.120
And the other thing is really important just to think about

18:15.120 --> 18:17.120
is that podcasts do not make you lots of money.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.560
OK, it's like books.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.360
If you produce a business book, it's like an expensive business card.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.360
I know I've written a couple, but it gives you a platform.

18:24.360 --> 18:28.680
So to give you a ballpark idea, each episode to produce,

18:28.680 --> 18:31.280
and that includes all the tech bits that I need to have it happen,

18:31.880 --> 18:34.080
is around one hundred and fifty US dollars a week.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.680
And I have a 44 week show.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.800
So you can do the maths up and after, you know, a period of time,

18:39.800 --> 18:43.160
you might get sponsors and ways in which you can cut those costs down.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.200
I don't edit my own show because I love content and I don't want to do that.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.520
And I figure my time is spent better any money in my day job.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.080
So that's not something I fiddle around with.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.200
I have a team that do that for me.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.280
But generally speaking, there are some things,

18:56.280 --> 19:00.640
subscription things that you need to sign up for to actually host your platform

19:01.280 --> 19:05.120
to record on, to be able to actually get it into iTunes, Spotify

19:05.120 --> 19:07.600
and all the places that you need it to be.

19:07.640 --> 19:10.720
But as I said, you can monetize them as as you go along,

19:10.880 --> 19:12.440
but you can't monetize them in the beginning.

19:12.440 --> 19:17.160
OK, so most, you know, organisations like Zencast is my sponsor,

19:17.160 --> 19:21.680
who's who I use and I have used since the beginning of my show to record on

19:21.680 --> 19:23.720
is now kind of expanded its offering.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.280
It it very much, you know, has a fixed subscription model,

19:28.280 --> 19:30.200
which you have to subscribe to for a year.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.640
So just just be aware there are a few set up costs regardless.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.840
OK, have you all had a couple of minutes

19:36.840 --> 19:40.200
to think about what some of these things are for you?

19:40.200 --> 19:45.520
Does anyone want to chuck anything in the chat about maybe an idea that they've got

19:45.520 --> 19:49.680
or, you know, something that they want to ask about how to get started?

19:54.160 --> 19:56.520
No, just happy to hear. OK, great.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.880
I'll keep going.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.360
These are the tech bits. OK, so these are the basics.

20:00.360 --> 20:04.040
This is the minimum stuff you are probably going to have to invest in

20:04.040 --> 20:05.360
if you haven't already.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.600
And these are ballpark figures.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.120
So it's kind of like buying a new car.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.360
You could buy the Toyota, you could buy the BMW.

20:11.360 --> 20:15.920
So I would just start off with something pretty basic if and that's easy to use.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.320
I'm not the most technical person.

20:17.320 --> 20:20.480
And as I said, I love content, but I don't want to sit there editing

20:21.080 --> 20:23.200
soundbites and putting my intros in every week.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.040
It's not doesn't spark joy for me.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.480
And it's not something I do.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.800
But my microphone and headset combination, I think, was about four hundred dollars

20:30.800 --> 20:32.280
at the time.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.360
I've only had to replace the headset once.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.760
So that's a pretty good investment.

20:35.760 --> 20:40.200
And I use road just because they really are designed for newbies

20:40.200 --> 20:43.400
and are very easy and compatible with all sorts of systems.

20:44.000 --> 20:44.960
You can buy a bundle.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.520
You can buy them individually.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.840
You might have to buy them secondhand if you go to Gumtree or something like that.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.160
A laptop, you need to record on something.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.720
As I mentioned to you in the beginning, when I started podcasting,

20:56.720 --> 20:58.280
it was so very opaque.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.560
People would actually say to me, oh, you need to hire a studio

21:00.560 --> 21:03.320
and you need to like have all the sound equipment and all the stuff

21:03.360 --> 21:06.040
which obviously it's going to add to your expenses.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.280
But it also reduces your flexibility because you then you wedded to one place

21:09.280 --> 21:12.640
and you have to get guests to try and come in and and people still do that.

21:12.640 --> 21:16.480
But that also limits, I guess, how and when you can actually podcast.

21:16.920 --> 21:20.400
The other thing to invest in if you haven't already in the past couple of years

21:20.400 --> 21:24.800
of work from home for most of us during the pandemic is a standing desk.

21:24.800 --> 21:29.400
So I'm seated today to present this to you because I'm recording with video on

21:29.400 --> 21:30.720
but a standing desk.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.920
I would never record my podcast sitting down.

21:34.520 --> 21:38.560
OK, so even though I haven't been a broadcast radio journalist,

21:38.560 --> 21:43.520
if you looked at any radio studio today, you would have all the presenters standing

21:44.240 --> 21:46.200
and there's some very good reasons for that.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.880
It's very much about how you access light and shade in your voice.

21:50.360 --> 21:51.800
It's about breathing.

21:51.800 --> 21:56.160
It's about mindfulness, being very present in your body and not distracted

21:56.160 --> 21:59.360
when we're seated, we're a little bit sedentary, obviously.

21:59.360 --> 22:04.680
So being able to, you know, actually stand and feel in that moment is great.

22:04.680 --> 22:08.400
But for me, it's just a bit of a habit and I've got used to doing it that way.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.400
So I don't know if my guests are standing or seated

22:11.400 --> 22:13.480
because I don't record them with video on.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.160
But I very much find the standing desk helps me.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.640
The other thing is just being able to test the sound in your room.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.000
So if you're going to record, you know, we're all limited.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.120
Some people might live in an apartment that has wooden floors, for example.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.760
But you might actually have to, initially,

22:30.760 --> 22:33.560
and I know guests that have had to do this because I've had flatmates

22:33.560 --> 22:36.760
or they've had something else happening is actually sit in the cupboard

22:36.920 --> 22:38.440
and actually record in there.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.520
It's pretty uncomfortable. It's pretty hot.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.920
But what you will get is great sound.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.560
You will get fully directional sound

22:45.560 --> 22:50.520
that will make sure that we're not getting, you know, the sound of the birds chirping

22:50.520 --> 22:54.360
or, you know, your flatmate vacuuming or the doorbell ringing.

22:54.360 --> 22:57.880
So that's kind of what I encourage people to make sure you sound as good.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.120
And if you can see in this little setup here, what they've got on the walls

23:01.520 --> 23:04.840
and I've seen people do this in their home studios is sound barriers.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.320
So they're just literally foam, but curtains and rugs

23:08.320 --> 23:10.680
and things like that can actually help as well.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.400
You just don't want that as I showed you before with the clapping,

23:14.400 --> 23:18.160
that alive sound and that some of the mistakes that I made in the beginning

23:18.160 --> 23:20.520
when I wasn't so in control of my environment.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.760
So just record yourself and see what it sounds like.

23:23.760 --> 23:27.280
But of course, the headphones and the mic really, really help you.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.280
The other question I often get from people is,

23:29.280 --> 23:31.280
does it do you guess need to have all that stuff?

23:31.280 --> 23:33.560
Well, I just give them some tips of how to sound great.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.720
But at the end of the day, they can actually when they are recording,

23:37.240 --> 23:39.880
you know, they can just use their normal earbuds that they would would use.

23:39.880 --> 23:44.520
I'd never let them record just with the laptop mic.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.880
My laptop mic is pretty echoey

23:46.880 --> 23:50.520
and also means all that non directional sound will pick up as well.

23:50.520 --> 23:53.800
So if you do have the guy next door suddenly designed to mow the lawns,

23:54.080 --> 23:56.040
that's going to be just as loud as their voice.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.600
So just try and encourage your guests to always have some earbuds

23:58.600 --> 24:02.640
and, you know, be able to actually block out the other sounds as best as possible

24:02.640 --> 24:05.600
because you want them to sound as good as you sound as well.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.320
Any questions on that?

24:11.080 --> 24:15.480
Great. OK, so here we get into the platform stuff.

24:16.080 --> 24:20.080
So we all know, right, you could record your podcast tomorrow on Zoom.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.600
I've never done that, as I said, I use Encaster,

24:23.600 --> 24:24.920
but you could technically speaking.

24:24.920 --> 24:29.080
But what you really need to do is find a way to get that to then be edited

24:29.080 --> 24:31.800
and then get into what we call the RSS feed.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.520
Now, this is a little graphic of the RSS feed.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.880
So that's the RSS feed. There you are. You've recorded.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.920
That's great. You've got your RSS feed.

24:40.920 --> 24:43.400
So you kind of have to get that set up.

24:43.400 --> 24:48.280
I use something called Libsyn, which is probably one of the early ways to do that.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.240
There are probably others out there as well.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.240
And it's kind of what we call your hosting platform.

24:53.240 --> 24:57.720
So it's where your edited product, if you like, your finished podcast

24:57.720 --> 25:02.520
with its intro, its outro, its level has been checked, all bits and pieces

25:02.840 --> 25:04.880
goes and lives forever.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.560
So I can go back and have a look on Libsyn, for example, statistically,

25:08.800 --> 25:11.080
you know, what's been my most downloaded episode?

25:11.080 --> 25:12.640
What's been my longest episode?

25:12.640 --> 25:17.520
Which weeks did that episode peak historically over the last five years?

25:17.760 --> 25:23.000
But then what Libsyn also does is it says, you know, hey, there's podcasts here.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.400
These are all the details.

25:24.400 --> 25:29.440
And I get it out there to all of these platforms, Apple podcasts,

25:29.440 --> 25:34.120
you know, Spotify, Castro, Breaker, Google Podcast, whatever it might be.

25:35.480 --> 25:36.600
And it does that for you.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.080
You need somebody to host it.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.440
It can't live on your computer because that is just yours.

25:41.920 --> 25:45.600
This is kind of like taking it, you know, down to Grand Central Station

25:45.680 --> 25:48.400
in New York and actually blasting it everywhere.

25:48.400 --> 25:52.040
So that allows those other platforms to actually pick up on that.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.600
I've just done a screenshot there.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.440
That's on iTunes, kind of what my podcast will look like.

25:56.440 --> 26:00.680
It'll have the guests kind of title episode and then how long it was.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.280
And it just it just feeds it every week.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.000
And I kind of don't even have to think about it.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.400
It's it's semi magic.

26:05.400 --> 26:11.120
But Libsyn subscriptions, I think mine's about 20 US dollars a month.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.880
And it's all based on storage levels like a lot of those programs are.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.520
So if you're going to record a show every day, you'll belt through your storage.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.280
So you might need a more expensive package

26:20.280 --> 26:22.040
because I only do one show once a week.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.080
That's half an hour over a year.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.720
It's not not as much storage to actually host that show over time.

26:29.360 --> 26:32.880
So there's just some ideas of how that that actually might work.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.200
As I mentioned, there probably are others out there.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.440
I'm a little bit of a it works for me.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.760
And it's it's the right price and my team know how to use it.

26:40.760 --> 26:43.240
So I just kind of have stuck with Libsyn from the beginning.

26:43.240 --> 26:47.760
And they're the ones I think that most platforms will interact with as well.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.960
So you just need to check out, you know, for example,

26:49.960 --> 26:52.320
can I get this on Spotify and iTunes and everywhere else

26:52.320 --> 26:54.240
that this needs to be downloaded from?

26:54.240 --> 26:55.840
So there's some pricing.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.880
But I think I use the twenty dollar one, which is the most popular

26:58.880 --> 27:01.720
because I just like the flexibility of additional storage.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.720
And also, I don't like to delete any episodes.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.360
I want to make sure that the catalog can't kind of live there

27:06.360 --> 27:08.760
for as long as it needs to as well.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.960
So that's Libsyn for you.

27:09.960 --> 27:10.960
Have a look at that.

27:13.280 --> 27:16.640
So some of my hacks, which I, as I mentioned to you,

27:16.640 --> 27:19.520
I made all the rookie mistakes of terrible sound.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.280
How am I going to find guests?

27:21.280 --> 27:24.680
Will people say yes to a show where, you know, I literally have an audience

27:24.680 --> 27:27.200
of 10 or maybe an audience of one some weeks.

27:27.880 --> 27:32.360
But very much when I started, I kind of knew from my broadcast

27:32.360 --> 27:36.480
journalism days that if something's not breaking news, which my story,

27:36.480 --> 27:40.600
my podcast isn't, I'm not doing a daily show about what's happening

27:40.600 --> 27:42.280
in the world of politics in Australia today.

27:42.280 --> 27:45.640
That would have to be recorded, you know, every day at a certain time.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.480
But I batch my shows.

27:47.480 --> 27:52.000
So I can tell you today, I have either scheduled or finished

27:52.000 --> 27:54.680
every single episode of my podcast for the rest of the year.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.560
And it's the second of September.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.920
So I never without a show every week.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.240
And that is because things happen.

28:01.240 --> 28:05.280
People get the flu, they get covered, their planes are late, I get sick.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.360
Something happens. My internet.
