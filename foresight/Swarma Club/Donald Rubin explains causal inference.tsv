32520	36960	Dear students and teachers from all over the world and from the community,
36960	38960	welcome to today's event.
38960	45360	We are very honored to have Donald Ruffin, one of the world's most influential scholar in statistics,
45360	54960	to be with us and to introduce the essential concepts for causal inference in randomized experiments and observational studies, a remarkable history.
54960	59960	First, let me briefly introduce Professor Donald Ruffin.
59960	71960	He is the John Litt Professor Emeritus of Statistics from Harvard University, where he has been professor since 1983 and also department chair for 13 years.
71960	83960	He also holds professorship at the Young Mathematical Sciences Center in Tsinghua University and Murray Schusterman Senior Research Fellow at Fox School of Business Temple University.
83960	91960	He is the winner of Wilkes Medal, Pausen Prize for Statistics Innovation, George W. Snedekor Award.

111960	115960	British Academy and the US National Academy of Sciences.
115960	124960	As of 2021, he has authored and co-authored over 400 publications, including 10 books, and has four joint patents.
124960	137960	And for many years, he has been one of the most highly cited scholars in the world, with currently over 35,000, 350,000 citations from Google Scholar.
137960	143960	And we're also very honored to have three discussant speakers with us.
143960	148960	They are Professor Zhou Xiaohua and Zhu Zhou from Peking University.
148960	163960	He's the PKIU Chair, Professor and the Chair of Department of Biostatistics in Peking University, and Xi Liang Zhao, Professor from the Wang Yan'an Institute for Studies in Economics and from Xia Men University.
163960	170960	And also Professor Tui Pong from Association Professor with tenure in Qinghai University.
170960	183960	Now without further ado, let us give a warm applause and welcome to Donald Ruby, and to have him introduce for us the causal inference.
183960	185960	Okay.
185960	191960	So these, these slides were created a few months ago.
191960	199960	I want to thank the organizers for inviting me.
199960	205960	And I'm very pleased to be able to give this introductory lecture.
205960	229960	Another comment that that's relevant today, but that is, is not relevant with was not relevant when I made up these slides is that within the last week, my co authors on on a causal paper, just got the share the Nobel Prize in economics.
230960	233960	And Guido in bends.
233960	240960	Just about a week ago, got a Nobel Prize in economics.
240960	249960	And I'm very happy for work that's completely consistent with this framework that I'm going to describe here.
249960	265960	And actually both of them gave me gave me phone calls the day that I got the Nobel Prize because it's an impressive event so in, in addition to being this interpretation of essential concepts and causal inference.
265960	283960	I think now it's pretty much become the standard approach, at least in economics and parts of medicine. So I think it's the talk is even more relevant than it would have been of even a few weeks ago.
283960	300960	The title is essential concepts for causal inference and randomized experiments and observational studies are remarkable history, and a couple comments about the title, what I mean by essential concepts is ones that you need, and you get rid of the clutter.
300960	322960	So for example, I'm often asked about the graphical approach to to to causal inference. And in many cases, other approaches than the one I'll be describing here can be useful for communicating ideas but they're not essential.
323960	338960	And the sense of essential here is like the mathematical sense of of essential. So if you leave out a condition in the theorem that makes the condition false without that condition, then that's essential.
338960	342960	And if you if you add stuff, that's not essential.
342960	359960	So for example, if you say you have a right triangle, and with two sides equals so it's an isosceles right triangle, and you say the twice is the square of the short sides equals the long side.
359960	373960	Well, that's true. But it has clutter in it because you're putting something in that you don't need because it's any, it's any right triangle for which that's that's true.
373960	388960	So, and why do I call it a remarkable history. Well, as the idea will be developed here, which you'll, which you'll see at least from my perspective, is the history of the formal history is very recent.
388960	404960	You can trace the intuitive idea of causal inference back for thousands of years, but the formal mathematical history is really, in my mind, remarkably recent, meaning it's a 20th century idea.
404960	423960	That's related in some ways to another set of remarkable ideas, having to do with quantum mechanics, basically the idea that you can define two things, each of which can be measurable, you can have to observe, but you can't observe them simultaneously.
423960	436960	And that's what I regard as one of the essential ideas of causal inference, as reflected in, especially in the, in the mathematics of the 20th century. Okay, next slide.
436960	445960	Well, a pro-leg to causal inference is my sort of exposure to what I regard as science.
445960	462960	As a kid, like many kids in high school, I was interested in math and physics, but far more physics than math. So when I went to college, I went to Princeton University, which I entered 1961.
462960	472960	And the first physics course I took with a relatively famous physicist named John Wheeler.
472960	482960	John Wheeler was a colleague of Albert Einstein's, and so they were in the physics department at the same time.
482960	502960	And he was also well known for his attributed to having made up the name Black Holes. And in fact, he denied that he was giving a lecture at one point in time as describing something that has so much mass, so much gravity, that even light cannot escape.
502960	516960	And somebody in the audience, this is an audience of about 200 people, shouted out, it's a black hole. And according to Wheeler, he tried to find the guy afterwards, but never could.
516960	523960	And so he, he started using the expression became attributed to him.
523960	530960	Another thing that Wheeler, he was a really kind person and outstanding teacher.
531960	540960	And his first problem that he assigned us in 1961 was how far can a wild goose fly.
540960	547960	And obviously he was not looking for a precise answer, but he wanted to know how you would try to solve it.
547960	562960	What are the principles that, that even when you're really in physics understand, what are the principles of conservation conservation of energy, momentum, these other basic concepts and so the energy was had to be conserved.
562960	571960	So how does, how does a wild goose say up in the air and fly. Well, what he's doing is he's converting energy.
572960	585960	That potential energy into kinetic energy to fight gravity pulling him down. So he wanted you to think about those those principles.
585960	596960	Another thing that Wheeler was known for is he was the PhD advisor of Richard Feynman, the famous US physicist Feynman.
597960	608960	But these were complicated years in 1961, especially for a male in the United States because there was a draft lottery.
608960	635960	In order to stay out of the draft, to avoid tromping through the mud, thousands of miles away, you had to stay in school. And so, at that time, if you were going to be in getting a PhD in physics, pretty much the job market looked like you even if you got a PhD, you had to had to be in nuclear physics.
635960	640960	And so, instead, I switched to psychology.
640960	654960	And I went when I went into psychology at Princeton, there was a gun, Sylvan Tompkins, who was a wonderful professor is also a character named Julian James.
655960	663960	In 1964, and became actually very good friends with especially later when I returned to live in Princeton.
663960	677960	And it was became very close friends and talked about lots of ideas. And one of his his critical ideas was consciousness. What makes human beings different from other animals.
677960	686960	He wrote a book that was published in the 1970s, called the origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind.
686960	692960	And this book actually advanced a thesis that consciousness was special to humans.
692960	707960	It's not possessed by animals, because they had two hemispheres, so all brains have have two hemispheres, but humans developed the art of communicating between the two hemispheres, which are really independent.
707960	715960	They're only connected with a gang of nerves at the base of the of the brain at the top of the spine for the corpus callosum.
715960	726960	And they, these two hemispheres communicated almost independently through language at the zap messages back and forth.
726960	739960	And so his, his version of consciousness was that people would, we had these two hemispheres talking to each other, almost as if they were.
739960	747960	And in fact that pre conscious people would hear these messages as messages of God's.
747960	762960	And this was very influential on my on my thinking and psychology became very interesting to me is all science everything we math mathematics even formal logic is obviously filtered through our brain.
762960	768960	So could you go back to the, yes, I'm not done with that yet.
769960	787960	So I went when I went to graduate school at Harvard, I started out in psychology, and then I realized that I really wasn't that serious about psychology, and I switched to computer science where I got a master's degree.
787960	808960	And then I actually eventually switched to department of statistics right from my eventual PhD, where my advisor was William Cochran, this wonderful Scottish statistician, very, very down to earth guy, who taught me experimental design in 1968.
808960	821960	But this was a was a great course, because it had formal experimental design how you learn about the world how you learn about what works and what doesn't work in terms of interventions.
821960	833960	And the other thing about Cochran's course that was I opening for me, it was completely consistent with the science that I learned when I was in physics.
833960	843960	And one thing about it is there was a clear separation between science, which is the object of inference, and what you do to learn about the science.
843960	855960	So what you do to learn about science is you intervene in the real world in some way to intervene to measure aspects of science of the world at one point in time.
855960	875960	To intervene you have to change something you have to either observe something which you throw photons at it, or something. So the, which you try to learn about is, is the object at a point in time at one instance, and you learn about it through what you observe at a, at a subsequent
875960	886960	instance. But the, the notation that you use to represent the science at the previous point in time is the same.
886960	893960	So the science notation for the science doesn't change as you try to learn about it, or measure it.
893960	902960	But the, but the fact of measurement changes the science from the earlier point in time to a later point in time.
902960	922960	And that way of thinking about it is, is missing data always exist. We cannot go back in time and undo what we did to, to measure the science. And this was completely consistent with, with two principles in, in, in physics, the well known
923960	933960	uncertainty principle, for example, which says you cannot measure position and momentum at the same point in time you have to take your choice they both exist.
933960	948960	But you can only measure one with this with certainty. And there's another principle that's sometimes confused which is the observer effect that the active observation actually changes the world has to do with time.
948960	954960	And the state of science at time to is different from the state of science prior to that.
954960	967960	And where's the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is has to do with with quantum mechanics and uncertainty of being able to measure both things at the same point in time.
967960	971960	Okay, next slide.
971960	983960	So, so my exposure to statistics when I entered Harvard again was to Cochran, and, and he was a protege of Ronald Fisher.
983960	999960	And Ronald Fisher had really revolutionized the field of statistics in fact started in some real sense, and in 1925 with his book statistical methods to research workers.
999960	1019960	And in the last chapter in that 1925 book, he proposed randomization. So if you're trying to learn about what an intervention does meaning is fertilizer one better than fertilizer to control fertilizer versus a new fertilizer, or for a variety of
1019960	1035960	seeds of a plant is a new variety better than the old variety, you actually should randomize turns out that the idea of randomization, mathematically, was in the air at the time.
1035960	1049960	If you read some old student gossip articles in the early 20s, you would say well if you had randomized, then the distribution would be this way.
1049960	1064960	This sort of was in the air at Rotham study at the Rotham study experimental station, where they were doing studies of different fertilizers and different breeding of plants and animals.
1065960	1085960	And the idea of actually randomizing this issue in thereby you created balance and all treat pre treatment variables in expectation. So the fact that it created balance was in these articles, in various expressions, but the Fisher said that I know that's what the mathematics
1085960	1096960	is, but I'm saying you should actually do that. You should actually toss coins to assign treatments, and no one had actually done that, but as far as I can find.
1096960	1100960	Before there's some debate about this.
1100960	1105960	But it will say a little about that in the subsequent slide.
1105960	1120960	Now there was recondite advice at the time that if you had unbalanced covariates, so an important pre treatment variable that was unbalanced between treatment group and a control group.
1121960	1136960	Fisher actually said he would re randomize. Now he didn't write that. And I can't find that advice anywhere. So you got a bad randomization, meaning for example, in the study of hypertensive drugs, where they have males and females.
1136960	1146960	If you if you did complete randomization, it's possible that all the males would get an active treatment, and all the females would get the control treatment.
1147960	1149960	Bad advice.
1149960	1164960	Bad randomization so the advice was from from what would Fisher wrote is live with the randomization, because that's what underlie all the mathematics like the f, f distributions and t distributions.
1164960	1170960	If you talked to Cochran about what Fisher actually would do, he would re randomize.
1170960	1179960	He would throw away the bad randomized allocation and look for a better one at the, at the time.
1179960	1195960	The theory was was was complicated because you didn't have the usual symmetry arguments working for you. They were actually led to truncated distributions, which you which for the, which the computation was back then impossible.
1195960	1208960	But the theory and application is now being pursued because the computing is much better than it was. That's being pursued in a series of articles I wrote with a former PhD students.
1208960	1217960	And it's being pursued in other words, I'm doing with other people.
1217960	1222960	And that's it's being pursued because the computations is, is possible.
1222960	1236960	Now, if you, if you did get an acceptable randomization you were living with it. How would you do the assessment of the was there a causal effect.
1236960	1250960	And in here he had this very deep idea that's related to Carol Poppers of the philosophers idea of science advances by rejecting myths.
1250960	1265960	So what, what, what, what Fisher did is he had this, this method of inference, where you hypothetically re randomized, you look at the data, put down a null hypothesis and hypothesis that that you don't that you want to prove is wrong.
1265960	1283960	And so in this re randomization was a stochastic proof by contradiction so it's not really a proof by contradiction, but you get a probability that you would observe data, which you did observe this extreme, if the null hypothesis were true.
1283960	1297960	I think it's a brilliant idea that that led to a sort of a deceptive version of it, because the name and Pearson ideas which are which I think are not nearly as sharp.
1297960	1316960	And I, and I think that this proof by contradiction, it can be embedded within a Bayesian framework. And I wrote about this in an annals of statistics paper 1984, where I call that a posterior predictive check or price, where the p value in
1316960	1330960	a check is a posterior predictive p value, or instead of having a sharp null hypothesis, what I mean by sharp, if there's no missing data anymore. So you can fill in all, all missing values.
1330960	1343960	And, but instead of having a sharp null hypothesis you can have a stochastic null hypothesis. So it becomes a Bayesian positive predictive p value.
1343960	1362960	Even though he was never formal about the, this idea of an alternative hypothesis, because he said, I have never, I have no problem in choosing a test statistic, just do it. He clearly understood this site, a non null causal effect, because in this 1918 paper, years
1363960	1377960	from the 1925 book, he has this direct quote, if we say this boy has grown tall, he has, because he has been well fed, we are not merely tracing out the cause and effect in the individual instance.
1377960	1388960	In this particular case, we're suggesting that he might have quite probably not very well written, might quite probably have been worse fed.
1388960	1399960	In that case, he would have been shorter. So he's comparing the boy's height, being well fed with his hypothetical height, had he been poorly fed.
1399960	1411960	So he clearly has this idea of, of the, of an alternative hypothesis here the alternative is being well poorly fed, because the, what's observed as being well fed.
1411960	1424960	But he never had any explicit notation, never any mathematical notation for formalizing non null causal effects, despite, I mean, it's very difficult to criticize.
1424960	1436960	Fisher's work with respect to distributions under this sharp null hypothesis, tremendous geometric insights based on symmetry arguments.
1436960	1449960	Fisher was was legally blind. And, and so according to Cochran, he would, he would, when he had a problem, he would, you know, sit down, close his eyes and think about things.
1449960	1465960	And we have these blasted insights, I guess that, that came into his mind. So where do we get the notation that that that was arose in the textbooks in the mid 20th century like, like in Kempthal next slide.
1465960	1478960	That's okay. I mean, these things happen with with with zoom, especially when the when participants are thousands of miles away.
1479960	1503960	So the notation that was used in in subsequent years to describe in mathematically the situation with about causal effects was actually due to Neyman Jersey Neyman in his 1923 master's thesis, where he defined written in in in Polish.
1503960	1527960	And this thesis was not translated to English until 1990, although because Neyman by before 1990 was at Berkeley, the notation had had a big influence because Berkeley was the outstanding department of statistics at the time Neyman was was there.
1527960	1537960	And so what he defined the estimates the quantities to be estimated in randomized experiments as functions of potential outcomes for N units.
1537960	1550960	In other words, why of zero is the array of potential outcomes under treatment zero, and why one is the array of potential outcomes under an active treatment, labeled here treatment one.
1550960	1575960	And Neyman at 23 was written in Polish, as I said, translated to English in 1990. And I, I made up the phrase potential outcomes, really to stay close to this 1923 paper, where at least the translation of into English of this, of this paper in 1990, called the potential yields, where the units of the
1575960	1591960	experiment were the N units were plots of land, and the outcomes there were yields of of of a particular variety of a of a plant under different fertilizers.
1591960	1600960	And so the treatments there would be the control fertilizer and treatment one for example would be the active fertilizer.
1600960	1612960	And Neyman actually use this notation, although later he denigrated he said I was I was just fooling around I really didn't know what I was doing.
1612960	1635960	And there are there are other examples of that in science we can see people using notation that they really didn't understand the full meaning of fact actually you can you can see that in some of the work on in relativity as well.
1635960	1651960	I don't want to get off onto that topic, although I could answer some questions about it. And so, namely put down this notation, and implicitly assuming something that I later called, so to stable unit treatment value assumption.
1651960	1670960	What this means is that if I give if I have a Y which is the outcome for plot I so I indexes the plots, and w indexes the different treatments. So that's a function of I and w. That's all that's that's it's a meaning it's a well defined function.
1670960	1673960	So you have that notation.
1673960	1690960	So all that the outcome for particular treatment on a particular plot. It's just a function of that plot, and of that treatment. It's not affected by the fertilizers that the other plots got. So for example,
1691960	1713960	excluded interference between units for example, if you're doing an agricultural experiment where rain would move one fertilizer on one plot to an adjacent plot. So the adjacent plots, not only were affected by the fertilizer they receive, but by fertilizers adjacent plots got.
1714960	1735960	And so agronomists knew this for hundreds of years, but, but this assumption wasn't really formalized until the combination of of naming and this explicit assumption that I made up and in the quote said for 1968.
1735960	1746960	So the point is that you cannot observe both of these on any one unit cannot observe both the outcome under under active treatment and the outcome under control treatment.
1746960	1758960	And so this idea was kind of natural to me, because I grew up with with Heisenberg that you that just existed, but the name and contribution went beyond this notation.
1758960	1766960	And he evaluated the operating characteristics of procedure procedures, such as estimators over the randomization distribution.
1766960	1785960	So he said, Okay, I observe this under the, what would be the expectation of the of a statistic, an estimator such as the observed outcomes, the observed potential outcomes under active treatment, minus the observed potential outcomes under control treatment.
1785960	1802960	So this is a statistic being a function of observed values. But now we'll see what I would have observed under all possible values, and I can derive pro operating characters for such as unbiasedness of this difference in observe sample needs.
1802960	1808960	Very important idea which eventually led to all the name and Pearson stuff.
1808960	1824960	He also worried about the role of non additive unit level causal effects, an additive unit level causal effect is the difference between why I have zero and why I have one is the same for all I.
1824960	1833960	So that would say that the new fertilizer is better than the old fertilizer by the same amount and all plots.
1833960	1851960	And name and word about that in 1923, because he he not only defined unbiasedness, but but he he eventually defined confident would later was called confidence intervals.
1851960	1866960	Now, in, in, in later years, he denied the lack of understanding in 1923, pointing out that the, that the definition of the potential outcomes was an important idea.
1866960	1885960	And he said, I really didn't understand the real depth of randomization, because they never advocated it is Fisher, who advocated randomization actually randomizing plots, not, not name it. Next slide please.
1885960	1908960	So once on these insights. Well, these are 20th century insights at least as, as, as far as, as, as I can see. I've looked a little bit I'm not a really in depth historian like Steve Stigler, my former colleague at the University of Chicago, but I think I can't find any, any corresponding insights in
1908960	1926960	these insights where you define an estimate quantities you want to estimate in terms of measurable quantities, which, but these are individually measure, but they cannot be simultaneously measured, measurable even theoretically.
1926960	1947960	So I really think these are really 20th century insights that were seem to be floating around Northern Europe at, at the time was was was Fisher really the, the, the, the first to have these well Steve Stigler likes to point to an American psychologist,
1948960	1971960	who's whose father was a mathematician at Harvard in the late 19th century, who was writing about unbiasedness from, from taking representative samples, very, very close but as far as I can see, there's no use of the idea of randomization as a base of inference the way,
1972960	1993960	the way Fisher did. But anyway, after Fisher proposed randomization in this last chapter of statistical methods for research workers, randomized trials quickly dominated agricultural and animal, animal breeding in the United Kingdom, and became even dominant in the United States in
1993960	1998960	industrial work, more applied work was was was done.
1998960	2002960	For example, by Oscar Kempthorne,
2002960	2013960	Bill Cochran and Gertrude Cox, George box wonder wonderful work by by by box in industrial experiments, David Cox
2013960	2015960	wrote a wonderful textbook.
2016960	2041960	I'm planning experiments and supporting more mathematical work and almost pure mathematical work was done in the Indian statistics Institute, which is founded by my Helen obis work was done there by RC bows, Nair, see a row who is still going strong in his 100th birthday he had his 100th birthday.
2041960	2049960	Are we 100 first I think a few weeks ago.
2049960	2070960	And subsequently randomized controlled trials entered Western industry they started doing industrial experiments and at the end of the Second World War, when the, the, the, the West, the allies had completely sort of destroyed.
2071960	2075960	Japan at the end of World War two.
2075960	2092960	We sent Edward Deming, the West and Edward Deming to help rebuild Japanese industry, and through the use of quality control in experiments and in randomized experiments.
2092960	2105960	It was a combination of randomized experiments, and especially with the idea of quality control. Japan has given a Deming medal for quality control since 1951.
2105960	2130960	But the insights that that were exposed in the in this work with randomized trials were really limited at this time to non conscious units plants, animals, or industrial object like widgets you know various mechanical things that we built or paints that
2130960	2142960	we used to do experiments on paints for painting the dividing lines in in in roads, for example. Next slide.
2142960	2157960	The transportation of these insights to randomize control trials with conscious units came before the transportation well before the transportation of these insights to non randomized studies.
2157960	2175960	And in medicine my understanding is the first randomized experiments were done in the United Kingdom in 1946, the Medical Research Center, and a guy named Sir Bradford Hill on Streptococcus,
2175960	2182960	where they have antibiotics study of antibiotics they actually did randomized experiment.
2183960	2197960	Early big randomized experiment with salt vaccine, whereas like thousands of people that was done in 1954, actually randomized experiment with conscious units, and they actually use blinding them.
2197960	2211960	The idea that you don't tell the patient, which you're, or the kid in this case, which vaccine you're getting the the active vaccine or placebo vaccine.
2212960	2223960	In the in the 50s and middle eight 50s of the United States Food and Drug Administration, it became almost wedded to the use of randomized experiments.
2223960	2240960	And so randomized experiments entered pharmacology. And before this before the 1950s and Paul Meyer was my colleague at the University of Chicago was the main instigator this he really sort of fell in love with with random device experiments.
2240960	2256960	But when I say falling in love. I think there was an over-resilience in adherence to the intention to treat principle to estimate the effect of the assignment to treatment, rather the effect of assignment and receipt of treatment, which I don't think was very wise.
2256960	2280960	But the idea intention to treat is you analyze the data, the way the units got assigned, not what they took. And I think this is a very relevant comment now, because I view the recent Nobel Prize in economics, which is given to like co authors, angriest and
2281960	2291960	David Carr, for actually implementing a study in the non randomized interesting inference in the non randomized study.
2291960	2304960	This the idea of non compliance because that conscious units have had a habit of not agreeing with what they were randomized to not agreeing to doing what they were randomized to do.
2305960	2312960	And the interesting thing is, but there's no use of these Fisher name and insights, or the notation and non randomized trials.
2312960	2321960	It wasn't used at all, I think, until I proposed using it in 1974 paper.
2321960	2332960	So for example if you look at the 1964 US Surgeon General support report on cigarette smoking and lung cancer, very important study.
2332960	2336960	Everything was done by regression.
2336960	2340960	In fact, ordinary least squares regression.
2341960	2356960	Nothing. No, no use of the insights from from randomized experiments in this giant observational studies. In fact, regression was used everywhere epidemiology economics, social science psychology sociology.
2356960	2366960	They all used regression with the potential outcomes replaced by the observed outcome with an indicator w i for each unit for which treatment they got.
2366960	2380960	So they would do a regression of the observed value is why I ops as the observed value for each unit on an indicator variable w i and covariance.
2380960	2390960	But this notation violates this this principle that I learned when I was a kid that you separate the science from what we do to learn about the science.
2390960	2404960	So this why obs notation would became completely prevalent for dealing with with non randomized data, starting actually in the at the end of the 19th century, we're doing regression.
2404960	2417960	There's an old paper by you on how you do this, using this observational notation and regression.
2417960	2421960	Next slide please.
2421960	2440960	Well, it turns out this sequence of papers came to be called the Ruben causal model to the name Paul Holland made up in his 1986 Journal of the Wilson of the jazz American statistical association paper, Ruben causal model, which I sort of the proposed this model
2441960	2456960	and wrote 1974. There's a follow up paper and proceedings and 75 paper and missing data where I, I, I called missing data in a randomized experiment should be treated as missing data.
2456960	2468960	Even from a Bayesian point of view, if I frequent this point of view, talked about how randomization inferences basically based on missing data followed up with another publication 1977.
2469960	2480960	Probably the, the, the, in some sense the most complete paper was in 1978 in the annals of statistics was on Bayesian difference for causal effects.
2480960	2500960	The contributions of this paper, I think some of it were, were, were beyond what, what Neyman did but certainly built on, on, on Neyman's notation to say the notation of potential outcomes, define causal effects in all situations, not just in randomized experiments.
2500960	2507960	The idea that you can separate the science from what you do to learn about the science says you first define what you're trying to estimate.
2507960	2516960	And in an observational study you're trying to estimate the same thing you're trying to estimate in a randomized experiment, you just intervening in different ways.
2516960	2529960	Actually Neyman when I, when I had an office next to his at Berkeley disagreed, he said no, you can't talk about causal effects without randomization.
2529960	2540960	You have to have randomization even talk about causal effects, otherwise it's too speculative. So instead, Neyman said let's talk about the stars.
2540960	2552960	Another confusion of his paper was that you needed an assignment mechanism for causal inference. So an assignment mechanism is just the generalization of randomization.
2552960	2572960	So it's the probability distribution for the treatment indicator, given the covariates and the potential outcomes. So that's probability of w, given covariates x, and potential outcomes y0, y1 with the general dependence on y0 and y1.
2572960	2584960	And I defined unconfounded in, I guess, 74 I think, to be when this assignment mechanism doesn't depend upon the potential outcomes.
2584960	2591960	And you know it doesn't depend upon the potential outcomes in randomized controlled trials, because you did the randomization.
2591960	2602960	And it was, you couldn't see the potential outcomes, and you didn't use them, and you didn't use any unobserved predictors of potential outcomes.
2602960	2620960	The confusion inference I defined this concept called the ignorable, where the assignment mechanism just depend upon observed values, for example any sequential randomized controlled tiles, so that in this potential dependence on why
2620960	2634960	the observed value as in you doing a play the winner randomization. So you'd randomize the first unit, but after the after the first unit you change the odds and getting active treatment versus control treatment.
2634960	2646960	So it, the odds are in favor of the more successful treatment based on the earlier units. So here why are you first all the observed values of y0 and y1.
2646960	2655960	And of course in Bayesian inference, you have to model the science, in addition to the assignment mechanism.
2655960	2669960	Now, and I called the ignorable because that factor in the likelihood for the posterior distribution can be ignored to get the same inference and get the same answer.
2669960	2682960	So the, so the assignment mechanism creates missing and absurd potential outcomes. I say an artistic touch is needed here, because all models are wrong.
2682960	2701960	There's a question that goes back to George box, or before that von Neumann even even said that the real world is much too complex for anything but simplified models. So if, if I know if the math was too hard for von Neumann, and who's obviously too hard for
2702960	2721960	So that the idea, the idea of, of models that we use in science are always wrong, they're always too, too, too simple. I say an artistic touch is needed here, and there's a great Picasso quote I don't know if I have it here but it's
2721960	2729960	he's talking about computers and Picasso said computers are worthless. They only give answers.
2729960	2742960	Picasso's point I think is, is a great expression of the field of statistics thing that that makes statistics artistic is you have to posit models.
2742960	2753960	And, and you know these models are wrong, but they're, they're, they're working hypotheses, and that they have to be discarded as, as you go along.
2753960	2757960	Please.
2757960	2765960	So the fundamental problem facing causal inference which is an expression that made up in the 1975 paper.
2765960	2768960	It's a missing data problem.
2768960	2785960	And, you know, Paul Holland had had a more eloquent way of saying this in his jazz of paper 1986, but it's an expression that that I, well, that was in this 75 paper.
2785960	2798960	So for each unit, and here we have an example with any units, and either a control treatment zero, or an active treatment one, you get to observe either why one or why zero, you can observe both of it.
2798960	2808960	And the, and the random assignment of active or control means a representative sample of why I one will be compared to represents that of why I zero obvious.
2808960	2825960	And once you put down the notation, it's obvious notation with the question marks and the checks. It's obvious, but you have to have names notation to do that, and you have to have the idea. This notation applies beyond randomized experiments.
2825960	2837960	And, and then you have to have the ideas you need a model on this assignment mechanism that creates missing and observed data, in order to draw inference about the missing potential outcomes.
2837960	2861960	I think that that was an important insight. And in fact, I think it's the basic fundamental idea behind this year's Nobel Prize in economics, because David card was actually doing cause inference in a study where an observational
2862960	2872960	study where he had hypothetical randomization he can describe it that way, hypothetical randomization of fast food restaurants in New Jersey versus Pennsylvania.
2872960	2890960	And he the hypothetical experiment, again not said this way but had to be on his mind was a coin was tossed to see whether the, with the restaurant was situated in New Jersey, or Pennsylvania, because New Jersey and Pennsylvania had different laws
2890960	2906960	and different state laws on the minimum wage. And so the units in that experiment with a different fast food restaurants, and the hypothetical randomization was were they in Pennsylvania, or New Jersey, where there were different minimum wage laws.
2906960	2922960	And that has important economic implications, and which eventually led to David cards Nobel Prize, and English and in Ben's use of these potential outcomes to describe the methods.
2922960	2938960	You're both both very generous. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm sort of jealous of it, but, but it was not I was not any more mistake for the Nobel Prize to do that, then a mistake and lots of the Nobel Prize had mistakes in that in that same sense.
2938960	2942960	Okay, next slide.
2942960	2958960	It's a mistake to do this for regression use of this regression goes back to the 19th century for causal inference, but it's a mistake to regress its observe value on an indicator for which treatment you got in and covariates.
2958960	2967960	Why is it a mistake. Look at this notation. It loses the potential outcomes and the key Fisher naming concepts and using the observe value notation.
2967960	2973960	Mixes up this why habs mixes up the assignment mechanism and the in science.
2973960	2989960	And here, my insights, which built on Namens insight from the notation is, you want to separate the science here the, the, the wise from what you did to learn about the science the W's.
2989960	3010960	This was, was critical to the 20th century insights, and here this mixed it all up again suppresses these key insights there are no missing data. So once you write this down, and you're regressing the observe value of why on the observed W's and the, and the observed covariates.
3011960	3029960	Hmm, must be parameters well parameters are always missing because they're they're hypothetical. So but this this notation for observational its use and observational became standard and biostatistics economics, epidemiology everywhere, and even great statisticians and
3029960	3047960	epidemiologists, for example, Fisher, I can't talk about these pay I don't have time, but I can find mistakes that Fisher made in dealing with secondary outcomes in randomized experiments.
3048960	3067960	We made mistakes, Cochran made mistakes cornfield made mistakes, they confuse themselves in observational studies, because they're always in this observe value notation, and talking about doing regressions, the cornfield quotation that's on the next slide, I think it's particularly revealing.
3067960	3071960	So next slide please.
3071960	3085960	So the results on the way observational studies were quote handle, because there was no design phase, and they're instead confused analysis, and they, and they mixed up association versus causation came muddled.
3085960	3097960	I think one of the real examples of that is it was called now a case control study and cases referred to people with a disease controls referred to people without the disease.
3097960	3114960	And I much prefer the terminology case non case, because the control in a case control study is completely different than a control in a randomized experiment control in a randomized experiment is a person who's exposed to the control treatment.
3114960	3126960	And in this case controls that a case control is somebody without the disease. So it's very confusing terminology.
3126960	3141960	Because with case control studies, use the sampling mechanism is how you drew samples, but they're confounded sampling mechanisms in a case control study are confounded because they by definition depend upon the observed potential outcomes.
3141960	3157960	In other words, what they did they typically, they looked at all the cases, all the people with the disease, and they compared them to non cases, people without the disease.
3157960	3167960	So this is what you had to do when you're looking at a rare outcome, you almost had to do it because they're otherwise became too expensive to collect data.
3167960	3177960	This is a quote from cornfield, who's the main epidemiologist on the smoking lung cancer.
3177960	3192960	A direct quote from a paper that he wrote in 1959, we now consider the distinction between the kinds of inferences that can be supported by observational studies is non randomized studies, whether prospective or retrospective.
3192960	3204960	And this case control prospective means you go forward by by looking at smokers and non smokers.
3204960	3211960	Whereas a case control looks at lung cancer versus nonline cancer.
3211960	3224960	And so the prospective studies, or retrospective and those but they're observational, and those that can be supported by experimental studies that there is, is a distinction seems undeniable.
3224960	3245960	But it's exact nature is elusive. And I agree with it at that time it was elusive, because it didn't become formalized until I did it in 1977 by putting down an assignment mechanism, which embedded these two kinds of studies within one framework and could define what the benefit of
3245960	3256960	the assumption was. It's, it's unconfoundedness is that the assignment mechanism cannot depend upon potential outcomes, because you did the assignment.
3256960	3266960	But in a, an observational study where the prospective retrospective is unconfoundedness of the assignment mechanism is an assumption.
3266960	3278960	There's a big difference between how well justified the assumption in a randomized experiment is risk the assumption in an observational study.
3278960	3281960	Next slide please.
3281960	3291960	So the starting conclusions of I mean the starting conclusions on causality. And that's why I hope this was a useful introductory lecture.
3291960	3308960	So let's retain the key insights from the past key insights meaning insights from name and Fisher, but issue, get rid of confusion from the past, get rid of the fact that everybody's doing everything by regression, and they're replacing the potential outcomes by the observed
3308960	3311960	outcome and trying to do the squares regression.
3311960	3322960	So the important conclusion is to realize that the ideas between randomized controlled trials are extremely recent people have been talking about causality for thousands of years.
3322960	3331960	Now which direction should I hunt for food, should I plant this variety or plant that variety, when we came out more an agrarian society.
3331960	3336960	The ideas are extremely recent. These are 20th century ideas.
3336960	3354960	Now we should certainly update statistical methods from in both design and analysis to take advantage of modern computing. So what I mean by design and modern, you know, take advantage of modern computing to take the advantage of modern computing to throw away bad randomized
3354960	3375960	allocations, use machine learning ideas to draw thousands of randomized randomized allocations, and then compare balance on on zillions of covariates and understand the geometry behind that, and then throw away the bad allocations.
3375960	3389960	I encourage mathematical precision, especially in notation and logical flow. So I don't care about mathematical precision in these in these stupid theorems about asymptotic balance and stuff like that.
3389960	3396960	Take advantage of modern computing and stay with with finite sample methods as much as possible.
3396960	3417960	And this precision in in thinking and logical flow can have critical consequences in in in current in challenging applications. For example, now in placebo effects. I think one of the really important areas of advancement can be can built on some
3417960	3429960	ideas of placebo effects using this notation of potential outcomes, and for which I think the this this Nobel Prize was recently given.
3429960	3443960	Okay, so I think I probably have run out of time if not more. It's four minutes after 10 is I get so I will let our host say how we should proceed.
3443960	3446960	I thought we have the next slide.
3446960	3466960	The last slide is newer general ideas. Okay, so this in here is really this idea propensity score for for for designing studies both experimental and observational studies, this idea that you, you, you summarize all zillions of covariates by a low
3466960	3477960	three dimensional summary. So this is really is tied to machine learning ideas and use these both for designing experimental and observational studies.
3477960	3493960	So this propensity score idea is due to this paper by Paul Rosenbaum, and I wrote in 1983 that you can design observational studies and propensity scores because they do not they are not a function of potential outcomes, they can be used in
3493960	3501960	a much more important idea, then, then its use as an analysis tool.
3501960	3514960	And re randomization experiments to avoid unlucky allocations, and this is an expanded template for observational studies.
3514960	3521960	Another joint paper with us with a sequence of papers.
3521960	3535960	Another really important idea is what I with Paul wasn't that Paul, constantly for a caucus and I called principal stratification, which generalize this idea of instrumental variables from economics.
3535960	3548960	So I, I think this is with principal stratification. I think as as a basic idea, that's yet sort of got the Nobel Prize and I mean I'll make the tie there, even though formerly it didn't.
3548960	3568960	I think it's a combination with with complications to deal with with not only non compliance, which is the instrumental variables, setting, but basically, is ruben and and, and, and, and Thomas paper and placebo effects.
3568960	3579960	I recently wrote where the that that generalization is is is made using.
3579960	3594960	Actually, this paper says that when you're doing randomized experiments is currently done for a new drug. For example, the way it's done the placebo control trials.
3594960	3602960	It affects the placebo effects meaning that people think they're getting the active treatment, and that affects the outcome.
3602960	3616960	And if you do a placebo controlled randomized trial, and now you prove a drug, when people have a are taking an approved drug, they know they're getting an active treatment when you fill a prescription farm.
3617960	3641960	Retreated in practice, are getting the placebo effect. In addition, and what that leads to in practice is higher doses of drug that you then what you need for the outcome effect because the effect on the outcome you're already getting with the
3641960	3646960	when you go to a drug store in in in you in you fill a prescription.
3646960	3666960	So in practice, I think 80 or something like 50 to 60% of drugs as approved by FDA from placebo controlled trials are ratcheted down in the future based on observational data, saying the doses were too high, led to too many side effects.
3666960	3677960	And that's approved for practice is the dose that was used in the placebo controlled trials, when giving that dose.
3677960	3687960	The units the the patients with you observe is it in addition to the drug effect, you're getting from placebo effect.
3687960	3702960	So, the, the, the drug that's being assigned is too high, because it's, it's, it's being assigned to get the effect, the real effect of the drug plus the placebo placebo effect.
3702960	3710960	So this, this, this 2020 paper that I wrote that that's published in Andrews journal, I believe.
3710960	3728960	So to me, it's the Japanese Journal, Kazuma Shumatsu's journal, actually, is about that, that, that the topic, have other things to submit to Andrews journal on on this topic, I think it's a very important topic.
3728960	3731960	Okay, I think I'm finally done.
3731960	3732960	Yes.
3732960	3736960	And thank you for your patience, as we struggle with the slides.
3736960	3742960	Thank you so much and sorry for the slides is being too excited to see you today.
3742960	3745960	Very kind. Thank you.

3932960	3935960	Okay.
3935960	3949960	I'm going to comment at Rubin's talk and we are going to have an open discussion session. So you may, you may each one ask questions to Professor Donald Rubin.
3949960	3958960	And now I'll pass the mic to Professor Zhou Xiaohua from Peking University.
3958960	3960960	Yeah, hi, Don.
3960960	3964960	Nice to hear you talk again.
3964960	3969960	I've never heard this talk before, but every time I will gain insight from your talk.
3969960	3981960	Yeah, yeah, I, I think one of the reasons is that I, I use a limited number of slides. And so the talk is always slightly different.
3981960	3995960	Anyway, this is very great talk or just common few sense and also maybe just discuss a little bit further work actually based on principle strata ideas.
3995960	4002960	I think it's a very important idea. And by the way, so I have a note down for like over 25 years old friend of mine.
4002960	4014960	And actually my research in causal inference actually introduced by Don to me about, I think I can remember when I was doing post that hover or when that started.
4014960	4020960	But, but one work I had done was done is about encouragement design. I don't know if you remember.
4020960	4023960	Andrew, your, your voice is breaking up.
4023960	4025960	Oh, can you hear me.
4025960	4026960	Yeah, I can hear you now.
4026960	4027960	Okay.
4027960	4030960	Yeah, I just, yeah, I just said look.
4030960	4031960	Okay.
4031960	4032960	Yeah, go ahead.
4032960	4040960	So what I say that my research in causal inference actually introduced you to me about 25 years ago.
4040960	4045960	Yes, about a study about the randomized encouragement design for flu shot.
4045960	4049960	Actually, that's a paper we did with Emmons and his students.
4049960	4050960	That's right.
4050960	4051960	You remember that.
4051960	4052960	Yes.
4052960	4060960	And then actually that's a great work and then got the award from international Bayesian society.
4060960	4070960	Yeah, actually, so I very grateful actually you are introducing me to the field of the causal inference and then, and then we'll have done some work so I want to mention a little bit.
4070960	4093960	The, the, the Ruben framework for you call the Ruben causal model, I think I like that model, because I think one thing I don't probably dimension maybe to pride in his talk is I think is a Ruben causal model actually clearly distinguish between estimate and estimation, I think that's actually very crucial.
4093960	4104960	I mean, bio statistic in the medical field. So what I mean is the estimate is quantity is determined by science. So scientific question you want to ask.
4104960	4121960	So that is given by estimate, which has nothing to do with the model with assumptions I think that should be very clear, because, because particularly the causal inference became more popular in computer science, in artificial intelligence, and in other fields.
4121960	4128960	I feel like when I read those papers, it's not clear to me what their estimate with what they're trying to do.
4128960	4140960	They're just through all the jargon which we talk about the mathematics stuff and then the, the, the location really get confused, because our audience mostly actually from the computer science I think the field.
4140960	4153960	I think it's very glad that actually down you give a talk in this audience is good. Yeah, because I think this audience most familiar with the pearls, the graphic model, I think my understanding is, but I think it's good.
4153960	4169960	I mean, the pearls graph model I think has their own usage, has own usage. But on the other hand, I think it's a woman, we need to clear what are the scientific questions, and what are the estimates with estimate is the parameter, which defines scientific questions.
4169960	4181960	I think if you don't make that clear everything well, well, well, I think we'll go around afterwards. Then after you have an estimate so clearly defined and everybody understand, then you talk about estimations.
4181960	4194960	So where does assumption come in, because the, the estimation whether you can estimate estimate dependent on the data you have, you have a, if you have a randomized trial data or you have a long compliance, or you have truncation by death.
4195960	4209960	So, so you have to very clear, clear for a study the data you have to estimate estimate, and then also clearly to make your assumptions, which to make estimate estimate more.
4209960	4216960	So that's a crucial I think that part of the causal inference to say the parameter you have is whether it's estimable.
4216960	4233960	So, is the parameter you have can be estimated consistently based on the data you have. I think that part I think is part of the, I think the key, I mean maybe don't agree in the causal inference, compared with other field, the, as an ability issues.
4233960	4243960	And then the third I think is the important is to check your assumptions you made in your causal inference, but some something make sense some something doesn't.
4243960	4250960	So if the assumption doesn't make no sense in the in practice, in practice, then I don't think your causal inference make any sense.
4251960	4264960	So that's I learned from down actually to work on those the medical field, the problem. So I want to also mention a little bit about the, the some extension us actually some application of the principle certification down mentioned just a little bit.
4264960	4269960	So actually that's the he mentioned about this dude.
4270960	4280960	So that's one of the students actually work with us with work with me and down on the also around my encouragement design. So we have actually two paper on that area.
4280960	4294960	So I want to mention, based on the principle certification that I have done some work actually also motivated by the dance, the principle. So why is truncation by that's how do you make causal inference when you have a truncation by that.
4294960	4308960	So what's our problem is, is this if you interested in some parameters, like quality of life in five years after you take the treatment by the people might die one year after receive the treatment.
4308960	4316960	So, so for the people who die, what are their outcomes. So actually that's a very interesting issue right now.
4317960	4326960	Can you still treat as a missing data, which some people did to say, even they die this is still missing the quality of life five year after the die.
4326960	4332960	So that's actually might be a problem because I don't know what the quality of life for that people.
4332960	4349960	So that's actually the big issue. So that's actually show the principle of the stratification really work in the cities. So, so we have done some work to how do you make causal inference when when when you have a truncation by death.
4349960	4363960	This is very important because that one is commonly occur in medical research, because for most of the cohort study large cohort study you always have some people who died during the study.
4363960	4373960	So how do you deal with us and and then they don't maybe have a time to talk about that truncation by that but that's actually the very important applications in medical research.
4373960	4382960	But another area I think I also get a lot of attention recently is the precision medicine to say how do you do the causal inference in precision medicine.
4382960	4394960	So you might say what is a precision medicine probably in this audience may not familiar. So precision medicine is like this, as we know in the in the medicine, there's no one drug can treat all patient well.
4394960	4407960	So, so you're so the precision medicine sometimes also called personalized medicine. So that means you may want to tailor your treatment based on characteristic of the patients.
4407960	4422960	So maybe let's say for the cancer patients, you may have the chemotherapy or you may have surgery, but for some people is better to use chemo than than other people based on the genetic information of the subject.
4422960	4436960	So that area actually is called a heterogeneous treatment fact. So that means, so the in the literature, the talk down mentioned, mostly focused on, I think the overall average treatment fact to the whole population.
4436960	4441960	But sometimes you might might be interested actually is the sub population.
4441960	4458960	So maybe you want to condition on covariates and then look at the causal effect in the sub group. So, so they call the heterogeneous treatment fact, but the principle down just mentioned about the Ruben causal model can still apply, but you have to do more work to make work.
4458960	4465960	So that's called a heterogeneous treatment fact. Actually, I think this is still right open area in medicine.
4466960	4475960	And then particularly when you have observational data, which have so one of the difficulty with observational data in causal inferences is our major confounders.
4475960	4489960	So the reason I think the card and then even got lower prices, they actually try to use the instrument variable to crack for the major confounders, which is they call the late.
4489960	4495960	So I think, later on I think we call the complier average cause of that right, right.
4495960	4501960	Yeah, but so maybe the late is the first proposed by ambulance and the angry.
4501960	4513960	Yes. Yeah, okay. And then later on I think we actually in our medical field we, we, we prefer the CSE, the complier average cause of that.
4513960	4532960	Okay, I think that the causal inference is getting more and more popular. And I think the current research in causal inference is how do you apply the clear principle like Ruben model to more complicated problem, like heterogeneous treatment
4532960	4541960	like big data, like observational data, like communication by death, or like right now is artificial intelligence.
4541960	4559960	Like, like, like, like in this section of the most like say how do you apply causal inference to, to the reinforcement learning to recommend, recommend, recommending systems recommendation systems, which is can be applied, because actually they're doing that down I
4559960	4567960	wasn't aware about that the in computer science they apply causal inference to almost all field of the computer science.
4567960	4584960	But I mean we look closely is I think the framework is not still not very clear actually one of the paper I'm working on with my student is how do you currently define the cause of framework for recommend recommend dating system system, like the how do you recommend
4584960	4597960	the causal inference principle, which is a doing that all the time, because they try to introduce causal inference in, in that, in that framework to make more stable or more.
4597960	4607960	They call the robust predictions. So, so as the third field I think is in the causal inference is that is a causal prediction. So that's a little bit different from the causal effect.
4607960	4621960	It's very popular those days in the science to say, how can you make prediction, which has some causal property, I think, and no one I think needs a lot of work to be done, I think that field. Yeah.
4621960	4625960	So, so, Professor Joe, Professor Joe we have limited time.
4625960	4634960	So I will more maybe once I don't comment a little bit is what do you think about the causal predictions, do you have any thought on that.
4634960	4641960	I, I should do, I can say, one or two minutes now.
4641960	4659960	I think that's probably easier for the audience and for me as well, instead of trying to remember everybody if I so if I make a comment. So I very much appreciate Andrew's comments and as, as he said we've known each other for decades.
4659960	4661960	We've written papers together.
4661960	4681960	And I think that that's your point about the, the, the being precision medicine, and the problem of censoring by, by, by death, think the, it was the censoring by death I think has been underappreciated for for years.
4681960	4695960	And I think the idea of thinking about sensing, sensing due due due to death as creating a particular principle straight up where they can always survivors, the subgroup of people who would survive.
4695960	4707960	And so you try to do it do a study, and you want to try to separate the outcome of death from the outcome of quality of life, I think with many serious diseases. That's, that's an important question.
4707960	4711960	These otherwise you sort of get the wrong answer.
4711960	4721960	Because the, so how if you want to look at the effect of an intervention on quality of life. What do you do with people who died.
4721960	4738960	Well, if you just throw them out, then you can get completely the wrong answer. If, especially if the, if, if one treatment kills people who are weak, and then the other treatment looks better because it lets them survive.
4738960	4751960	And it's just, you've got to worry about, about both outcomes, the death outcome, and the quality of life outcome. And I think that there's a lot of work to be done there.
4751960	4766960	I, I, I second Andrew's comment about that, that this perspective has, has a lot of, of things to offer current studies and in, in medicine where with those are critical attributes.
4766960	4780960	Also the comment about precision medicine. Certainly, I'm on the word that the idea of precision medicine is especially important when treating patients, you don't want to, when it when it treat everybody the same.
4780960	4796960	But one of the ideas of precision medicine is you want to obviously have a different treatment for different people. And the, and there the complication is principal straighter are only partially identified.
4796960	4805960	If you, if, if, but there, but here's where, where, where the role of covariates can be really important.
4805960	4823960	And, and I think there's a, probably the most, maybe the, maybe the most relevant paper is, is one that on this topic is one that I wrote with for me to me Ellie, and some of her students, her Italian students.
4823960	4839960	Because here the, the words is published, I don't, I don't remember right, right, right now. But the, but the idea is that you can, the covariates help to predict which principal straighter you're in.
4839960	4851960	And obviously the medicine, the principal straighter help define which treatments work for which sub subgroup of patients.
4851960	4857960	And I think that's a terribly important idea.
4857960	4863960	And maybe I'll stop there to make sure we have time, because I can always come back at the end of it.
4864960	4872960	Actually, Professor safe home is also very interested in this question. Professors, say, do you want to make a comment.
4872960	4874960	Yes, hi.
4874960	4882960	Hi, this is punctually here I'm in the computer science department in Tsinghua University. Actually, we are in the same university now.
4882960	4884960	Yes.
4884960	4893960	There is some problem with my camera so next time I hope that we can, we can meet face to face.
4893960	4902960	My question is that actually, in the recent years, you know that there is a very obvious trend that in the machine learning community.
4902960	4916960	There are many researchers, especially very, I mean, famous researchers in this field to start to talk about causality, right, we need to embrace causality into the machine learning.
4916960	4924960	Actually, from the 2016 we just start to, to think about so what's the limitation.
4924960	4942960	There are some problems that today's machine learning framework cannot solve in the end. Actually, we find that there are several problems like explainability and also the stability problem, I mean the generalization to out of distribution and also fairness issues.
4943960	4959960	We think that when we choose back, all of these problems are the root cause of these problems is, is just that in the learning framework we, we didn't even try to differentiate the causality and also the correlation.
4959960	4969960	So, because in the, in the big data we just absorb a lot of spurious correlations in our model so that directly lead to these problems.
4969960	4986960	So, I just want to listen to your thoughts and comments on this trend. And also, the second question is, when we try to do this when we try to embrace the causality into the learning.
4986960	4999960	Some researchers just use, for example, the structure causal model, and we, our group actually borrow a lot of ideas from the Rubens causal model the potential outcome framework.
4999960	5007960	So, actually, we are not that confident because we are just a halfway.
5007960	5028960	We stand in the, in the machine learning community we just a halfway with respect to the causal inference community so we just want to listen to your advice from your perspective so how can the potential Rubens causal model help in the machine learning tasks.
5028960	5029960	Thank you.
5029960	5058960	Sure. Yeah, I'll say just a couple of sentences now about this. I think one of the critical things and I've over the years I've done a variety of consulting and very often the main effort is at the front, meaning at the beginning, when trying to understand exactly what the, what the question is being asked and try to get
5058960	5085960	investigators away from talking about very theoretical things and get them to address what they can do. So, if you're talking about causal inference in machine learning, computer science, real world, what are the collections of interventions
5085960	5101960	that you can implement. I don't want to talk about the theory, because the theory will will will will follow from the question that you're trying to address. If, if your eventual answer can't help doing what you want to do.
5101960	5103960	It's worthless.
5103960	5117960	I think that that's one of the, the important ideas from this 20th century ideas of experimentation is you should try to experiment on things that you can actually do.
5117960	5126960	So, in the, in the computer science world, what can you actually do, what are the intro and interventions that you can implement.
5126960	5129960	Now,
5129960	5146960	I'm thinking about that implement in the context of a randomized experiment. What are the, what are the interventions that you can actually create and, and do, and then what are the outcomes that you want to achieve.
5147960	5164960	Now, I think the internet kind of experimentation is more far more complicated than the classical ones for one primary reason. Everybody's interfering with everybody else.
5164960	5180960	And it's, it's, it's very hard to get discrete non interfering units in, in, in, even in, even if you can do the randomization.
5180960	5194960	And there's, there's only one real study that I've been actively involved in, which is something that I didn't refer to here at all but it has to do with.
5195960	5214960	Actually, it's, I guess it's, it's partially confidential, so I probably shouldn't say too much about, but it has, it worries about the second order causal effects that you get on the internet, where, where the units of the quote experimentation are not very independent.
5214960	5231960	And so I guess my general advice to people who are thinking about in terms of internet experiments is to decide, first of all, what the interventions that are possible to do, and then how to deal with the interference.
5231960	5247960	And I think that's a wide open area and how you, how you deal with interfering units units who are communicating, because the, the network on on the internet is, is so incredibly vast.
5247960	5266960	And you, and you don't, and depending upon how what the links are between the different nodes in the network, you get, you have to get a different type of, of, of inference and a lot of work has to be done there.
5267960	5273960	I, I don't know whether that as you question at all, but those are my fast thoughts on it.
5273960	5284960	Thank you, thank you. And if the time, time allows, we may have more discussions, just the host. Yeah.
5284960	5304960	You just mentioned about the treatment and how it is important in the causal inference. We actually have Professor Joe Silan who has written, written the most one of the most popular textbooks in econometrics and talking about the policy treatment and policy impact evaluation.
5304960	5311960	So let us welcome John Silan to give some comments.
5312960	5322960	Actually, can you send me a title for this book, if, especially if it's in English.
5322960	5325960	Okay, I'm going to send you right now.
5325960	5327960	Okay, good.
5327960	5332960	Yeah, we're like, we're like, I also like to see you too.
5332960	5343960	I prefer Ruben and thank you very much for the great lecture about the history of the Ruben called model.
5343960	5350960	The following poll model is actually the basis for calling for the empirical economics.
5350960	5377960	Economics usually use random control trial and a natural experiment, natural experiment, trying to identify color effects in economics, especially in liberal economics, which so called the credible revolution in empirical economics by anguish.
5377960	5388960	Especially Ruben called model is, is especially suited to do policy evaluation in economics.
5388960	5395960	After implanting on government policy, governments usually want to know the effects of the policy.
5395960	5407960	So Ruben Paul model played a great role in those kinds of research questions. Ruben called model can perform the research question and make the evaluation.
5408960	5425960	There is another kind of problem in economics. That is, we saw the economic phenomena, and we want to find out the causes of the phenomena or the problem.
5425960	5439960	For example, in 2008, you know, it's happened a world economic crisis. So economies want to know what's the reason called this crisis.
5439960	5457960	So in this case, I have a question for Ruben is that how Ruben called model play a role in those kind of problems. This is just like another direction from
5458960	5480960	from policy evaluation is from manipulation to find out the color effects. And this probably is a try to reverse we will see effects, how to find out the reasons can you give
5480960	5488960	us some sort of problem.
5488960	5505960	Sure. Yeah, I think what you're pointing out is a really critical point that actually arises, especially in philosophy.
5505960	5520960	If you look at sort of historically at at some of the literature on causal inference, a lot of it is devoted to finding the cause of an effect.
5520960	5541960	So you got sick what caused that. And there is an important distinction between searching for the cause of an effect, which is I think, really a descriptive question, versus the effects of causes in other words.
5541960	5555960	So think about randomized experiments. What you're randomizing are the causes, and then what you can observe are what the effects of those causes, those interventions are.
5555960	5575960	As, as we look at data, what we see are a state, you know, the current state of affairs. And here we were constantly drawn to wondering, ah, what caused that effect.
5575960	5590960	And in fact, in my mind, one of the revolutions of the 20th century, this experimental revolution, and the cause of effect revolution is that's almost an unanswerable question what the cause of an effect is.
5590960	5601960	Let me give you a trivial example that they've used for years. So somebody died dies of lung cancer.
5601960	5612960	First person is ah, he died of lung cancer because he smoked two packs of cigarettes a day from the time he was 14 years old.
5612960	5623960	And the next person says, well, that's true. But the reason the reason he spoke, he spoke two packs of cigarettes a day was his parents were both heavy smokers.
5623960	5633960	And each of them smoked two packs of cigarettes a day. And there are always cigarettes around the house, even when he was a young teenager.
5633960	5643960	Other person says, ah, well, that's true. But the reason both of his parents smoked is that his, their, their grandparents smoked.
5643960	5653960	And they came from the old country and the old country, everybody was a smoker. So they were smoking all the time. They smoked three packs a day, four packs a day.
5653960	5662960	They, they're like eating cigarettes. In fact, one of the relatives came from Turkey, where everyone smoked unfiltered cigarettes all the time.
5662960	5674960	So the real cause was that, that his grandparents smoked cigarettes, and therefore his parents were doomed to smoke cigarettes. So the real cause was his grandparents.
5674960	5678960	And of course that can go on indefinitely.
5679960	5697960	I think one of the revolutions of the 20th century and the idea of experimentation was a change in focus from looking for the cause of something that exists to the effect of causes, the effect of interventions, where you can formulate the
5698960	5706960	question and the answer in terms of actual interventions that you can do in terms of an assignment mechanism.
5706960	5719960	Ideally a randomized assignment so that it's unconfounded or some other, but the, but these other, these other questions, the effects, the causes of effects of things that is descriptive.
5720960	5736960	They may be hypothetical, maybe able to think, and I've written about that in various places. For example, there was one discussion I wrote, I think with the title, which ifs have causal answers.
5736960	5746960	So what kind of question that would be is, if I, if I remove the sun from the solar system with the planets still go in their orbits.
5746960	5753960	There's no causal like, like, like questions, but the intervention of removing the sun, we have no idea what that even means.
5753960	5770960	So I think it's important when formulating questions in practice for things that you really want to understand is you have to formulate them in the, in the context of what interventions that you can do, because then you try to choose the
5770960	5777960	one that's most favorable to you.
5777960	5780960	Does that help in any way, I hope so.
5780960	5799960	So that means you have come to some ideas first, then you can manipulate is or interface data to find some correct and very often the manipulation that you can do, you will find that you want to do is you really can't do it.
5799960	5811960	And then I think the focus should turn to interventions that you can do, because if you're a practical person, why should you spend time thinking about something you can't do.
5811960	5823960	Right, it's like saying, ah, if I live to 2000 years old, when I'm 1000 years old, I will, I will start in the study of medicine.
5824960	5835960	Why spend time thinking about that you're not going to live to 1000 years old. So why so why have a debate with other people on what you're going to do when you're 1000 years old.
5835960	5837960	It's not worth the effort.
5837960	5844960	So you should, you should expand effort thinking about things that can be done.
5844960	5861960	Maybe maybe that's too applied for, for some philosophers, but it's, I guess, I've, I've come to the conclusion that people spend too much time worrying about things that they can't change.
5861960	5867960	Okay, thank you.
5868960	5881960	We actually have also a few questions from the audience that they want to see, Professor Rubins comments, then, then we'll first answer the audience questions and then we'll come back to discussion if we have more time.
5881960	5883960	Okay, that's fine.
5883960	5894960	Okay, so the first question is, what's your opinion about the future development of the potential outcome framework. What's your expectation.
5895960	5911960	Ah, well, my expectation is, it's the, it's the correct basic framework, but they're all sorts of aspects of the real world that it hasn't been modified to address.
5912960	5932960	Because it, so for example, this idea that Andrew talked about of precision medicine, I think is is an important one, because the, and the role of covariates, I think is underappreciated there.
5933960	5946960	If you do randomized experiments one attitude used to be, you should pretty much ignore covariates, you should do large simple, simple trials, for example, and I think that's wrong.
5946960	5957960	Because in order to do anything precise with being precise means at least to me is to be able to to condition on more and more descriptors of individuals.
5958960	5976960	And so the idea there is you can't just do large simple trials. And actually I'd be interested in hearing what would Andrew has to say about that because certainly there's been an emphasis in in in recent years on doing this large simple
5977960	5996960	where you don't worry about enforcing balance on many covariates, you just the simple refers to just complete randomization, because the basic theory of Fisher and Neyman is averaging over everything, but when you actually going down to making decisions, decisions
5996960	6000960	have to be very conditional.
6000960	6003960	What do you have to say about that.
6003960	6008960	Well, I think I will pull wait because because the audience probably want to hear from you.
6008960	6009960	Okay.
6009960	6012960	And now if the time allow, I will see if you will.
6012960	6015960	Okay, fine.
6015960	6031960	So, so this basic answer is that even in design, we now have the computational tools to make designs far more precise than then can be achieved just by complete randomization.
6031960	6043960	And an important aspect of that is this idea of rerandomization randomization. So you look at at zillions of possible randomized allocations.
6043960	6059960	And then you have measures of marriage, like the difference between covariate distributions in the treatment group and the control group, and you throw out all bad allocations by using the computer to do that for you.
6059960	6071960	And the resulting distributions that you're using are not the simple t distributions and f distributions and chi squared distributions.
6071960	6084960	Because they this throwing out bad randomizations means you're truncating those distributions. And so the distributions are complex mixtures of truncated distributions, even asymptotically.
6084960	6091960	And so using this general framework of potential outcomes and Ruben causal model.
6091960	6109960	Then you can then you can try to use the power of modern computing to do the really tedious job of throwing out bad allocations, but you first have to define bad allocations and bad allocations will be defined in terms of covariate
6109960	6122960	distributions and multivariate covariate distributions. They're really tedious to compute, but that's what computers are great at doing in these really tedious computations. They're terrible at thinking.
6122960	6137960	I agree. I think the realization could be a potential future research area. But on the other hand, I think that the realization can solve the bias, some bias issues.
6137960	6148960	On the other hand, they, they create some difficulty in analysis, because of the use throughout some data, and then you have to just for I know you have done some work in that.
6148960	6154960	But I think, but when the data structure complicated. So they are going to complicate analysis further.
6154960	6165960	Like if you have, let's say non digital data, and then you have a missing data in your outcomes, and then you have delay in correct collect outcomes.
6165960	6176960	So I'm kind of worried about that part to say, maybe the outcome is survival time. So you can't just wait until they die. That's too long.
6177960	6188960	And, but I think by the idea is I like the idea of a randomization but just need to think about the design issue and analysis the issue how to balance those two.
6188960	6207960	Yes. And when I think about why it's this re randomization has become a more recent idea is again I said this briefly in the talk. I mean, Fisher would would throw out a obviously bad randomized allocation.
6207960	6225960	He would never live with one where all the good plants got got a treat one treatment and all the bad plants got got the other other treatment. In fact, that's why he invented the analysis of covariance in 1935 I think he invented it.
6225960	6246960	And he was had an experiment experiment where, according to the complete randomization, the tea bushes in India, and all the, the, all the bushes with low yield in the previous year, we're assigned one treatment and the ones with good yield previous year, got assigned the other
6246960	6253960	treatment. And so we have to adjust for that, using the analysis of covariance.
6253960	6265960	And I wrote down details actually that's a paper where he, where he, he made some mistakes, not mathematical mistakes but mental mistakes, fundamental thinking about.
6265960	6282960	And I think the reason why he made those mistakes is he didn't, he wasn't using Naaman's notation for these intermediate potential outcomes, which he was saying should be adjusted for.
6282960	6294960	Okay, thank you. This is really, really helpful, especially in regards to the hot topic of a real normalization recently. It's been discussed. So it's very helpful to hear your comments.
6294960	6314960	So the next question is from Deng Wu from Waseda University. He was asking, now the COVID-19 pandemic is getting down worldwide. However, it is reported that the reasons for getting down are not clear enough, even for epidemiological
6314960	6326960	experts. So how causal inference methods can do some more intelligence analysis in epidemiology that, sorry.
6326960	6354960	Okay, well, I guess there are now a variety of vaccines being proposed and the rules for who gets them vary not only by country, but within a country like the United States, the rules vary by state.
6354960	6378960	So the 50 states, each of them has somewhat different versions of that. And so I think this gives an opportunity because of the variety of interventions being proposed to actually learn about and compare the different rules.
6378960	6383960	So some of the rules have age limitations.
6383960	6401960	You know, they have other rules have you, you have to have boosters with it with the same vaccine. There's recent stuff in the United States at least that said that that seems to suggest that a booster from any of the vaccines works, no matter what vaccine you got earlier.
6401960	6411960	So there I think there are a variety of, I guess what would be called natural experiments taking place all over the world with respect to COVID.
6412960	6431960	And so I'm, I'm surely I'm not an expert on following and tracking what what what these interventions are. There's certainly is a variety of them which leads to, I think what would be called natural experiments where there's some
6431960	6445960	the assignment mechanism is probably not that related to the assignment mechanism is not really related to potential outcomes, which is the critical assumption. I think realizing that that's the assumption.
6445960	6458960	That's the critical assumption to do inference in natural experiments is is really a critical idea to keep in mind.
6459960	6469960	Okay, so the next next question from the audience is from her your way.
6469960	6482960	His question is, is the output set of causality included in the correlation output set of vice versa. What are the relationships.
6483960	6504960	Okay, I think I understood the words, but I may not have understood the big idea. So read again please is the output set of causality included in the correlation output set or vice versa. What are the relationships.
6504960	6523960	So I guess by output set that terminology is, is not familiar to me. But, but the I assume what it means is the output set meaning the, the scientific conclusions that are reached at the end of the causal analysis.
6523960	6527960	Is, is that how I should interpret that.
6527960	6533960	I just wonder if it is outcome set.
6533960	6542960	So is the outcome set me that the outcome set. I don't see the outcome set output. I think they're probably this person from computer science.
6542960	6557960	So the computer think about input output. So this is the output. So that means the results probably right now. So he took he talked about if you if I interpret correctly is if you do the causal inference you get the results, and then you do the correlation.
6557960	6560960	Not as you get results how those results.
6560960	6564960	What's the relationship between those two results is all right.
6564960	6569960	Maybe I suggest the organizer move on to the next question. I think I see us.
6569960	6575960	So, so if you want to rephrase that in the comments, so please do that be fine. Yeah.
6575960	6586960	Yeah, yeah, yeah, that'll be helpful. So the next question is that, do you think causal learning has the potential to be applied in more complex control problems like robotic arm control.
6586960	6593960	If that how to apply causal learning to the high dimension space.
6593960	6608960	Okay, so first with respect to the high, high dimensional space I, I think that when you're dealing with it with with a high dimensional space. The, the first thing to do is to understand Euclidean geometry.
6608960	6625960	And, and, and because there are many sort of examples where people think that if you have a high dimensional covariates that that that creates complications, or in some sense it does.
6625960	6641960	So if you look at the Euclidean space, and you, and you understand eigenvectors and eigenvalues. If you, if you have a high, a high dimensional space of covariates, but only a few treatments.
6641960	6652960	And then what happens automatically is after looking at the first principal components, there are no differences in the, in the, in the lower principal components.
6652960	6656960	So you don't have to worry about balancing things that are already balanced.
6656960	6671960	It doesn't, it doesn't create the same kind of problem as if you have a high dimensional outcome space, which leads to like multiple comparisons problems when, when, when trying to look at p values or significance levels.
6671960	6690960	I, I'm not, I'm a little bit that I, I know about the work being being done in in sort of more than machine learning computer science is it starts with something that's not a complication.
6690960	6696960	So we're worrying about eigenspaces that where there's no difference.
6696960	6715960	If, if you have high, you know, if you have high dimensional covariates, and you sort of ordered them, you know, ranked them in importance, and then you use look at the icon structure, you find out in the unimportant spaces.
6715960	6717960	There are no differences.
6717960	6727960	And that's because you don't have enough units. But, but, but still you don't have to, I mean, mechanically, it's, it's not an issue to be worried about.
6727960	6731960	I hope that address the question to some extent at least.
6731960	6746960	Thank you. I, I think it will be helpful for him to. Okay, so then, the next question is that if potential outcome framework has same function in causal explainable AI with SCM.
6747960	6750960	SCM structural causal model.
6750960	6753960	Okay.
6753960	6758960	And so we the sense with the question again please.
6758960	6771960	If potential outcome framework have the same function in causal explainable AI with structural causal model.
6771960	6777960	Well, I think he's comparing with POM with SCM.
6777960	6784960	The structural causal model. I mean, I, I, I don't really understand what the with those words mean.
6784960	6794960	If you, if you have the question that you're addressing formulated in terms of potential outcomes.
6795960	6810960	Then the next step is to design a study to try to address that, that, that, that causal question. And the study will, will obviously depend upon whether it's randomized on the assignment mechanism.
6811960	6828960	Are you, are you just observing observational data. Are you actually doing an experiment and depending upon which of those you're doing the method of analysis will follow from the, from the design that, that you used.
6828960	6838960	I basically like Bayesian models, I think Bayesian models are where everything's a random variable are the right way to derive statistics.
6838960	6854960	The fundamental way to do a basic analysis is uses use the basic idea the essential idea of a fisher doing basing it on the randomization distribution, or hypothetical distribution if you if you didn't do a randomized experiment.
6854960	6864960	That's the first step, and then more complex answers are given by the by the posterior distribution.
6864960	6873960	I don't understand all these other words that are sometime added, like structural or graphical. I mean those.
6873960	6885960	Those don't mean anything to me. So I, I just, I guess I view a lot of that as clutter.
6885960	6900960	I have often self serving clutter, which is put in in papers to just for self serving reasons.
6900960	6920960	The answers are very important when you're expressing either the question or the theory. Okay, let's go to the next question is bad allocation cannot truly be measured by covariates. Is there a way to measure randomness beyond using big data covariates.
6920960	6924960	So the first part of the question was what we did again. I'm not sure I understood that.
6925960	6931960	Bad allocation, bad allocation cannot truly be measured by covariates.
6931960	6941960	Okay, let me respond with a question why not. How else, how else would you measure it.
6941960	6950960	And he was asking is there a way to measure randomness beyond using big data covariates.
6950960	6958960	So, because randomness refers to a property of what you did.
6958960	6967960	You did random allocation, and everything's an approximation. I mean, you know, how do you draw random numbers.
6967960	6982960	You know, in the old days, you took out ran table of random numbers and grabbed a haphazard graduate student asked him to close his eyes, turn to a page in the round table of random numbers and put his finger down.
6982960	6990960	If you looked at which pages were, were drawn a random page was always in the middle.
6990960	7003960	It was never the first page or the last page. Similarly, the, the number that was drawn on a particular page was never at the very top, or the very bottom, or in the very end some corner.
7003960	7022960	So, random was always, you mean, sort of uniform in some sense, but you have to describe the process by which it's done, and then it's a mathematical assumption after that.
7023960	7030960	I'm not sure I addressed at all the, the end of that question, could you read the, the end again.
7030960	7032960	With correlation.
7032960	7041960	The end is, is there a way to measure randomness beyond using big data covariates.
7041960	7058960	And randomness again is a property of a procedure which is all hypothetical. It's a mathematical structure, and the way it should be certain implications of a mathematical process which are mathematical, which are from covariates I have.
7058960	7062960	If I have no covariates at all.
7062960	7067960	How do I even assess for something looks random.
7068960	7084960	Okay, so the next question is how to understand the success of COVID-19 containment policies in relationship to public health leadership roles through causality statistics.
7084960	7090960	Yeah, well, I guess this is like the an earlier question.
7090960	7110960	Yeah, because it's, it's, you have, like, different countries have have different policies being implemented at, at different times, presumably, the many of the policies are not being decided based on the actual potential outcomes.
7110960	7131960	I think that probably the policies and the implementation heaven have a lot of natural experimentation in them right right now, especially as implemented with various different states or regions of countries having modifications of policies.
7131960	7137960	Okay, so this is a very similar question from the first question we responded earlier.
7137960	7150960	So, so, so let's go to the next question. Okay, this will be the last question. What's the role of assignment mechanism in potential outcome, and how to design a good RCT.
7150960	7171960	Okay, so the potential outcomes are how you define the science and the covariates. So it's, it's completely the potential outcomes framework is completely separate from the assignment mechanism, whether it's randomized or natural experiment or completely
7171960	7188960	observational. So that's that that's what I think of the the real contributions that I made in the 1970s was over and over again emphasizing the distinction between the framework for defining causal effects, which is potential
7188960	7201960	outcomes, and thinking about them as potential outcomes of the bit of interventions, often in trying to make the interventions ones that you could possibly do.
7201960	7215960	And then the assignment mechanism is what you actually did with how you implemented the interventions on different different units. I think one of the things that I think, and you emphasize that that's
7215960	7237960	important are these complex designs we have nesting and clustered randomization. And we wrote several papers about those kinds of designs. So, but again, the critical first step is to think what you want to learn about, then formulate
7238960	7256960	that question in terms of potential outcomes. And then once it formulated in terms of potential outcomes, then think very hard about how you do the intervention or hypothetical intervention that would yield some observed potential outcomes and some missing potential outcomes.
7256960	7277960	And my own preference with at that point, to be build Bayesian models where you get statistics functions of observed data. And then at that point, do inference, starting with to the extent possible for sharing an inference based on randomization distributions
7277960	7291960	or hypothetical randomization distributions, and then get more refinement from from the Bayesian models and more precise answers to more complex questions.
7291960	7296960	Okay. Thank you so much for attending this event.
7296960	7304960	If we don't have any more questions. I thought Professor two from earlier had a question he wanted to ask.
7304960	7307960	Professor say do you want to propose your question.
7307960	7311960	Do I still have a time.
7311960	7328960	Okay, okay, I just want to take two minutes to echo to dance question on how, how, how can we do intervention in the machine learning and how can I do with interference in our problem.
7328960	7339960	Yeah, actually, this is my understanding. So the goal of the machine learning is actually just to do prediction. Right. And in the class of my understanding is to.
7340960	7356960	Yeah. And in the classical setting actually we made some quite ideal hypothesis. The hypothesis is the ID right the sample that the training and testing they are just from, I don't from the identical distribution.
7356960	7371960	So, and another setting is just that the domain adaptive adaptation that okay we train from one distribution and we can test from on the other distribution but the testing distribution should be known.
7371960	7383960	So, either the ID, we call the ID learning or the transfer learning or domain adaptation actually, we just assume that the testing distribution is known.
7383960	7399960	Okay, so this is a classical setting. So under this setting, actually, what's the machine learning models trying to do is just to do the distribution feeding or data feeding, because we know the testing distribution, right.
7399960	7415960	So, now this is actually quite ideal. I mean, assumption because in the real in the real applications we cannot assume that okay the testing distribution is known because there are a lot of interventions.
7415960	7431960	There are a lot of distribution shifted in the real applications right. So, so now actually, I think a very fundamental problem in the machine learning community is trying to to relax assumption that the testing distribution is known.
7431960	7445960	Okay, so if we don't have the testing distribution then how can we optimize the model, how can we learn the parameters. So, then we need a new paradigm for the learning.
7446960	7467960	I think, from our understanding, if we don't know the testing distribution, then we need to pursue the true model, the true model that generate the data, right, if we can, we can gather two model, then of course, no matter how the covariate shift and how the distribution
7467960	7471960	change we can make a reasonable prediction, right.
7471960	7472960	Correct.
7472960	7491960	And the logic is, if we have the true model, actually for any samples, for any sample, we can perform uniformly good, right, because we can model the true signal and only the noise cannot be modeled if we have the true model.
7491960	7492960	Correct.
7492960	7501960	So, we, we just want to do a reverse engineering that means, okay, if you change the data distribution.
7501960	7518960	Okay, you're just a change that there's a kind of intervention, for example, you can raise, reweight all of the training samples to another distribution, if a model can can have, I mean, the uniformly good performance on all of the
7519960	7539960	distributions, for example, you have a multiple sample evading strategy, right, and under each strategy, actually you can get one distribution, but across different distributions, if we can have a good, I mean, a prediction performance, that means, okay, the model actually captured the true model.
7539960	7547960	So, I think that in the machine learning, maybe one way of intervention is just the sample evading.
7547960	7557960	So, we're going to train the distributions, and then under these distributions, whether we can find out the invariant, I mean, model or invariant structure.
7557960	7568960	And this invariance, I think it's somewhat related to a causal effect, a causal relationship or causal structure.
7569960	7579960	Our idea, but I'm not just very sure whether this is correct from the causal inference perspective, especially from the perspective of
7579960	7582960	Rubin causal model.
7582960	7588960	Right, well, I think what you, what you mean by the
7588960	7596960	true causal model is the true distribution of outcomes given covariates.
7596960	7607960	When the covariates are simple enough, let's say just define a few straighter, then we waiting works.
7607960	7618960	But if there is, if the covariates are complex or complicated, I don't want to use complex in the, in the mathematical sense.
7619960	7630960	But if they're complicated, and you have many outcome variables, I think you have to rely on modeling the y, the outcome, given the covariates.
7630960	7645960	And the modeling can, and then what you do, because if you have a good model for outcomes given covariates for y given x, then you can predict y at lots of different x values.
7645960	7659960	And I think that that's the, the bigger picture, whereas waiting is, you have to, you have to have the continuous version of waiting to have the general idea.
7659960	7662960	Yeah, correctly formulated.
7662960	7666960	So I, I think we're saying the same thing.
7666960	7669960	Basically, although the words may be slightly different.
7669960	7671960	Yeah, yeah.
7671960	7682960	But, but there has been work done starting in the probably mid 1930s in in survey work.
7682960	7694960	I think the probably the work that's closest to the work that that you're talking about in computer science is probably the work on missing data.
7694960	7711960	Because here, you'd worry about if the, if the guys who are, who are missing have very different covariate values, you know that you're relying on extrapolation, relying more and more in some hypothetical model.
7711960	7727960	And the waiting, the idea of just just waiting units only works when the support for the data are the same for the people who are observed, and the people who are missing, or otherwise the, the imputation of the missing data won't be very good.
7728960	7749960	In fact, there, there was a three volume collection of books that were published around I think 1984 or three by the, under the National Academy of Sciences, because there was a committee on, on, on handling missing data.
7749960	7766960	And the, there are various authors to the, to the three volumes, I think I'm on, I'm one of the co authors on one of the volumes, but a guy named William Maddow and adow with author on all.
7766960	7782960	I mean, it's actually because it's true during a problem. You're discussing right now, except it was done on text of, of large US surveys mostly.
7782960	7800960	The Medical Examination Survey, which was 20 or 30,000, and they, and because this was a design survey, it had certain structures that like it had different sampling units were states and has a hierarchical level to it.
7800960	7814960	So that, that, that literature, I think is, is quite relevant, although not the techniques are being used because, again, the techniques are far more simple minded than the ones that can be used today.
7814960	7825960	But I think it's worth looking at server, it's historical interest, and there probably are a variety of interesting ideas.
7825960	7840960	Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. I think this is very constructive comments and inspiring, but just now that the signal is not very good. So I will write an email to you and could you send the survey title to me and I will.
7840960	7841960	Fine, I will do so.
7841960	7843960	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
7843960	7851960	Thank you so much. So it's actually getting very late, almost like 1118 in China.
7851960	7864960	Yeah, I know you need time to grab lunch as well. Yes. Thank you so much for, for the wonderful, wonderful talk that we're very, very honored and very lucky to have you here tonight.
7864960	7880960	And thank you all for the speakers because I was reading the comments from the Billy Billy because this room is full. So we have a lot of also broadcasting guests from the website of Billy Billy and they were commenting on how useful and how helpful those
7880960	7890960	responses are. So I guess they contribute a lot to the knowledge and we are very, very happy and learn a lot tonight.
7890960	7906960	I really appreciate the formal discussions and the informal questions. They are very helpful generally for trying to clarify these important ideas. Thanks again for the invitation.
7906960	7916960	So last section, I'm going to give a brief introduction about Professor Don's book.
7916960	7918960	One second my.
7918960	7919960	Okay.
7919960	7924960	Here's what happens every single time I try to share something on my screen.
7924960	7928960	I don't have to say goodbye because I have a meeting tomorrow.
7928960	7929960	Okay.
7929960	7933960	Okay, you have to get up or hope say back back in China.
7933960	7936960	I hope I hope so too.
7936960	7939960	Good seeing you again. Bye bye.
7939960	7941960	Bye bye.
7941960	7945960	Okay, so can everybody see my screen.
7945960	7948960	I can't see your screen I can see your face.
7948960	7950960	You can see me in my screen.
7950960	7954960	I can't I can see your face but I can't see your screen.
7954960	7956960	You can't see my screen.
7956960	7958960	Okay, let's try again.
7958960	7962960	That's what happens every single time I try to share something.
7962960	7963960	I see it.
7963960	7964960	It comes.
7964960	7969960	Yes, there's a very long time of that time lack.
7969960	7972960	Yes.
7972960	7973960	Okay.
7973960	7976960	Well, the speed of light is only so fast.
7976960	7983960	Okay, yes, depending on how many circuits, it has to go through even the speed of light can take time.
7984960	7988960	Okay, so I'm going to finish this really fast.
7988960	7999960	We are going to read Professor Donna Rubins book on causal inference for statistics, social and biomedical sciences, the end introduction.
7999960	8004960	This will be a, this is a very classical book to learn about causal inference.
8004960	8009960	So the reading club will start next Sunday every morning.
8009960	8018960	And then we will have students and also scholars sharing the contents of each chapter every single week.
8018960	8024960	And then we are also having the coding session to help to replicate the studies in the book.
8024960	8027960	So, on the right is the QR code.
8027960	8032960	So if you're interested, please register through the QR code on the right.
8032960	8035960	And again, thank you very much for ruby.
8035960	8036960	Okay.
8036960	8038960	I'm going to use Chinese for a moment.
8038960	8040960	This is our background.
8040960	8041960	It's really ruby.
8041960	8043960	This book has a reading club.
8043960	8044960	We call it English Science.
8044960	8046960	The reading club is translated by English.
8046960	8051960	And then we will, if you're interested, you can scan the QR code on the right.
8051960	8058960	And then come to our reading club to participate in our new series of English teaching.
8058960	8061960	Okay, so that's all for tonight.
8061960	8066960	Thank you so much. Stay safe and have a good day.
8066960	8070960	Thank you very much. And again, thanks for the invitation.
