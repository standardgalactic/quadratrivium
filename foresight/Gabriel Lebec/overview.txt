Checking Gabriel Lebec/A Flock of Functions： Combinators, Lambda Calculus, & Church Encodings in JS - Part II.txt
1. **Introduction to Lambda Calculus**: Lambda calculus is a formal system for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application, which doesn't rely on any specific programming language. It was developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s and laid the foundation for functional programming languages.

2. **Church Encodings**: Lambda calculus can encode data types using functions. For example, natural numbers can be encoded using a series of function applications (Church numerals), propositions can be encoded as functions, and lists can be encoded as recursive function applications.

3. **Church Booleans**: True is a function that applies to any input and returns the input itself (`I = λx. x`), while False is a function that always returns false (`K = λx. K`). The `if-then-else` construct can be simulated using these Church Booleans.

4. **Church Pairs**: A pair in lambda calculus consists of two functions, a head and a tail (`fst` and `snd`), which can encode ordered pairs or lists. The concept of a pair is used to build more complex data structures like lists.

5. **Function Composition**: Composing functions involves taking the output of one function and passing it as the input to another. This can be visualized using the concept of "birds" in lambda calculus, where `duck` represents function composition (`duck x y = (x z) z y`), `seagull` represents the composition of two functions (`seagull f g x = f (g x)`), and `blackbird` is the composition of composition itself (`blackbird f g x = f (g f) (g x)`).

6. **Infinite Lists**: By recursively applying pairs, one can create infinite lists. However, this becomes impractical for large numbers due to the need for an infinite number of function applications.

7. **Real-World Applications**: While lambda calculus is a foundational concept, practical functional programming languages take shortcuts and use hardware-based math for performance reasons. Nevertheless, they retain the essence of lambda calculus in their design.

8. **Conclusion**: Understanding lambda calculus can enhance one's grasp of functional programming concepts like currying, partial function application, higher order functions, and combinators. It's not strictly necessary for programming, but it can be intellectually stimulating and provide a deeper understanding of the principles behind functional languages.
