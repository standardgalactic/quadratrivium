1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Getting the roof trusses into a building is a satisfying milestone.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You are really making progress.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can see the shape of the finished building,

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but if it goes wrong, it goes very wrong.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The erection trusses can be hazardous,

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and any collapse can be expensive to fix,

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and it takes time and money to put right.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And most of all, people can be injured.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
There's been some guys go off overhangs,

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and another guy who went through some trusses

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
who leaned on a truss that wasn't nailed off properly

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and went down through and landed on the ground,

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and he ended up fairly badly injured.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Until recently, there has been no specific

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
practical guide available to assist you erection trusses safely.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now there is.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This industry safety standard provides practical assistance

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
for principal contractors,

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the people who erection trusses,

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
suppliers of trusses, crane operators,

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
owner builders, and other building contractors.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It is a guide that has been developed by builders

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and roofers and manufacturers,

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and is based on the best advice possible.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Coming up with a framework,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
or a set of guidelines for frame and carbonists to work with him,

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and a practical framework,

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
so we actually have a greater chance

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
of actually trying to achieve compliance.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a balance between what the regulators would want

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
for precise, absolutely safe,

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
no one could possibly get injured,

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and the practicalities of installing trusses in a fashion

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
that won't cost the earth.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So you've got to work that balance in between speed and safety,

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and I think the code forms a reasonably happy medium

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
between the two, if you like.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The Occupational Health and Safety legislation

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
requires us to control risks to health and safety.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The safety standard is all about managing risks

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
when we erect trusses.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If we follow this industry safety standard,

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
we can comply with the law.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The basic aim of this video, based on this standard,

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is to show you how to erect trusses safely, every time.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The idea is to identify the risks

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and manage them so that everyone is safe all the time,

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and so everyone goes home every day.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Simple to say, but hard to do.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Looking at a safer way of working at heights is really important

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
because the more we look at that,

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the more we find better ways of doing things.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hence, we can reduce the number of injuries and fatalities,

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and at the end of the day,

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
like you see, every worker is able to go home to their family.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If we really want to make sure we safely erect trusses,

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
we have to go back in time.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Like most important issues in construction,

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
success ultimately comes down to planning.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A critical part of planning is communication.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You have to consult properly to construct properly.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The principal contractor should consult with you,

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
the people erecting the trusses,

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
to ensure that work is planned and scheduled

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to minimise disruptions and situations that could affect safety.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I've been building for 34 years,

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
in that 34 years I've never had a fall from a roof.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Because I plan things before I go,

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I make sure I can't fall,

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and I make sure that there is nothing underneath me if I do fall.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
An unstable area is a dangerous area.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You should discuss the loading and unloading sequence

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
of the trusses at the factory and on site.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This can have a big impact on reducing manual handling risks.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Our safety standard, like with a lot of current legislation,

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
puts a lot of focus on planning.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Planning the activity from a get-go.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You should discuss the size and type of crane required

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
to lift the trusses.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And you should discuss the access and safe positioning

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
of the crane and whether you need a doger.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Discuss the perimeter scaffolding you need on site.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Discuss the weather.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Will it change the site conditions?

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Discuss the manual handling risks.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are there unusual, heavy or awkward frames or trusses?

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is there difficult access?

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There is risk on all building sites.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So you've got to minimise the risk.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So you get on site, show what the risks are,

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
point them out to your workers so they know where the hazards are,

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
where the risks are, so you're minimising your effect.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If you go on site and the fellas don't know

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
there's hazards or risks there,

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
they'll go in that area.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
One of the best ways to work safe

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
is to make sure everyone has had the right training.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So before starting work, everyone erecting trusses

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
must have done basic training.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Everyone must have completed OHS

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
general induction for construction work.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You have to have completed a work activity induction

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and you have to complete a site-specific induction.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And you have to consult with the people erecting the trusses

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
in preparing the safe work method statement.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The place where you are going to work needs to be assessed.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Every site is different, so every site assessment will be different.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Different hazards and different solutions.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The safety standard recommends you assess each work site.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The principal contractor and the people erecting trusses

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
must undertake a site risk assessment

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
prior to commencing work.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And all significant hazards must be identified, assessed and controlled.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Site hazards include such things as high work areas,

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
heavy or difficult loads,

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
electric power, sun, heat, rain, slippery surfaces, power tools and so on.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You search the site for the hazards

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and there are usually quite a few.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The next step is to work out which of the hazards

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
pose the greatest risk.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
One of the biggest hazards in erecting roof trusses

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
is that you have to work at heights.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It may only be a few metres, but a fall from that height can kill you.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That is a hazard.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And because you are erecting heavy trusses on top of the walls a lot of the time,

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the risk is high.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now you have to work out what you are going to do

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
to reduce the risk of those hazards being a problem.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can reduce the risk by reducing the number of people

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
who work at heights.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That is risk management.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Identify on the hazard,

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
assessing the risk and controlling the hazard.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We have to make sure all our plant and equipment

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is working properly and is used safely.

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We have to examine our electrical plant,

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
ladders and ramps, power tools including

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
pneumatic tools, cranes,

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
scaffolding and roof edge protection.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Preparation.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You have checked that everyone has training

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and you have identified the hazards on each work site

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and worked out how to assess and control the hazards.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And thirdly, you have made sure that the plant and equipment

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
is working properly and is used safely.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All this before we live to trust.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Good planning is a powerful tool for safety.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It only takes one mistake and you have a catastrophe.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can use several safe methods to erect roof trusses.

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If the size, weight and positioning of the roof trusses

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
pose a risk to health and safety,

152
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
then a crane with a certificated operator must be used.

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The first method is to use a crane

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
if the erection height is too great

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
or trusses too large for manual handling.

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The trusses must be craned into position,

157
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
laid flat and suitably supported prior to erection.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Where trusses cannot be self-supporting,

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
use temporary props or internal walls for support.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You must ensure that all wall frames

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
are sufficiently braced to withstand loads during construction.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You can lift the trusses by hand if they are lighter

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
or the lift is lower.

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Separate the smaller trusses for single-storey roofs from the pack.

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Lift them individually into position along the top plates.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
If the truss needs to be repositioned,

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
you should do this from below to avoid working at heights.

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The trusses are in position.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Now comes the crucial phase of erecting them,

170
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and these are the recommended methods of erecting trusses.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The critical stage is erecting the first two trusses.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Think it through first.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Erect the first truss at the location specified by the roof manufacturer.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Now you can erect, fix and brace the first and second truss in several ways.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
One method is to use a crane to lift and position trusses.

176
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Set up an appropriate working platform,

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
no greater than two metres from the floor at each end,

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
where the truss is to be fixed to the top plate,

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
or use a ladder.

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If a perimeter scaffold system is installed,

181
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
work from the outside.

182
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Fix temporary braces to solid fixing points,

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
ready for connection to the truss.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The braces can be timber,

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
of adequate size and length, fixed by nails.

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Guide the first truss into position while supported by the crane.

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Use a minimum of two people, one at each end,

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
to fix the truss to top plates and to the temporary braces.

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
At this point, the first truss should be in a stable condition.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Erect the second truss using the same procedure,

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
temporarily brace the second truss to the first truss.

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Another method is to lift the trusses into position manually.

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Set up an appropriate working platform,

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
no greater than two metres from the floor level,

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
at each end, where the truss is to be fixed to the top plate,

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
or use a ladder.

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If a perimeter scaffold system is installed,

198
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
this work can be done from the outside.

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Now, fix temporary braces to solid fixing points,

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
ready for connection to the truss.

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The braces can be timber, of adequate size and length, fixed by nails.

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Fix skid blocks to the top plate, at first truss position,

203
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
to prevent the truss from slipping during standing.

204
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Use a minimum of two people, one at each end,

205
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
to stand the first truss.

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
A third person may be required at mid-span

207
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
to assist in stabilising a long-span truss.

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Additional roof trusses are not to be erected

209
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
unless the prescribed fixing, racing,

210
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and any additional support requirements

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
have been undertaken for the first and second truss.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Each subsequent roof truss is placed,

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
with each end of the truss controlled by a person

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
on the working platform or ladder.

215
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
A third person at the apex may be required to assist.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Each subsequent roof truss is fixed

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and braced according to the manufacturer's specifications,

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
using safe methods for working at heights.

219
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Temporary ties or bracing for roof truss erection

220
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
should be fixed according to Australian standard AS4440,

221
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
installation of nail-plated timber roof trusses.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This standard requires that temporary ties be used

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
on the top cords at spacings no greater than 3 metres

224
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and at spacings no greater than 4 metres on the bottom cord.

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If the person erecting trusses is to be supported

226
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
by the bottom cords of the roof trusses,

227
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
the ties or bracing must be no more than 3 metres apart.

228
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
All bracing and fixing should take into consideration

229
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
or impose loads during the course of construction.

230
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
As such, flat strapping, or an equivalent,

231
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
or trimmers nailed to the face of trusses,

232
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
where the nailing is from the outer face of the truss,

233
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
must not be used.

234
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We should use safe work methods to erect

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
gable roof assembly and verge truss assembly.

236
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Diminishing truss, verge truss, verge trimmers,

237
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
gable studs, or droppers.

238
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Where practical, elements of the roof structure

239
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
should be pre-assembled on the ground as a complete unit

240
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and lifted onto the supporting structure.

241
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Go to boots, hangers, and the like should be installed

242
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to the manufacturer's specifications

243
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
prior to working in the truss space.

244
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:58,000
MUSIC

245
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:08,000
MUSIC

246
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There are many serious hazards working at heights.

247
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This is probably the most important message of the safety standard.

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
To erect trusses, you have to work at heights.

249
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The main thrust of the safety standard is to allow erectors

250
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
to walk the trusses under controlled conditions.

251
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
When trusses are erected at up to 600 millimetre centres,

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
you can, under controlled conditions,

253
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
use the bottom cords of erected and braced trusses

254
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
as access and fore protection.

255
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
At no time is any person to stand on

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
or work from an external wall top plate

257
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
without suitable fore protection.

258
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You can use trusses, but a no-go zone applies.

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
No one can work in the area of the erected framing

260
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
where the height from the top of the bottom cord

261
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
to the top of the top cord is less than 900 mills.

262
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
No one can work within 1.2 metres of the outside wall top plate.

263
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If you're any closer than 1200,

264
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
when you fall, you pass your waist

265
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
and you'll end up going straight over the roof.

266
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So always work 1200 back off the plate,

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
which is a zone where if you fall,

268
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
everyone's from feet to waist is about 1200.

269
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So you will not go straight over.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It is a catch zone where you grab hold of the plate

271
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
or land on the plate and save yourself.

272
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Staying in a position where you can't fall out of the building

273
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
or can't fall through into the building

274
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
is the key of the no-go zone.

275
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
To manage the risk of falls,

276
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
you have to follow the following conditions.

277
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Have the trusses braced at a maximum of 3 metres.

278
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You have to be a competent person,

279
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
fully trained to walk the trusses.

280
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You have to have suitable footwear

281
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
that provides a good foothold.

282
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You need to be supervised by a competent person

283
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
in the erection team.

284
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The bottom cord has to be checked for defects.

285
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Erecting trusses is different from a lot of other work

286
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
in construction,

287
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
but the risk of falling is ever-present

288
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and has to be managed.

289
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This way of using the trusses for fall protection

290
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
is practical, but you have to follow the guidelines

291
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
to make it safe.

292
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Some trusses are tall and you have to work near the top.

293
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If the apex or other high bracing points

294
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
cannot be reached,

295
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
use whaling plates to reach the apex or high points.

296
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Fix whaling plates for standing

297
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
or supporting temporary work platforms

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
at the appropriate height.

299
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The whaling plate should be fixed to the face of the truss

300
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
according to the manufacturer's recommendations

301
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
to ensure the load is transferred to the bottom cord.

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The whaling plate should be timber

303
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
of 70 by 35mm F5

304
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
or equivalent

305
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
to a maximum of 1500mm long.

306
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Fixed at each end by a minimum of 265mm

307
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
by 3.15mm nails.

308
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
If we are using ladders for access,

309
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
they should have non-slip feet

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and be secured against displacement.

311
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There should be a safe landing place

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
when stepping off the ladder,

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and the top of the ladder should extend

314
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
1 metre above the landing place.

315
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You can use timber railings

316
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
installed at the point of manufacture.

317
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You can install temporary studs.

318
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Temporary timber handrails should be checked

319
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
for their quality and their effectiveness

320
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
to prevent falls.

321
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We can use scaffolding

322
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
as good edge protection on low pitched roofs,

323
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
providing the guard rails of the scaffolding

324
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
extend at least 900mm above the roof.

325
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Or scaffolding over 4 metres

326
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
needs to be constructed by a qualified scaffolder

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and comply with standards.

328
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The first floor perimeter edge protection

329
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
must not be removed until all openings

330
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and penetrations are otherwise protected.

331
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Temporary timber handrails should be checked

332
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
for their quality and their effectiveness

333
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
to prevent falls.

334
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Where a void exists,

335
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
no one is to work on the first floor or above

336
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
unless a void protection system is installed.

337
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
If you want to be safe all the time,

338
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
everyone has to be trained and qualified

339
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and consulted.

340
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You're going to rely on each other.

341
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Others rely on you.

342
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You have to know what you're doing.

343
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So, you all need training and qualifications.

344
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Manual handling heavy loads around building sites

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
can affect our working lives.

346
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And it shouldn't.

347
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You should be able to do our work and stay safe.

348
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So, what should we do about eliminating

349
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
or reducing the hazards of manual handling?

350
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Like everything else, if we want to work safe,

351
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
we have to think and we have to plan.

352
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The best thing we can do is to avoid manual handling entirely.

353
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Take an example.

354
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We have to erect frames.

355
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Think about mechanization and using handling aids.

356
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
For example, we could use a crane.

357
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It may seem obvious,

358
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
but that is the best way to eliminate

359
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
the risk of manual handling injuries.

360
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Use machines.

361
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You can use a checklist to assess

362
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
the risk of manual handling injury.

363
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We might find the risk of manual handling injury

364
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
is greater if any of these issues are present.

365
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The tasks, do they involve

366
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
holding loads away from the body,

367
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
twisting, stooping or reaching upwards,

368
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
large vertical movement,

369
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
long carrying distances,

370
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
generous pushing or pulling,

371
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
repetitive handling,

372
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
insufficient rest or recovery time,

373
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
a work rate imposed by a process.

374
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
We might have assessed

375
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
that there is a risk of manual handling injury.

376
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So, what can we do to control the risk?

377
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
How can you make the work safer and easier?

378
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You can make the load lighter or less bulky,

379
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
easier to grasp, more stable,

380
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
less damaging to hold.

381
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We are all at risk of manual handling injuries.

382
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And they can be disabling,

383
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
painful and just plain inconvenient.

384
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But we can take control

385
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
by working smart and planning

386
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and good investment.

387
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We can eliminate manual handling injuries.

388
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Employers have to provide

389
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
personal protective equipment

390
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
so that they can be used

391
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Employers have to provide personal protective equipment

392
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and workers have to use the equipment.

393
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That includes you if you're self-employed.

394
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The PPE requirements for working on site

395
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
are pretty generic.

396
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Sunshine exposure to the elements,

397
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
that sort of stuff is standard

398
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and working with power tools, electricity,

399
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
things that cut timber or nails into them.

400
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Again, you have to use the PPE required.

401
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There are four areas of personal protective equipment

402
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
to consider using it.

403
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You may use safety harnesses,

404
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
you need appropriate footwear

405
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
such as rubber sold shoes

406
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
with non-slip tread

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
with or without steel caps.

408
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You should use eye protection

409
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and you can consider using hearing protection.

410
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
One of the long-term hazards

411
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
is exposure to the sun.

412
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You should protect yourself every time you work outside.

413
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
This means sunscreen, hats

414
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and covers for your legs and arms.

415
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Clothing should be comfortable

416
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and not snag.

417
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Or personal protective equipment

418
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
should be regularly inspected

419
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and replaced where necessary.

420
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
In certain situations

421
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
the spacing of the trust may exceed

422
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
600mm centres

423
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
in which case other fore protection must be provided.

424
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You can use fore protection including

425
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
mobile scaffolding systems

426
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
compliant with Australian standard

427
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
AS1576 scaffolding Part 1

428
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
general requirements

429
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and Part 3

430
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
prefabricated and tube and coupler scaffolding

431
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
and Australian standard

432
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
AS4576

433
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
guidelines for scaffolding.

434
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You can use mesh or netting

435
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
or fencing and handrails

436
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
with adjacent trusses

437
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
installed to the manufacturer's specifications.

438
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You can use elevating platforms

439
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
including motorised single person lift platforms

440
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
compliant with Australian standard

441
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
AS14183.10

442
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The people who wrote the safety standard

443
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
have provided a useful checklist.

444
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
If you ask yourself these questions

445
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
honestly and take the appropriate action

446
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
you will be managing safety on your job.

447
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
A lot of questions were raised about

448
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
the time that would take

449
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
to do a lot of these things in a certain fashion.

450
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It seems that working with industry

451
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
has helped in this manner

452
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
allowing to provide practical guidance

453
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
that is actually realistic

454
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
in safe election trustee.

455
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
This way it uniforms the whole of Australia

456
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and everyone knows the standard practice.

457
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The essence of using the code right

458
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
means that the individual can do their job

459
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
within a good time frame,

460
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
make the money they need to make

461
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and still come home at the end of the day.

462
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Getting the roof trusses into a building

463
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
is a satisfied milestone.

464
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The critical thing is to do it safely

465
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and efficiently.

466
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
If you are organised you'll save money

467
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
and time and possibly a life.

468
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And that is worth all the thinking

469
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and all the effort.
