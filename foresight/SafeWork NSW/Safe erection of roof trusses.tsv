30000	36000	Getting the roof trusses into a building is a satisfying milestone.
36000	38000	You are really making progress.
38000	41000	You can see the shape of the finished building,
41000	44000	but if it goes wrong, it goes very wrong.
46000	48000	The erection trusses can be hazardous,
48000	51000	and any collapse can be expensive to fix,
51000	54000	and it takes time and money to put right.
54000	56000	And most of all, people can be injured.
56000	59000	There's been some guys go off overhangs,
59000	61000	and another guy who went through some trusses
61000	63000	who leaned on a truss that wasn't nailed off properly
63000	65000	and went down through and landed on the ground,
65000	67000	and he ended up fairly badly injured.
69000	72000	Until recently, there has been no specific
72000	76000	practical guide available to assist you erection trusses safely.
76000	78000	Now there is.
78000	82000	This industry safety standard provides practical assistance
82000	84000	for principal contractors,
84000	86000	the people who erection trusses,
86000	89000	suppliers of trusses, crane operators,
89000	93000	owner builders, and other building contractors.
93000	96000	It is a guide that has been developed by builders
96000	99000	and roofers and manufacturers,
99000	102000	and is based on the best advice possible.
102000	104000	Coming up with a framework,
104000	107000	or a set of guidelines for frame and carbonists to work with him,
107000	109000	and a practical framework,
109000	113000	so we actually have a greater chance
113000	117000	of actually trying to achieve compliance.
117000	120000	It's a balance between what the regulators would want
120000	122000	for precise, absolutely safe,
122000	124000	no one could possibly get injured,
124000	127000	and the practicalities of installing trusses in a fashion
127000	129000	that won't cost the earth.
129000	132000	So you've got to work that balance in between speed and safety,
132000	136000	and I think the code forms a reasonably happy medium
136000	138000	between the two, if you like.
139000	142000	The Occupational Health and Safety legislation
142000	146000	requires us to control risks to health and safety.
146000	149000	The safety standard is all about managing risks
149000	151000	when we erect trusses.
151000	153000	If we follow this industry safety standard,
153000	155000	we can comply with the law.
155000	159000	The basic aim of this video, based on this standard,
159000	163000	is to show you how to erect trusses safely, every time.
163000	166000	The idea is to identify the risks
166000	169000	and manage them so that everyone is safe all the time,
169000	172000	and so everyone goes home every day.
172000	175000	Simple to say, but hard to do.
175000	181000	Looking at a safer way of working at heights is really important
181000	183000	because the more we look at that,
183000	185000	the more we find better ways of doing things.
185000	189000	Hence, we can reduce the number of injuries and fatalities,
189000	191000	and at the end of the day,
191000	195000	like you see, every worker is able to go home to their family.
204000	207000	If we really want to make sure we safely erect trusses,
207000	209000	we have to go back in time.
214000	216000	Like most important issues in construction,
216000	220000	success ultimately comes down to planning.
222000	226000	A critical part of planning is communication.
226000	230000	You have to consult properly to construct properly.
234000	237000	The principal contractor should consult with you,
237000	239000	the people erecting the trusses,
239000	242000	to ensure that work is planned and scheduled
242000	247000	to minimise disruptions and situations that could affect safety.
247000	249000	I've been building for 34 years,
249000	252000	in that 34 years I've never had a fall from a roof.
252000	255000	Because I plan things before I go,
255000	257000	I make sure I can't fall,
257000	260000	and I make sure that there is nothing underneath me if I do fall.
260000	263000	An unstable area is a dangerous area.
263000	266000	You should discuss the loading and unloading sequence
266000	270000	of the trusses at the factory and on site.
270000	274000	This can have a big impact on reducing manual handling risks.
274000	277000	Our safety standard, like with a lot of current legislation,
277000	279000	puts a lot of focus on planning.
279000	282000	Planning the activity from a get-go.
283000	286000	You should discuss the size and type of crane required
286000	288000	to lift the trusses.
289000	292000	And you should discuss the access and safe positioning
292000	295000	of the crane and whether you need a doger.
296000	299000	Discuss the perimeter scaffolding you need on site.
299000	301000	Discuss the weather.
301000	303000	Will it change the site conditions?
304000	307000	Discuss the manual handling risks.
307000	311000	Are there unusual, heavy or awkward frames or trusses?
311000	313000	Is there difficult access?
313000	315000	There is risk on all building sites.
315000	317000	So you've got to minimise the risk.
317000	321000	So you get on site, show what the risks are,
321000	324000	point them out to your workers so they know where the hazards are,
324000	327000	where the risks are, so you're minimising your effect.
327000	329000	If you go on site and the fellas don't know
329000	331000	there's hazards or risks there,
332000	334000	they'll go in that area.
341000	343000	One of the best ways to work safe
343000	346000	is to make sure everyone has had the right training.
346000	349000	So before starting work, everyone erecting trusses
349000	351000	must have done basic training.
354000	357000	Everyone must have completed OHS
357000	360000	general induction for construction work.
360000	363000	You have to have completed a work activity induction
363000	367000	and you have to complete a site-specific induction.
368000	371000	And you have to consult with the people erecting the trusses
371000	374000	in preparing the safe work method statement.
381000	384000	The place where you are going to work needs to be assessed.
385000	389000	Every site is different, so every site assessment will be different.
390000	393000	Different hazards and different solutions.
396000	399000	The safety standard recommends you assess each work site.
400000	403000	The principal contractor and the people erecting trusses
403000	406000	must undertake a site risk assessment
406000	408000	prior to commencing work.
408000	413000	And all significant hazards must be identified, assessed and controlled.
414000	419000	Site hazards include such things as high work areas,
420000	422000	heavy or difficult loads,
424000	432000	electric power, sun, heat, rain, slippery surfaces, power tools and so on.
433000	435000	You search the site for the hazards
435000	437000	and there are usually quite a few.
437000	440000	The next step is to work out which of the hazards
440000	442000	pose the greatest risk.
443000	446000	One of the biggest hazards in erecting roof trusses
446000	448000	is that you have to work at heights.
448000	451000	It may only be a few metres, but a fall from that height can kill you.
451000	453000	That is a hazard.
453000	456000	And because you are erecting heavy trusses on top of the walls a lot of the time,
456000	458000	the risk is high.
458000	461000	Now you have to work out what you are going to do
461000	464000	to reduce the risk of those hazards being a problem.
465000	468000	You can reduce the risk by reducing the number of people
468000	470000	who work at heights.
470000	472000	That is risk management.
472000	474000	Identify on the hazard,
474000	477000	assessing the risk and controlling the hazard.
480000	483000	We have to make sure all our plant and equipment
483000	486000	is working properly and is used safely.
487000	489000	We have to examine our electrical plant,
489000	492000	ladders and ramps, power tools including
492000	495000	pneumatic tools, cranes,
495000	498000	scaffolding and roof edge protection.
500000	502000	Preparation.
502000	504000	You have checked that everyone has training
504000	507000	and you have identified the hazards on each work site
507000	510000	and worked out how to assess and control the hazards.
510000	513000	And thirdly, you have made sure that the plant and equipment
513000	516000	is working properly and is used safely.
516000	519000	All this before we live to trust.
519000	522000	Good planning is a powerful tool for safety.
522000	525000	It only takes one mistake and you have a catastrophe.
552000	556000	You can use several safe methods to erect roof trusses.
558000	561000	If the size, weight and positioning of the roof trusses
561000	563000	pose a risk to health and safety,
563000	567000	then a crane with a certificated operator must be used.
570000	572000	The first method is to use a crane
572000	574000	if the erection height is too great
574000	578000	or trusses too large for manual handling.
578000	581000	The trusses must be craned into position,
581000	585000	laid flat and suitably supported prior to erection.
586000	589000	Where trusses cannot be self-supporting,
589000	593000	use temporary props or internal walls for support.
594000	596000	You must ensure that all wall frames
596000	600000	are sufficiently braced to withstand loads during construction.
605000	608000	You can lift the trusses by hand if they are lighter
608000	610000	or the lift is lower.
611000	615000	Separate the smaller trusses for single-storey roofs from the pack.
615000	619000	Lift them individually into position along the top plates.
622000	624000	If the truss needs to be repositioned,
624000	628000	you should do this from below to avoid working at heights.
629000	631000	The trusses are in position.
631000	634000	Now comes the crucial phase of erecting them,
634000	638000	and these are the recommended methods of erecting trusses.
642000	646000	The critical stage is erecting the first two trusses.
646000	648000	Think it through first.
648000	653000	Erect the first truss at the location specified by the roof manufacturer.
653000	658000	Now you can erect, fix and brace the first and second truss in several ways.
658000	662000	One method is to use a crane to lift and position trusses.
665000	667000	Set up an appropriate working platform,
667000	671000	no greater than two metres from the floor at each end,
671000	675000	where the truss is to be fixed to the top plate,
675000	677000	or use a ladder.
677000	680000	If a perimeter scaffold system is installed,
680000	682000	work from the outside.
682000	684000	Fix temporary braces to solid fixing points,
684000	687000	ready for connection to the truss.
693000	695000	The braces can be timber,
695000	699000	of adequate size and length, fixed by nails.
702000	706000	Guide the first truss into position while supported by the crane.
706000	709000	Use a minimum of two people, one at each end,
709000	714000	to fix the truss to top plates and to the temporary braces.
714000	719000	At this point, the first truss should be in a stable condition.
719000	722000	Erect the second truss using the same procedure,
723000	727000	temporarily brace the second truss to the first truss.
730000	734000	Another method is to lift the trusses into position manually.
734000	736000	Set up an appropriate working platform,
736000	739000	no greater than two metres from the floor level,
739000	743000	at each end, where the truss is to be fixed to the top plate,
743000	745000	or use a ladder.
745000	748000	If a perimeter scaffold system is installed,
748000	751000	this work can be done from the outside.
751000	755000	Now, fix temporary braces to solid fixing points,
755000	757000	ready for connection to the truss.
757000	762000	The braces can be timber, of adequate size and length, fixed by nails.
763000	767000	Fix skid blocks to the top plate, at first truss position,
767000	771000	to prevent the truss from slipping during standing.
771000	774000	Use a minimum of two people, one at each end,
774000	776000	to stand the first truss.
776000	779000	A third person may be required at mid-span
779000	783000	to assist in stabilising a long-span truss.
785000	788000	Additional roof trusses are not to be erected
788000	791000	unless the prescribed fixing, racing,
791000	793000	and any additional support requirements
793000	797000	have been undertaken for the first and second truss.
798000	801000	Each subsequent roof truss is placed,
801000	804000	with each end of the truss controlled by a person
804000	807000	on the working platform or ladder.
807000	811000	A third person at the apex may be required to assist.
813000	816000	Each subsequent roof truss is fixed
816000	819000	and braced according to the manufacturer's specifications,
819000	823000	using safe methods for working at heights.
831000	834000	Temporary ties or bracing for roof truss erection
834000	839000	should be fixed according to Australian standard AS4440,
839000	843000	installation of nail-plated timber roof trusses.
846000	849000	This standard requires that temporary ties be used
849000	853000	on the top cords at spacings no greater than 3 metres
853000	857000	and at spacings no greater than 4 metres on the bottom cord.
858000	861000	If the person erecting trusses is to be supported
861000	864000	by the bottom cords of the roof trusses,
864000	868000	the ties or bracing must be no more than 3 metres apart.
871000	875000	All bracing and fixing should take into consideration
875000	879000	or impose loads during the course of construction.
879000	883000	As such, flat strapping, or an equivalent,
883000	886000	or trimmers nailed to the face of trusses,
886000	889000	where the nailing is from the outer face of the truss,
889000	891000	must not be used.
893000	896000	We should use safe work methods to erect
896000	899000	gable roof assembly and verge truss assembly.
899000	903000	Diminishing truss, verge truss, verge trimmers,
903000	906000	gable studs, or droppers.
906000	909000	Where practical, elements of the roof structure
909000	913000	should be pre-assembled on the ground as a complete unit
913000	916000	and lifted onto the supporting structure.
920000	923000	Go to boots, hangers, and the like should be installed
923000	926000	to the manufacturer's specifications
926000	929000	prior to working in the truss space.
939000	958000	MUSIC
958000	968000	MUSIC
968000	971000	There are many serious hazards working at heights.
971000	974000	This is probably the most important message of the safety standard.
974000	977000	To erect trusses, you have to work at heights.
977000	980000	The main thrust of the safety standard is to allow erectors
980000	983000	to walk the trusses under controlled conditions.
985000	989000	When trusses are erected at up to 600 millimetre centres,
989000	991000	you can, under controlled conditions,
991000	994000	use the bottom cords of erected and braced trusses
994000	997000	as access and fore protection.
997000	1000000	At no time is any person to stand on
1000000	1003000	or work from an external wall top plate
1003000	1006000	without suitable fore protection.
1008000	1012000	You can use trusses, but a no-go zone applies.
1012000	1015000	No one can work in the area of the erected framing
1015000	1018000	where the height from the top of the bottom cord
1018000	1022000	to the top of the top cord is less than 900 mills.
1022000	1027000	No one can work within 1.2 metres of the outside wall top plate.
1027000	1030000	If you're any closer than 1200,
1030000	1033000	when you fall, you pass your waist
1033000	1035000	and you'll end up going straight over the roof.
1035000	1037000	So always work 1200 back off the plate,
1037000	1039000	which is a zone where if you fall,
1039000	1042000	everyone's from feet to waist is about 1200.
1042000	1044000	So you will not go straight over.
1044000	1046000	It is a catch zone where you grab hold of the plate
1046000	1048000	or land on the plate and save yourself.
1048000	1051000	Staying in a position where you can't fall out of the building
1051000	1053000	or can't fall through into the building
1053000	1055000	is the key of the no-go zone.
1056000	1058000	To manage the risk of falls,
1058000	1061000	you have to follow the following conditions.
1062000	1066000	Have the trusses braced at a maximum of 3 metres.
1066000	1068000	You have to be a competent person,
1068000	1071000	fully trained to walk the trusses.
1071000	1074000	You have to have suitable footwear
1074000	1077000	that provides a good foothold.
1077000	1080000	You need to be supervised by a competent person
1080000	1082000	in the erection team.
1082000	1085000	The bottom cord has to be checked for defects.
1089000	1092000	Erecting trusses is different from a lot of other work
1092000	1094000	in construction,
1094000	1096000	but the risk of falling is ever-present
1096000	1098000	and has to be managed.
1098000	1101000	This way of using the trusses for fall protection
1101000	1104000	is practical, but you have to follow the guidelines
1104000	1106000	to make it safe.
1107000	1110000	Some trusses are tall and you have to work near the top.
1110000	1113000	If the apex or other high bracing points
1113000	1115000	cannot be reached,
1115000	1118000	use whaling plates to reach the apex or high points.
1118000	1120000	Fix whaling plates for standing
1120000	1123000	or supporting temporary work platforms
1123000	1125000	at the appropriate height.
1125000	1128000	The whaling plate should be fixed to the face of the truss
1128000	1131000	according to the manufacturer's recommendations
1131000	1134000	to ensure the load is transferred to the bottom cord.
1135000	1137000	The whaling plate should be timber
1137000	1140000	of 70 by 35mm F5
1140000	1142000	or equivalent
1142000	1145000	to a maximum of 1500mm long.
1146000	1150000	Fixed at each end by a minimum of 265mm
1150000	1153000	by 3.15mm nails.
1160000	1162000	If we are using ladders for access,
1162000	1164000	they should have non-slip feet
1164000	1167000	and be secured against displacement.
1167000	1169000	There should be a safe landing place
1169000	1171000	when stepping off the ladder,
1171000	1173000	and the top of the ladder should extend
1173000	1176000	1 metre above the landing place.
1178000	1180000	You can use timber railings
1180000	1183000	installed at the point of manufacture.
1183000	1185000	You can install temporary studs.
1185000	1187000	Temporary timber handrails should be checked
1187000	1189000	for their quality and their effectiveness
1189000	1191000	to prevent falls.
1193000	1195000	We can use scaffolding
1195000	1198000	as good edge protection on low pitched roofs,
1198000	1200000	providing the guard rails of the scaffolding
1200000	1203000	extend at least 900mm above the roof.
1205000	1207000	Or scaffolding over 4 metres
1207000	1210000	needs to be constructed by a qualified scaffolder
1210000	1212000	and comply with standards.
1213000	1215000	The first floor perimeter edge protection
1215000	1217000	must not be removed until all openings
1217000	1220000	and penetrations are otherwise protected.
1220000	1223000	Temporary timber handrails should be checked
1223000	1225000	for their quality and their effectiveness
1225000	1228000	to prevent falls.
1230000	1232000	Where a void exists,
1232000	1234000	no one is to work on the first floor or above
1234000	1238000	unless a void protection system is installed.
1243000	1245000	If you want to be safe all the time,
1245000	1247000	everyone has to be trained and qualified
1247000	1249000	and consulted.
1249000	1251000	You're going to rely on each other.
1251000	1253000	Others rely on you.
1253000	1255000	You have to know what you're doing.
1255000	1259000	So, you all need training and qualifications.
1262000	1264000	Manual handling heavy loads around building sites
1264000	1266000	can affect our working lives.
1266000	1267000	And it shouldn't.
1267000	1270000	You should be able to do our work and stay safe.
1270000	1272000	So, what should we do about eliminating
1272000	1275000	or reducing the hazards of manual handling?
1275000	1278000	Like everything else, if we want to work safe,
1278000	1281000	we have to think and we have to plan.
1283000	1287000	The best thing we can do is to avoid manual handling entirely.
1287000	1289000	Take an example.
1289000	1291000	We have to erect frames.
1291000	1294000	Think about mechanization and using handling aids.
1294000	1296000	For example, we could use a crane.
1296000	1298000	It may seem obvious,
1298000	1300000	but that is the best way to eliminate
1300000	1302000	the risk of manual handling injuries.
1302000	1304000	Use machines.
1304000	1306000	You can use a checklist to assess
1306000	1308000	the risk of manual handling injury.
1308000	1310000	We might find the risk of manual handling injury
1310000	1313000	is greater if any of these issues are present.
1313000	1315000	The tasks, do they involve
1315000	1317000	holding loads away from the body,
1317000	1320000	twisting, stooping or reaching upwards,
1320000	1322000	large vertical movement,
1322000	1324000	long carrying distances,
1324000	1326000	generous pushing or pulling,
1326000	1328000	repetitive handling,
1328000	1330000	insufficient rest or recovery time,
1330000	1333000	a work rate imposed by a process.
1334000	1336000	We might have assessed
1336000	1339000	that there is a risk of manual handling injury.
1339000	1343000	So, what can we do to control the risk?
1343000	1347000	How can you make the work safer and easier?
1349000	1353000	You can make the load lighter or less bulky,
1353000	1356000	easier to grasp, more stable,
1356000	1359000	less damaging to hold.
1364000	1368000	We are all at risk of manual handling injuries.
1368000	1370000	And they can be disabling,
1370000	1372000	painful and just plain inconvenient.
1372000	1374000	But we can take control
1374000	1376000	by working smart and planning
1376000	1378000	and good investment.
1378000	1381000	We can eliminate manual handling injuries.
1384000	1386000	Employers have to provide
1386000	1388000	personal protective equipment
1388000	1390000	so that they can be used
1391000	1394000	Employers have to provide personal protective equipment
1394000	1396000	and workers have to use the equipment.
1396000	1399000	That includes you if you're self-employed.
1399000	1402000	The PPE requirements for working on site
1402000	1404000	are pretty generic.
1404000	1406000	Sunshine exposure to the elements,
1406000	1408000	that sort of stuff is standard
1408000	1411000	and working with power tools, electricity,
1411000	1414000	things that cut timber or nails into them.
1414000	1416000	Again, you have to use the PPE required.
1416000	1419000	There are four areas of personal protective equipment
1419000	1421000	to consider using it.
1421000	1423000	You may use safety harnesses,
1423000	1425000	you need appropriate footwear
1425000	1427000	such as rubber sold shoes
1427000	1429000	with non-slip tread
1429000	1431000	with or without steel caps.
1431000	1433000	You should use eye protection
1433000	1436000	and you can consider using hearing protection.
1438000	1440000	One of the long-term hazards
1440000	1442000	is exposure to the sun.
1442000	1445000	You should protect yourself every time you work outside.
1445000	1447000	This means sunscreen, hats
1448000	1450000	and covers for your legs and arms.
1450000	1452000	Clothing should be comfortable
1452000	1454000	and not snag.
1454000	1456000	Or personal protective equipment
1456000	1458000	should be regularly inspected
1458000	1460000	and replaced where necessary.
1467000	1469000	In certain situations
1469000	1471000	the spacing of the trust may exceed
1471000	1473000	600mm centres
1473000	1476000	in which case other fore protection must be provided.
1476000	1478000	You can use fore protection including
1478000	1480000	mobile scaffolding systems
1480000	1482000	compliant with Australian standard
1482000	1484000	AS1576 scaffolding Part 1
1484000	1486000	general requirements
1486000	1488000	and Part 3
1488000	1490000	prefabricated and tube and coupler scaffolding
1490000	1492000	and Australian standard
1492000	1494000	AS4576
1494000	1496000	guidelines for scaffolding.
1500000	1502000	You can use mesh or netting
1503000	1505000	or fencing and handrails
1505000	1507000	with adjacent trusses
1507000	1510000	installed to the manufacturer's specifications.
1516000	1518000	You can use elevating platforms
1518000	1520000	including motorised single person lift platforms
1520000	1522000	compliant with Australian standard
1522000	1524000	AS14183.10
1533000	1535000	The people who wrote the safety standard
1535000	1537000	have provided a useful checklist.
1539000	1541000	If you ask yourself these questions
1541000	1544000	honestly and take the appropriate action
1544000	1546000	you will be managing safety on your job.
1546000	1548000	A lot of questions were raised about
1548000	1550000	the time that would take
1550000	1553000	to do a lot of these things in a certain fashion.
1553000	1555000	It seems that working with industry
1555000	1557000	has helped in this manner
1557000	1559000	allowing to provide practical guidance
1559000	1561000	that is actually realistic
1561000	1563000	in safe election trustee.
1563000	1566000	This way it uniforms the whole of Australia
1566000	1569000	and everyone knows the standard practice.
1571000	1573000	The essence of using the code right
1573000	1575000	means that the individual can do their job
1575000	1577000	within a good time frame,
1577000	1578000	make the money they need to make
1578000	1580000	and still come home at the end of the day.
1591000	1595000	Getting the roof trusses into a building
1595000	1597000	is a satisfied milestone.
1597000	1599000	The critical thing is to do it safely
1599000	1601000	and efficiently.
1601000	1603000	If you are organised you'll save money
1603000	1605000	and time and possibly a life.
1605000	1607000	And that is worth all the thinking
1607000	1609000	and all the effort.
