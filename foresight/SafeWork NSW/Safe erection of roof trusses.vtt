00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
Getting the roof trusses into a building is a satisfying milestone.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
You are really making progress.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
You can see the shape of the finished building,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
but if it goes wrong, it goes very wrong.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
The erection trusses can be hazardous,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
and any collapse can be expensive to fix,

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
and it takes time and money to put right.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
And most of all, people can be injured.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
There's been some guys go off overhangs,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
and another guy who went through some trusses

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
who leaned on a truss that wasn't nailed off properly

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
and went down through and landed on the ground,

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
and he ended up fairly badly injured.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Until recently, there has been no specific

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
practical guide available to assist you erection trusses safely.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Now there is.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
This industry safety standard provides practical assistance

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
for principal contractors,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
the people who erection trusses,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
suppliers of trusses, crane operators,

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
owner builders, and other building contractors.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
It is a guide that has been developed by builders

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
and roofers and manufacturers,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
and is based on the best advice possible.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Coming up with a framework,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
or a set of guidelines for frame and carbonists to work with him,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
and a practical framework,

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
so we actually have a greater chance

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
of actually trying to achieve compliance.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
It's a balance between what the regulators would want

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
for precise, absolutely safe,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
no one could possibly get injured,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
and the practicalities of installing trusses in a fashion

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
that won't cost the earth.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
So you've got to work that balance in between speed and safety,

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
and I think the code forms a reasonably happy medium

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
between the two, if you like.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
The Occupational Health and Safety legislation

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
requires us to control risks to health and safety.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
The safety standard is all about managing risks

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
when we erect trusses.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
If we follow this industry safety standard,

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
we can comply with the law.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
The basic aim of this video, based on this standard,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
is to show you how to erect trusses safely, every time.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
The idea is to identify the risks

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
and manage them so that everyone is safe all the time,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
and so everyone goes home every day.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Simple to say, but hard to do.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
Looking at a safer way of working at heights is really important

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
because the more we look at that,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
the more we find better ways of doing things.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
Hence, we can reduce the number of injuries and fatalities,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
and at the end of the day,

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
like you see, every worker is able to go home to their family.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
If we really want to make sure we safely erect trusses,

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
we have to go back in time.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Like most important issues in construction,

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
success ultimately comes down to planning.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
A critical part of planning is communication.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
You have to consult properly to construct properly.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
The principal contractor should consult with you,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
the people erecting the trusses,

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
to ensure that work is planned and scheduled

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
to minimise disruptions and situations that could affect safety.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I've been building for 34 years,

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
in that 34 years I've never had a fall from a roof.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Because I plan things before I go,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
I make sure I can't fall,

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
and I make sure that there is nothing underneath me if I do fall.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
An unstable area is a dangerous area.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
You should discuss the loading and unloading sequence

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
of the trusses at the factory and on site.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
This can have a big impact on reducing manual handling risks.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Our safety standard, like with a lot of current legislation,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
puts a lot of focus on planning.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Planning the activity from a get-go.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
You should discuss the size and type of crane required

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
to lift the trusses.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
And you should discuss the access and safe positioning

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
of the crane and whether you need a doger.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Discuss the perimeter scaffolding you need on site.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Discuss the weather.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Will it change the site conditions?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
Discuss the manual handling risks.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Are there unusual, heavy or awkward frames or trusses?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Is there difficult access?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
There is risk on all building sites.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
So you've got to minimise the risk.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
So you get on site, show what the risks are,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
point them out to your workers so they know where the hazards are,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
where the risks are, so you're minimising your effect.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
If you go on site and the fellas don't know

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
there's hazards or risks there,

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
they'll go in that area.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
One of the best ways to work safe

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
is to make sure everyone has had the right training.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
So before starting work, everyone erecting trusses

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
must have done basic training.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Everyone must have completed OHS

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
general induction for construction work.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
You have to have completed a work activity induction

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
and you have to complete a site-specific induction.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
And you have to consult with the people erecting the trusses

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
in preparing the safe work method statement.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
The place where you are going to work needs to be assessed.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Every site is different, so every site assessment will be different.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Different hazards and different solutions.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
The safety standard recommends you assess each work site.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
The principal contractor and the people erecting trusses

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
must undertake a site risk assessment

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
prior to commencing work.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
And all significant hazards must be identified, assessed and controlled.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Site hazards include such things as high work areas,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
heavy or difficult loads,

07:04.000 --> 07:12.000
electric power, sun, heat, rain, slippery surfaces, power tools and so on.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
You search the site for the hazards

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
and there are usually quite a few.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
The next step is to work out which of the hazards

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
pose the greatest risk.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
One of the biggest hazards in erecting roof trusses

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
is that you have to work at heights.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
It may only be a few metres, but a fall from that height can kill you.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
That is a hazard.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
And because you are erecting heavy trusses on top of the walls a lot of the time,

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
the risk is high.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Now you have to work out what you are going to do

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
to reduce the risk of those hazards being a problem.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
You can reduce the risk by reducing the number of people

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
who work at heights.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
That is risk management.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Identify on the hazard,

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
assessing the risk and controlling the hazard.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
We have to make sure all our plant and equipment

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
is working properly and is used safely.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
We have to examine our electrical plant,

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
ladders and ramps, power tools including

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
pneumatic tools, cranes,

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
scaffolding and roof edge protection.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Preparation.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
You have checked that everyone has training

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
and you have identified the hazards on each work site

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
and worked out how to assess and control the hazards.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
And thirdly, you have made sure that the plant and equipment

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
is working properly and is used safely.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
All this before we live to trust.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Good planning is a powerful tool for safety.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
It only takes one mistake and you have a catastrophe.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
You can use several safe methods to erect roof trusses.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
If the size, weight and positioning of the roof trusses

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
pose a risk to health and safety,

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
then a crane with a certificated operator must be used.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
The first method is to use a crane

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
if the erection height is too great

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
or trusses too large for manual handling.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
The trusses must be craned into position,

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
laid flat and suitably supported prior to erection.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Where trusses cannot be self-supporting,

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
use temporary props or internal walls for support.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
You must ensure that all wall frames

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
are sufficiently braced to withstand loads during construction.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
You can lift the trusses by hand if they are lighter

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
or the lift is lower.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.000
Separate the smaller trusses for single-storey roofs from the pack.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Lift them individually into position along the top plates.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
If the truss needs to be repositioned,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
you should do this from below to avoid working at heights.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
The trusses are in position.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
Now comes the crucial phase of erecting them,

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
and these are the recommended methods of erecting trusses.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
The critical stage is erecting the first two trusses.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Think it through first.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
Erect the first truss at the location specified by the roof manufacturer.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
Now you can erect, fix and brace the first and second truss in several ways.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
One method is to use a crane to lift and position trusses.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Set up an appropriate working platform,

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
no greater than two metres from the floor at each end,

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
where the truss is to be fixed to the top plate,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
or use a ladder.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
If a perimeter scaffold system is installed,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
work from the outside.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Fix temporary braces to solid fixing points,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
ready for connection to the truss.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
The braces can be timber,

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
of adequate size and length, fixed by nails.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Guide the first truss into position while supported by the crane.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Use a minimum of two people, one at each end,

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
to fix the truss to top plates and to the temporary braces.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
At this point, the first truss should be in a stable condition.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Erect the second truss using the same procedure,

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
temporarily brace the second truss to the first truss.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
Another method is to lift the trusses into position manually.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Set up an appropriate working platform,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
no greater than two metres from the floor level,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
at each end, where the truss is to be fixed to the top plate,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
or use a ladder.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
If a perimeter scaffold system is installed,

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
this work can be done from the outside.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
Now, fix temporary braces to solid fixing points,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
ready for connection to the truss.

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
The braces can be timber, of adequate size and length, fixed by nails.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Fix skid blocks to the top plate, at first truss position,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
to prevent the truss from slipping during standing.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Use a minimum of two people, one at each end,

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
to stand the first truss.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
A third person may be required at mid-span

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
to assist in stabilising a long-span truss.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Additional roof trusses are not to be erected

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
unless the prescribed fixing, racing,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
and any additional support requirements

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
have been undertaken for the first and second truss.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Each subsequent roof truss is placed,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
with each end of the truss controlled by a person

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
on the working platform or ladder.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
A third person at the apex may be required to assist.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Each subsequent roof truss is fixed

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
and braced according to the manufacturer's specifications,

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
using safe methods for working at heights.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
Temporary ties or bracing for roof truss erection

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
should be fixed according to Australian standard AS4440,

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
installation of nail-plated timber roof trusses.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
This standard requires that temporary ties be used

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
on the top cords at spacings no greater than 3 metres

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
and at spacings no greater than 4 metres on the bottom cord.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
If the person erecting trusses is to be supported

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
by the bottom cords of the roof trusses,

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
the ties or bracing must be no more than 3 metres apart.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
All bracing and fixing should take into consideration

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
or impose loads during the course of construction.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
As such, flat strapping, or an equivalent,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
or trimmers nailed to the face of trusses,

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
where the nailing is from the outer face of the truss,

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
must not be used.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
We should use safe work methods to erect

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
gable roof assembly and verge truss assembly.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Diminishing truss, verge truss, verge trimmers,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
gable studs, or droppers.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Where practical, elements of the roof structure

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
should be pre-assembled on the ground as a complete unit

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
and lifted onto the supporting structure.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
Go to boots, hangers, and the like should be installed

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
to the manufacturer's specifications

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
prior to working in the truss space.

15:39.000 --> 15:58.000
MUSIC

15:58.000 --> 16:08.000
MUSIC

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
There are many serious hazards working at heights.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
This is probably the most important message of the safety standard.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
To erect trusses, you have to work at heights.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
The main thrust of the safety standard is to allow erectors

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
to walk the trusses under controlled conditions.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
When trusses are erected at up to 600 millimetre centres,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
you can, under controlled conditions,

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
use the bottom cords of erected and braced trusses

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
as access and fore protection.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
At no time is any person to stand on

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
or work from an external wall top plate

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
without suitable fore protection.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
You can use trusses, but a no-go zone applies.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
No one can work in the area of the erected framing

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
where the height from the top of the bottom cord

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
to the top of the top cord is less than 900 mills.

17:02.000 --> 17:07.000
No one can work within 1.2 metres of the outside wall top plate.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
If you're any closer than 1200,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
when you fall, you pass your waist

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
and you'll end up going straight over the roof.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
So always work 1200 back off the plate,

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
which is a zone where if you fall,

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
everyone's from feet to waist is about 1200.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
So you will not go straight over.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
It is a catch zone where you grab hold of the plate

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
or land on the plate and save yourself.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Staying in a position where you can't fall out of the building

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
or can't fall through into the building

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
is the key of the no-go zone.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
To manage the risk of falls,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
you have to follow the following conditions.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Have the trusses braced at a maximum of 3 metres.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
You have to be a competent person,

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
fully trained to walk the trusses.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
You have to have suitable footwear

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
that provides a good foothold.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
You need to be supervised by a competent person

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
in the erection team.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
The bottom cord has to be checked for defects.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Erecting trusses is different from a lot of other work

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
in construction,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
but the risk of falling is ever-present

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
and has to be managed.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
This way of using the trusses for fall protection

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
is practical, but you have to follow the guidelines

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
to make it safe.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Some trusses are tall and you have to work near the top.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
If the apex or other high bracing points

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
cannot be reached,

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
use whaling plates to reach the apex or high points.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Fix whaling plates for standing

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
or supporting temporary work platforms

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
at the appropriate height.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
The whaling plate should be fixed to the face of the truss

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
according to the manufacturer's recommendations

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
to ensure the load is transferred to the bottom cord.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
The whaling plate should be timber

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
of 70 by 35mm F5

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
or equivalent

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
to a maximum of 1500mm long.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Fixed at each end by a minimum of 265mm

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
by 3.15mm nails.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
If we are using ladders for access,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
they should have non-slip feet

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
and be secured against displacement.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
There should be a safe landing place

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
when stepping off the ladder,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
and the top of the ladder should extend

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
1 metre above the landing place.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
You can use timber railings

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
installed at the point of manufacture.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
You can install temporary studs.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Temporary timber handrails should be checked

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
for their quality and their effectiveness

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
to prevent falls.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
We can use scaffolding

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
as good edge protection on low pitched roofs,

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
providing the guard rails of the scaffolding

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
extend at least 900mm above the roof.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Or scaffolding over 4 metres

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
needs to be constructed by a qualified scaffolder

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
and comply with standards.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
The first floor perimeter edge protection

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
must not be removed until all openings

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
and penetrations are otherwise protected.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Temporary timber handrails should be checked

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
for their quality and their effectiveness

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
to prevent falls.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Where a void exists,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
no one is to work on the first floor or above

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
unless a void protection system is installed.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
If you want to be safe all the time,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
everyone has to be trained and qualified

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
and consulted.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
You're going to rely on each other.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Others rely on you.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
You have to know what you're doing.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
So, you all need training and qualifications.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Manual handling heavy loads around building sites

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
can affect our working lives.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
And it shouldn't.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
You should be able to do our work and stay safe.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
So, what should we do about eliminating

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
or reducing the hazards of manual handling?

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Like everything else, if we want to work safe,

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
we have to think and we have to plan.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
The best thing we can do is to avoid manual handling entirely.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Take an example.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
We have to erect frames.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Think about mechanization and using handling aids.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
For example, we could use a crane.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
It may seem obvious,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
but that is the best way to eliminate

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
the risk of manual handling injuries.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Use machines.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
You can use a checklist to assess

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
the risk of manual handling injury.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
We might find the risk of manual handling injury

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
is greater if any of these issues are present.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
The tasks, do they involve

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
holding loads away from the body,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
twisting, stooping or reaching upwards,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
large vertical movement,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
long carrying distances,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
generous pushing or pulling,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
repetitive handling,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
insufficient rest or recovery time,

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
a work rate imposed by a process.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
We might have assessed

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
that there is a risk of manual handling injury.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
So, what can we do to control the risk?

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
How can you make the work safer and easier?

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
You can make the load lighter or less bulky,

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
easier to grasp, more stable,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
less damaging to hold.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
We are all at risk of manual handling injuries.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
And they can be disabling,

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
painful and just plain inconvenient.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
But we can take control

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
by working smart and planning

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and good investment.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
We can eliminate manual handling injuries.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Employers have to provide

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
personal protective equipment

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
so that they can be used

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
Employers have to provide personal protective equipment

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
and workers have to use the equipment.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
That includes you if you're self-employed.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
The PPE requirements for working on site

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
are pretty generic.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Sunshine exposure to the elements,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
that sort of stuff is standard

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
and working with power tools, electricity,

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
things that cut timber or nails into them.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Again, you have to use the PPE required.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
There are four areas of personal protective equipment

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
to consider using it.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
You may use safety harnesses,

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
you need appropriate footwear

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
such as rubber sold shoes

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
with non-slip tread

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
with or without steel caps.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
You should use eye protection

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
and you can consider using hearing protection.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
One of the long-term hazards

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
is exposure to the sun.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
You should protect yourself every time you work outside.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
This means sunscreen, hats

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
and covers for your legs and arms.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Clothing should be comfortable

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
and not snag.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Or personal protective equipment

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
should be regularly inspected

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
and replaced where necessary.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
In certain situations

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
the spacing of the trust may exceed

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
600mm centres

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
in which case other fore protection must be provided.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
You can use fore protection including

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
mobile scaffolding systems

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
compliant with Australian standard

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
AS1576 scaffolding Part 1

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
general requirements

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
and Part 3

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
prefabricated and tube and coupler scaffolding

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
and Australian standard

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
AS4576

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
guidelines for scaffolding.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
You can use mesh or netting

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
or fencing and handrails

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
with adjacent trusses

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
installed to the manufacturer's specifications.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
You can use elevating platforms

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
including motorised single person lift platforms

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
compliant with Australian standard

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
AS14183.10

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
The people who wrote the safety standard

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
have provided a useful checklist.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
If you ask yourself these questions

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
honestly and take the appropriate action

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
you will be managing safety on your job.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
A lot of questions were raised about

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
the time that would take

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
to do a lot of these things in a certain fashion.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
It seems that working with industry

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
has helped in this manner

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
allowing to provide practical guidance

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
that is actually realistic

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
in safe election trustee.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
This way it uniforms the whole of Australia

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
and everyone knows the standard practice.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
The essence of using the code right

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
means that the individual can do their job

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
within a good time frame,

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
make the money they need to make

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
and still come home at the end of the day.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Getting the roof trusses into a building

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
is a satisfied milestone.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
The critical thing is to do it safely

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
and efficiently.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
If you are organised you'll save money

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
and time and possibly a life.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
And that is worth all the thinking

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
and all the effort.
