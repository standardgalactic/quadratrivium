1. **Avoid Manual Handling**: The best way to eliminate the risk of manual handling injuries is to avoid manual handling tasks entirely. This can be achieved by using mechanization or handling aids, such as cranes.

2. **Assess Risk**: Use a checklist to assess the risk of manual handling injury. Factors that might indicate a high risk include the task's involvement in holding loads away from the body, twisting, stooping, reaching upwards, large vertical movement, long carrying distances, generous pushing or pulling, repetitive handling, insufficient rest or recovery time, and a work rate imposed by a process.

3. **Control Measures**: If there is a risk of manual handling injury, take steps to make the work safer and easier. This can involve making the load lighter or less bulky, more stable, and easier to grasp.

4. **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Employers must provide PPE that workers must use, such as safety harnesses, appropriate footwear, eye protection, hearing protection, and protection against sun exposure with sunscreen, hats, and protective clothing.

5. **Compliance with Standards**: Use fore protection like mobile scaffolding systems, mesh or netting, fencing, handrails, and elevating platforms that comply with Australian standards (AS 1576, AS 4576, AS 14183.10).

6. **Practical Guidance**: Implementing these measures not only ensures safety but also efficiency, potentially saving time and money while reducing the risk of accidents or injuries.

7. **Safety Checklist**: Regularly inspect and replace PPE as necessary, follow the code of practice correctly, and ensure that all safety measures are in line with industry standards to maintain a safe work environment.

8. **Time Management**: While there may be concerns about the time it takes to implement these safety measures, doing so ensures that workers can complete their tasks effectively and within a reasonable time frame, while also ensuring their safety and well-being.

In summary, to manage manual handling risks in construction work, one must identify the risks, take appropriate control measures, provide and use PPE, comply with relevant safety standards, and ensure that safety practices are practical and realistic for the job at hand. This approach helps in completing tasks efficiently while minimizing the risk of injury or accident.
