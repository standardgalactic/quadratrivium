Processing Overview for Elm Europe
============================

1. **Module Organization**: As your Elm project grows, organize code into modules based on types and their use cases. This makes it easier to navigate and maintain the codebase.

2. **Data Structures**: Focus on modeling your data effectively. As you add more functionality or related features, evolve your record structures to reflect these relationships and dependencies.

3. **Expose as Little as Possible**: Only expose public functions that are necessary. Avoid unnecessary abstraction just for the sake of it.

4. **Avoid Premature Optimization/Refactoring**: Don't refactor code until there is an actual problem that needs solving. Refactoring for the sake of it can lead to unnecessary complexity and code golfing, which may not be beneficial for the project.

5. **Functional Programming in Elm**: Consider writing a book or documentation that encapsulates your learning journey and experiences with functional programming in Elm. This can serve as a valuable resource for others.

6. **Recursion and Graphs**: Learn about recursive functions and graph data structures, which are important concepts in functional programming and can be particularly useful in Elm.

7. **Live Coding Experience**: Strive to create educational content that not only teaches the concepts but also demonstrates them in a live setting, like a talk or a coding session.

8. **Iterative Learning**: As you grow your codebase and your knowledge, iterate on your data models and modules, ensuring they remain aligned with the needs of your application.

In summary, the key to growing an Elm project is to organize your code effectively, model your data thoughtfully, and refactor only when necessary. Focus on the functional programming aspects of Elm, such as recursion and graph structures, and aim to create educational materials that help others understand these concepts. Remember that both optimization and refactoring should be driven by real problems rather than speculative improvements.

1. **Custom Elements vs. Mutation Observers**: Custom elements are a cleaner and more manageable way to interoperate with JavaScript compared to mutation observers. They provide instance management, meaning they automatically keep track of the elements as they are added to the DOM without requiring you to manually observe changes and find those elements.

2. **Interoperability with JavaScript**: When integrating dynamic UI widgets or components that rely on JavaScript for functionality (like a text area that grows and shrinks), it's recommended to use custom elements in Elm. For more complex interactions, like a growth hacking AI blockchain client, you should use ports to communicate between Elm and JavaScript.

3. **CodeMirror Integration**: To handle fast typing in CodeMirror without issues like letters ending up in the wrong order or characters being overwritten, you can debounce requestIdleCallbacks. This ensures that the editor's state is stable before dispatching events to Elm.

4. **Polyfill for Custom Elements**: If you need to support browsers that don't natively support custom elements (like older versions of Firefox), you can use a polyfill. The official polyfill for custom elements works well and will soon be natively supported in Firefox.

5. **Resources for Implementation**: To implement custom elements or understand more about interoperability with JavaScript, you can refer to the following resources:
   - Elm's guide on interoperability (`elm-interop` package)
   - The `elm-template` package for rendering HTML in Elm
   - The LA (Large Hadron Arms) repository on GitHub for an example of integrating CodeMirror with Elm using custom elements
   - The custom-elements-v1 npm package and its polyfill for cross-browser compatibility

6. **Community Support**: If you have further questions or need assistance, Elm community members like the speaker are available on Slack and can be emailed for support.

In summary, custom elements provide a straightforward way to integrate complex JavaScript components into an Elm application without the overhead of continuously monitoring the DOM for changes. They are recommended over mutation observers for their simplicity and cleaner API. For handling rapid input in dynamic editors like CodeMirror, debouncing is a key technique to ensure stable interactions between Elm and JavaScript. Lastly, the Elm community offers resources and support to help developers navigate these interoperabilities effectively.
