Checking TEDx Talks/An Ancient Guide for New Technology ｜ Evan Rodriguez ｜ TEDxIdahoStateUniversity.txt
 Plato, an ancient Greek philosopher, offers insights on the impact of writing and technology in his work, which still resonate today. In one of his dialogues, he presents a god king who is skeptical of writing, arguing that it could lead to forgetfulness and superficial knowledge. Despite this, Plato himself recognizes the value of writing and demonstrates it through the crafting of written dialogues, which allow for a nuanced exploration of ideas that mimic real conversations.

Plato also uses the metaphor of the lifelike statues of Daedalus that could move away if not secured. This serves as an allegory for the importance of grounding our beliefs and ideas with reason to prevent them from being as elusive as the statues. Plato's concern is that people might adopt ideas without understanding their underlying motivations, similar to how modern shortcuts like hashtags can give a misleading sense of understanding or agreement.

The key takeaway from Plato's reflections is the need to continuously engage in dialogue and critical thinking, ensuring that new technologies enhance our ability to reason and consider different perspectives. He emphasizes that while technology can offer quick solutions, deeper insights often emerge from a gradual process of exploration and reflection. Plato challenges us to use both old and new technologies wisely, preserving the essence of meaningful conversation and critical thought.

In summary, Plato's ancient wisdom encourages us to think deeply about how we use technology and to prioritize reasoned dialogue that considers multiple perspectives to maintain the value of our ideas and beliefs in an ever-changing technological landscape.

Checking TEDx Talks/How Social Media is Shaping Our Political Future ｜ Victoria Bonney ｜ TEDxDirigo.txt
 The speaker, with over a decade of experience in government and campaigns, reflects on the impact of social media on politics since the 2016 election. They acknowledge that while social media has negative aspects, such as Russian bots and polarizing presidential tweets, it has also democratized political communication and made politics more diverse and transparent.

The speaker recalls their own transformation from a skeptic of their own fit for politics to an active campaigner after witnessing Howard Dean's 2004 campaign, which successfully leveraged low-dollar donations via the internet. They highlight how social media has revolutionized political communication by enabling candidates to share authentic stories and connect directly with voters without traditional media gatekeepers.

Social media has also changed opposition research dynamics, as showing vulnerability can be a shrewd political move. The speaker cites examples like Stacey Abrams and Beto O'Rourke, who have effectively used social media to engage with millions of Americans and raise significant funds.

Furthermore, the speaker points out that social media has made government more transparent, as seen with the Trump administration's border separation policy. Elected officials can now directly document and respond to issues, fostering a dialogue between themselves and their constituents. This has led to a change in the types of people running for office and has given a voice to those who previously felt unheard. Ultimately, the speaker argues that social media could even alter the representation on Mount Rushmore, symbolizing a shift towards a more inclusive and representative political landscape.

Checking TEDx Talks/How social media makes us unsocial ｜ Allison Graham ｜ TEDxSMU.txt
1. The speaker begins by emphasizing the danger of using phones while driving, highlighting how a five-second distraction can cover the length of a football field without looking.
2. They note that both adults and children are increasingly distracted by devices, often feeling compelled to respond to work emails even on vacation.

Checking TEDx Talks/How social media takes away our humanness ｜ Armin Hamrah ｜ TEDxSacredHeartSchoolsAtherton.txt
Hello! You've introduced yourself and then reflected on the impact of social media on our lives, particularly how it can detract from real human interactions and potentially diminish our humanity. You've highlighted that while social media was designed to help us stay connected, it often leads to unnatural communication and can become an unhealthy habit.

You've provided a brief history of social media, starting with Six Degrees in 1997 and moving on to Facebook in 2004, noting that these platforms have shifted how we interact from face-to-face to online, which is not inherently human or natural.

To illustrate the extent of our reliance on social media, you referenced a Spring VA survey which showed that most respondents use their phones for two or more hours on weekdays and five or more hours on weekends, totaling up to ten hours on weekends alone. This heavy usage can interfere with family time and sleep, leading to potential negative effects on academic performance and overall well-being.

You've pointed out that while social media has some positive aspects, it often presents a one-dimensional version of ourselves and can be likened to junk food for the brain, creating an addictive cycle that detracts from genuine human connections and experiences.

Citing research by Cal Newport, you've emphasized that constant phone checks and social media interactions can impair our capacity for deep work and concentration.

In conclusion, you're advocating for a return to real-life interactions, encouraging individuals to meet with friends in person rather than communicating through screens. You suggest setting up face-to-face meetings instead of sending messages or sharing content without context. If making this shift is challenging, you recommend setting screen time limits as a step towards reclaiming one's humanness and fostering genuine connections.

Your message is clear: choose meaningful interactions over digital ones to preserve our human essence and enhance the quality of our lives.

Checking TEDx Talks/Is Social Media Good for You？ ｜ Cliff Lampe ｜ TEDxUofM.txt
1. **Social Media as a Tool**: Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram offer various tools that facilitate different types of social interactions, such as sharing photos, tagging friends, or voting on content. These tools shape the way we communicate and build communities online.

2. **Community Formation**: When an individual, like Taylor Swift with her 54 million followers, posts content that receives a high number of retweets, shares, and favorites, it indicates the formation of a community around that person or brand.

3. **Visibility and Virality**: The visibility of social media posts can lead to increased virality, making content available to many people over time. This is amplified when content is shared or retweeted.

4. **Editability and Presence Curating**: Users have the ability to edit and curate their online presence, which is crucial for both personal and organizational branding.

5. **Social Grooming**: Social media facilitates a form of social grooming where users allocate attention based on the strength of their relationships. This can range from liking a post to sending a birthday message, and while it may seem trivial, it's a powerful form of maintaining relationships.

6. **Literacy and Design**: To effectively benefit from social media, individuals and organizations need to become more literate in its use and consider the design of these platforms. Social media is a platform for self-expression, and the content users create shapes the overall experience.

7. **Active Participation**: Being successful on social media requires active participation and thoughtful engagement with the platform, not just passive consumption. Users should take responsibility for what they contribute to the social media space.

In summary, the effectiveness of social media use depends on a combination of literacy, design considerations, and active participation. It's a powerful tool for communication and community building when used thoughtfully and with an understanding of its capabilities and limitations.

Checking TEDx Talks/Live in the Moment： Delete Social Media ｜ Ryan Thomas ｜ TEDxAshburnSalon.txt
 The speaker discusses the impact of social media on our lives, emphasizing that while it offers various features and gimmicks, it cannot replace genuine human interaction and real-life experiences. They highlight a study by Pew Research Center showing a shift from face-to-face to online interactions among friends on a daily basis. The speaker personally experienced this disconnect, using their phone as an escape during social situations. This realization led them to reassess their own use of social media and its role in their life goals.

They decided to quit social media entirely, which resulted in a significant positive change in their outlook and actions. This experience taught the speaker that they have control over their happiness and satisfaction in life, and it encouraged them to focus on personal growth and individuality rather than comparing themselves to others online. They argue that while deleting social media isn't a cure-all for happiness or success, it can provide a pathway to more thoughtful and intentional living.

The speaker encourages the audience to be present in the moment and to value face-to-face interactions over virtual ones. They believe that by being present and treating others with kindness, we can find genuine happiness and foster meaningful relationships. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of being mindful of how social media affects our daily lives and interactions with others.

Checking TEDx Talks/Mathematics is the sense you never knew you had ｜ Eddie Woo ｜ TEDxSydney.txt
1. **Introduction to Fractals**: Fractals are self-similar patterns found in nature, like the branching of rivers or the veins of leaves. They are a fundamental aspect of the universe that we all share and can recognize with practice.

2. **Perception of Mathematics**: Just as one can refine their sense of taste or hearing, our mathematical perception can be developed over time. Some people have a more natural inclination towards recognizing patterns, while others may initially struggle but can still appreciate the beauty of mathematics.

3. **Patterns in Art and Nature**: Humans are pattern-makers, and this is evident in both art and nature. For example, Islamic art features intricate geometric designs that reflect a deep understanding of symmetry and patterns. Similarly, flowers exhibit rotational symmetry, which optimizes their growth and aesthetic appeal.

4. **The Golden Ratio**: The Golden Ratio (approximately 1.618) is a mathematical constant that appears in various natural phenomena, including the arrangement of flower parts and the architecture of historical structures. It is often associated with beauty and efficiency.

5. **Personal Anecdotal Note**: The speaker has a visual impairment but emphasizes that this should not preclude anyone from engaging with or appreciating mathematics, which is as much a part of our world as any other sensory experience. Mathematics can be perceived and loved by everyone, just like music or art.

Checking TEDx Talks/Quit social media ｜ Dr. Cal Newport ｜ TEDxTysons.txt
1. **Cognitive Consequences**: The overuse of social media, likened to a slot machine, can lead to a "background hum of anxiety" and has cognitive consequences, especially among college students where there's been an increase in anxiety-related disorders coinciding with the rise of smartphone and social media use.

2. **Productivity**: Life without social media can be highly productive. Intense focus on tasks for extended periods is possible when attention isn't fragmented by constant notifications and distractions.

3. **Peaceful Leisure**: Life outside of work without social media can be tranquil, with activities like reading newspapers, listening to the radio, or enjoying hardcover books offering a more restorative and peaceful experience.

4. **Critique of Social Media Usage**: The speaker argues that the claim that you need social media for professional reasons is unfounded, as it's not a fundamental technology but rather a choice. The harms of social media use are real and significant, outweighing any perceived benefits.

5. **Personal Experience**: The speaker has found personal satisfaction in life without social media, noting that it aligns with a more peaceful and old-fashioned way of living that was effective even in the 1930s.

6. **Recommendation**: The speaker suggests that many people would benefit from significantly reducing their use of social media, considering the potential harms and the positive aspects of life without it.

Checking TEDx Talks/Social Media Isn't Real (Even if it Looks Like it is) ｜ Samantha Cohen ｜ TEDxYouth@SRDS.txt
 The speaker discusses the impact of social media on mental health, highlighting studies that suggest reducing social media usage can alleviate feelings of depression and loneliness. They emphasize that while social media has significant advantages in terms of communication and sharing ideas across the globe, it also poses challenges like promoting unrealistic standards and fostering insecurities among users. The speaker points out that influencers often have access to resources that make maintaining a certain image easier, which can be misleading to their audience.

To combat the negative effects of social media, the speaker suggests taking a break from it. They recommend deleting social media apps for a day to experience the relief and discover alternative activities that might bring more fulfillment and satisfaction. The speaker encourages the audience to remember that their self-worth should not be measured by online interactions or validation through likes and comments.

In conclusion, while social media is a powerful tool for connecting people, it's crucial to use it responsibly and to maintain a healthy balance to avoid its adverse effects on mental health. The speaker encourages individuals to find their own balance and to not let social media define who they are as people.

Checking TEDx Talks/Social Media is Making Us Unsocial ｜ Kristin Gallucci ｜ TEDxBocaRaton.txt
 The speaker reflects on their experience at a social media event where they observed influencers prioritizing Instagram-worthy photo opportunities over genuine human connections. This moment highlighted the paradox of social media, which can lead to unsocial behavior, harm authentic relationships, and even replace real experiences with digital ones. Social media's influence is pervasive, shaping everything from how we consume news to our interactions with loved ones. It has also introduced terms like "slacktivism," where online activism may not translate into tangible societal change.

The speaker acknowledges that technology itself is not inherently harmful; rather, it's our engagement with it that can become problematic. Overdependence on social media can lead to addiction, and the more we engage online, the more we might neglect real-life relationships and personal well-being. The need for human connection is fundamental to our health and happiness, and social media should serve as a supplement to real-world interactions, not a replacement.

To counteract these negative effects, the speaker suggests several strategies: turning off notifications, removing social media apps from smartphones, educating ourselves and others on responsible usage, and using social media tools to enhance and support real-life relationships rather than letting them replace them. The speaker calls for a proactive approach to manage our relationship with social media, emphasizing the importance of disconnecting to truly connect with others and ourselves.

Checking TEDx Talks/Social media isn't bad： you're just using it wrong ｜ Eva Amin ｜ TEDxCherryCreekWomen.txt
The speaker reflects on the impact of social media, recognizing that it can serve as a modern-day equivalent to children's books in teaching life lessons. They argue that the true impact of social media depends on how one chooses to use it—it can either present a negative or positive view of the world based on the content we consume. The speaker shares their approach to maintaining a positive social media experience by following four specific categories of people:

1. **Friends, Family, and Positive Acquaintances**: Surrounding oneself with supportive and positive individuals can prevent exposure to toxic behavior.

2. **People Who Align with Your Goals**: Following those who are on a similar path or have achieved your aspirations can provide guidance and inspiration, as well as opportunities that align with your objectives.

3. **People Who Inspire You**: Even if someone no longer represents your goals, their content might still be inspiring or motivational, which is valuable.

4. **Entertainers**: Enjoying content from entertainers for leisure and enjoyment is a natural part of social media use.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of being mindful of the content consumed on social media and encourages a shift in perception away from viewing social media as inherently negative. Instead, they suggest educating others about the potential dangers while also promoting its positive uses. The speaker concludes by adapting a famous quote to highlight the importance of both personal relationships and the influence of the content we engage with online.

In essence, the speaker advocates for a more thoughtful and intentional approach to social media use, one that recognizes its potential as a tool for learning, inspiration, and opportunity, rather than dismissing it outright as harmful. They encourage listeners to be active participants in curating their feeds to include content that supports their personal growth and goals.

Checking TEDx Talks/Socially Silent： my relationship with social media ｜ Siena Wescott-Toi ｜ TEDxYouth@Haileybury.txt
 Sienna shares a personal journey of how five weeks without social media in January 2021 during lockdown significantly changed her life for the better. She initially relied on social media as an escape from loneliness but realized it was negatively affecting her self-confidence and motivation. After a self-reflective moment in front of a mirror, Sienna decided to cut off all her virtual relationships when physical interactions were scarce. This decision led to a more fulfilling life where she engaged in meaningful activities like reading, painting, cooking, and learning about the world around her. She found peace and a sense of freedom without the constant pressure to conform to social media standards.

Sienna's experience made her realize the importance of balance with social media, viewing it as a tool for communication rather than a source of endless feeds and superficial standards. She emphasizes that the average teenager spends nine hours a day on social media, which amounts to half a year, highlighting the potential impact of excessive screen time on young people's lives.

After her break, Sienna learned to communicate with herself, gaining self-awareness and control over her time. She encourages others to take a break from social media to discover their own balance, find freedom, and learn more about themselves, believing that this approach can lead to a deeper understanding of life and the world.

Sienna's story is a testament to the potential for personal growth and change through introspection and digital detox, and she hopes her experience inspires others to reflect on their relationship with social media.

Checking TEDx Talks/Software -- past and future ｜ Charles H. Moore ｜ TEDxDavidsonAcademy.txt
1. **Complexity of Code**: The complexity of large codebases, like those in Windows or major software systems, can be overwhelming. It often requires the collective effort of entire corporations to understand and maintain such systems, leading to potential issues with reliability and efficiency.

2. **Size vs. Complexity**: Modern applications on smartphones are relatively small, around 10 megabytes, yet they perform complex tasks without the need for massive codebases. This suggests that smaller, more efficient programs can be more effective.

3. **Bug Frequency**: Smaller programs tend to have fewer bugs compared to larger ones due to their simplicity and manageability.

4. **Software Development Trends**: Current software development trends favor the integration of pre-existing software components rather than writing code from scratch, often due to corporate preferences and practices.

5. **Fourth Language and OS**: The fourth programming language and its associated operating system can be implemented in a very small amount of code—around 10 kilobytes. This allows individuals to write their own systems, demonstrating the power of simplicity and the potential for users to create efficient software solutions.

6. **Resource Usage**: Large, complex software often uses more energy, space, and resources than necessary, which can be inefficient and costly.

7. **Education and Inspiration**: The speaker encourages young programmers to write their own software, prove its value, and contribute to a better understanding of how to create effective, small, fast, and cheap solutions.

8. **Fourth Community**: There is an active community of fourth users and developers, with resources available online for those interested in learning more about the language and its applications.

9. **Personal Pride**: The speaker takes pride in their involvement with fourth and believes that sometimes the best solutions come about by accident or through a less conventional approach.

10. **Future of Software Development**: The speaker calls for a change in software development practices, advocating for smaller, more efficient programs as a way to improve upon current trends.

Checking TEDx Talks/The Right Way to Use Social Media ｜ Paula La Croix ｜ TEDxYouth@TBSRJ.txt
14-year-old teenager in São Paulo, Brazil, facing a modeling career and navigating the ups and downs of the industry. She shared her experiences on social media, which helped her connect with her audience on a deeper level, gaining over 340,000 followers by sharing her journey, including her challenges and triumphs. She conducted a survey on Instagram, revealing that 90% of respondents believed social media to be a toxic environment due to the contrast between curated virtual realities and the comparisons made in real life.

From this, she developed the "effects" formula to guide her posts, ensuring they are Aesthetic (visually pleasing), Function and Purpose (intentional and beneficial), Energy (positive and uplifting), Knowledge (informative or educative), and Sustainability (encouraging eco-friendly practices). This approach aims to create a constructive and positive impact on her audience, both online and offline. She encourages others to apply this formula to their social media content, promoting a more positive and supportive digital community. Her goal is to use social media not just for personal gain but as a tool for good, inspiring others to do the same and become role models within their own circles.

The key takeaway is the importance of mindfully creating content that has a positive impact on one's audience and contributes to a healthier online environment. The "effects" formula serves as a guide for individuals to assess and enhance the value of their social media posts, fostering a more supportive and constructive digital space.

Checking TEDx Talks/The Role Of Smell in Consciousness  ｜ Barry Smith ｜ TEDxOxford.txt
1. Taste is closely linked with smell, and our perception of food flavor relies heavily on the sense of smell. When people lose their sense of smell (anosmia), they often also lose their ability to taste, which can significantly impact their quality of life.

2. There are four key elements of taste: sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. However, these tastes alone do not create the full flavor experience. Smell plays a crucial role by contributing aromas that our brain associates with certain tastes, leading to a perception of flavor.

3. When we eat or drink, volatile compounds are released and travel up through the back of the nasopharynx to the nose, enhancing our taste experience. This process is known as retro-nasal olfaction.

4. Smell also influences other senses such as touch and taste, and it can affect our emotional state, cognitive function, and memory recall.

5. A diminished sense of smell, particularly in older adults, is a common issue that can lead to decreased enjoyment of food, increased risk of depression, and difficulties with recognizing people and places.

6. Smell training or olfactory training involves regularly exposing oneself to a variety of essential oils to help preserve the sense of smell as one ages and to potentially improve cognitive alertness.

7. People who are born without a sense of smell (congenital anosmia) may miss out on the immersive experience that odors can provide in environments like gardens, where visual beauty is enhanced by aromas.

8. The importance of all faction (smell) has been highlighted by researchers and neuroscientists who study the sense of smell and its impact on our daily lives. They emphasize that a lack of awareness about the significance of smell can lead people to underestimate its role in their overall well-being.

Checking TEDx Talks/The next leap into the future： Explaining the Unexplainable [AI] ｜ Luca Longo ｜ TEDxInnopolis.txt
1. The speaker discusses the importance of understanding why AI makes certain decisions, not just what decisions it makes. This is crucial for informed decision-making and for trust in AI systems.
2. An example is given where an AI system predicted a 5% increase in sales, but human insight was needed to understand this prediction (propositional rules) and guide business decisions.
3. The context shifts to a bookstore scenario, where visual analytics helped the owner understand that high customer satisfaction during morning and evening hours was offset by poor experiences during lunchtime due to overcrowding.
4. The speaker then introduces the concept of feasible argumentation using the example of a patient with symptoms possibly indicating both a tumor and multiple cavernomas. Different arguments with premises and conclusions show how additional information can change the AI's conclusion.
5. The key message is that AI systems should be transparent, allowing users to comprehend and interpret their inferences, as opposed to being black boxes.
6. Alan Turing's question about whether machines can think highlights the evolution of AI into various sectors. The speaker emphasizes the need for a revolution to democratize AI and ensure it is used to enhance human decision-making rather than replace it.
7. Stephen Hawking's warning about the potential risks of uncontrolled AI development is mentioned, underscoring the urgency to open the black boxes of AI systems and understand their workings.
8. The speaker concludes by advocating for a change in how we develop AI—making it explainable, transparent, and human-centric to ensure it benefits humanity without posing existential risks.

Checking TEDx Talks/The surprising secret that solves your problems quickly ｜ Collins Key ｜ TEDxSantaBarbara.txt
1. **The Key to Magic**: The key to performing successful magic, especially on television, is to make it intimate and personal, rather than grand and spectacle-like. This approach was successful for the speaker on "America's Got Talent."

2. **Clues in Plain Sight**: Throughout the talk, the speaker provided two clues that would help solve upcoming problems. These clues were subtly indicated by the speaker touching their key at specific moments and stating that the answer was always hiding in plain sight.

3. **Problem Solving**: The speaker presented three challenges designed to illustrate how perceptions, misconceptions, assumptions, and expectations can prevent one from seeing the simple solutions to problems. These challenges were:
   - Drinking champagne from a bottle without opening it.
   - Balancing a salt shaker on a dollar bill suspended between two glasses.
   - A bar bet puzzle that uses principles similar to those used in magic.

4. **Overcoming Misconceptions**: The speaker explained that intelligent people can sometimes be harder to fool because they may talk themselves out of the simple solution, create false sets of assumptions, and allow their expectations to cloud their judgment. They may also become so focused on what they perceive as the problem's complexity that they overlook the straightforward answer.

5. **The Takeaway**: The overarching message is that by recognizing and overcoming our own misconceptions, assumptions, and expectations, we can unlock answers and solutions that are often right in front of us but hidden due to our preconceived notions. This approach can be applied to various aspects of life, including problem-solving, critical thinking, and even performance arts like magic.

Checking TEDx Talks/Why Social Media Is Ruining Your Life ｜ Katherine Ormerod ｜ TEDxManchester.txt
 The speaker, who has used social media to further her career in fashion while also caring for her child, discusses the complex relationship people have with social media. She points out that if we continue to use social media without mindfulness and behavioral change, it could negatively impact our mental health and well-being. She shares personal stories of how she posted seemingly happy images on social media when, in reality, she was going through difficult times. This revelation led to a campaign where she reposted these images with the hashtag #whysocialmediarisruiningyourlife, aiming to show the disconnect between online personas and real-life experiences.

The response was significant, with many parents using her posts to educate their children about the difference between curated social media images and actual life. The speaker emphasizes that while it's natural to aspire to the lifestyles portrayed in magazines and on social media, we must ground our expectations in reality to avoid feelings of inadequacy or envy.

She reminds us that everyone, regardless of their online presence, faces personal struggles. Social media should not be used as a yardstick for measuring life success or happiness. The speaker encourages viewers to remember that social media posts are carefully curated and do not reflect the full reality of a person's life. It's crucial to differentiate between the 1% of someone's life they choose to share online and the 99% that happens offline. Her message is a call for mindfulness in how we use social media, advocating for a more honest and realistic approach to both presenting our lives online and evaluating the lives of others.

Checking TEDx Talks/Why the majority is always wrong ｜ Paul Rulkens ｜ TEDxMaastricht.txt
1. **Think Beyond Conventions**: The box within which most people operate is defined by industry standards or norms. To achieve extraordinary results, it's essential to move beyond these conventional boundaries.

2. **London Taxi Drivers Example**: In London, taxi drivers must possess extensive "Knowledge" of the city. However, to scale their business, they created a new category of taxis where drivers did not know the city but welcomed passengers who enjoyed giving directions. This innovation allowed them to employ drivers without the required knowledge while still providing value.

3. **Innovation and Breaking Norms**: Breakthrough innovations occur when individuals or companies decide to ignore industry norms. For example, IKEA disrupted the furniture industry by shifting from selling fully assembled furniture to flat-pack products that customers assemble themselves. Dell Computers revolutionized the computer market by moving from brick-and-mortar stores to direct online sales.

4. **Marcus Aurelius' Insight**: Marcus Aurelius noted that siding with the majority often leads to mediocrity or madness. High performance requires thinking and acting differently from the majority.

5. **High Performance Requires Deviation**: Only a minority (about 3%) of people achieve high performance by deviating from industry standards and norms. The rest either remain average or become part of those who excel.

6. **Choosing Your Path**: Each individual has the opportunity to aim for high performance by choosing to disrupt their industry's status quo. This requires challenging conventional wisdom, thinking differently, and innovating. It's a choice between being a follower or a leader in one's field.
