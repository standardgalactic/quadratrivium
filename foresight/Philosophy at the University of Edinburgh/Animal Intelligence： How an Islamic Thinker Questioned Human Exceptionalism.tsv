0	19800	So this, thank you very much Fedor, actually Fedor did not mention that he wrote the index
19800	23400	for one of the books based on the podcast, or at least one of them, maybe more than one
23400	29960	of them, and we know each other for a long time, so it's great to be here at his invitation.
29960	36800	This indeed is going to be a presentation of some of the work I did in this ERC project,
36800	43160	especially together with one of the then postdocs who's now at Fordham University named Blyosoma,
43160	50880	and it's about a philosopher theologian named Fahradin Arasi, who lived in the 12th, just
50880	56160	barely into the 13th century, and what he thought about animals.
56160	64600	The payoff of the talk is that he thought that animals can be rational or intelligent,
64600	69280	depending on how you want to translate the key term, which is a very surprising thing
69280	74120	for someone to have thought in the 12th century.
74120	79560	Just think about the fact that in the Aristotelian tradition, it's very common to just define
79560	85840	human as rational animal, implying that all the other animals are non-rational.
85920	92160	That's maybe a definition they just kind of throw around without thinking about it very
92160	96840	much, but it is also something that they seem to be committed to.
96840	104360	In this talk, I'm going to present that idea, the sort of orthodox view, that only humans
104360	110320	are rational, why they might have thought this, and then I'm going to talk a little
110320	117000	bit about a philosopher who's the immediate context for understanding Fahradin's position,
117000	121720	who's the most important philosopher of the Islamic tradition named Ibn Sina, maybe more
121720	126600	famous under the name of Avicenna, and the reason I need to talk about him is that it's
126600	132520	really to him that Fahradin is responding when he makes this argument that animals can
132520	134960	also be rational.
134960	140520	But first, let's start with the conventional, or orthodox view, and of course we have to
140520	145080	start with Aristotle as so often.
145080	147560	Aristotle has a lot to say about animals.
147560	154720	In fact, one of the kind of mysterious things about ancient philosophy is that Aristotle
154720	162760	writes this vast corpus of works on zoology, so we've got the parts of animals on the generation
162760	170000	of animals, on the motion of animals, history of animals, and unlike other works of his
170000	176480	on logic, on physics, on the soul, on metaphysics, on ethics, these works don't receive any commentaries
176480	177480	in late antiquity.
177480	183920	In fact, there's no Greek commentary on any of his zoological works until the Byzantine
183920	190680	period when a group of commentators who are gathered around a queen, or at least princess
190680	196120	named Anna Komnena, decide to write commentaries on all the texts by Aristotle that haven't
196120	198680	already been commented on in antiquity.
198680	204840	So this is a kind of underappreciated feature of Aristotle's corpus in antiquity.
204840	210160	In the medieval period it gets some attention in Latin, especially from Albert the Great,
210160	212000	the teacher of Aquinas.
212000	216920	So he writes about zoology, he also writes about botany, he was a very intrepid natural
216920	223760	philosopher, did things like repelling down cliffs to look at nests of birds.
223760	224760	Very cool.
224760	227960	They don't call him Albert the Great for nothing.
227960	235120	But it's also true that the zoological works are quite valued in the Arabic tradition.
235120	239360	So they were translated into Arabic, they were translated as a single work, just called
239360	244360	a hayawan, so animals, that's just one big text.
244360	248640	And they were known to people like Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd and so on, Ibn Sina actually writes
248640	252080	a work of his own on animals that's kind of based on it.
252080	258000	So Aristotle's absolutely a fundamental source of information about animals.
258000	261560	And the information is often quite detailed.
261560	267480	So the anatomy of animals, the way that their embryos look, the way that they move, like
267480	271880	the difference between flying animals, four footed animals, two footed animals, what do
271880	275600	they eat, where do they live, and so on.
275600	282320	History of animals also has some information in it, which is a little bit fanciful, like
282320	286560	animals healing themselves by deliberately eating certain herbs or things like that.
286560	291000	But by and large, Aristotle's observations of animals are very impressive.
291000	298240	He himself did dissections of animals, often of marine life, and he described many, many
298240	300960	animals and animal structures for the first time.
300960	303800	So the dude is really into animals.
303800	307640	Okay, that's what I'm trying to communicate to you here.
307640	315240	And in fact, I would say it's really amongst his most amazing achievements is his empirical
315240	317600	work on the animal world.
317600	326760	Yet, in some sense, he rates animals kind of low in another respect, namely that he doesn't
326760	332320	really ascribe to animals very high cognitive powers.
332320	341320	In particular, he draws a really kind of rigorous divide between humans on the one hand who
341320	348440	have the capacity for reasoning and what he calls a noose, which means intellect.
348440	352880	So we've got humans on the one hand, and we've got animals on the other hand who only have
352880	359480	animal souls and are capable of sensation and motion.
359480	361360	So in other words, they can move around.
361360	365760	That differentiates them from plants, because plants can only engage in the powers of the
365760	366760	vegetative soul.
366760	367960	In other words, the plant soul.
367960	369240	So that's kind of tautologist.
369240	375260	But what that would mean is the ability to reproduce and the ability to engage in nutrition.
375260	377280	So plants can take in food and water.
377280	378360	They can make more plants.
378360	379760	They can reproduce.
379760	381840	Animals can do those things.
381840	383160	They can also perceive.
383160	385720	They can also move around.
385720	390920	But only humans can think rationally.
390920	396680	That's something that we share in common with God, which is not an insignificant fact.
396680	399000	So there's something divine about humans.
399000	405120	At the end of the ethics, Aristotle says that the life of philosophy is almost more than
405120	409040	human, because it allows us to partake in divinity.
409040	413840	So even for all that he has a lot to say about animals and for all that he was extremely
413840	420720	interested in them, he still draws this very hard and fast divide between non-human animals
420720	425640	on the one hand and humans on the other hand.
425640	430600	Something else that we're going to see is going to be important is that he says that
430600	437900	the mind, the human mind, does not have a bodily organ through which it is exercised.
437900	442780	So he does not think that you're thinking with your heart, well, he doesn't think you're
442780	445780	thinking with your brain, because he doesn't think the brain does very much.
445780	449300	He thinks it's a kind of cooling element in your body.
449300	453100	But also he doesn't think you're thinking with your heart, even though your sensation
453100	457780	and some of your other cognitive powers are seated in the heart, like probably your imagination
457780	460660	is seated in the heart, but not your mind.
460660	466780	Also your intellect, noose, is exercised without any bodily organ.
466780	471700	And later philosophers, and we're going to see this in Sinai, later philosophers thought
471700	477700	that this is a sign that Aristotle would believe that you can survive the death of your body,
477700	481380	because if you don't need a bodily organ to think, then why wouldn't you be able to keep
481380	487180	thinking after you die?
487180	492900	Now here's a question that people, I think, don't ask themselves enough.
492900	496060	Why in the world would Aristotle have thought this?
496060	502100	Why would he think that animals can't think, or can't engage in reason or intellect?
502100	505820	After all, animals do all kinds of problem-solving.
505820	510620	They build amazing things like webs and nests.
510620	515980	We're going to see later on that this is important for Fahddin, they even apparently
515980	522660	can do geometry, think about beehives, perfect hexagons that tessellate, I wouldn't be able
522660	525220	to build something like that.
525220	527860	So animals do all kinds of amazing things.
527860	532740	And if there's anyone in the entire ancient world who's extremely aware of the amazing
532740	539140	things that animals do, it's Aristotle, as I just said, due to superintent animals.
539140	545540	So why does he think that animals fall not just below humans in this respect, but why
545540	549900	does he see this very striking difference between animals and humans?
549900	553220	Well there's maybe two reasons.
553220	556500	One is that animals are not capable of language.
556500	561940	So he may have a very strong connection in his mind between rational thinking and language,
561940	564980	especially if you think about the Greek words involved here.
564980	570940	So the word for language is logos, and that's also the word for reason, or the word rational
570940	573060	is logike.
573060	578220	So there's a very strong drive, even through the Greek language itself, to associate reasoning
578220	580460	with language.
580460	581940	That's one thing.
581940	588340	Another thing is that he may have quite a narrow understanding of what intellect or reasoning
588340	590980	actually involves.
590980	595580	If you think that what it means to engage in intellect or reasoning is something like
595580	601940	to engage in abstract thinking about general features of the universe, and that does seem
601940	606020	to be what he thinks is a long story, what he thinks intellect is, so we don't have time
606020	607020	to get into.
607020	609340	We can talk about that in the Q&A if you want.
609340	614140	But if it's something like that, abstract thinking about general features of the universe,
614140	619100	then it's actually quite plausible to say that animals don't do that.
619100	621480	Basically animals don't do philosophy.
621480	624220	So that's why we should say they don't engage in reasoning.
624220	627620	Of course most humans don't engage in philosophy either.
627620	630420	So there's us.
630420	635780	So the people in this room are better than animals.
635780	642300	Whether everyone else outside the room is, I mean it's a university, but there may be
642300	647180	this kind of elitist attitude that all of the non-scientists, non-philosophers are kind
647180	650180	of like cows.
650180	655500	And this is something you see again and again actually in the later history of philosophy.
655500	660980	For example, Ibn Rushd or Averwes, the great medieval Muslim commentator on Aristotle,
660980	671180	says at one point that most humans are human in name only because they don't do philosophy.
671180	676300	And this actually is not an unimportant, I mean it's kind of funny, but it's also got
676300	677980	a very dark side.
677980	682540	So when they discovered the Americas, they were like, well these people don't do philosophy,
682540	685740	so we can basically treat them as if they were herd animals.
685740	691500	So this is not unimportant, this feature of Aristotelianism.
691500	694380	So that's Aristotle's position.
694380	699420	We don't need to put the blame for all of that on Aristotle, but he sort of kicks off
699420	701820	this way of thinking about humans and animals.
701820	704220	And for the most part other ancient philosophers agree.
704220	711900	So in particular the Stoics agree, and the Platonists maybe agree sometimes.
711900	715740	So there are exceptions, and they come mostly in the Platonic tradition.
715740	722260	In particular there's a second century philosopher who's a Platonist named Plutarch, and a third
722260	727060	fourth century philosopher named Porphyry, who is the student of Plotinus, the founder
727060	730900	of Neoplatonism, if that means anything to you.
730900	736620	Porphyry wrote a work using some material from Plutarch in which he argues explicitly
736620	742020	that animals can use language, and he gives a whole bunch of reasons to think that they
742020	747100	can use language, as he says, we don't understand them, but we don't understand people from
747100	751180	Skithia either, but we don't say that they're not rational.
751180	755340	So when the animals seem to be communicating with each other, so probably that just speaking
755340	761500	a language we can't understand, he also gives examples of animals that can respond to linguistic
761500	762500	commands.
762500	768940	Because he had a pet bird who could do this, and what he says is, so attacking this link
768940	775420	between reasoning and language in the Stoics rather than Aristotle, he says that the Stoics
775420	780940	are wrong to deny intelligence to animals on the basis that they can't talk, because
780940	785140	in fact they probably can talk, at least some of them can talk.
785140	790180	But Plutarch and Porphyry, it's interesting as they aren't really relevant for us today,
790180	793300	because their works were not translated into Arabic, or at least these works by them were
793300	796780	not translated into Arabic, so they kind of fall out of the story.
796780	802820	And what's communicated to the Arabic tradition is basically a unified view, according to
802820	809740	which animals are non-rational, and that completely differentiates them from humans.
809740	816540	Okay, now let's think a little bit more about what I was saying just a moment ago, namely
816540	824540	that animal cognition falls below human cognition, because it doesn't involve thinking abstractly
824540	828660	about general features of the universe.
828660	832380	So I want to flesh that out a little bit.
832380	838260	What this would mean in the terms that become familiar in the Arabic tradition, but to some
838260	844060	extent this is all pretty well grounded in Aristotle himself, would be that animals can
844060	850620	only grasp particulars, they can't grasp generalities.
850620	862340	So what this would mean is that, for example, a mother giraffe could see that another animal
862340	867460	is a giraffe, maybe, and they would certainly be able to recognize particular giraffes,
867460	872860	like the mother can recognize her own offspring, that's not a problem, and of course they
872860	878180	can sort of differentiate between giraffes and non-giraffes, like if you put another giraffe
878180	886740	in front of a giraffe, the giraffe will be like giraffe, okay, whereas if you put a lion
886740	893180	in front of the giraffe, the giraffe will be like, oh, crap, and it will turn and run
893180	897980	away with that loping stride that we're so familiar with, right, so they react appropriately,
898260	903620	but to do that they don't need to have the notion of giraffes as opposed to lions, right,
903620	908380	like they don't need to think about the species of lion or the species of giraffe, they just
908380	914260	have to be like, oh, there's a dangerous animal, I'm going to run, there's a safe animal so
914260	917500	I'm not going to run.
917500	924380	Now obviously we also grasp particulars all the time, right, and in fact, as I was saying,
924380	929820	a lot of humans may not think at the level of generalities very often or even at all,
929820	936020	so you can do things like enjoy a nice piece of cake without engaging in any general abstract
936020	941620	reasoning about cake, right, so you don't have to think, ah, here's a piece of cake
941620	947980	that falls under the species of cake, which falls under the genus of baked goods, and
947980	952660	I've had other baked goods and I enjoyed them, therefore I may enjoy, you can do that if
952660	958340	you want, but most of us are just like, ah, cake, right, and you just eat it.
958340	964020	You also, at least I spend very little time thinking about whether, and in retrospect,
964020	968220	the members of my own family fall under the species of human, I don't know about your
968220	973300	own family lives, but basically for practical purposes we don't need to think about, think
973300	979660	like this very much, we think like this when we're doing science.
979660	985620	Now the examples I've just given are really about sense perception, right, like giraffes
985620	991180	seeing other giraffes or lions, us seeing pieces of cake, but even when we're engaging
991180	996700	in what you might think of as somewhat more abstract forms of cognition, we're still actually
996700	1003980	dealing with particulars most of the time, so for example, show of hands, who had cake
1003980	1010620	yesterday, that's it, this is great Britain, come on, this is the best thing about the
1010620	1017020	country, okay, so those of you who had cake, so those of you who raised your hand or those
1017020	1022260	of you who thought I did have cake but I'm not admitting that in front of all these people,
1022260	1025980	you were remembering the cake you had yesterday and you were remembering a particular piece
1025980	1030380	of cake, namely the particular piece of cake you had yesterday, right, some of you may have
1030380	1036380	foregone a piece of cake yesterday because you're unlike me, you're very, you know,
1036380	1041220	abstemious and self-controlled, so that was a particular piece of cake that you remember
1041220	1048780	not eating, also everyone in the room is now imagining a piece of cake, right, because
1048780	1053420	how could you not, that's sort of what cake is, it's the kind of thing that you imagine
1053420	1057900	when people talk about it, and you were also imagining a giraffe looking at a lion or a
1057900	1063020	giraffe a minute ago, what you were imagining was a particular giraffe, not necessarily
1063020	1067780	a particular one you've seen, but if you have a kind of image of the giraffe, it's an image
1067780	1074540	of a particular giraffe that you kind of cobble together from story books, safaris, nature
1074540	1078740	documentaries, whatever it is that's giving you your image of giraffes, so that actually
1078740	1084140	means that you can get through a lot of your mental life just dealing with particulars,
1084780	1088980	right, sort of constructed imaginary particulars or actual particulars, when you remember,
1088980	1094820	when you imagine, you're dealing with particulars, and this would help explain how it is that
1094820	1099940	animals can do some of these amazing things that they do, right, so why are they capable
1099940	1106500	of apparently complex behaviors, recognizing things, maybe building things, making apparently
1106500	1111740	making plans, something like apparent means and reasoning, they're doing it all with memory
1111860	1119860	and imagination, according to the conventional view, and this has an important consequence,
1120380	1126300	so as I said before, Aristotle is of the view that the intellect doesn't have a bodily organ,
1126820	1132420	but the imagination and memory do have a bodily organ, he would have thought, as I said before,
1132420	1136780	that it's the heart, but by the time we get to the Arabic tradition, they know that it's the
1136780	1141500	brain, and the reason they know that it's the brain is because Galen, the great doctor in
1141500	1150260	the second century, has done empirical studies that prove that all of your cognitive powers
1150260	1159940	are seated in the brain, in particular he shows that the commands that move the limbs travel
1159940	1163300	through the nerves down from the brain, in the time of Aristotle they didn't even know
1163300	1168980	the nervous system existed, actually, that was first discovered in Alexandria, a couple
1169020	1175020	of hundred years before Galen, and Galen does experiments actually on animals, in which
1175020	1181540	he proves that it's really the brain that's the most central organ, at one point he says
1181540	1187780	that if you want to show people how important the brain is, a really good way to do this
1187780	1194780	is to take a pig, put it on a stage, expose the nerves coming down from the neck, and
1195700	1200700	then snip the nerves that go to the vocal cords, because the pig will be making this
1200700	1207700	incredible racket and screaming in pain, and then suddenly it will be silent, it's obviously
1207700	1215700	a very gruesome experiment, but a very impressive one. By contrast, interlection doesn't involve
1215700	1222820	a bodily organ, so the difference between us and animals, as I said before, really is
1223060	1228380	along this line between material powers and immaterial powers, even the things that we
1228380	1232580	might think of as part of our mental life or consciousness, by the way this is a real
1232580	1238420	difference between the way we tend to think about it in philosophy of mind nowadays, and
1238420	1245420	the way that ancient and medieval people thought in their philosophy of mind, so for us all
1245460	1251220	the mental stuff is kind of whatever involves consciousness, so for us something like imagination
1251220	1258220	or memory would be just as much on the mind side of things as abstract thinking, whereas
1261980	1268480	in the Aristotelian tradition there's a huge difference between something like imagination
1268480	1275480	and intellect, the difference is precisely the difference between particulars being grasped
1275680	1282680	with a power that's seated in a bodily organ, and universals, abstract generalities, being
1284760	1291120	grasped with an immaterial power, namely intellect, so this particular versus universal thing
1291120	1298120	tracks material versus immaterial powers, and this is all the kind of background for
1299120	1306120	Ibn Sina's view, so Ibn Sina, like I said, is the most important philosopher in the Islamic
1307880	1314880	tradition, he died in 1037, and he actually proves, or tries to prove, that the intellect
1317460	1324460	is realized immaterially and that the rational soul does not have a bodily organ on the
1325460	1332460	grounds that the rational soul or mind or intellect, so the Arabic word here for intellect
1335180	1342180	is akl, which can also be translated as a reason sometimes, that power he thinks can't
1342220	1347420	be realized in a bodily organ, just as Aristotle said, but he gives a different argument that's
1347420	1354020	not found in Aristotle, and his argument is precisely on the basis of universals versus
1354020	1361020	particulars, and this is a little bit complicated and probably won't convince you, but here's
1361780	1368780	the argument anyway for what it's worth, so his idea is that if a universal were received
1369220	1376220	in a particular, like in an organ, then the universal would somehow be rendered particular,
1376980	1383980	and his idea here is something like this, if you think about the abstract idea of giraffe,
1384900	1391420	that's just a kind of form or essence or something like that, and it becomes a particular giraffe
1391420	1398420	because it's found in some matter, namely the matter that the giraffe is made of. He compares
1399140	1405860	this to the way a color could be received in a body or on a surface, so if a color appears
1405860	1409900	in a surface, then it will be rendered a particular instance of that color, and there'll be some
1409900	1415180	over here and some over here, so similarly when giraffeness is received by matter, you
1415180	1420380	get a particular giraffe of a certain size with a certain location, and it's really
1420380	1427220	matter that generates the particularity in some sense, or that explains the particularity.
1427220	1433980	Another way of thinking about this is in terms of individuation, so what makes this giraffe
1433980	1438460	and this giraffe, I should have brought two giraffes with me as display objects, but the
1438500	1443540	budget would not allow for it. I did ask Fedor, but apparently your university wouldn't support
1443540	1448900	me. Now you have to use your imagination, much-a-vanted imagination, which we share
1448900	1452780	with animals, so imagine there's a giraffe here and a giraffe here. What do they have
1452780	1457180	in common? What differentiates them? Well, in the first instance, what they have in common
1457180	1463620	is that they're both giraffes, so it's not giraffehood that makes them different. What
1463660	1470180	makes them different is things like there's one here and one there, spatial location, and
1470180	1477460	there's a long story, which actually Fedor has worked on, about how individuation works
1477460	1484460	in the scene, but to make a long story short, we can say that individuation is at least
1484460	1489580	correlated with matter, so when you have one hunk of matter turned into a giraffe over
1490020	1494460	here, and another hunk of matter turned into a giraffe over here, you get two giraffes,
1494460	1501460	whereas giraffehood is just one thing, so to speak. Similarly, if we were to receive
1503540	1510540	a universal idea in a bodily organ, like the brain, then that would constrain it or particularize
1511820	1517060	it. It would no longer be universal, it would be rendered particular, just as giraffehood
1517060	1521860	is rendered particular by being realized in one bit of matter rather than another bit
1521860	1528860	of matter. That's his proof for the immateriality of the rational soul. But, he thinks that
1531980	1536980	just as we've seen in the rest of the Aristotelian tradition, he holds on to this part of the
1536980	1543980	traditional view. He thinks that our other cognitive powers are all realized in the brain,
1544420	1551420	so the intellect is the only thing that we exercise without using a bodily organ. Obviously,
1552340	1559340	things like digestion, reproduction, or eyesight or hearing, obviously these things are manifested
1561500	1566580	and executed through bodily organs. It's less obvious that that's true with things like
1566580	1571740	imagination and memory, but he thinks that those are just as much seated in the brain
1571940	1576820	as, for example, your eyesight is seated in your eyes and your optic nerve and so on,
1576820	1583820	your whole visual system. Intellection is the exception. Only intellect is exercised
1583820	1590820	immaterially. The more that you think about this and the more detailed your story about
1594940	1600620	cognitive powers other than intellect becomes, the more you are accepting that there's quite
1600620	1605380	a large degree of overlap between humans and animals. Actually, although we're going
1605380	1611820	to get on to Faridina Razi, who argues against Ibn Sina by saying that there's even more
1611820	1617340	commonality between animals and humans than Ibn Sina thought, actually, in my opinion,
1617340	1623340	Ibn Sina is someone who should be recognized as really going very far in the direction
1623340	1628660	of admitting that there's a lot of overlap or a lot of commonality between humans and
1628700	1633940	animals. This is precisely because he was so interested in the cognitive powers that
1633940	1638900	we have that are shared with animals. In other words, the cognitive powers that somehow
1638900	1645100	fall short of intellect because they only deal with particulars. This brings us to his
1645100	1652100	celebrated theory of the internal senses. We have five external senses, hearing, sight,
1652100	1659100	hearing, smell, taste, touch, right, five. Similarly, this is very neat. We have five
1662580	1669580	internal senses. We've got five external senses, hearing, sight, et cetera. We have five internal
1670020	1677020	senses, the common sense, the retentive imagination, the estimation, which I'll say more about
1677020	1684020	in a second, memory and the compositive imagination. It actually doesn't matter very much how these
1684020	1691020	all work and what their functions are. As we can see from this Latin medieval drawing,
1691780	1696820	which is supposed to show Ibn Sina's theory, or what they would have called Abyssinus theory,
1696820	1700940	they're all seated in the brain. They're in different what he calls ventricles of the
1700940	1707060	brain. I think memory is in the back, for example. Actually, you can almost see them
1707060	1714060	in my case because they're so little in the way. He actually tells you where they are
1714580	1720620	in your brain, which lobes of the brain contain which powers. Again, what they all have in
1720620	1727020	common is that, of course, they're internal. They're in the brain. They're not realized
1727100	1732700	through something like eyes or ears or whatever, but also they deal with particulars. A really
1732700	1739700	nice example of this is the so-called estimation, or wahm in Arabic. Estimation is a misleading
1741780	1748300	translation here. The reason we often translate this word into English as estimation is that
1748300	1755300	it was translated as estimatio into Latin, but in English it conjures up the idea of
1755300	1760700	guessing or approximating, and that's not what we're talking about at all. I usually
1760700	1765540	just say, I just usually use the word wahm for it because there is no easy good translation
1765540	1772540	into English. This is a capacity that both humans and animals have, which allows them
1774020	1781020	to register the properties that particular things have that aren't detectable by the
1781380	1788380	external senses. His example is the, I couldn't believe I found this picture, by the way,
1788380	1792740	online, because it's so perfect. I'm going to use this in every slideshow for the rest
1792740	1798700	of my life as I talk about how to send a theory of wahm. His example is a sheep seeing
1798700	1805700	a wolf and doing what these sheep are doing, which is running away from the wolf and hoping
1806180	1813180	that they're not the slowest sheep. Why would a sheep do this? Ask yourself. Imagine you're
1815620	1822620	in an Aristotelian universe. A sheep can do whatever Aristotle would say the sheep can
1822740	1828460	do. The sheep can smell the wolf. The wolf smells, I don't know, have a wolf smell? Musty,
1828460	1835460	I'm thinking, and a musty. It can see that the wolf has a gray coat, and maybe can hear
1835620	1841740	the snarl, but none of these things are worth running away from. You don't run away from
1841740	1847860	the color gray, and you don't run away from the snarling noise just because of the noise.
1847860	1851460	If you ran away from the noise, it would be because of what the noise represents, which
1851460	1858220	you can't hear. Probably the sheep doesn't have memories of wolves that it's met in
1858220	1864980	the past because the sheep is still alive. In any case, sheep will run away from a wolf
1865020	1869540	the first time they see a wolf. They don't need to have experienced a wolf before. The
1869540	1874500	sheep doesn't need to imagine the wolf. Also, if it were imagining a wolf, it wouldn't run.
1874500	1881500	It would just go, ooh, wolves, I hate wolves. Rather, what's happening is that the sheep
1882340	1889340	looks at the wolf and is like, what the draft is with the line, oh, crap, that looks dangerous
1889900	1896900	or as Ibn Sina says, it's hostile, it's dangerous. It turns and runs like hell. How is it doing
1896900	1901940	this? Actually, I think Ibn Sina would say, well, Aristotle wouldn't be able to explain
1901940	1908940	this. But I can explain it. My explanation is that the sheep has a faculty called Wahm.
1909100	1915300	Wahm is the ability to detect things like hostility. Another cozier example is that
1915420	1922420	the sheep can also perceive the familiarity of its own offspring. That's why it kind of
1924100	1931100	nuzzles or takes care of its lamb, but it doesn't run from the lamb and it doesn't cozy
1931220	1936620	up to the wolf. It runs from the wolf and cozy's up to the lamb. The reason it is able
1936620	1943060	to do that is it has this power called Wahm. We have it too. What we're seeing here is
1943100	1950100	that actually, Ibn Sina has, in a way, gone quite far in the direction of expanding our
1953900	1960580	conception of what animals are capable of. I would say he offers us a picture of animal
1960580	1967340	mental life, which is very rich, because what he's left for humans to do uniquely is very
1967340	1972780	thin. It's just this kind of abstract universal thinking. Again, it's really important that
1972820	1978020	all of these complicated things and sophisticated things that animals can do are always going
1978020	1983220	to involve particulars as their cognitive content. The sheep will never start thinking
1983220	1989260	about, why do the wolves hate us so much? Is it because we're so delicious? They don't
1989260	1993940	think about it in that level. They're just like, here's a wolf. That's dangerous. I'm
1994020	1999020	running. That's all they do. There's no abstract thought.
1999020	2006020	Now, I gave not this paper, but a paper that had some of this material in it before. Teresa
2009020	2013740	Antirouard pointed out something to me that she had just been writing about in a paper
2013740	2019140	which wasn't published at the time, namely that there's a passage in part of the logic
2019820	2026820	of Ibn Sina's biggest philosophical work, the Shifa, that suggests that animals can
2027420	2034420	use Wahum to discriminate between species. This would be like my example, Gazintide.
2034940	2041940	As we say in Germany, Gazintide. This would be like the case I gave before, the giraffes
2042260	2048620	are like, oh, giraffes versus lions. You might think, well, doesn't that start to suggest
2048620	2055620	that animals do have the capacity to think at the level of universals? Maybe, but even
2057140	2061580	in this very passage, he still draws this hard and fast distinction between Wahum and
2061580	2068580	intellect, Akku. Even there, he's saying, well, if animals can classify particulars as
2070580	2075980	being of a certain type, they still can't engage in an intellect. Maybe there's some
2076020	2083020	ambiguity here between exactly how much he wants to pack into Wahum as opposed to Akku.
2083100	2087700	I find this passage quite puzzling, actually, how he can say this. Ultimately, it's going
2087700	2094700	to be really important for him that proper, as such, universal thinking is only going
2094820	2101500	to be possible for humans, and of course, God and angels, because only we have this
2101500	2108500	immaterial rational power. If you start saying that animals can grasp universals, then his
2109620	2114860	proof for the immateriality of the soul will go for them just as much as for us, and then
2114860	2119700	animal souls would be able to survive the death of their body, right? And you wouldn't
2119700	2126700	want that. Or would you? Maybe you would want that. Even Sino doesn't, so even Sino surely
2127580	2132740	does not think that animals survive the death of their body, but that doesn't necessarily
2132740	2139740	represent a kind of unified, unanimous opinion amongst Muslim scholars, because in fact,
2142620	2149380	in the Islamic theological tradition, the tradition that goes under the name of Qalaam in Arabic,
2149380	2156380	is commonly thought that animals also enjoy an afterlife. And there's good reason for
2158500	2165500	this, namely that there are passages in the Quran that suggest an afterlife for the animals.
2168100	2175100	For example, this is a passage from Quran 6.38, there's no creature on the earth or bird
2175540	2180460	that flies with its wings, except that they are communities like you. So it seems to imply
2180460	2185620	some kind of political life, maybe, for animals. But then the important part is, unto their
2185620	2190460	Lord they will be gathered. Well, that sounds like they're all going to heaven or something,
2190460	2196460	right? Or going to paradise. And on the basis of this, and also on the basis that you don't
2196460	2203460	want injustice in God's creation without it being somehow counterbalanced by some kind
2205140	2212140	of justice, some motakalimun theologians said things like, oh, well, when animals are savagely
2213820	2220520	torn to bits by predators, that's sad for them. But the good news is then they go to
2220520	2226700	paradise and they get lots of nice food to make it up to them. So as an author who's
2226700	2233700	written about this has said, for this particular school of Qalaam, God is like a cosmic bookkeeper
2235140	2241100	who's like, oh, well, this giraffe got savaged to death by lions. So the giraffe will get
2241100	2246460	you know, 30 years of really nice acacia leaves or something in paradise. And then God is
2246460	2250100	like, okay, you've been rewarded enough to make up for that. It's sorry about that thing
2250100	2254460	that happened to you, 30 years in it. I know that was rough. But look at all the nice leaves
2254460	2259500	you've got, right? That might be a little bit too crude a way of thinking about it, but
2259500	2266500	somehow God makes it up to them in the afterlife. And in general, there's a very strong trend
2269060	2273660	in Qalaam of thinking that animals somehow participate in the afterlife, which brings
2273660	2279840	us to Fahad al-Nirazi, because it is precisely in the context of talking about the afterlife
2279840	2285220	in a work of his called the Molachas, which was only just recently edited. But actually
2285220	2291220	when we started working on this, we were looking at the work in manuscripts. So this
2291220	2297740	is like a very recently, a work that's only very recently started to get studied. So it's
2297740	2305740	one of several works he wrote that kind of survey philosophical and theological questions,
2305740	2312660	across a variety of topics. So he's talking about the afterlife. And then without really
2312700	2319300	explaining that that's the relevant context, he says, now here's a question. Do animals
2319300	2324780	have rational souls or not? Do they have rational souls like humans, or do they have a different
2324780	2330140	kind of soul like the philosophers would say? And although he doesn't spell this out, I
2330140	2337140	think that, and I've written a paper about this with Bly, we think that he must be thinking
2338140	2345140	the reason why it's worth discussing this is that if animals didn't have rational souls,
2345140	2351660	then at least according to Ibn Sina's arguments for the immateriality and hence immortality
2351660	2358660	of our soul, if they don't have rational souls, then they must die when their bodies die,
2358780	2363660	and then they wouldn't have an afterlife. But as a theologian, he wants to at least be
2363700	2370700	open to the possibility that animals do have an afterlife. Now, so this is actually, typically
2370740	2374860	for him, this is quite a complicated thing going on here, because what he's thinking
2374860	2381860	is, well, if I were an Avicenan philosopher, then I would think that the only way for animals
2382700	2388380	to have an afterlife is for them to be rational. Now, actually, he's not an Avicenan philosopher,
2388380	2394740	he's a critic of Ibn Sina, but what he wants to do, I think, is to suggest, well, I'm going
2394740	2399580	to give an argument that would show Ibn Sina that he should admit that animals have an
2399580	2405500	afterlife. And then if I can show that, since theologians, also with their own kind of theory
2405500	2410500	of the soul and whatever, if they would also think that animals would have an afterlife,
2410500	2416580	then everyone could sort of agree. So this is almost like a way of saying, well, even
2416620	2422220	the kind of toughest nut to crack, namely an Aristotelian slash Avicenan position, should
2422220	2426300	still think that animals have an afterlife, because they should admit that animals are
2426300	2429780	rational, and if they admit that animals are rational, then they should admit that animals
2429780	2435780	have an afterlife. Now, that's obviously imputing a lot to him, because he doesn't spell anything,
2435780	2442780	any of that out in the text, but I think that's the kind of basis for the argument. In any
2443780	2449580	case, even if you kind of set that aside, what's really worth our interest is the way
2449580	2456020	he argues for animal rationality. And as we're going to see, he really kind of presupposes
2456020	2463020	the truth of Ibn Sina's own way of thinking about rationality. Because if you think about
2463020	2466620	it, there's two ways you could go at this, right? You could say, well, you say that
2466660	2473660	intellection or rationality, akka, is characterized by universal abstract thought. But that's not
2473660	2480660	true. I'm using my intellect when I decide what to have for dinner, right? Cake, maybe.
2482380	2488060	Bad choice, but a choice nonetheless. But then he knows that Ibn Sina would say, no, no,
2488060	2492660	no, no, that's just imagination. Or you know, you're remembering some cake you had, you're
2492700	2496940	imagining the cake you could have, you're engaging in something that's not full blown
2496940	2501820	intellection. So that doesn't count. So what he's going to do is maybe for the sake of
2501820	2506260	arguments, he's going to say, let's suppose that intellection is what you say it is. And
2506260	2512860	I'm going to show you that animals by that criterion must have intellect. And this is
2512860	2516700	really clear from the first argument he gives. There's five arguments I'm going to give you
2516700	2523140	two of them. And the first argument comes in kind of free with three cases to illustrate
2523140	2530140	it. So the first argument is that animals must have the ability to grasp universals as
2530180	2537180	such. They don't only grasp particulars. Why? Well, first of all, even exercise, and this
2539300	2545180	I think is a really remarkable thing to say, even the exercise of sense perception involves
2545220	2552220	grasping universals. Because to see a wolf and see it as something other than just a
2553140	2560140	patch of gray is to see it as a wolf. Now, this is actually an interesting question in
2561500	2565540	Aristotelian philosophy. So what would Aristotle say about this? What does Aristotle think
2565540	2572540	about seeing something as a wolf? He might say, well, properly speaking, what you see
2573100	2578980	is something gray. But then you kind of layer on top of that the information that it's a
2578980	2585980	wolf or something like that. But Fahredin is thinking, well, take this example that
2586500	2593460	we have for the Messina, the sheep seeing the wolf, seeing that the wolf is dangerous.
2593460	2600460	It must be able to perceive the wolf as a wolf, as a member of a hostile species, in
2601420	2607340	order to react appropriately. So all of that kind of abstract universal content is already
2607340	2612180	built into sense perception. It's a profoundly un-Aristotelian thing to say, or at least
2612180	2616420	if not un-Aristotelian, it's against the Aristotelian tradition. There's exactly what
2616420	2621900	Aristotelians have been denying for literally more than a thousand years. So they've always
2621900	2626500	said sense perception is of particulars, not universals. And Fahredin is like, ah, if you
2626540	2632140	think about it, sense perception is of universals too, because you're classifying or you're
2632140	2637740	sort of subsuming the particular that you see under a particular universal in order to react
2637740	2643060	to it appropriately. And it's obvious that animals can do this. There's quite a remarkable
2643060	2650060	move on his part. And the next case he gives, another illustration of the fact that animals
2650860	2657860	can grasp universals, is if anything, even more clever. So let's imagine that the sheep
2659340	2666340	sees the wolf, and it turns to run. So now it's intending to run, okay? And an Aristotelian
2667900	2674500	would say, no problem, it runs. But Fahredin says, well, hang on a second. Is it intending
2674540	2681300	to perform the particular act of running it's about to perform? No. It's not like, oh, I'm
2681300	2687020	going to run exactly in this way, away from this wolf, like I'm going to put my foot exactly
2687020	2691940	there and exactly there. No. It's going to just run like hell. Any act of running would
2691940	2697260	be fine, right? Any act of running that will get it away from the wolf would be perfectly
2697260	2703260	adequate. In fact, probably it couldn't think, it couldn't intend very exactly to perform
2703260	2710260	a particular act of running. This might actually connect to something that you, there's an argument
2712580	2718620	that you sometimes get in Calam, which is that God and not we must be the creator of
2718620	2724780	our acts, because we aren't able to create particular acts down to the level of finest
2724780	2731220	detail. Why? How do we know this? Well, an example that he gives, imagine you write your
2731220	2738020	name and then someone says to you, okay, now write your name again, exactly the same, down
2738020	2743860	to the molecule. No chance, right? You wouldn't even be able to come close. You could make
2743860	2748660	something, you could make a signature or something that looks basically similar, but of course
2748660	2753900	you couldn't make something exactly identical in every detail, whereas God could. And then
2753900	2757020	they say, well, if you can't do it the second time, then obviously you can't do it the first
2757020	2763340	time. If you were capable of producing this, then you could do it again, but you can't.
2763340	2768700	So it must be God creating your signature and not you. This is an argument for occasionalism.
2768700	2771700	Whether that's in the background here, I'm not sure, but it's very similar, it's a very
2771700	2776860	similar thought. So the idea is that the sheep is not going to be able to intend to perform
2776860	2783860	exactly the act of running that it performs. It can only intend generically to run. And
2784860	2789980	that's, I think, is a brilliant argument. So this is showing that what is in them, as
2789980	2796660	it were, in the mind of the sheep is a universal, namely running and not a particular, namely
2796660	2802140	the particular act of running it's about to perform. Very clever. Third example, and this
2802140	2808740	may be the easiest, is imagine a sheep that's looking for grass. And he actually gives the
2808740	2813460	example of looking for grass, of an animal looking for grass. He says, the animal's not
2813500	2819700	looking for some particular grass. Oh, no, not that one. I had some different grass in
2819700	2823300	mind. They don't care, they're just looking for grass. In other words, they're looking
2823300	2829100	for something that instantiates the universal grass. So again, what is, as it were, in their
2829100	2836100	mind has to be a universal, not a particular. I mean, think about it like this. All of the
2836100	2842980	particular examples of grass that the sheep have ever seen are precisely the ones that
2842980	2847700	aren't relevant, because they've already been eaten by the sheep and the sheep's friends.
2847700	2852360	What I'm looking for is some grass that I've never experienced yet. So I'm precisely looking
2852360	2858620	not for the particular grass as I've seen, but for a new one, like, I'll go over there.
2858620	2863900	He also has this nice example of smelling that there's some grass and being like, oh, that
2863900	2871300	must be some grass. Not some particular grass, but just grass. Now, I think this is interesting
2871300	2875780	now to think about what an Aristotelian slash Abyssinian would say in response. Maybe they
2875780	2883640	would say, well, the animal is not grasping these things qua universal. So they're somehow
2883640	2889820	operating as if they had a universal in their mind, but they don't because they're not sort
2889820	2896900	of explicitly entertaining the universal and thinking about it as such. But if that's the
2896900	2901340	answer, I think it's not a very good one. Because remember that Abyssinian's argument
2901340	2907580	was in order to receive the universal at all, you have to have an immaterial power. And it
2907580	2914700	looks like they are, and it looks like to operate with a universal concept, the animal needs
2914700	2920980	to have such an immaterial power whether or not it's thinking about it as such. So I actually
2920980	2935620	think Fakhredin's argument here is very convincing. Oh, sorry, these slides are in the wrong order.
2935620	2940900	There's another argument, the fourth one, where he just reels off a very short list of amazing
2940900	2946100	things that animals do. And there's a parallel text in another work, which I also wrote an
2946100	2957300	article about, about all these sort of amazing things that animals, like amazing behaviors
2957300	2962780	that animals display. He gives the example of hexagonal cells in a beehive. He gives
2962780	2968420	an example that our colleague Sarah Vergi wrote a whole paper about. This is an example
2968420	2973260	that comes up already in antiquity and then a whole series of texts in the Islamic world.
2973260	2979340	The example is a mouse wants to get at some oil in a bottle, apparently mice like to
2979340	2987180	sip oil, I didn't know this. And the bottle has a narrow neck, and it's too narrow for
2987180	2992980	the animal to poke its head in and lick the oil. So what it does is it sits on top, dips
2992980	3000580	its tail into the oil, sort of swirls its tail around, pulls it out and licks its tail.
3001100	3006180	I don't know if mice actually do this, but you can sort of imagine a mouse doing this.
3006180	3012540	And the idea is if animals can do this, then they must be just as capable of reasoning
3012540	3022060	as humans are. This is just supposed to amaze you with the things that animals do. So the
3022060	3029700	upshot is that animals can grasp universals, they can engage in reasoning, means and reasoning
3029740	3034660	like we just saw with the mouse, the kind of universal reasoning that is needed to engage
3034660	3044220	in sense perception, look for food, perform motions. And that should show that animals,
3044220	3048620	whatever you say about human reasoning, you should say about animals too. So if humans
3048620	3052460	can do this because they have immaterial souls, then you should say that animals have immaterial
3052500	3060660	souls. There might be another thing that's in play here, namely that in general Farhaddin
3060660	3065580	is quite skeptical of what you might call the faculty psychology theory that we find
3065580	3072340	in Aristotelianism where you have like sensation and imagination and memory and so on. Farhaddin,
3072340	3076340	along with some other philosophers of the period, especially someone named Abu Barakat
3076340	3082020	al-Baghdadi, who's going to be relevant again in a second, they thought that this is kind
3082020	3087620	of a wrong way of approaching philosophical psychology and that what you should say is
3087620	3094140	that you have a soul, which is just one kind of power, and it can do a whole bunch of things.
3094140	3099580	So rather than, I mean this is kind of a tendentious way of thinking about the Abbasin and Slash
3099580	3105020	Aristotelian position, but they would say, well they think that you see that what sees
3105140	3114140	is your vision and what imagines is your imagination, whereas we think that when I imagine the
3114140	3119580	person, the thing that's imagining is just me, right? So it's just one of many actions
3119580	3126060	that I can perform. So they're trying to articulate a view according to which there's this single
3126060	3134580	subject of cognition, which we might call the self, and this self is just what does everything.
3134780	3141260	And the reason why I think that might be relevant is that it's, given what we've seen from Fahaddin
3141260	3147580	about animals, it looks like he's trying to question this very hard and fast kind of
3147580	3152980	leveled theory of cognition, where you have reason up here and imagination and sensation
3152980	3159100	down here. So for example, think about what he said in the first argument here. You can't
3159140	3165020	even do sense perception without using intellect, right? So that would kind of push you in the
3165020	3170460	direction of thinking that different forms of cognition kind of involve each other, and
3170460	3175620	that would go along very nicely with the idea that it's just one self or soul doing all
3175620	3181300	the cognition rather than the idea that you have these separate faculties which somehow
3181340	3193340	get put together to form a rich mental life. Okay, in any case, what we've seen is that,
3193340	3199620	as I say, we have all these examples of clever things that animals do, some of them actually
3199620	3203980	drawn from in the Sina, and even going all the way back to Aristotle, and this should
3204020	3211020	show that animals too are intelligent. And all of this is within, to some extent, within
3211260	3216860	the framework of the conventional view, right, the traditional Aristotelian view, because
3216860	3223860	he's assuming that the possession of reason somehow goes along with the ability to outlive
3223980	3230980	the death of the body, right? That's, I think, the whole point. Now then, one thing about
3231900	3238900	Razzi is that he always will consider objections on every side of every dispute, so he will
3240100	3244300	very rarely advance a position without then saying, well, but there's an objection to
3244300	3251300	this position, so that's what he does to here, and he says, well, here's an objection.
3252660	3258580	If animals were rational, then there'd only be one kind of soul, and probably he's not
3258620	3262940	thinking about plants, right? Because he has to argue that plants are rational, or that
3262940	3268580	plants can engage in sense perception. So there'd only be a single kind of soul, which
3268580	3273980	is jointly shared by humans and animals, and so he wouldn't even have a distinction between
3273980	3280980	these different kinds of soul anymore, right? Now, actually, this is an interesting, there's
3281580	3288580	an interesting kind of long running debate here. If you think about it, we kind of very
3290740	3297740	naturally associate, in the Aristotelian tradition, the idea that we very naturally associate
3298380	3303500	different types of soul with different kind of levels of existence, right? So there's
3303500	3308940	human rational souls, there's animal souls, and then there's plant souls, so we think
3308940	3314700	there are three kinds of souls, but you wouldn't have to do it like that, right? So for example,
3314700	3320820	you could say there's plant souls, and there's non-plant souls, so you could be less fine
3320820	3325620	grained, or you could be more fine grained, right? So for example, you could say there's
3325620	3330100	the kind of soul that really smart people have, and then there's the kind of soul that
3330100	3335420	kind of dumb people have, and then in between there's sort of the mediocre souls, and then
3335460	3342460	there's the animal souls, right? Or you could say that there's the carnivorous souls and
3343580	3350340	the plantiferous souls, herbivorous, yes, herbivorous souls, right? You could have carved
3350340	3354980	it up in all kinds of ways, to use a very apt metaphor given all the tearing apart of
3354980	3360380	limbs we've been discussing during this talk. So why do it this way? And in fact, just in
3360420	3365340	an immediate environment of Fakhreddin, there's been a slightly earlier philosopher named
3365340	3369980	Abu Barakat Al-Baghdadi who said, well, actually, maybe different humans have different kinds
3369980	3376020	of souls, so maybe courageous people have one kind of soul, and cowardly people have another
3376020	3383020	kind of soul. This is an idea that has just been flirted with in the tradition. But Fakhreddin
3383020	3388180	doesn't really like, he doesn't really want to smash all the different kinds of souls
3388220	3393300	together, nor does he want to say that there are different species of human soul. He wants
3393300	3398140	to adhere to the traditional idea that there are human souls and non-human souls, animal
3398140	3403420	souls, and that you can somehow distinguish them. Yet, now he's saying, well, I can't
3403420	3409100	define human souls just in respect of their rationality, because I'm now suggesting that
3409140	3416140	animal souls can be rational as well. So what he says is, there might be, and by the way,
3422420	3426860	sorry, I should have gotten to this slide first. He actually mentions this thing from
3426860	3433860	Abu Barakat about courageous and cowardly souls, and he says, this is like lions and rabbits.
3434060	3440260	So lions have one kind of soul, rabbits have another kind of soul, lions are brave, rabbits
3440260	3447260	are timid. But the fact that, and so you can find these differences if you want, but the
3448260	3453820	fact that there might be some kind of shared commonality between human souls and animal
3453820	3460500	souls doesn't prove that there's no difference between human souls and animal souls, because
3460540	3466100	maybe animals have reason, and we have reason, but we have more of it than they do. So we're
3466100	3472780	intelligent to a much greater degree than animals are intelligent, and that's really
3472780	3479780	the difference. So his idea here would apparently be that there's a kind of continuum of intelligence
3481820	3488820	from animals up to humans with us at the top, or maybe we're not at the top actually,
3489020	3494300	because probably angels, and for sure God, are more intelligent and rational than we are,
3494300	3499060	so maybe we're actually sort of in the middle. But if you leave these exalted beings out
3499060	3504540	in the natural world, we're the most intelligent, rational creatures, and then animals are less
3504540	3509900	rational and intelligent than us, and plants are not rational and intelligent at all. Something
3509900	3514140	he doesn't get into, one would really like to know what he thinks about this. He doesn't
3514180	3519660	get that much into the question of whether non-human animals are at different places
3519660	3525100	on the scale, but it's kind of suggested by these passages where he gives you all of these
3525100	3529980	examples of clever animals, because of course not all animals are capable of this kind of
3529980	3536260	clever behavior, like slugs don't do things like dipping their tail in oil and licking
3536260	3540780	it, and it's not just because they don't have tongues. Maybe slugs do have tongues. Slug
3540820	3545740	ologists in the house? Anyone? No? Okay, let's say for the sake of argument, slugs don't have
3545740	3552900	tongues. Even if they had tongues, they couldn't do this, right? Dogs are smarter than turtles.
3552900	3560740	I have no idea how smart turtles are. They're very smart, just rather slow. But you see what I
3560740	3565620	mean, right? So there's probably a continuum of smartness of intelligence within the animal
3565620	3570620	kingdom. He doesn't really get into that. He kind of gestures towards it by talking about what some
3570660	3578060	animals can do. But the really interesting thing would be that if you have human intelligence as
3578060	3584020	the kind of gold standard, then you would have some like, at least fairly smart animals that are
3584020	3589260	less intelligent than us, but still rational, and that would secure their participation in the
3589260	3596980	afterlife. So hence the title of the talk. So I said that the talk would be about an Islamic
3596980	3604580	thinker who's denying human exceptionalism. And it's true that we're not exceptional on his view,
3604580	3610100	at least if you, I mean, there are some texts where he is kind of noncommittal about all of this,
3610100	3614700	but at least in the mulachas, this one text we've been looking at, he seems to be quite committed
3614700	3621500	to the view that animals are intelligent. But they're not as intelligent as we are. And in that
3621500	3625860	sense, we do remain exceptional. And of course, that is important for him as a theologian too,
3626220	3633860	because God's relationship towards animals may be benevolent. He may give animals an afterlife. He
3633860	3639140	may even accept praise from animals. There are texts that say that animal calls and the noises
3639140	3645620	they make are prayers to God that we don't understand and so on. But still God's relationship to
3645620	3649660	humans is going to be very different from his relationship to the rest of the animal kingdom.
3649660	3652740	And he would want it that way. Thanks very much.
