WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.800
So this, thank you very much Fedor, actually Fedor did not mention that he wrote the index

00:19.800 --> 00:23.400
for one of the books based on the podcast, or at least one of them, maybe more than one

00:23.400 --> 00:29.960
of them, and we know each other for a long time, so it's great to be here at his invitation.

00:29.960 --> 00:36.800
This indeed is going to be a presentation of some of the work I did in this ERC project,

00:36.800 --> 00:43.160
especially together with one of the then postdocs who's now at Fordham University named Blyosoma,

00:43.160 --> 00:50.880
and it's about a philosopher theologian named Fahradin Arasi, who lived in the 12th, just

00:50.880 --> 00:56.160
barely into the 13th century, and what he thought about animals.

00:56.160 --> 01:04.600
The payoff of the talk is that he thought that animals can be rational or intelligent,

01:04.600 --> 01:09.280
depending on how you want to translate the key term, which is a very surprising thing

01:09.280 --> 01:14.120
for someone to have thought in the 12th century.

01:14.120 --> 01:19.560
Just think about the fact that in the Aristotelian tradition, it's very common to just define

01:19.560 --> 01:25.840
human as rational animal, implying that all the other animals are non-rational.

01:25.920 --> 01:32.160
That's maybe a definition they just kind of throw around without thinking about it very

01:32.160 --> 01:36.840
much, but it is also something that they seem to be committed to.

01:36.840 --> 01:44.360
In this talk, I'm going to present that idea, the sort of orthodox view, that only humans

01:44.360 --> 01:50.320
are rational, why they might have thought this, and then I'm going to talk a little

01:50.320 --> 01:57.000
bit about a philosopher who's the immediate context for understanding Fahradin's position,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.720
who's the most important philosopher of the Islamic tradition named Ibn Sina, maybe more

02:01.720 --> 02:06.600
famous under the name of Avicenna, and the reason I need to talk about him is that it's

02:06.600 --> 02:12.520
really to him that Fahradin is responding when he makes this argument that animals can

02:12.520 --> 02:14.960
also be rational.

02:14.960 --> 02:20.520
But first, let's start with the conventional, or orthodox view, and of course we have to

02:20.520 --> 02:25.080
start with Aristotle as so often.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.560
Aristotle has a lot to say about animals.

02:27.560 --> 02:34.720
In fact, one of the kind of mysterious things about ancient philosophy is that Aristotle

02:34.720 --> 02:42.760
writes this vast corpus of works on zoology, so we've got the parts of animals on the generation

02:42.760 --> 02:50.000
of animals, on the motion of animals, history of animals, and unlike other works of his

02:50.000 --> 02:56.480
on logic, on physics, on the soul, on metaphysics, on ethics, these works don't receive any commentaries

02:56.480 --> 02:57.480
in late antiquity.

02:57.480 --> 03:03.920
In fact, there's no Greek commentary on any of his zoological works until the Byzantine

03:03.920 --> 03:10.680
period when a group of commentators who are gathered around a queen, or at least princess

03:10.680 --> 03:16.120
named Anna Komnena, decide to write commentaries on all the texts by Aristotle that haven't

03:16.120 --> 03:18.680
already been commented on in antiquity.

03:18.680 --> 03:24.840
So this is a kind of underappreciated feature of Aristotle's corpus in antiquity.

03:24.840 --> 03:30.160
In the medieval period it gets some attention in Latin, especially from Albert the Great,

03:30.160 --> 03:32.000
the teacher of Aquinas.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.920
So he writes about zoology, he also writes about botany, he was a very intrepid natural

03:36.920 --> 03:43.760
philosopher, did things like repelling down cliffs to look at nests of birds.

03:43.760 --> 03:44.760
Very cool.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.960
They don't call him Albert the Great for nothing.

03:47.960 --> 03:55.120
But it's also true that the zoological works are quite valued in the Arabic tradition.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.360
So they were translated into Arabic, they were translated as a single work, just called

03:59.360 --> 04:04.360
a hayawan, so animals, that's just one big text.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.640
And they were known to people like Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd and so on, Ibn Sina actually writes

04:08.640 --> 04:12.080
a work of his own on animals that's kind of based on it.

04:12.080 --> 04:18.000
So Aristotle's absolutely a fundamental source of information about animals.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.560
And the information is often quite detailed.

04:21.560 --> 04:27.480
So the anatomy of animals, the way that their embryos look, the way that they move, like

04:27.480 --> 04:31.880
the difference between flying animals, four footed animals, two footed animals, what do

04:31.880 --> 04:35.600
they eat, where do they live, and so on.

04:35.600 --> 04:42.320
History of animals also has some information in it, which is a little bit fanciful, like

04:42.320 --> 04:46.560
animals healing themselves by deliberately eating certain herbs or things like that.

04:46.560 --> 04:51.000
But by and large, Aristotle's observations of animals are very impressive.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.240
He himself did dissections of animals, often of marine life, and he described many, many

04:58.240 --> 05:00.960
animals and animal structures for the first time.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.800
So the dude is really into animals.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.640
Okay, that's what I'm trying to communicate to you here.

05:07.640 --> 05:15.240
And in fact, I would say it's really amongst his most amazing achievements is his empirical

05:15.240 --> 05:17.600
work on the animal world.

05:17.600 --> 05:26.760
Yet, in some sense, he rates animals kind of low in another respect, namely that he doesn't

05:26.760 --> 05:32.320
really ascribe to animals very high cognitive powers.

05:32.320 --> 05:41.320
In particular, he draws a really kind of rigorous divide between humans on the one hand who

05:41.320 --> 05:48.440
have the capacity for reasoning and what he calls a noose, which means intellect.

05:48.440 --> 05:52.880
So we've got humans on the one hand, and we've got animals on the other hand who only have

05:52.880 --> 05:59.480
animal souls and are capable of sensation and motion.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.360
So in other words, they can move around.

06:01.360 --> 06:05.760
That differentiates them from plants, because plants can only engage in the powers of the

06:05.760 --> 06:06.760
vegetative soul.

06:06.760 --> 06:07.960
In other words, the plant soul.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.240
So that's kind of tautologist.

06:09.240 --> 06:15.260
But what that would mean is the ability to reproduce and the ability to engage in nutrition.

06:15.260 --> 06:17.280
So plants can take in food and water.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.360
They can make more plants.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.760
They can reproduce.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.840
Animals can do those things.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.160
They can also perceive.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.720
They can also move around.

06:25.720 --> 06:30.920
But only humans can think rationally.

06:30.920 --> 06:36.680
That's something that we share in common with God, which is not an insignificant fact.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.000
So there's something divine about humans.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.120
At the end of the ethics, Aristotle says that the life of philosophy is almost more than

06:45.120 --> 06:49.040
human, because it allows us to partake in divinity.

06:49.040 --> 06:53.840
So even for all that he has a lot to say about animals and for all that he was extremely

06:53.840 --> 07:00.720
interested in them, he still draws this very hard and fast divide between non-human animals

07:00.720 --> 07:05.640
on the one hand and humans on the other hand.

07:05.640 --> 07:10.600
Something else that we're going to see is going to be important is that he says that

07:10.600 --> 07:17.900
the mind, the human mind, does not have a bodily organ through which it is exercised.

07:17.900 --> 07:22.780
So he does not think that you're thinking with your heart, well, he doesn't think you're

07:22.780 --> 07:25.780
thinking with your brain, because he doesn't think the brain does very much.

07:25.780 --> 07:29.300
He thinks it's a kind of cooling element in your body.

07:29.300 --> 07:33.100
But also he doesn't think you're thinking with your heart, even though your sensation

07:33.100 --> 07:37.780
and some of your other cognitive powers are seated in the heart, like probably your imagination

07:37.780 --> 07:40.660
is seated in the heart, but not your mind.

07:40.660 --> 07:46.780
Also your intellect, noose, is exercised without any bodily organ.

07:46.780 --> 07:51.700
And later philosophers, and we're going to see this in Sinai, later philosophers thought

07:51.700 --> 07:57.700
that this is a sign that Aristotle would believe that you can survive the death of your body,

07:57.700 --> 08:01.380
because if you don't need a bodily organ to think, then why wouldn't you be able to keep

08:01.380 --> 08:07.180
thinking after you die?

08:07.180 --> 08:12.900
Now here's a question that people, I think, don't ask themselves enough.

08:12.900 --> 08:16.060
Why in the world would Aristotle have thought this?

08:16.060 --> 08:22.100
Why would he think that animals can't think, or can't engage in reason or intellect?

08:22.100 --> 08:25.820
After all, animals do all kinds of problem-solving.

08:25.820 --> 08:30.620
They build amazing things like webs and nests.

08:30.620 --> 08:35.980
We're going to see later on that this is important for Fahddin, they even apparently

08:35.980 --> 08:42.660
can do geometry, think about beehives, perfect hexagons that tessellate, I wouldn't be able

08:42.660 --> 08:45.220
to build something like that.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.860
So animals do all kinds of amazing things.

08:47.860 --> 08:52.740
And if there's anyone in the entire ancient world who's extremely aware of the amazing

08:52.740 --> 08:59.140
things that animals do, it's Aristotle, as I just said, due to superintent animals.

08:59.140 --> 09:05.540
So why does he think that animals fall not just below humans in this respect, but why

09:05.540 --> 09:09.900
does he see this very striking difference between animals and humans?

09:09.900 --> 09:13.220
Well there's maybe two reasons.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.500
One is that animals are not capable of language.

09:16.500 --> 09:21.940
So he may have a very strong connection in his mind between rational thinking and language,

09:21.940 --> 09:24.980
especially if you think about the Greek words involved here.

09:24.980 --> 09:30.940
So the word for language is logos, and that's also the word for reason, or the word rational

09:30.940 --> 09:33.060
is logike.

09:33.060 --> 09:38.220
So there's a very strong drive, even through the Greek language itself, to associate reasoning

09:38.220 --> 09:40.460
with language.

09:40.460 --> 09:41.940
That's one thing.

09:41.940 --> 09:48.340
Another thing is that he may have quite a narrow understanding of what intellect or reasoning

09:48.340 --> 09:50.980
actually involves.

09:50.980 --> 09:55.580
If you think that what it means to engage in intellect or reasoning is something like

09:55.580 --> 10:01.940
to engage in abstract thinking about general features of the universe, and that does seem

10:01.940 --> 10:06.020
to be what he thinks is a long story, what he thinks intellect is, so we don't have time

10:06.020 --> 10:07.020
to get into.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.340
We can talk about that in the Q&A if you want.

10:09.340 --> 10:14.140
But if it's something like that, abstract thinking about general features of the universe,

10:14.140 --> 10:19.100
then it's actually quite plausible to say that animals don't do that.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.480
Basically animals don't do philosophy.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.220
So that's why we should say they don't engage in reasoning.

10:24.220 --> 10:27.620
Of course most humans don't engage in philosophy either.

10:27.620 --> 10:30.420
So there's us.

10:30.420 --> 10:35.780
So the people in this room are better than animals.

10:35.780 --> 10:42.300
Whether everyone else outside the room is, I mean it's a university, but there may be

10:42.300 --> 10:47.180
this kind of elitist attitude that all of the non-scientists, non-philosophers are kind

10:47.180 --> 10:50.180
of like cows.

10:50.180 --> 10:55.500
And this is something you see again and again actually in the later history of philosophy.

10:55.500 --> 11:00.980
For example, Ibn Rushd or Averwes, the great medieval Muslim commentator on Aristotle,

11:00.980 --> 11:11.180
says at one point that most humans are human in name only because they don't do philosophy.

11:11.180 --> 11:16.300
And this actually is not an unimportant, I mean it's kind of funny, but it's also got

11:16.300 --> 11:17.980
a very dark side.

11:17.980 --> 11:22.540
So when they discovered the Americas, they were like, well these people don't do philosophy,

11:22.540 --> 11:25.740
so we can basically treat them as if they were herd animals.

11:25.740 --> 11:31.500
So this is not unimportant, this feature of Aristotelianism.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.380
So that's Aristotle's position.

11:34.380 --> 11:39.420
We don't need to put the blame for all of that on Aristotle, but he sort of kicks off

11:39.420 --> 11:41.820
this way of thinking about humans and animals.

11:41.820 --> 11:44.220
And for the most part other ancient philosophers agree.

11:44.220 --> 11:51.900
So in particular the Stoics agree, and the Platonists maybe agree sometimes.

11:51.900 --> 11:55.740
So there are exceptions, and they come mostly in the Platonic tradition.

11:55.740 --> 12:02.260
In particular there's a second century philosopher who's a Platonist named Plutarch, and a third

12:02.260 --> 12:07.060
fourth century philosopher named Porphyry, who is the student of Plotinus, the founder

12:07.060 --> 12:10.900
of Neoplatonism, if that means anything to you.

12:10.900 --> 12:16.620
Porphyry wrote a work using some material from Plutarch in which he argues explicitly

12:16.620 --> 12:22.020
that animals can use language, and he gives a whole bunch of reasons to think that they

12:22.020 --> 12:27.100
can use language, as he says, we don't understand them, but we don't understand people from

12:27.100 --> 12:31.180
Skithia either, but we don't say that they're not rational.

12:31.180 --> 12:35.340
So when the animals seem to be communicating with each other, so probably that just speaking

12:35.340 --> 12:41.500
a language we can't understand, he also gives examples of animals that can respond to linguistic

12:41.500 --> 12:42.500
commands.

12:42.500 --> 12:48.940
Because he had a pet bird who could do this, and what he says is, so attacking this link

12:48.940 --> 12:55.420
between reasoning and language in the Stoics rather than Aristotle, he says that the Stoics

12:55.420 --> 13:00.940
are wrong to deny intelligence to animals on the basis that they can't talk, because

13:00.940 --> 13:05.140
in fact they probably can talk, at least some of them can talk.

13:05.140 --> 13:10.180
But Plutarch and Porphyry, it's interesting as they aren't really relevant for us today,

13:10.180 --> 13:13.300
because their works were not translated into Arabic, or at least these works by them were

13:13.300 --> 13:16.780
not translated into Arabic, so they kind of fall out of the story.

13:16.780 --> 13:22.820
And what's communicated to the Arabic tradition is basically a unified view, according to

13:22.820 --> 13:29.740
which animals are non-rational, and that completely differentiates them from humans.

13:29.740 --> 13:36.540
Okay, now let's think a little bit more about what I was saying just a moment ago, namely

13:36.540 --> 13:44.540
that animal cognition falls below human cognition, because it doesn't involve thinking abstractly

13:44.540 --> 13:48.660
about general features of the universe.

13:48.660 --> 13:52.380
So I want to flesh that out a little bit.

13:52.380 --> 13:58.260
What this would mean in the terms that become familiar in the Arabic tradition, but to some

13:58.260 --> 14:04.060
extent this is all pretty well grounded in Aristotle himself, would be that animals can

14:04.060 --> 14:10.620
only grasp particulars, they can't grasp generalities.

14:10.620 --> 14:22.340
So what this would mean is that, for example, a mother giraffe could see that another animal

14:22.340 --> 14:27.460
is a giraffe, maybe, and they would certainly be able to recognize particular giraffes,

14:27.460 --> 14:32.860
like the mother can recognize her own offspring, that's not a problem, and of course they

14:32.860 --> 14:38.180
can sort of differentiate between giraffes and non-giraffes, like if you put another giraffe

14:38.180 --> 14:46.740
in front of a giraffe, the giraffe will be like giraffe, okay, whereas if you put a lion

14:46.740 --> 14:53.180
in front of the giraffe, the giraffe will be like, oh, crap, and it will turn and run

14:53.180 --> 14:57.980
away with that loping stride that we're so familiar with, right, so they react appropriately,

14:58.260 --> 15:03.620
but to do that they don't need to have the notion of giraffes as opposed to lions, right,

15:03.620 --> 15:08.380
like they don't need to think about the species of lion or the species of giraffe, they just

15:08.380 --> 15:14.260
have to be like, oh, there's a dangerous animal, I'm going to run, there's a safe animal so

15:14.260 --> 15:17.500
I'm not going to run.

15:17.500 --> 15:24.380
Now obviously we also grasp particulars all the time, right, and in fact, as I was saying,

15:24.380 --> 15:29.820
a lot of humans may not think at the level of generalities very often or even at all,

15:29.820 --> 15:36.020
so you can do things like enjoy a nice piece of cake without engaging in any general abstract

15:36.020 --> 15:41.620
reasoning about cake, right, so you don't have to think, ah, here's a piece of cake

15:41.620 --> 15:47.980
that falls under the species of cake, which falls under the genus of baked goods, and

15:47.980 --> 15:52.660
I've had other baked goods and I enjoyed them, therefore I may enjoy, you can do that if

15:52.660 --> 15:58.340
you want, but most of us are just like, ah, cake, right, and you just eat it.

15:58.340 --> 16:04.020
You also, at least I spend very little time thinking about whether, and in retrospect,

16:04.020 --> 16:08.220
the members of my own family fall under the species of human, I don't know about your

16:08.220 --> 16:13.300
own family lives, but basically for practical purposes we don't need to think about, think

16:13.300 --> 16:19.660
like this very much, we think like this when we're doing science.

16:19.660 --> 16:25.620
Now the examples I've just given are really about sense perception, right, like giraffes

16:25.620 --> 16:31.180
seeing other giraffes or lions, us seeing pieces of cake, but even when we're engaging

16:31.180 --> 16:36.700
in what you might think of as somewhat more abstract forms of cognition, we're still actually

16:36.700 --> 16:43.980
dealing with particulars most of the time, so for example, show of hands, who had cake

16:43.980 --> 16:50.620
yesterday, that's it, this is great Britain, come on, this is the best thing about the

16:50.620 --> 16:57.020
country, okay, so those of you who had cake, so those of you who raised your hand or those

16:57.020 --> 17:02.260
of you who thought I did have cake but I'm not admitting that in front of all these people,

17:02.260 --> 17:05.980
you were remembering the cake you had yesterday and you were remembering a particular piece

17:05.980 --> 17:10.380
of cake, namely the particular piece of cake you had yesterday, right, some of you may have

17:10.380 --> 17:16.380
foregone a piece of cake yesterday because you're unlike me, you're very, you know,

17:16.380 --> 17:21.220
abstemious and self-controlled, so that was a particular piece of cake that you remember

17:21.220 --> 17:28.780
not eating, also everyone in the room is now imagining a piece of cake, right, because

17:28.780 --> 17:33.420
how could you not, that's sort of what cake is, it's the kind of thing that you imagine

17:33.420 --> 17:37.900
when people talk about it, and you were also imagining a giraffe looking at a lion or a

17:37.900 --> 17:43.020
giraffe a minute ago, what you were imagining was a particular giraffe, not necessarily

17:43.020 --> 17:47.780
a particular one you've seen, but if you have a kind of image of the giraffe, it's an image

17:47.780 --> 17:54.540
of a particular giraffe that you kind of cobble together from story books, safaris, nature

17:54.540 --> 17:58.740
documentaries, whatever it is that's giving you your image of giraffes, so that actually

17:58.740 --> 18:04.140
means that you can get through a lot of your mental life just dealing with particulars,

18:04.780 --> 18:08.980
right, sort of constructed imaginary particulars or actual particulars, when you remember,

18:08.980 --> 18:14.820
when you imagine, you're dealing with particulars, and this would help explain how it is that

18:14.820 --> 18:19.940
animals can do some of these amazing things that they do, right, so why are they capable

18:19.940 --> 18:26.500
of apparently complex behaviors, recognizing things, maybe building things, making apparently

18:26.500 --> 18:31.740
making plans, something like apparent means and reasoning, they're doing it all with memory

18:31.860 --> 18:39.860
and imagination, according to the conventional view, and this has an important consequence,

18:40.380 --> 18:46.300
so as I said before, Aristotle is of the view that the intellect doesn't have a bodily organ,

18:46.820 --> 18:52.420
but the imagination and memory do have a bodily organ, he would have thought, as I said before,

18:52.420 --> 18:56.780
that it's the heart, but by the time we get to the Arabic tradition, they know that it's the

18:56.780 --> 19:01.500
brain, and the reason they know that it's the brain is because Galen, the great doctor in

19:01.500 --> 19:10.260
the second century, has done empirical studies that prove that all of your cognitive powers

19:10.260 --> 19:19.940
are seated in the brain, in particular he shows that the commands that move the limbs travel

19:19.940 --> 19:23.300
through the nerves down from the brain, in the time of Aristotle they didn't even know

19:23.300 --> 19:28.980
the nervous system existed, actually, that was first discovered in Alexandria, a couple

19:29.020 --> 19:35.020
of hundred years before Galen, and Galen does experiments actually on animals, in which

19:35.020 --> 19:41.540
he proves that it's really the brain that's the most central organ, at one point he says

19:41.540 --> 19:47.780
that if you want to show people how important the brain is, a really good way to do this

19:47.780 --> 19:54.780
is to take a pig, put it on a stage, expose the nerves coming down from the neck, and

19:55.700 --> 20:00.700
then snip the nerves that go to the vocal cords, because the pig will be making this

20:00.700 --> 20:07.700
incredible racket and screaming in pain, and then suddenly it will be silent, it's obviously

20:07.700 --> 20:15.700
a very gruesome experiment, but a very impressive one. By contrast, interlection doesn't involve

20:15.700 --> 20:22.820
a bodily organ, so the difference between us and animals, as I said before, really is

20:23.060 --> 20:28.380
along this line between material powers and immaterial powers, even the things that we

20:28.380 --> 20:32.580
might think of as part of our mental life or consciousness, by the way this is a real

20:32.580 --> 20:38.420
difference between the way we tend to think about it in philosophy of mind nowadays, and

20:38.420 --> 20:45.420
the way that ancient and medieval people thought in their philosophy of mind, so for us all

20:45.460 --> 20:51.220
the mental stuff is kind of whatever involves consciousness, so for us something like imagination

20:51.220 --> 20:58.220
or memory would be just as much on the mind side of things as abstract thinking, whereas

21:01.980 --> 21:08.480
in the Aristotelian tradition there's a huge difference between something like imagination

21:08.480 --> 21:15.480
and intellect, the difference is precisely the difference between particulars being grasped

21:15.680 --> 21:22.680
with a power that's seated in a bodily organ, and universals, abstract generalities, being

21:24.760 --> 21:31.120
grasped with an immaterial power, namely intellect, so this particular versus universal thing

21:31.120 --> 21:38.120
tracks material versus immaterial powers, and this is all the kind of background for

21:39.120 --> 21:46.120
Ibn Sina's view, so Ibn Sina, like I said, is the most important philosopher in the Islamic

21:47.880 --> 21:54.880
tradition, he died in 1037, and he actually proves, or tries to prove, that the intellect

21:57.460 --> 22:04.460
is realized immaterially and that the rational soul does not have a bodily organ on the

22:05.460 --> 22:12.460
grounds that the rational soul or mind or intellect, so the Arabic word here for intellect

22:15.180 --> 22:22.180
is akl, which can also be translated as a reason sometimes, that power he thinks can't

22:22.220 --> 22:27.420
be realized in a bodily organ, just as Aristotle said, but he gives a different argument that's

22:27.420 --> 22:34.020
not found in Aristotle, and his argument is precisely on the basis of universals versus

22:34.020 --> 22:41.020
particulars, and this is a little bit complicated and probably won't convince you, but here's

22:41.780 --> 22:48.780
the argument anyway for what it's worth, so his idea is that if a universal were received

22:49.220 --> 22:56.220
in a particular, like in an organ, then the universal would somehow be rendered particular,

22:56.980 --> 23:03.980
and his idea here is something like this, if you think about the abstract idea of giraffe,

23:04.900 --> 23:11.420
that's just a kind of form or essence or something like that, and it becomes a particular giraffe

23:11.420 --> 23:18.420
because it's found in some matter, namely the matter that the giraffe is made of. He compares

23:19.140 --> 23:25.860
this to the way a color could be received in a body or on a surface, so if a color appears

23:25.860 --> 23:29.900
in a surface, then it will be rendered a particular instance of that color, and there'll be some

23:29.900 --> 23:35.180
over here and some over here, so similarly when giraffeness is received by matter, you

23:35.180 --> 23:40.380
get a particular giraffe of a certain size with a certain location, and it's really

23:40.380 --> 23:47.220
matter that generates the particularity in some sense, or that explains the particularity.

23:47.220 --> 23:53.980
Another way of thinking about this is in terms of individuation, so what makes this giraffe

23:53.980 --> 23:58.460
and this giraffe, I should have brought two giraffes with me as display objects, but the

23:58.500 --> 24:03.540
budget would not allow for it. I did ask Fedor, but apparently your university wouldn't support

24:03.540 --> 24:08.900
me. Now you have to use your imagination, much-a-vanted imagination, which we share

24:08.900 --> 24:12.780
with animals, so imagine there's a giraffe here and a giraffe here. What do they have

24:12.780 --> 24:17.180
in common? What differentiates them? Well, in the first instance, what they have in common

24:17.180 --> 24:23.620
is that they're both giraffes, so it's not giraffehood that makes them different. What

24:23.660 --> 24:30.180
makes them different is things like there's one here and one there, spatial location, and

24:30.180 --> 24:37.460
there's a long story, which actually Fedor has worked on, about how individuation works

24:37.460 --> 24:44.460
in the scene, but to make a long story short, we can say that individuation is at least

24:44.460 --> 24:49.580
correlated with matter, so when you have one hunk of matter turned into a giraffe over

24:50.020 --> 24:54.460
here, and another hunk of matter turned into a giraffe over here, you get two giraffes,

24:54.460 --> 25:01.460
whereas giraffehood is just one thing, so to speak. Similarly, if we were to receive

25:03.540 --> 25:10.540
a universal idea in a bodily organ, like the brain, then that would constrain it or particularize

25:11.820 --> 25:17.060
it. It would no longer be universal, it would be rendered particular, just as giraffehood

25:17.060 --> 25:21.860
is rendered particular by being realized in one bit of matter rather than another bit

25:21.860 --> 25:28.860
of matter. That's his proof for the immateriality of the rational soul. But, he thinks that

25:31.980 --> 25:36.980
just as we've seen in the rest of the Aristotelian tradition, he holds on to this part of the

25:36.980 --> 25:43.980
traditional view. He thinks that our other cognitive powers are all realized in the brain,

25:44.420 --> 25:51.420
so the intellect is the only thing that we exercise without using a bodily organ. Obviously,

25:52.340 --> 25:59.340
things like digestion, reproduction, or eyesight or hearing, obviously these things are manifested

26:01.500 --> 26:06.580
and executed through bodily organs. It's less obvious that that's true with things like

26:06.580 --> 26:11.740
imagination and memory, but he thinks that those are just as much seated in the brain

26:11.940 --> 26:16.820
as, for example, your eyesight is seated in your eyes and your optic nerve and so on,

26:16.820 --> 26:23.820
your whole visual system. Intellection is the exception. Only intellect is exercised

26:23.820 --> 26:30.820
immaterially. The more that you think about this and the more detailed your story about

26:34.940 --> 26:40.620
cognitive powers other than intellect becomes, the more you are accepting that there's quite

26:40.620 --> 26:45.380
a large degree of overlap between humans and animals. Actually, although we're going

26:45.380 --> 26:51.820
to get on to Faridina Razi, who argues against Ibn Sina by saying that there's even more

26:51.820 --> 26:57.340
commonality between animals and humans than Ibn Sina thought, actually, in my opinion,

26:57.340 --> 27:03.340
Ibn Sina is someone who should be recognized as really going very far in the direction

27:03.340 --> 27:08.660
of admitting that there's a lot of overlap or a lot of commonality between humans and

27:08.700 --> 27:13.940
animals. This is precisely because he was so interested in the cognitive powers that

27:13.940 --> 27:18.900
we have that are shared with animals. In other words, the cognitive powers that somehow

27:18.900 --> 27:25.100
fall short of intellect because they only deal with particulars. This brings us to his

27:25.100 --> 27:32.100
celebrated theory of the internal senses. We have five external senses, hearing, sight,

27:32.100 --> 27:39.100
hearing, smell, taste, touch, right, five. Similarly, this is very neat. We have five

27:42.580 --> 27:49.580
internal senses. We've got five external senses, hearing, sight, et cetera. We have five internal

27:50.020 --> 27:57.020
senses, the common sense, the retentive imagination, the estimation, which I'll say more about

27:57.020 --> 28:04.020
in a second, memory and the compositive imagination. It actually doesn't matter very much how these

28:04.020 --> 28:11.020
all work and what their functions are. As we can see from this Latin medieval drawing,

28:11.780 --> 28:16.820
which is supposed to show Ibn Sina's theory, or what they would have called Abyssinus theory,

28:16.820 --> 28:20.940
they're all seated in the brain. They're in different what he calls ventricles of the

28:20.940 --> 28:27.060
brain. I think memory is in the back, for example. Actually, you can almost see them

28:27.060 --> 28:34.060
in my case because they're so little in the way. He actually tells you where they are

28:34.580 --> 28:40.620
in your brain, which lobes of the brain contain which powers. Again, what they all have in

28:40.620 --> 28:47.020
common is that, of course, they're internal. They're in the brain. They're not realized

28:47.100 --> 28:52.700
through something like eyes or ears or whatever, but also they deal with particulars. A really

28:52.700 --> 28:59.700
nice example of this is the so-called estimation, or wahm in Arabic. Estimation is a misleading

29:01.780 --> 29:08.300
translation here. The reason we often translate this word into English as estimation is that

29:08.300 --> 29:15.300
it was translated as estimatio into Latin, but in English it conjures up the idea of

29:15.300 --> 29:20.700
guessing or approximating, and that's not what we're talking about at all. I usually

29:20.700 --> 29:25.540
just say, I just usually use the word wahm for it because there is no easy good translation

29:25.540 --> 29:32.540
into English. This is a capacity that both humans and animals have, which allows them

29:34.020 --> 29:41.020
to register the properties that particular things have that aren't detectable by the

29:41.380 --> 29:48.380
external senses. His example is the, I couldn't believe I found this picture, by the way,

29:48.380 --> 29:52.740
online, because it's so perfect. I'm going to use this in every slideshow for the rest

29:52.740 --> 29:58.700
of my life as I talk about how to send a theory of wahm. His example is a sheep seeing

29:58.700 --> 30:05.700
a wolf and doing what these sheep are doing, which is running away from the wolf and hoping

30:06.180 --> 30:13.180
that they're not the slowest sheep. Why would a sheep do this? Ask yourself. Imagine you're

30:15.620 --> 30:22.620
in an Aristotelian universe. A sheep can do whatever Aristotle would say the sheep can

30:22.740 --> 30:28.460
do. The sheep can smell the wolf. The wolf smells, I don't know, have a wolf smell? Musty,

30:28.460 --> 30:35.460
I'm thinking, and a musty. It can see that the wolf has a gray coat, and maybe can hear

30:35.620 --> 30:41.740
the snarl, but none of these things are worth running away from. You don't run away from

30:41.740 --> 30:47.860
the color gray, and you don't run away from the snarling noise just because of the noise.

30:47.860 --> 30:51.460
If you ran away from the noise, it would be because of what the noise represents, which

30:51.460 --> 30:58.220
you can't hear. Probably the sheep doesn't have memories of wolves that it's met in

30:58.220 --> 31:04.980
the past because the sheep is still alive. In any case, sheep will run away from a wolf

31:05.020 --> 31:09.540
the first time they see a wolf. They don't need to have experienced a wolf before. The

31:09.540 --> 31:14.500
sheep doesn't need to imagine the wolf. Also, if it were imagining a wolf, it wouldn't run.

31:14.500 --> 31:21.500
It would just go, ooh, wolves, I hate wolves. Rather, what's happening is that the sheep

31:22.340 --> 31:29.340
looks at the wolf and is like, what the draft is with the line, oh, crap, that looks dangerous

31:29.900 --> 31:36.900
or as Ibn Sina says, it's hostile, it's dangerous. It turns and runs like hell. How is it doing

31:36.900 --> 31:41.940
this? Actually, I think Ibn Sina would say, well, Aristotle wouldn't be able to explain

31:41.940 --> 31:48.940
this. But I can explain it. My explanation is that the sheep has a faculty called Wahm.

31:49.100 --> 31:55.300
Wahm is the ability to detect things like hostility. Another cozier example is that

31:55.420 --> 32:02.420
the sheep can also perceive the familiarity of its own offspring. That's why it kind of

32:04.100 --> 32:11.100
nuzzles or takes care of its lamb, but it doesn't run from the lamb and it doesn't cozy

32:11.220 --> 32:16.620
up to the wolf. It runs from the wolf and cozy's up to the lamb. The reason it is able

32:16.620 --> 32:23.060
to do that is it has this power called Wahm. We have it too. What we're seeing here is

32:23.100 --> 32:30.100
that actually, Ibn Sina has, in a way, gone quite far in the direction of expanding our

32:33.900 --> 32:40.580
conception of what animals are capable of. I would say he offers us a picture of animal

32:40.580 --> 32:47.340
mental life, which is very rich, because what he's left for humans to do uniquely is very

32:47.340 --> 32:52.780
thin. It's just this kind of abstract universal thinking. Again, it's really important that

32:52.820 --> 32:58.020
all of these complicated things and sophisticated things that animals can do are always going

32:58.020 --> 33:03.220
to involve particulars as their cognitive content. The sheep will never start thinking

33:03.220 --> 33:09.260
about, why do the wolves hate us so much? Is it because we're so delicious? They don't

33:09.260 --> 33:13.940
think about it in that level. They're just like, here's a wolf. That's dangerous. I'm

33:14.020 --> 33:19.020
running. That's all they do. There's no abstract thought.

33:19.020 --> 33:26.020
Now, I gave not this paper, but a paper that had some of this material in it before. Teresa

33:29.020 --> 33:33.740
Antirouard pointed out something to me that she had just been writing about in a paper

33:33.740 --> 33:39.140
which wasn't published at the time, namely that there's a passage in part of the logic

33:39.820 --> 33:46.820
of Ibn Sina's biggest philosophical work, the Shifa, that suggests that animals can

33:47.420 --> 33:54.420
use Wahum to discriminate between species. This would be like my example, Gazintide.

33:54.940 --> 34:01.940
As we say in Germany, Gazintide. This would be like the case I gave before, the giraffes

34:02.260 --> 34:08.620
are like, oh, giraffes versus lions. You might think, well, doesn't that start to suggest

34:08.620 --> 34:15.620
that animals do have the capacity to think at the level of universals? Maybe, but even

34:17.140 --> 34:21.580
in this very passage, he still draws this hard and fast distinction between Wahum and

34:21.580 --> 34:28.580
intellect, Akku. Even there, he's saying, well, if animals can classify particulars as

34:30.580 --> 34:35.980
being of a certain type, they still can't engage in an intellect. Maybe there's some

34:36.020 --> 34:43.020
ambiguity here between exactly how much he wants to pack into Wahum as opposed to Akku.

34:43.100 --> 34:47.700
I find this passage quite puzzling, actually, how he can say this. Ultimately, it's going

34:47.700 --> 34:54.700
to be really important for him that proper, as such, universal thinking is only going

34:54.820 --> 35:01.500
to be possible for humans, and of course, God and angels, because only we have this

35:01.500 --> 35:08.500
immaterial rational power. If you start saying that animals can grasp universals, then his

35:09.620 --> 35:14.860
proof for the immateriality of the soul will go for them just as much as for us, and then

35:14.860 --> 35:19.700
animal souls would be able to survive the death of their body, right? And you wouldn't

35:19.700 --> 35:26.700
want that. Or would you? Maybe you would want that. Even Sino doesn't, so even Sino surely

35:27.580 --> 35:32.740
does not think that animals survive the death of their body, but that doesn't necessarily

35:32.740 --> 35:39.740
represent a kind of unified, unanimous opinion amongst Muslim scholars, because in fact,

35:42.620 --> 35:49.380
in the Islamic theological tradition, the tradition that goes under the name of Qalaam in Arabic,

35:49.380 --> 35:56.380
is commonly thought that animals also enjoy an afterlife. And there's good reason for

35:58.500 --> 36:05.500
this, namely that there are passages in the Quran that suggest an afterlife for the animals.

36:08.100 --> 36:15.100
For example, this is a passage from Quran 6.38, there's no creature on the earth or bird

36:15.540 --> 36:20.460
that flies with its wings, except that they are communities like you. So it seems to imply

36:20.460 --> 36:25.620
some kind of political life, maybe, for animals. But then the important part is, unto their

36:25.620 --> 36:30.460
Lord they will be gathered. Well, that sounds like they're all going to heaven or something,

36:30.460 --> 36:36.460
right? Or going to paradise. And on the basis of this, and also on the basis that you don't

36:36.460 --> 36:43.460
want injustice in God's creation without it being somehow counterbalanced by some kind

36:45.140 --> 36:52.140
of justice, some motakalimun theologians said things like, oh, well, when animals are savagely

36:53.820 --> 37:00.520
torn to bits by predators, that's sad for them. But the good news is then they go to

37:00.520 --> 37:06.700
paradise and they get lots of nice food to make it up to them. So as an author who's

37:06.700 --> 37:13.700
written about this has said, for this particular school of Qalaam, God is like a cosmic bookkeeper

37:15.140 --> 37:21.100
who's like, oh, well, this giraffe got savaged to death by lions. So the giraffe will get

37:21.100 --> 37:26.460
you know, 30 years of really nice acacia leaves or something in paradise. And then God is

37:26.460 --> 37:30.100
like, okay, you've been rewarded enough to make up for that. It's sorry about that thing

37:30.100 --> 37:34.460
that happened to you, 30 years in it. I know that was rough. But look at all the nice leaves

37:34.460 --> 37:39.500
you've got, right? That might be a little bit too crude a way of thinking about it, but

37:39.500 --> 37:46.500
somehow God makes it up to them in the afterlife. And in general, there's a very strong trend

37:49.060 --> 37:53.660
in Qalaam of thinking that animals somehow participate in the afterlife, which brings

37:53.660 --> 37:59.840
us to Fahad al-Nirazi, because it is precisely in the context of talking about the afterlife

37:59.840 --> 38:05.220
in a work of his called the Molachas, which was only just recently edited. But actually

38:05.220 --> 38:11.220
when we started working on this, we were looking at the work in manuscripts. So this

38:11.220 --> 38:17.740
is like a very recently, a work that's only very recently started to get studied. So it's

38:17.740 --> 38:25.740
one of several works he wrote that kind of survey philosophical and theological questions,

38:25.740 --> 38:32.660
across a variety of topics. So he's talking about the afterlife. And then without really

38:32.700 --> 38:39.300
explaining that that's the relevant context, he says, now here's a question. Do animals

38:39.300 --> 38:44.780
have rational souls or not? Do they have rational souls like humans, or do they have a different

38:44.780 --> 38:50.140
kind of soul like the philosophers would say? And although he doesn't spell this out, I

38:50.140 --> 38:57.140
think that, and I've written a paper about this with Bly, we think that he must be thinking

38:58.140 --> 39:05.140
the reason why it's worth discussing this is that if animals didn't have rational souls,

39:05.140 --> 39:11.660
then at least according to Ibn Sina's arguments for the immateriality and hence immortality

39:11.660 --> 39:18.660
of our soul, if they don't have rational souls, then they must die when their bodies die,

39:18.780 --> 39:23.660
and then they wouldn't have an afterlife. But as a theologian, he wants to at least be

39:23.700 --> 39:30.700
open to the possibility that animals do have an afterlife. Now, so this is actually, typically

39:30.740 --> 39:34.860
for him, this is quite a complicated thing going on here, because what he's thinking

39:34.860 --> 39:41.860
is, well, if I were an Avicenan philosopher, then I would think that the only way for animals

39:42.700 --> 39:48.380
to have an afterlife is for them to be rational. Now, actually, he's not an Avicenan philosopher,

39:48.380 --> 39:54.740
he's a critic of Ibn Sina, but what he wants to do, I think, is to suggest, well, I'm going

39:54.740 --> 39:59.580
to give an argument that would show Ibn Sina that he should admit that animals have an

39:59.580 --> 40:05.500
afterlife. And then if I can show that, since theologians, also with their own kind of theory

40:05.500 --> 40:10.500
of the soul and whatever, if they would also think that animals would have an afterlife,

40:10.500 --> 40:16.580
then everyone could sort of agree. So this is almost like a way of saying, well, even

40:16.620 --> 40:22.220
the kind of toughest nut to crack, namely an Aristotelian slash Avicenan position, should

40:22.220 --> 40:26.300
still think that animals have an afterlife, because they should admit that animals are

40:26.300 --> 40:29.780
rational, and if they admit that animals are rational, then they should admit that animals

40:29.780 --> 40:35.780
have an afterlife. Now, that's obviously imputing a lot to him, because he doesn't spell anything,

40:35.780 --> 40:42.780
any of that out in the text, but I think that's the kind of basis for the argument. In any

40:43.780 --> 40:49.580
case, even if you kind of set that aside, what's really worth our interest is the way

40:49.580 --> 40:56.020
he argues for animal rationality. And as we're going to see, he really kind of presupposes

40:56.020 --> 41:03.020
the truth of Ibn Sina's own way of thinking about rationality. Because if you think about

41:03.020 --> 41:06.620
it, there's two ways you could go at this, right? You could say, well, you say that

41:06.660 --> 41:13.660
intellection or rationality, akka, is characterized by universal abstract thought. But that's not

41:13.660 --> 41:20.660
true. I'm using my intellect when I decide what to have for dinner, right? Cake, maybe.

41:22.380 --> 41:28.060
Bad choice, but a choice nonetheless. But then he knows that Ibn Sina would say, no, no,

41:28.060 --> 41:32.660
no, no, that's just imagination. Or you know, you're remembering some cake you had, you're

41:32.700 --> 41:36.940
imagining the cake you could have, you're engaging in something that's not full blown

41:36.940 --> 41:41.820
intellection. So that doesn't count. So what he's going to do is maybe for the sake of

41:41.820 --> 41:46.260
arguments, he's going to say, let's suppose that intellection is what you say it is. And

41:46.260 --> 41:52.860
I'm going to show you that animals by that criterion must have intellect. And this is

41:52.860 --> 41:56.700
really clear from the first argument he gives. There's five arguments I'm going to give you

41:56.700 --> 42:03.140
two of them. And the first argument comes in kind of free with three cases to illustrate

42:03.140 --> 42:10.140
it. So the first argument is that animals must have the ability to grasp universals as

42:10.180 --> 42:17.180
such. They don't only grasp particulars. Why? Well, first of all, even exercise, and this

42:19.300 --> 42:25.180
I think is a really remarkable thing to say, even the exercise of sense perception involves

42:25.220 --> 42:32.220
grasping universals. Because to see a wolf and see it as something other than just a

42:33.140 --> 42:40.140
patch of gray is to see it as a wolf. Now, this is actually an interesting question in

42:41.500 --> 42:45.540
Aristotelian philosophy. So what would Aristotle say about this? What does Aristotle think

42:45.540 --> 42:52.540
about seeing something as a wolf? He might say, well, properly speaking, what you see

42:53.100 --> 42:58.980
is something gray. But then you kind of layer on top of that the information that it's a

42:58.980 --> 43:05.980
wolf or something like that. But Fahredin is thinking, well, take this example that

43:06.500 --> 43:13.460
we have for the Messina, the sheep seeing the wolf, seeing that the wolf is dangerous.

43:13.460 --> 43:20.460
It must be able to perceive the wolf as a wolf, as a member of a hostile species, in

43:21.420 --> 43:27.340
order to react appropriately. So all of that kind of abstract universal content is already

43:27.340 --> 43:32.180
built into sense perception. It's a profoundly un-Aristotelian thing to say, or at least

43:32.180 --> 43:36.420
if not un-Aristotelian, it's against the Aristotelian tradition. There's exactly what

43:36.420 --> 43:41.900
Aristotelians have been denying for literally more than a thousand years. So they've always

43:41.900 --> 43:46.500
said sense perception is of particulars, not universals. And Fahredin is like, ah, if you

43:46.540 --> 43:52.140
think about it, sense perception is of universals too, because you're classifying or you're

43:52.140 --> 43:57.740
sort of subsuming the particular that you see under a particular universal in order to react

43:57.740 --> 44:03.060
to it appropriately. And it's obvious that animals can do this. There's quite a remarkable

44:03.060 --> 44:10.060
move on his part. And the next case he gives, another illustration of the fact that animals

44:10.860 --> 44:17.860
can grasp universals, is if anything, even more clever. So let's imagine that the sheep

44:19.340 --> 44:26.340
sees the wolf, and it turns to run. So now it's intending to run, okay? And an Aristotelian

44:27.900 --> 44:34.500
would say, no problem, it runs. But Fahredin says, well, hang on a second. Is it intending

44:34.540 --> 44:41.300
to perform the particular act of running it's about to perform? No. It's not like, oh, I'm

44:41.300 --> 44:47.020
going to run exactly in this way, away from this wolf, like I'm going to put my foot exactly

44:47.020 --> 44:51.940
there and exactly there. No. It's going to just run like hell. Any act of running would

44:51.940 --> 44:57.260
be fine, right? Any act of running that will get it away from the wolf would be perfectly

44:57.260 --> 45:03.260
adequate. In fact, probably it couldn't think, it couldn't intend very exactly to perform

45:03.260 --> 45:10.260
a particular act of running. This might actually connect to something that you, there's an argument

45:12.580 --> 45:18.620
that you sometimes get in Calam, which is that God and not we must be the creator of

45:18.620 --> 45:24.780
our acts, because we aren't able to create particular acts down to the level of finest

45:24.780 --> 45:31.220
detail. Why? How do we know this? Well, an example that he gives, imagine you write your

45:31.220 --> 45:38.020
name and then someone says to you, okay, now write your name again, exactly the same, down

45:38.020 --> 45:43.860
to the molecule. No chance, right? You wouldn't even be able to come close. You could make

45:43.860 --> 45:48.660
something, you could make a signature or something that looks basically similar, but of course

45:48.660 --> 45:53.900
you couldn't make something exactly identical in every detail, whereas God could. And then

45:53.900 --> 45:57.020
they say, well, if you can't do it the second time, then obviously you can't do it the first

45:57.020 --> 46:03.340
time. If you were capable of producing this, then you could do it again, but you can't.

46:03.340 --> 46:08.700
So it must be God creating your signature and not you. This is an argument for occasionalism.

46:08.700 --> 46:11.700
Whether that's in the background here, I'm not sure, but it's very similar, it's a very

46:11.700 --> 46:16.860
similar thought. So the idea is that the sheep is not going to be able to intend to perform

46:16.860 --> 46:23.860
exactly the act of running that it performs. It can only intend generically to run. And

46:24.860 --> 46:29.980
that's, I think, is a brilliant argument. So this is showing that what is in them, as

46:29.980 --> 46:36.660
it were, in the mind of the sheep is a universal, namely running and not a particular, namely

46:36.660 --> 46:42.140
the particular act of running it's about to perform. Very clever. Third example, and this

46:42.140 --> 46:48.740
may be the easiest, is imagine a sheep that's looking for grass. And he actually gives the

46:48.740 --> 46:53.460
example of looking for grass, of an animal looking for grass. He says, the animal's not

46:53.500 --> 46:59.700
looking for some particular grass. Oh, no, not that one. I had some different grass in

46:59.700 --> 47:03.300
mind. They don't care, they're just looking for grass. In other words, they're looking

47:03.300 --> 47:09.100
for something that instantiates the universal grass. So again, what is, as it were, in their

47:09.100 --> 47:16.100
mind has to be a universal, not a particular. I mean, think about it like this. All of the

47:16.100 --> 47:22.980
particular examples of grass that the sheep have ever seen are precisely the ones that

47:22.980 --> 47:27.700
aren't relevant, because they've already been eaten by the sheep and the sheep's friends.

47:27.700 --> 47:32.360
What I'm looking for is some grass that I've never experienced yet. So I'm precisely looking

47:32.360 --> 47:38.620
not for the particular grass as I've seen, but for a new one, like, I'll go over there.

47:38.620 --> 47:43.900
He also has this nice example of smelling that there's some grass and being like, oh, that

47:43.900 --> 47:51.300
must be some grass. Not some particular grass, but just grass. Now, I think this is interesting

47:51.300 --> 47:55.780
now to think about what an Aristotelian slash Abyssinian would say in response. Maybe they

47:55.780 --> 48:03.640
would say, well, the animal is not grasping these things qua universal. So they're somehow

48:03.640 --> 48:09.820
operating as if they had a universal in their mind, but they don't because they're not sort

48:09.820 --> 48:16.900
of explicitly entertaining the universal and thinking about it as such. But if that's the

48:16.900 --> 48:21.340
answer, I think it's not a very good one. Because remember that Abyssinian's argument

48:21.340 --> 48:27.580
was in order to receive the universal at all, you have to have an immaterial power. And it

48:27.580 --> 48:34.700
looks like they are, and it looks like to operate with a universal concept, the animal needs

48:34.700 --> 48:40.980
to have such an immaterial power whether or not it's thinking about it as such. So I actually

48:40.980 --> 48:55.620
think Fakhredin's argument here is very convincing. Oh, sorry, these slides are in the wrong order.

48:55.620 --> 49:00.900
There's another argument, the fourth one, where he just reels off a very short list of amazing

49:00.900 --> 49:06.100
things that animals do. And there's a parallel text in another work, which I also wrote an

49:06.100 --> 49:17.300
article about, about all these sort of amazing things that animals, like amazing behaviors

49:17.300 --> 49:22.780
that animals display. He gives the example of hexagonal cells in a beehive. He gives

49:22.780 --> 49:28.420
an example that our colleague Sarah Vergi wrote a whole paper about. This is an example

49:28.420 --> 49:33.260
that comes up already in antiquity and then a whole series of texts in the Islamic world.

49:33.260 --> 49:39.340
The example is a mouse wants to get at some oil in a bottle, apparently mice like to

49:39.340 --> 49:47.180
sip oil, I didn't know this. And the bottle has a narrow neck, and it's too narrow for

49:47.180 --> 49:52.980
the animal to poke its head in and lick the oil. So what it does is it sits on top, dips

49:52.980 --> 50:00.580
its tail into the oil, sort of swirls its tail around, pulls it out and licks its tail.

50:01.100 --> 50:06.180
I don't know if mice actually do this, but you can sort of imagine a mouse doing this.

50:06.180 --> 50:12.540
And the idea is if animals can do this, then they must be just as capable of reasoning

50:12.540 --> 50:22.060
as humans are. This is just supposed to amaze you with the things that animals do. So the

50:22.060 --> 50:29.700
upshot is that animals can grasp universals, they can engage in reasoning, means and reasoning

50:29.740 --> 50:34.660
like we just saw with the mouse, the kind of universal reasoning that is needed to engage

50:34.660 --> 50:44.220
in sense perception, look for food, perform motions. And that should show that animals,

50:44.220 --> 50:48.620
whatever you say about human reasoning, you should say about animals too. So if humans

50:48.620 --> 50:52.460
can do this because they have immaterial souls, then you should say that animals have immaterial

50:52.500 --> 51:00.660
souls. There might be another thing that's in play here, namely that in general Farhaddin

51:00.660 --> 51:05.580
is quite skeptical of what you might call the faculty psychology theory that we find

51:05.580 --> 51:12.340
in Aristotelianism where you have like sensation and imagination and memory and so on. Farhaddin,

51:12.340 --> 51:16.340
along with some other philosophers of the period, especially someone named Abu Barakat

51:16.340 --> 51:22.020
al-Baghdadi, who's going to be relevant again in a second, they thought that this is kind

51:22.020 --> 51:27.620
of a wrong way of approaching philosophical psychology and that what you should say is

51:27.620 --> 51:34.140
that you have a soul, which is just one kind of power, and it can do a whole bunch of things.

51:34.140 --> 51:39.580
So rather than, I mean this is kind of a tendentious way of thinking about the Abbasin and Slash

51:39.580 --> 51:45.020
Aristotelian position, but they would say, well they think that you see that what sees

51:45.140 --> 51:54.140
is your vision and what imagines is your imagination, whereas we think that when I imagine the

51:54.140 --> 51:59.580
person, the thing that's imagining is just me, right? So it's just one of many actions

51:59.580 --> 52:06.060
that I can perform. So they're trying to articulate a view according to which there's this single

52:06.060 --> 52:14.580
subject of cognition, which we might call the self, and this self is just what does everything.

52:14.780 --> 52:21.260
And the reason why I think that might be relevant is that it's, given what we've seen from Fahaddin

52:21.260 --> 52:27.580
about animals, it looks like he's trying to question this very hard and fast kind of

52:27.580 --> 52:32.980
leveled theory of cognition, where you have reason up here and imagination and sensation

52:32.980 --> 52:39.100
down here. So for example, think about what he said in the first argument here. You can't

52:39.140 --> 52:45.020
even do sense perception without using intellect, right? So that would kind of push you in the

52:45.020 --> 52:50.460
direction of thinking that different forms of cognition kind of involve each other, and

52:50.460 --> 52:55.620
that would go along very nicely with the idea that it's just one self or soul doing all

52:55.620 --> 53:01.300
the cognition rather than the idea that you have these separate faculties which somehow

53:01.340 --> 53:13.340
get put together to form a rich mental life. Okay, in any case, what we've seen is that,

53:13.340 --> 53:19.620
as I say, we have all these examples of clever things that animals do, some of them actually

53:19.620 --> 53:23.980
drawn from in the Sina, and even going all the way back to Aristotle, and this should

53:24.020 --> 53:31.020
show that animals too are intelligent. And all of this is within, to some extent, within

53:31.260 --> 53:36.860
the framework of the conventional view, right, the traditional Aristotelian view, because

53:36.860 --> 53:43.860
he's assuming that the possession of reason somehow goes along with the ability to outlive

53:43.980 --> 53:50.980
the death of the body, right? That's, I think, the whole point. Now then, one thing about

53:51.900 --> 53:58.900
Razzi is that he always will consider objections on every side of every dispute, so he will

54:00.100 --> 54:04.300
very rarely advance a position without then saying, well, but there's an objection to

54:04.300 --> 54:11.300
this position, so that's what he does to here, and he says, well, here's an objection.

54:12.660 --> 54:18.580
If animals were rational, then there'd only be one kind of soul, and probably he's not

54:18.620 --> 54:22.940
thinking about plants, right? Because he has to argue that plants are rational, or that

54:22.940 --> 54:28.580
plants can engage in sense perception. So there'd only be a single kind of soul, which

54:28.580 --> 54:33.980
is jointly shared by humans and animals, and so he wouldn't even have a distinction between

54:33.980 --> 54:40.980
these different kinds of soul anymore, right? Now, actually, this is an interesting, there's

54:41.580 --> 54:48.580
an interesting kind of long running debate here. If you think about it, we kind of very

54:50.740 --> 54:57.740
naturally associate, in the Aristotelian tradition, the idea that we very naturally associate

54:58.380 --> 55:03.500
different types of soul with different kind of levels of existence, right? So there's

55:03.500 --> 55:08.940
human rational souls, there's animal souls, and then there's plant souls, so we think

55:08.940 --> 55:14.700
there are three kinds of souls, but you wouldn't have to do it like that, right? So for example,

55:14.700 --> 55:20.820
you could say there's plant souls, and there's non-plant souls, so you could be less fine

55:20.820 --> 55:25.620
grained, or you could be more fine grained, right? So for example, you could say there's

55:25.620 --> 55:30.100
the kind of soul that really smart people have, and then there's the kind of soul that

55:30.100 --> 55:35.420
kind of dumb people have, and then in between there's sort of the mediocre souls, and then

55:35.460 --> 55:42.460
there's the animal souls, right? Or you could say that there's the carnivorous souls and

55:43.580 --> 55:50.340
the plantiferous souls, herbivorous, yes, herbivorous souls, right? You could have carved

55:50.340 --> 55:54.980
it up in all kinds of ways, to use a very apt metaphor given all the tearing apart of

55:54.980 --> 56:00.380
limbs we've been discussing during this talk. So why do it this way? And in fact, just in

56:00.420 --> 56:05.340
an immediate environment of Fakhreddin, there's been a slightly earlier philosopher named

56:05.340 --> 56:09.980
Abu Barakat Al-Baghdadi who said, well, actually, maybe different humans have different kinds

56:09.980 --> 56:16.020
of souls, so maybe courageous people have one kind of soul, and cowardly people have another

56:16.020 --> 56:23.020
kind of soul. This is an idea that has just been flirted with in the tradition. But Fakhreddin

56:23.020 --> 56:28.180
doesn't really like, he doesn't really want to smash all the different kinds of souls

56:28.220 --> 56:33.300
together, nor does he want to say that there are different species of human soul. He wants

56:33.300 --> 56:38.140
to adhere to the traditional idea that there are human souls and non-human souls, animal

56:38.140 --> 56:43.420
souls, and that you can somehow distinguish them. Yet, now he's saying, well, I can't

56:43.420 --> 56:49.100
define human souls just in respect of their rationality, because I'm now suggesting that

56:49.140 --> 56:56.140
animal souls can be rational as well. So what he says is, there might be, and by the way,

57:02.420 --> 57:06.860
sorry, I should have gotten to this slide first. He actually mentions this thing from

57:06.860 --> 57:13.860
Abu Barakat about courageous and cowardly souls, and he says, this is like lions and rabbits.

57:14.060 --> 57:20.260
So lions have one kind of soul, rabbits have another kind of soul, lions are brave, rabbits

57:20.260 --> 57:27.260
are timid. But the fact that, and so you can find these differences if you want, but the

57:28.260 --> 57:33.820
fact that there might be some kind of shared commonality between human souls and animal

57:33.820 --> 57:40.500
souls doesn't prove that there's no difference between human souls and animal souls, because

57:40.540 --> 57:46.100
maybe animals have reason, and we have reason, but we have more of it than they do. So we're

57:46.100 --> 57:52.780
intelligent to a much greater degree than animals are intelligent, and that's really

57:52.780 --> 57:59.780
the difference. So his idea here would apparently be that there's a kind of continuum of intelligence

58:01.820 --> 58:08.820
from animals up to humans with us at the top, or maybe we're not at the top actually,

58:09.020 --> 58:14.300
because probably angels, and for sure God, are more intelligent and rational than we are,

58:14.300 --> 58:19.060
so maybe we're actually sort of in the middle. But if you leave these exalted beings out

58:19.060 --> 58:24.540
in the natural world, we're the most intelligent, rational creatures, and then animals are less

58:24.540 --> 58:29.900
rational and intelligent than us, and plants are not rational and intelligent at all. Something

58:29.900 --> 58:34.140
he doesn't get into, one would really like to know what he thinks about this. He doesn't

58:34.180 --> 58:39.660
get that much into the question of whether non-human animals are at different places

58:39.660 --> 58:45.100
on the scale, but it's kind of suggested by these passages where he gives you all of these

58:45.100 --> 58:49.980
examples of clever animals, because of course not all animals are capable of this kind of

58:49.980 --> 58:56.260
clever behavior, like slugs don't do things like dipping their tail in oil and licking

58:56.260 --> 59:00.780
it, and it's not just because they don't have tongues. Maybe slugs do have tongues. Slug

59:00.820 --> 59:05.740
ologists in the house? Anyone? No? Okay, let's say for the sake of argument, slugs don't have

59:05.740 --> 59:12.900
tongues. Even if they had tongues, they couldn't do this, right? Dogs are smarter than turtles.

59:12.900 --> 59:20.740
I have no idea how smart turtles are. They're very smart, just rather slow. But you see what I

59:20.740 --> 59:25.620
mean, right? So there's probably a continuum of smartness of intelligence within the animal

59:25.620 --> 59:30.620
kingdom. He doesn't really get into that. He kind of gestures towards it by talking about what some

59:30.660 --> 59:38.060
animals can do. But the really interesting thing would be that if you have human intelligence as

59:38.060 --> 59:44.020
the kind of gold standard, then you would have some like, at least fairly smart animals that are

59:44.020 --> 59:49.260
less intelligent than us, but still rational, and that would secure their participation in the

59:49.260 --> 59:56.980
afterlife. So hence the title of the talk. So I said that the talk would be about an Islamic

59:56.980 --> 01:00:04.580
thinker who's denying human exceptionalism. And it's true that we're not exceptional on his view,

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:10.100
at least if you, I mean, there are some texts where he is kind of noncommittal about all of this,

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:14.700
but at least in the mulachas, this one text we've been looking at, he seems to be quite committed

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:21.500
to the view that animals are intelligent. But they're not as intelligent as we are. And in that

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:25.860
sense, we do remain exceptional. And of course, that is important for him as a theologian too,

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:33.860
because God's relationship towards animals may be benevolent. He may give animals an afterlife. He

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:39.140
may even accept praise from animals. There are texts that say that animal calls and the noises

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:45.620
they make are prayers to God that we don't understand and so on. But still God's relationship to

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:49.660
humans is going to be very different from his relationship to the rest of the animal kingdom.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.740
And he would want it that way. Thanks very much.
