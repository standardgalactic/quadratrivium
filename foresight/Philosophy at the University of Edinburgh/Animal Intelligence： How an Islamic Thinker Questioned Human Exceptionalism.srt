1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,800
So this, thank you very much Fedor, actually Fedor did not mention that he wrote the index

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,400
for one of the books based on the podcast, or at least one of them, maybe more than one

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,960
of them, and we know each other for a long time, so it's great to be here at his invitation.

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,800
This indeed is going to be a presentation of some of the work I did in this ERC project,

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,160
especially together with one of the then postdocs who's now at Fordham University named Blyosoma,

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:50,880
and it's about a philosopher theologian named Fahradin Arasi, who lived in the 12th, just

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,160
barely into the 13th century, and what he thought about animals.

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,600
The payoff of the talk is that he thought that animals can be rational or intelligent,

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,280
depending on how you want to translate the key term, which is a very surprising thing

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,120
for someone to have thought in the 12th century.

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,560
Just think about the fact that in the Aristotelian tradition, it's very common to just define

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,840
human as rational animal, implying that all the other animals are non-rational.

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,160
That's maybe a definition they just kind of throw around without thinking about it very

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,840
much, but it is also something that they seem to be committed to.

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,360
In this talk, I'm going to present that idea, the sort of orthodox view, that only humans

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,320
are rational, why they might have thought this, and then I'm going to talk a little

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,000
bit about a philosopher who's the immediate context for understanding Fahradin's position,

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,720
who's the most important philosopher of the Islamic tradition named Ibn Sina, maybe more

19
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,600
famous under the name of Avicenna, and the reason I need to talk about him is that it's

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,520
really to him that Fahradin is responding when he makes this argument that animals can

21
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,960
also be rational.

22
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,520
But first, let's start with the conventional, or orthodox view, and of course we have to

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,080
start with Aristotle as so often.

24
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,560
Aristotle has a lot to say about animals.

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,720
In fact, one of the kind of mysterious things about ancient philosophy is that Aristotle

26
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:42,760
writes this vast corpus of works on zoology, so we've got the parts of animals on the generation

27
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:50,000
of animals, on the motion of animals, history of animals, and unlike other works of his

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,480
on logic, on physics, on the soul, on metaphysics, on ethics, these works don't receive any commentaries

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
in late antiquity.

30
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,920
In fact, there's no Greek commentary on any of his zoological works until the Byzantine

31
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,680
period when a group of commentators who are gathered around a queen, or at least princess

32
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,120
named Anna Komnena, decide to write commentaries on all the texts by Aristotle that haven't

33
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,680
already been commented on in antiquity.

34
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,840
So this is a kind of underappreciated feature of Aristotle's corpus in antiquity.

35
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,160
In the medieval period it gets some attention in Latin, especially from Albert the Great,

36
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,000
the teacher of Aquinas.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,920
So he writes about zoology, he also writes about botany, he was a very intrepid natural

38
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,760
philosopher, did things like repelling down cliffs to look at nests of birds.

39
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Very cool.

40
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,960
They don't call him Albert the Great for nothing.

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:55,120
But it's also true that the zoological works are quite valued in the Arabic tradition.

42
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,360
So they were translated into Arabic, they were translated as a single work, just called

43
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,360
a hayawan, so animals, that's just one big text.

44
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,640
And they were known to people like Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd and so on, Ibn Sina actually writes

45
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,080
a work of his own on animals that's kind of based on it.

46
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,000
So Aristotle's absolutely a fundamental source of information about animals.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,560
And the information is often quite detailed.

48
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,480
So the anatomy of animals, the way that their embryos look, the way that they move, like

49
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,880
the difference between flying animals, four footed animals, two footed animals, what do

50
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,600
they eat, where do they live, and so on.

51
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,320
History of animals also has some information in it, which is a little bit fanciful, like

52
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,560
animals healing themselves by deliberately eating certain herbs or things like that.

53
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,000
But by and large, Aristotle's observations of animals are very impressive.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,240
He himself did dissections of animals, often of marine life, and he described many, many

55
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,960
animals and animal structures for the first time.

56
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,800
So the dude is really into animals.

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,640
Okay, that's what I'm trying to communicate to you here.

58
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:15,240
And in fact, I would say it's really amongst his most amazing achievements is his empirical

59
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,600
work on the animal world.

60
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:26,760
Yet, in some sense, he rates animals kind of low in another respect, namely that he doesn't

61
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,320
really ascribe to animals very high cognitive powers.

62
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:41,320
In particular, he draws a really kind of rigorous divide between humans on the one hand who

63
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:48,440
have the capacity for reasoning and what he calls a noose, which means intellect.

64
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,880
So we've got humans on the one hand, and we've got animals on the other hand who only have

65
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,480
animal souls and are capable of sensation and motion.

66
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,360
So in other words, they can move around.

67
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,760
That differentiates them from plants, because plants can only engage in the powers of the

68
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
vegetative soul.

69
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,960
In other words, the plant soul.

70
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,240
So that's kind of tautologist.

71
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,260
But what that would mean is the ability to reproduce and the ability to engage in nutrition.

72
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,280
So plants can take in food and water.

73
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,360
They can make more plants.

74
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,760
They can reproduce.

75
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,840
Animals can do those things.

76
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,160
They can also perceive.

77
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,720
They can also move around.

78
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,920
But only humans can think rationally.

79
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,680
That's something that we share in common with God, which is not an insignificant fact.

80
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,000
So there's something divine about humans.

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,120
At the end of the ethics, Aristotle says that the life of philosophy is almost more than

82
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,040
human, because it allows us to partake in divinity.

83
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,840
So even for all that he has a lot to say about animals and for all that he was extremely

84
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,720
interested in them, he still draws this very hard and fast divide between non-human animals

85
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,640
on the one hand and humans on the other hand.

86
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,600
Something else that we're going to see is going to be important is that he says that

87
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:17,900
the mind, the human mind, does not have a bodily organ through which it is exercised.

88
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,780
So he does not think that you're thinking with your heart, well, he doesn't think you're

89
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,780
thinking with your brain, because he doesn't think the brain does very much.

90
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,300
He thinks it's a kind of cooling element in your body.

91
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,100
But also he doesn't think you're thinking with your heart, even though your sensation

92
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,780
and some of your other cognitive powers are seated in the heart, like probably your imagination

93
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,660
is seated in the heart, but not your mind.

94
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,780
Also your intellect, noose, is exercised without any bodily organ.

95
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,700
And later philosophers, and we're going to see this in Sinai, later philosophers thought

96
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,700
that this is a sign that Aristotle would believe that you can survive the death of your body,

97
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,380
because if you don't need a bodily organ to think, then why wouldn't you be able to keep

98
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:07,180
thinking after you die?

99
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,900
Now here's a question that people, I think, don't ask themselves enough.

100
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,060
Why in the world would Aristotle have thought this?

101
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:22,100
Why would he think that animals can't think, or can't engage in reason or intellect?

102
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,820
After all, animals do all kinds of problem-solving.

103
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,620
They build amazing things like webs and nests.

104
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,980
We're going to see later on that this is important for Fahddin, they even apparently

105
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:42,660
can do geometry, think about beehives, perfect hexagons that tessellate, I wouldn't be able

106
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,220
to build something like that.

107
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,860
So animals do all kinds of amazing things.

108
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,740
And if there's anyone in the entire ancient world who's extremely aware of the amazing

109
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:59,140
things that animals do, it's Aristotle, as I just said, due to superintent animals.

110
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:05,540
So why does he think that animals fall not just below humans in this respect, but why

111
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,900
does he see this very striking difference between animals and humans?

112
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,220
Well there's maybe two reasons.

113
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,500
One is that animals are not capable of language.

114
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,940
So he may have a very strong connection in his mind between rational thinking and language,

115
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,980
especially if you think about the Greek words involved here.

116
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,940
So the word for language is logos, and that's also the word for reason, or the word rational

117
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,060
is logike.

118
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,220
So there's a very strong drive, even through the Greek language itself, to associate reasoning

119
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,460
with language.

120
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,940
That's one thing.

121
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,340
Another thing is that he may have quite a narrow understanding of what intellect or reasoning

122
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,980
actually involves.

123
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,580
If you think that what it means to engage in intellect or reasoning is something like

124
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,940
to engage in abstract thinking about general features of the universe, and that does seem

125
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,020
to be what he thinks is a long story, what he thinks intellect is, so we don't have time

126
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
to get into.

127
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,340
We can talk about that in the Q&A if you want.

128
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,140
But if it's something like that, abstract thinking about general features of the universe,

129
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:19,100
then it's actually quite plausible to say that animals don't do that.

130
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,480
Basically animals don't do philosophy.

131
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,220
So that's why we should say they don't engage in reasoning.

132
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,620
Of course most humans don't engage in philosophy either.

133
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,420
So there's us.

134
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,780
So the people in this room are better than animals.

135
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:42,300
Whether everyone else outside the room is, I mean it's a university, but there may be

136
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,180
this kind of elitist attitude that all of the non-scientists, non-philosophers are kind

137
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,180
of like cows.

138
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,500
And this is something you see again and again actually in the later history of philosophy.

139
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,980
For example, Ibn Rushd or Averwes, the great medieval Muslim commentator on Aristotle,

140
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:11,180
says at one point that most humans are human in name only because they don't do philosophy.

141
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,300
And this actually is not an unimportant, I mean it's kind of funny, but it's also got

142
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,980
a very dark side.

143
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:22,540
So when they discovered the Americas, they were like, well these people don't do philosophy,

144
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,740
so we can basically treat them as if they were herd animals.

145
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,500
So this is not unimportant, this feature of Aristotelianism.

146
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,380
So that's Aristotle's position.

147
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,420
We don't need to put the blame for all of that on Aristotle, but he sort of kicks off

148
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,820
this way of thinking about humans and animals.

149
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,220
And for the most part other ancient philosophers agree.

150
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:51,900
So in particular the Stoics agree, and the Platonists maybe agree sometimes.

151
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,740
So there are exceptions, and they come mostly in the Platonic tradition.

152
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:02,260
In particular there's a second century philosopher who's a Platonist named Plutarch, and a third

153
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,060
fourth century philosopher named Porphyry, who is the student of Plotinus, the founder

154
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,900
of Neoplatonism, if that means anything to you.

155
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,620
Porphyry wrote a work using some material from Plutarch in which he argues explicitly

156
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,020
that animals can use language, and he gives a whole bunch of reasons to think that they

157
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,100
can use language, as he says, we don't understand them, but we don't understand people from

158
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,180
Skithia either, but we don't say that they're not rational.

159
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,340
So when the animals seem to be communicating with each other, so probably that just speaking

160
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,500
a language we can't understand, he also gives examples of animals that can respond to linguistic

161
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
commands.

162
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,940
Because he had a pet bird who could do this, and what he says is, so attacking this link

163
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:55,420
between reasoning and language in the Stoics rather than Aristotle, he says that the Stoics

164
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,940
are wrong to deny intelligence to animals on the basis that they can't talk, because

165
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,140
in fact they probably can talk, at least some of them can talk.

166
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,180
But Plutarch and Porphyry, it's interesting as they aren't really relevant for us today,

167
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,300
because their works were not translated into Arabic, or at least these works by them were

168
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,780
not translated into Arabic, so they kind of fall out of the story.

169
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:22,820
And what's communicated to the Arabic tradition is basically a unified view, according to

170
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,740
which animals are non-rational, and that completely differentiates them from humans.

171
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,540
Okay, now let's think a little bit more about what I was saying just a moment ago, namely

172
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:44,540
that animal cognition falls below human cognition, because it doesn't involve thinking abstractly

173
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,660
about general features of the universe.

174
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,380
So I want to flesh that out a little bit.

175
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,260
What this would mean in the terms that become familiar in the Arabic tradition, but to some

176
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,060
extent this is all pretty well grounded in Aristotle himself, would be that animals can

177
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:10,620
only grasp particulars, they can't grasp generalities.

178
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:22,340
So what this would mean is that, for example, a mother giraffe could see that another animal

179
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,460
is a giraffe, maybe, and they would certainly be able to recognize particular giraffes,

180
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,860
like the mother can recognize her own offspring, that's not a problem, and of course they

181
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,180
can sort of differentiate between giraffes and non-giraffes, like if you put another giraffe

182
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:46,740
in front of a giraffe, the giraffe will be like giraffe, okay, whereas if you put a lion

183
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,180
in front of the giraffe, the giraffe will be like, oh, crap, and it will turn and run

184
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,980
away with that loping stride that we're so familiar with, right, so they react appropriately,

185
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:03,620
but to do that they don't need to have the notion of giraffes as opposed to lions, right,

186
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,380
like they don't need to think about the species of lion or the species of giraffe, they just

187
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:14,260
have to be like, oh, there's a dangerous animal, I'm going to run, there's a safe animal so

188
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,500
I'm not going to run.

189
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:24,380
Now obviously we also grasp particulars all the time, right, and in fact, as I was saying,

190
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,820
a lot of humans may not think at the level of generalities very often or even at all,

191
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:36,020
so you can do things like enjoy a nice piece of cake without engaging in any general abstract

192
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,620
reasoning about cake, right, so you don't have to think, ah, here's a piece of cake

193
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,980
that falls under the species of cake, which falls under the genus of baked goods, and

194
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,660
I've had other baked goods and I enjoyed them, therefore I may enjoy, you can do that if

195
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:58,340
you want, but most of us are just like, ah, cake, right, and you just eat it.

196
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:04,020
You also, at least I spend very little time thinking about whether, and in retrospect,

197
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,220
the members of my own family fall under the species of human, I don't know about your

198
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,300
own family lives, but basically for practical purposes we don't need to think about, think

199
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,660
like this very much, we think like this when we're doing science.

200
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,620
Now the examples I've just given are really about sense perception, right, like giraffes

201
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,180
seeing other giraffes or lions, us seeing pieces of cake, but even when we're engaging

202
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,700
in what you might think of as somewhat more abstract forms of cognition, we're still actually

203
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,980
dealing with particulars most of the time, so for example, show of hands, who had cake

204
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:50,620
yesterday, that's it, this is great Britain, come on, this is the best thing about the

205
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:57,020
country, okay, so those of you who had cake, so those of you who raised your hand or those

206
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:02,260
of you who thought I did have cake but I'm not admitting that in front of all these people,

207
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,980
you were remembering the cake you had yesterday and you were remembering a particular piece

208
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,380
of cake, namely the particular piece of cake you had yesterday, right, some of you may have

209
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,380
foregone a piece of cake yesterday because you're unlike me, you're very, you know,

210
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,220
abstemious and self-controlled, so that was a particular piece of cake that you remember

211
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:28,780
not eating, also everyone in the room is now imagining a piece of cake, right, because

212
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,420
how could you not, that's sort of what cake is, it's the kind of thing that you imagine

213
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,900
when people talk about it, and you were also imagining a giraffe looking at a lion or a

214
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,020
giraffe a minute ago, what you were imagining was a particular giraffe, not necessarily

215
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,780
a particular one you've seen, but if you have a kind of image of the giraffe, it's an image

216
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:54,540
of a particular giraffe that you kind of cobble together from story books, safaris, nature

217
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,740
documentaries, whatever it is that's giving you your image of giraffes, so that actually

218
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,140
means that you can get through a lot of your mental life just dealing with particulars,

219
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,980
right, sort of constructed imaginary particulars or actual particulars, when you remember,

220
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,820
when you imagine, you're dealing with particulars, and this would help explain how it is that

221
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,940
animals can do some of these amazing things that they do, right, so why are they capable

222
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:26,500
of apparently complex behaviors, recognizing things, maybe building things, making apparently

223
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,740
making plans, something like apparent means and reasoning, they're doing it all with memory

224
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:39,860
and imagination, according to the conventional view, and this has an important consequence,

225
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,300
so as I said before, Aristotle is of the view that the intellect doesn't have a bodily organ,

226
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:52,420
but the imagination and memory do have a bodily organ, he would have thought, as I said before,

227
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,780
that it's the heart, but by the time we get to the Arabic tradition, they know that it's the

228
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,500
brain, and the reason they know that it's the brain is because Galen, the great doctor in

229
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:10,260
the second century, has done empirical studies that prove that all of your cognitive powers

230
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:19,940
are seated in the brain, in particular he shows that the commands that move the limbs travel

231
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,300
through the nerves down from the brain, in the time of Aristotle they didn't even know

232
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,980
the nervous system existed, actually, that was first discovered in Alexandria, a couple

233
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:35,020
of hundred years before Galen, and Galen does experiments actually on animals, in which

234
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:41,540
he proves that it's really the brain that's the most central organ, at one point he says

235
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:47,780
that if you want to show people how important the brain is, a really good way to do this

236
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:54,780
is to take a pig, put it on a stage, expose the nerves coming down from the neck, and

237
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,700
then snip the nerves that go to the vocal cords, because the pig will be making this

238
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:07,700
incredible racket and screaming in pain, and then suddenly it will be silent, it's obviously

239
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:15,700
a very gruesome experiment, but a very impressive one. By contrast, interlection doesn't involve

240
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:22,820
a bodily organ, so the difference between us and animals, as I said before, really is

241
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,380
along this line between material powers and immaterial powers, even the things that we

242
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,580
might think of as part of our mental life or consciousness, by the way this is a real

243
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,420
difference between the way we tend to think about it in philosophy of mind nowadays, and

244
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:45,420
the way that ancient and medieval people thought in their philosophy of mind, so for us all

245
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:51,220
the mental stuff is kind of whatever involves consciousness, so for us something like imagination

246
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:58,220
or memory would be just as much on the mind side of things as abstract thinking, whereas

247
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,480
in the Aristotelian tradition there's a huge difference between something like imagination

248
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,480
and intellect, the difference is precisely the difference between particulars being grasped

249
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:22,680
with a power that's seated in a bodily organ, and universals, abstract generalities, being

250
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:31,120
grasped with an immaterial power, namely intellect, so this particular versus universal thing

251
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:38,120
tracks material versus immaterial powers, and this is all the kind of background for

252
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Ibn Sina's view, so Ibn Sina, like I said, is the most important philosopher in the Islamic

253
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,880
tradition, he died in 1037, and he actually proves, or tries to prove, that the intellect

254
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:04,460
is realized immaterially and that the rational soul does not have a bodily organ on the

255
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,460
grounds that the rational soul or mind or intellect, so the Arabic word here for intellect

256
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:22,180
is akl, which can also be translated as a reason sometimes, that power he thinks can't

257
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:27,420
be realized in a bodily organ, just as Aristotle said, but he gives a different argument that's

258
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:34,020
not found in Aristotle, and his argument is precisely on the basis of universals versus

259
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:41,020
particulars, and this is a little bit complicated and probably won't convince you, but here's

260
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:48,780
the argument anyway for what it's worth, so his idea is that if a universal were received

261
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:56,220
in a particular, like in an organ, then the universal would somehow be rendered particular,

262
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:03,980
and his idea here is something like this, if you think about the abstract idea of giraffe,

263
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:11,420
that's just a kind of form or essence or something like that, and it becomes a particular giraffe

264
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:18,420
because it's found in some matter, namely the matter that the giraffe is made of. He compares

265
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,860
this to the way a color could be received in a body or on a surface, so if a color appears

266
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,900
in a surface, then it will be rendered a particular instance of that color, and there'll be some

267
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:35,180
over here and some over here, so similarly when giraffeness is received by matter, you

268
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,380
get a particular giraffe of a certain size with a certain location, and it's really

269
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:47,220
matter that generates the particularity in some sense, or that explains the particularity.

270
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:53,980
Another way of thinking about this is in terms of individuation, so what makes this giraffe

271
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,460
and this giraffe, I should have brought two giraffes with me as display objects, but the

272
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,540
budget would not allow for it. I did ask Fedor, but apparently your university wouldn't support

273
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,900
me. Now you have to use your imagination, much-a-vanted imagination, which we share

274
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,780
with animals, so imagine there's a giraffe here and a giraffe here. What do they have

275
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,180
in common? What differentiates them? Well, in the first instance, what they have in common

276
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:23,620
is that they're both giraffes, so it's not giraffehood that makes them different. What

277
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:30,180
makes them different is things like there's one here and one there, spatial location, and

278
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:37,460
there's a long story, which actually Fedor has worked on, about how individuation works

279
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:44,460
in the scene, but to make a long story short, we can say that individuation is at least

280
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,580
correlated with matter, so when you have one hunk of matter turned into a giraffe over

281
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,460
here, and another hunk of matter turned into a giraffe over here, you get two giraffes,

282
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:01,460
whereas giraffehood is just one thing, so to speak. Similarly, if we were to receive

283
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:10,540
a universal idea in a bodily organ, like the brain, then that would constrain it or particularize

284
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,060
it. It would no longer be universal, it would be rendered particular, just as giraffehood

285
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,860
is rendered particular by being realized in one bit of matter rather than another bit

286
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:28,860
of matter. That's his proof for the immateriality of the rational soul. But, he thinks that

287
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,980
just as we've seen in the rest of the Aristotelian tradition, he holds on to this part of the

288
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,980
traditional view. He thinks that our other cognitive powers are all realized in the brain,

289
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:51,420
so the intellect is the only thing that we exercise without using a bodily organ. Obviously,

290
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:59,340
things like digestion, reproduction, or eyesight or hearing, obviously these things are manifested

291
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,580
and executed through bodily organs. It's less obvious that that's true with things like

292
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,740
imagination and memory, but he thinks that those are just as much seated in the brain

293
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,820
as, for example, your eyesight is seated in your eyes and your optic nerve and so on,

294
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:23,820
your whole visual system. Intellection is the exception. Only intellect is exercised

295
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:30,820
immaterially. The more that you think about this and the more detailed your story about

296
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,620
cognitive powers other than intellect becomes, the more you are accepting that there's quite

297
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,380
a large degree of overlap between humans and animals. Actually, although we're going

298
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:51,820
to get on to Faridina Razi, who argues against Ibn Sina by saying that there's even more

299
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:57,340
commonality between animals and humans than Ibn Sina thought, actually, in my opinion,

300
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:03,340
Ibn Sina is someone who should be recognized as really going very far in the direction

301
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,660
of admitting that there's a lot of overlap or a lot of commonality between humans and

302
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,940
animals. This is precisely because he was so interested in the cognitive powers that

303
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,900
we have that are shared with animals. In other words, the cognitive powers that somehow

304
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:25,100
fall short of intellect because they only deal with particulars. This brings us to his

305
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:32,100
celebrated theory of the internal senses. We have five external senses, hearing, sight,

306
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:39,100
hearing, smell, taste, touch, right, five. Similarly, this is very neat. We have five

307
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:49,580
internal senses. We've got five external senses, hearing, sight, et cetera. We have five internal

308
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:57,020
senses, the common sense, the retentive imagination, the estimation, which I'll say more about

309
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:04,020
in a second, memory and the compositive imagination. It actually doesn't matter very much how these

310
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:11,020
all work and what their functions are. As we can see from this Latin medieval drawing,

311
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,820
which is supposed to show Ibn Sina's theory, or what they would have called Abyssinus theory,

312
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,940
they're all seated in the brain. They're in different what he calls ventricles of the

313
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:27,060
brain. I think memory is in the back, for example. Actually, you can almost see them

314
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:34,060
in my case because they're so little in the way. He actually tells you where they are

315
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,620
in your brain, which lobes of the brain contain which powers. Again, what they all have in

316
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:47,020
common is that, of course, they're internal. They're in the brain. They're not realized

317
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,700
through something like eyes or ears or whatever, but also they deal with particulars. A really

318
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:59,700
nice example of this is the so-called estimation, or wahm in Arabic. Estimation is a misleading

319
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:08,300
translation here. The reason we often translate this word into English as estimation is that

320
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:15,300
it was translated as estimatio into Latin, but in English it conjures up the idea of

321
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:20,700
guessing or approximating, and that's not what we're talking about at all. I usually

322
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,540
just say, I just usually use the word wahm for it because there is no easy good translation

323
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:32,540
into English. This is a capacity that both humans and animals have, which allows them

324
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:41,020
to register the properties that particular things have that aren't detectable by the

325
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:48,380
external senses. His example is the, I couldn't believe I found this picture, by the way,

326
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,740
online, because it's so perfect. I'm going to use this in every slideshow for the rest

327
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,700
of my life as I talk about how to send a theory of wahm. His example is a sheep seeing

328
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:05,700
a wolf and doing what these sheep are doing, which is running away from the wolf and hoping

329
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:13,180
that they're not the slowest sheep. Why would a sheep do this? Ask yourself. Imagine you're

330
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:22,620
in an Aristotelian universe. A sheep can do whatever Aristotle would say the sheep can

331
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,460
do. The sheep can smell the wolf. The wolf smells, I don't know, have a wolf smell? Musty,

332
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,460
I'm thinking, and a musty. It can see that the wolf has a gray coat, and maybe can hear

333
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,740
the snarl, but none of these things are worth running away from. You don't run away from

334
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:47,860
the color gray, and you don't run away from the snarling noise just because of the noise.

335
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,460
If you ran away from the noise, it would be because of what the noise represents, which

336
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:58,220
you can't hear. Probably the sheep doesn't have memories of wolves that it's met in

337
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:04,980
the past because the sheep is still alive. In any case, sheep will run away from a wolf

338
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,540
the first time they see a wolf. They don't need to have experienced a wolf before. The

339
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:14,500
sheep doesn't need to imagine the wolf. Also, if it were imagining a wolf, it wouldn't run.

340
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:21,500
It would just go, ooh, wolves, I hate wolves. Rather, what's happening is that the sheep

341
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:29,340
looks at the wolf and is like, what the draft is with the line, oh, crap, that looks dangerous

342
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:36,900
or as Ibn Sina says, it's hostile, it's dangerous. It turns and runs like hell. How is it doing

343
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,940
this? Actually, I think Ibn Sina would say, well, Aristotle wouldn't be able to explain

344
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:48,940
this. But I can explain it. My explanation is that the sheep has a faculty called Wahm.

345
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:55,300
Wahm is the ability to detect things like hostility. Another cozier example is that

346
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:02,420
the sheep can also perceive the familiarity of its own offspring. That's why it kind of

347
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:11,100
nuzzles or takes care of its lamb, but it doesn't run from the lamb and it doesn't cozy

348
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:16,620
up to the wolf. It runs from the wolf and cozy's up to the lamb. The reason it is able

349
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:23,060
to do that is it has this power called Wahm. We have it too. What we're seeing here is

350
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:30,100
that actually, Ibn Sina has, in a way, gone quite far in the direction of expanding our

351
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:40,580
conception of what animals are capable of. I would say he offers us a picture of animal

352
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:47,340
mental life, which is very rich, because what he's left for humans to do uniquely is very

353
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,780
thin. It's just this kind of abstract universal thinking. Again, it's really important that

354
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:58,020
all of these complicated things and sophisticated things that animals can do are always going

355
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:03,220
to involve particulars as their cognitive content. The sheep will never start thinking

356
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:09,260
about, why do the wolves hate us so much? Is it because we're so delicious? They don't

357
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,940
think about it in that level. They're just like, here's a wolf. That's dangerous. I'm

358
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:19,020
running. That's all they do. There's no abstract thought.

359
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:26,020
Now, I gave not this paper, but a paper that had some of this material in it before. Teresa

360
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,740
Antirouard pointed out something to me that she had just been writing about in a paper

361
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,140
which wasn't published at the time, namely that there's a passage in part of the logic

362
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:46,820
of Ibn Sina's biggest philosophical work, the Shifa, that suggests that animals can

363
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:54,420
use Wahum to discriminate between species. This would be like my example, Gazintide.

364
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:01,940
As we say in Germany, Gazintide. This would be like the case I gave before, the giraffes

365
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:08,620
are like, oh, giraffes versus lions. You might think, well, doesn't that start to suggest

366
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:15,620
that animals do have the capacity to think at the level of universals? Maybe, but even

367
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,580
in this very passage, he still draws this hard and fast distinction between Wahum and

368
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:28,580
intellect, Akku. Even there, he's saying, well, if animals can classify particulars as

369
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,980
being of a certain type, they still can't engage in an intellect. Maybe there's some

370
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:43,020
ambiguity here between exactly how much he wants to pack into Wahum as opposed to Akku.

371
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,700
I find this passage quite puzzling, actually, how he can say this. Ultimately, it's going

372
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:54,700
to be really important for him that proper, as such, universal thinking is only going

373
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:01,500
to be possible for humans, and of course, God and angels, because only we have this

374
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:08,500
immaterial rational power. If you start saying that animals can grasp universals, then his

375
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,860
proof for the immateriality of the soul will go for them just as much as for us, and then

376
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:19,700
animal souls would be able to survive the death of their body, right? And you wouldn't

377
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:26,700
want that. Or would you? Maybe you would want that. Even Sino doesn't, so even Sino surely

378
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,740
does not think that animals survive the death of their body, but that doesn't necessarily

379
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:39,740
represent a kind of unified, unanimous opinion amongst Muslim scholars, because in fact,

380
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:49,380
in the Islamic theological tradition, the tradition that goes under the name of Qalaam in Arabic,

381
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:56,380
is commonly thought that animals also enjoy an afterlife. And there's good reason for

382
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:05,500
this, namely that there are passages in the Quran that suggest an afterlife for the animals.

383
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:15,100
For example, this is a passage from Quran 6.38, there's no creature on the earth or bird

384
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,460
that flies with its wings, except that they are communities like you. So it seems to imply

385
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:25,620
some kind of political life, maybe, for animals. But then the important part is, unto their

386
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,460
Lord they will be gathered. Well, that sounds like they're all going to heaven or something,

387
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,460
right? Or going to paradise. And on the basis of this, and also on the basis that you don't

388
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:43,460
want injustice in God's creation without it being somehow counterbalanced by some kind

389
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:52,140
of justice, some motakalimun theologians said things like, oh, well, when animals are savagely

390
00:36:53,820 --> 00:37:00,520
torn to bits by predators, that's sad for them. But the good news is then they go to

391
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:06,700
paradise and they get lots of nice food to make it up to them. So as an author who's

392
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:13,700
written about this has said, for this particular school of Qalaam, God is like a cosmic bookkeeper

393
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:21,100
who's like, oh, well, this giraffe got savaged to death by lions. So the giraffe will get

394
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,460
you know, 30 years of really nice acacia leaves or something in paradise. And then God is

395
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,100
like, okay, you've been rewarded enough to make up for that. It's sorry about that thing

396
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,460
that happened to you, 30 years in it. I know that was rough. But look at all the nice leaves

397
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:39,500
you've got, right? That might be a little bit too crude a way of thinking about it, but

398
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:46,500
somehow God makes it up to them in the afterlife. And in general, there's a very strong trend

399
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,660
in Qalaam of thinking that animals somehow participate in the afterlife, which brings

400
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:59,840
us to Fahad al-Nirazi, because it is precisely in the context of talking about the afterlife

401
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,220
in a work of his called the Molachas, which was only just recently edited. But actually

402
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:11,220
when we started working on this, we were looking at the work in manuscripts. So this

403
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:17,740
is like a very recently, a work that's only very recently started to get studied. So it's

404
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:25,740
one of several works he wrote that kind of survey philosophical and theological questions,

405
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:32,660
across a variety of topics. So he's talking about the afterlife. And then without really

406
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:39,300
explaining that that's the relevant context, he says, now here's a question. Do animals

407
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,780
have rational souls or not? Do they have rational souls like humans, or do they have a different

408
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:50,140
kind of soul like the philosophers would say? And although he doesn't spell this out, I

409
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:57,140
think that, and I've written a paper about this with Bly, we think that he must be thinking

410
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:05,140
the reason why it's worth discussing this is that if animals didn't have rational souls,

411
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:11,660
then at least according to Ibn Sina's arguments for the immateriality and hence immortality

412
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:18,660
of our soul, if they don't have rational souls, then they must die when their bodies die,

413
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,660
and then they wouldn't have an afterlife. But as a theologian, he wants to at least be

414
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:30,700
open to the possibility that animals do have an afterlife. Now, so this is actually, typically

415
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:34,860
for him, this is quite a complicated thing going on here, because what he's thinking

416
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:41,860
is, well, if I were an Avicenan philosopher, then I would think that the only way for animals

417
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:48,380
to have an afterlife is for them to be rational. Now, actually, he's not an Avicenan philosopher,

418
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:54,740
he's a critic of Ibn Sina, but what he wants to do, I think, is to suggest, well, I'm going

419
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,580
to give an argument that would show Ibn Sina that he should admit that animals have an

420
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:05,500
afterlife. And then if I can show that, since theologians, also with their own kind of theory

421
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,500
of the soul and whatever, if they would also think that animals would have an afterlife,

422
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,580
then everyone could sort of agree. So this is almost like a way of saying, well, even

423
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:22,220
the kind of toughest nut to crack, namely an Aristotelian slash Avicenan position, should

424
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,300
still think that animals have an afterlife, because they should admit that animals are

425
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,780
rational, and if they admit that animals are rational, then they should admit that animals

426
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:35,780
have an afterlife. Now, that's obviously imputing a lot to him, because he doesn't spell anything,

427
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:42,780
any of that out in the text, but I think that's the kind of basis for the argument. In any

428
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:49,580
case, even if you kind of set that aside, what's really worth our interest is the way

429
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:56,020
he argues for animal rationality. And as we're going to see, he really kind of presupposes

430
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:03,020
the truth of Ibn Sina's own way of thinking about rationality. Because if you think about

431
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,620
it, there's two ways you could go at this, right? You could say, well, you say that

432
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:13,660
intellection or rationality, akka, is characterized by universal abstract thought. But that's not

433
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:20,660
true. I'm using my intellect when I decide what to have for dinner, right? Cake, maybe.

434
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,060
Bad choice, but a choice nonetheless. But then he knows that Ibn Sina would say, no, no,

435
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,660
no, no, that's just imagination. Or you know, you're remembering some cake you had, you're

436
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,940
imagining the cake you could have, you're engaging in something that's not full blown

437
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:41,820
intellection. So that doesn't count. So what he's going to do is maybe for the sake of

438
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:46,260
arguments, he's going to say, let's suppose that intellection is what you say it is. And

439
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:52,860
I'm going to show you that animals by that criterion must have intellect. And this is

440
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,700
really clear from the first argument he gives. There's five arguments I'm going to give you

441
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:03,140
two of them. And the first argument comes in kind of free with three cases to illustrate

442
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:10,140
it. So the first argument is that animals must have the ability to grasp universals as

443
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:17,180
such. They don't only grasp particulars. Why? Well, first of all, even exercise, and this

444
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:25,180
I think is a really remarkable thing to say, even the exercise of sense perception involves

445
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:32,220
grasping universals. Because to see a wolf and see it as something other than just a

446
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:40,140
patch of gray is to see it as a wolf. Now, this is actually an interesting question in

447
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,540
Aristotelian philosophy. So what would Aristotle say about this? What does Aristotle think

448
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:52,540
about seeing something as a wolf? He might say, well, properly speaking, what you see

449
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,980
is something gray. But then you kind of layer on top of that the information that it's a

450
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:05,980
wolf or something like that. But Fahredin is thinking, well, take this example that

451
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:13,460
we have for the Messina, the sheep seeing the wolf, seeing that the wolf is dangerous.

452
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:20,460
It must be able to perceive the wolf as a wolf, as a member of a hostile species, in

453
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:27,340
order to react appropriately. So all of that kind of abstract universal content is already

454
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:32,180
built into sense perception. It's a profoundly un-Aristotelian thing to say, or at least

455
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,420
if not un-Aristotelian, it's against the Aristotelian tradition. There's exactly what

456
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:41,900
Aristotelians have been denying for literally more than a thousand years. So they've always

457
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,500
said sense perception is of particulars, not universals. And Fahredin is like, ah, if you

458
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:52,140
think about it, sense perception is of universals too, because you're classifying or you're

459
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:57,740
sort of subsuming the particular that you see under a particular universal in order to react

460
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:03,060
to it appropriately. And it's obvious that animals can do this. There's quite a remarkable

461
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:10,060
move on his part. And the next case he gives, another illustration of the fact that animals

462
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:17,860
can grasp universals, is if anything, even more clever. So let's imagine that the sheep

463
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:26,340
sees the wolf, and it turns to run. So now it's intending to run, okay? And an Aristotelian

464
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:34,500
would say, no problem, it runs. But Fahredin says, well, hang on a second. Is it intending

465
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:41,300
to perform the particular act of running it's about to perform? No. It's not like, oh, I'm

466
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:47,020
going to run exactly in this way, away from this wolf, like I'm going to put my foot exactly

467
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,940
there and exactly there. No. It's going to just run like hell. Any act of running would

468
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:57,260
be fine, right? Any act of running that will get it away from the wolf would be perfectly

469
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:03,260
adequate. In fact, probably it couldn't think, it couldn't intend very exactly to perform

470
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:10,260
a particular act of running. This might actually connect to something that you, there's an argument

471
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:18,620
that you sometimes get in Calam, which is that God and not we must be the creator of

472
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:24,780
our acts, because we aren't able to create particular acts down to the level of finest

473
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:31,220
detail. Why? How do we know this? Well, an example that he gives, imagine you write your

474
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:38,020
name and then someone says to you, okay, now write your name again, exactly the same, down

475
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:43,860
to the molecule. No chance, right? You wouldn't even be able to come close. You could make

476
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,660
something, you could make a signature or something that looks basically similar, but of course

477
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:53,900
you couldn't make something exactly identical in every detail, whereas God could. And then

478
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,020
they say, well, if you can't do it the second time, then obviously you can't do it the first

479
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:03,340
time. If you were capable of producing this, then you could do it again, but you can't.

480
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,700
So it must be God creating your signature and not you. This is an argument for occasionalism.

481
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,700
Whether that's in the background here, I'm not sure, but it's very similar, it's a very

482
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:16,860
similar thought. So the idea is that the sheep is not going to be able to intend to perform

483
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:23,860
exactly the act of running that it performs. It can only intend generically to run. And

484
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:29,980
that's, I think, is a brilliant argument. So this is showing that what is in them, as

485
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:36,660
it were, in the mind of the sheep is a universal, namely running and not a particular, namely

486
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:42,140
the particular act of running it's about to perform. Very clever. Third example, and this

487
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:48,740
may be the easiest, is imagine a sheep that's looking for grass. And he actually gives the

488
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,460
example of looking for grass, of an animal looking for grass. He says, the animal's not

489
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:59,700
looking for some particular grass. Oh, no, not that one. I had some different grass in

490
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,300
mind. They don't care, they're just looking for grass. In other words, they're looking

491
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:09,100
for something that instantiates the universal grass. So again, what is, as it were, in their

492
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:16,100
mind has to be a universal, not a particular. I mean, think about it like this. All of the

493
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:22,980
particular examples of grass that the sheep have ever seen are precisely the ones that

494
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:27,700
aren't relevant, because they've already been eaten by the sheep and the sheep's friends.

495
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:32,360
What I'm looking for is some grass that I've never experienced yet. So I'm precisely looking

496
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:38,620
not for the particular grass as I've seen, but for a new one, like, I'll go over there.

497
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,900
He also has this nice example of smelling that there's some grass and being like, oh, that

498
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:51,300
must be some grass. Not some particular grass, but just grass. Now, I think this is interesting

499
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,780
now to think about what an Aristotelian slash Abyssinian would say in response. Maybe they

500
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:03,640
would say, well, the animal is not grasping these things qua universal. So they're somehow

501
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,820
operating as if they had a universal in their mind, but they don't because they're not sort

502
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:16,900
of explicitly entertaining the universal and thinking about it as such. But if that's the

503
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,340
answer, I think it's not a very good one. Because remember that Abyssinian's argument

504
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:27,580
was in order to receive the universal at all, you have to have an immaterial power. And it

505
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:34,700
looks like they are, and it looks like to operate with a universal concept, the animal needs

506
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:40,980
to have such an immaterial power whether or not it's thinking about it as such. So I actually

507
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:55,620
think Fakhredin's argument here is very convincing. Oh, sorry, these slides are in the wrong order.

508
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:00,900
There's another argument, the fourth one, where he just reels off a very short list of amazing

509
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:06,100
things that animals do. And there's a parallel text in another work, which I also wrote an

510
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:17,300
article about, about all these sort of amazing things that animals, like amazing behaviors

511
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:22,780
that animals display. He gives the example of hexagonal cells in a beehive. He gives

512
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,420
an example that our colleague Sarah Vergi wrote a whole paper about. This is an example

513
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:33,260
that comes up already in antiquity and then a whole series of texts in the Islamic world.

514
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:39,340
The example is a mouse wants to get at some oil in a bottle, apparently mice like to

515
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:47,180
sip oil, I didn't know this. And the bottle has a narrow neck, and it's too narrow for

516
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:52,980
the animal to poke its head in and lick the oil. So what it does is it sits on top, dips

517
00:49:52,980 --> 00:50:00,580
its tail into the oil, sort of swirls its tail around, pulls it out and licks its tail.

518
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:06,180
I don't know if mice actually do this, but you can sort of imagine a mouse doing this.

519
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:12,540
And the idea is if animals can do this, then they must be just as capable of reasoning

520
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:22,060
as humans are. This is just supposed to amaze you with the things that animals do. So the

521
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:29,700
upshot is that animals can grasp universals, they can engage in reasoning, means and reasoning

522
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:34,660
like we just saw with the mouse, the kind of universal reasoning that is needed to engage

523
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:44,220
in sense perception, look for food, perform motions. And that should show that animals,

524
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,620
whatever you say about human reasoning, you should say about animals too. So if humans

525
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,460
can do this because they have immaterial souls, then you should say that animals have immaterial

526
00:50:52,500 --> 00:51:00,660
souls. There might be another thing that's in play here, namely that in general Farhaddin

527
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,580
is quite skeptical of what you might call the faculty psychology theory that we find

528
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:12,340
in Aristotelianism where you have like sensation and imagination and memory and so on. Farhaddin,

529
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:16,340
along with some other philosophers of the period, especially someone named Abu Barakat

530
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:22,020
al-Baghdadi, who's going to be relevant again in a second, they thought that this is kind

531
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:27,620
of a wrong way of approaching philosophical psychology and that what you should say is

532
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:34,140
that you have a soul, which is just one kind of power, and it can do a whole bunch of things.

533
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:39,580
So rather than, I mean this is kind of a tendentious way of thinking about the Abbasin and Slash

534
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:45,020
Aristotelian position, but they would say, well they think that you see that what sees

535
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:54,140
is your vision and what imagines is your imagination, whereas we think that when I imagine the

536
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:59,580
person, the thing that's imagining is just me, right? So it's just one of many actions

537
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:06,060
that I can perform. So they're trying to articulate a view according to which there's this single

538
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:14,580
subject of cognition, which we might call the self, and this self is just what does everything.

539
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:21,260
And the reason why I think that might be relevant is that it's, given what we've seen from Fahaddin

540
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:27,580
about animals, it looks like he's trying to question this very hard and fast kind of

541
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:32,980
leveled theory of cognition, where you have reason up here and imagination and sensation

542
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:39,100
down here. So for example, think about what he said in the first argument here. You can't

543
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:45,020
even do sense perception without using intellect, right? So that would kind of push you in the

544
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:50,460
direction of thinking that different forms of cognition kind of involve each other, and

545
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:55,620
that would go along very nicely with the idea that it's just one self or soul doing all

546
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:01,300
the cognition rather than the idea that you have these separate faculties which somehow

547
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:13,340
get put together to form a rich mental life. Okay, in any case, what we've seen is that,

548
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:19,620
as I say, we have all these examples of clever things that animals do, some of them actually

549
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,980
drawn from in the Sina, and even going all the way back to Aristotle, and this should

550
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:31,020
show that animals too are intelligent. And all of this is within, to some extent, within

551
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:36,860
the framework of the conventional view, right, the traditional Aristotelian view, because

552
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:43,860
he's assuming that the possession of reason somehow goes along with the ability to outlive

553
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:50,980
the death of the body, right? That's, I think, the whole point. Now then, one thing about

554
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:58,900
Razzi is that he always will consider objections on every side of every dispute, so he will

555
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,300
very rarely advance a position without then saying, well, but there's an objection to

556
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:11,300
this position, so that's what he does to here, and he says, well, here's an objection.

557
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:18,580
If animals were rational, then there'd only be one kind of soul, and probably he's not

558
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:22,940
thinking about plants, right? Because he has to argue that plants are rational, or that

559
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:28,580
plants can engage in sense perception. So there'd only be a single kind of soul, which

560
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:33,980
is jointly shared by humans and animals, and so he wouldn't even have a distinction between

561
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:40,980
these different kinds of soul anymore, right? Now, actually, this is an interesting, there's

562
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:48,580
an interesting kind of long running debate here. If you think about it, we kind of very

563
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:57,740
naturally associate, in the Aristotelian tradition, the idea that we very naturally associate

564
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:03,500
different types of soul with different kind of levels of existence, right? So there's

565
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,940
human rational souls, there's animal souls, and then there's plant souls, so we think

566
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:14,700
there are three kinds of souls, but you wouldn't have to do it like that, right? So for example,

567
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:20,820
you could say there's plant souls, and there's non-plant souls, so you could be less fine

568
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:25,620
grained, or you could be more fine grained, right? So for example, you could say there's

569
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:30,100
the kind of soul that really smart people have, and then there's the kind of soul that

570
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:35,420
kind of dumb people have, and then in between there's sort of the mediocre souls, and then

571
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:42,460
there's the animal souls, right? Or you could say that there's the carnivorous souls and

572
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:50,340
the plantiferous souls, herbivorous, yes, herbivorous souls, right? You could have carved

573
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:54,980
it up in all kinds of ways, to use a very apt metaphor given all the tearing apart of

574
00:55:54,980 --> 00:56:00,380
limbs we've been discussing during this talk. So why do it this way? And in fact, just in

575
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:05,340
an immediate environment of Fakhreddin, there's been a slightly earlier philosopher named

576
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:09,980
Abu Barakat Al-Baghdadi who said, well, actually, maybe different humans have different kinds

577
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:16,020
of souls, so maybe courageous people have one kind of soul, and cowardly people have another

578
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:23,020
kind of soul. This is an idea that has just been flirted with in the tradition. But Fakhreddin

579
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:28,180
doesn't really like, he doesn't really want to smash all the different kinds of souls

580
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:33,300
together, nor does he want to say that there are different species of human soul. He wants

581
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:38,140
to adhere to the traditional idea that there are human souls and non-human souls, animal

582
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:43,420
souls, and that you can somehow distinguish them. Yet, now he's saying, well, I can't

583
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:49,100
define human souls just in respect of their rationality, because I'm now suggesting that

584
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:56,140
animal souls can be rational as well. So what he says is, there might be, and by the way,

585
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,860
sorry, I should have gotten to this slide first. He actually mentions this thing from

586
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:13,860
Abu Barakat about courageous and cowardly souls, and he says, this is like lions and rabbits.

587
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:20,260
So lions have one kind of soul, rabbits have another kind of soul, lions are brave, rabbits

588
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:27,260
are timid. But the fact that, and so you can find these differences if you want, but the

589
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:33,820
fact that there might be some kind of shared commonality between human souls and animal

590
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:40,500
souls doesn't prove that there's no difference between human souls and animal souls, because

591
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:46,100
maybe animals have reason, and we have reason, but we have more of it than they do. So we're

592
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:52,780
intelligent to a much greater degree than animals are intelligent, and that's really

593
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:59,780
the difference. So his idea here would apparently be that there's a kind of continuum of intelligence

594
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:08,820
from animals up to humans with us at the top, or maybe we're not at the top actually,

595
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:14,300
because probably angels, and for sure God, are more intelligent and rational than we are,

596
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:19,060
so maybe we're actually sort of in the middle. But if you leave these exalted beings out

597
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:24,540
in the natural world, we're the most intelligent, rational creatures, and then animals are less

598
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:29,900
rational and intelligent than us, and plants are not rational and intelligent at all. Something

599
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:34,140
he doesn't get into, one would really like to know what he thinks about this. He doesn't

600
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:39,660
get that much into the question of whether non-human animals are at different places

601
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:45,100
on the scale, but it's kind of suggested by these passages where he gives you all of these

602
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,980
examples of clever animals, because of course not all animals are capable of this kind of

603
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:56,260
clever behavior, like slugs don't do things like dipping their tail in oil and licking

604
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:00,780
it, and it's not just because they don't have tongues. Maybe slugs do have tongues. Slug

605
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:05,740
ologists in the house? Anyone? No? Okay, let's say for the sake of argument, slugs don't have

606
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:12,900
tongues. Even if they had tongues, they couldn't do this, right? Dogs are smarter than turtles.

607
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:20,740
I have no idea how smart turtles are. They're very smart, just rather slow. But you see what I

608
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:25,620
mean, right? So there's probably a continuum of smartness of intelligence within the animal

609
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:30,620
kingdom. He doesn't really get into that. He kind of gestures towards it by talking about what some

610
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:38,060
animals can do. But the really interesting thing would be that if you have human intelligence as

611
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:44,020
the kind of gold standard, then you would have some like, at least fairly smart animals that are

612
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:49,260
less intelligent than us, but still rational, and that would secure their participation in the

613
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:56,980
afterlife. So hence the title of the talk. So I said that the talk would be about an Islamic

614
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:04,580
thinker who's denying human exceptionalism. And it's true that we're not exceptional on his view,

615
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:10,100
at least if you, I mean, there are some texts where he is kind of noncommittal about all of this,

616
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,700
but at least in the mulachas, this one text we've been looking at, he seems to be quite committed

617
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:21,500
to the view that animals are intelligent. But they're not as intelligent as we are. And in that

618
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,860
sense, we do remain exceptional. And of course, that is important for him as a theologian too,

619
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:33,860
because God's relationship towards animals may be benevolent. He may give animals an afterlife. He

620
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:39,140
may even accept praise from animals. There are texts that say that animal calls and the noises

621
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:45,620
they make are prayers to God that we don't understand and so on. But still God's relationship to

622
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:49,660
humans is going to be very different from his relationship to the rest of the animal kingdom.

623
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:52,740
And he would want it that way. Thanks very much.
