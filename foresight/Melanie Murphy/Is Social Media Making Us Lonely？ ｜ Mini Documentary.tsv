0	20640	My name is Melanie Murphy and I love asking people questions that are difficult to answer.
20640	25600	Something I've been fascinated by recently is how much social media has blown up over
25600	32880	the past 20 years and let's be honest 20 years is a drop in the ocean of the timeline of humanity
32880	40320	and yet it's completely changed our lives. I create online content for a living mostly alone
40320	46160	as well as writing books the loneliest of jobs and while I feel that I spend plenty of time with
46160	51440	real-life human beings my average daily screen time leaves much to be desired.
52400	55600	So how many hours on average do you spend on your screen per day?
56240	61920	Four hours a day Lucy. Over four hours that is like two movies I could be watching a day.
62640	66480	I could be running a whole marathon every day. A lot of time spent with family and friends.
68480	73360	Ever since I graduated I've been partial to that mental nourishment that comes with having
73360	77760	different voices contribute to important conversations and the conversation around
77760	83040	social media and loneliness couldn't be more significant right now. What with study after
83040	88960	study and headline after headline pointing to higher rates of social isolation and depression
88960	92720	in those who replace most of their face-to-face encounters with cliques.
93760	100240	All the while 81% of teenagers feel that social media has a positive effect on their lives
100240	103600	and the credit for helping them to build stronger friendships.
104320	109440	Almost half of the people on this planet use social media every day for hours
109440	115520	and as humans time is our most valuable resource so are all these things like Twitter and Instagram
115520	122720	and Facebook detrimental to our social lives our well-being here is some food for thought.
124400	129440	Face-to-face interaction is like so important I just feel you get a good read of someone
129440	133440	when you're like looking at them looking at their expressions or the way they say something like it's
134000	136960	it's you can't compare that to like a text message or anything like that.
136960	141200	I've met people and I'm friends with people and I've gone on dates with people
141200	145360	I would never have met only for social media. You know it is intense and it is overwhelming
146080	153680	to go online and go on social media and see that 300 of the people that you follow are active
153680	162400	and they are accessible to talk to to interact with but they're not really there.
162480	166240	Social media was created to be social with people and I try to always remember that.
166240	169840	Ironically even though it's supposed to make us feel more connected can actually enhance
169840	174640	feelings of loneliness. I think social media can be really beneficial to people who are
175200	181600	experiencing something that can be really isolating like going through an illness.
181600	185360	The internet has been such a bridge for me such a lifeline.
185360	189680	I think social media makes me less lonely definitely.
189680	193360	I have to put my phone on did not disturb all the time because my brain can't handle it.
193360	196720	If children had phones in schools they wouldn't be locking up from the phone
196720	198960	they would be texting each other through the phone.
198960	203440	I would say that like 80% of my friendship circle has come from social media.
203440	207760	It would not surprise me if a lot of young people growing up nowadays
208800	214720	with who only know social media are terrified of conversation.
214720	217840	But from their point of view they're looking at people like us and going wow
217920	222000	I want to be like them they have loads of friends and meanwhile I'm sitting at home
222000	224640	with my dad with his cancer and no one's there.
224640	228640	Sometimes you'll like chat a lot online and you see that person in person and it's really
228640	230960	awkward and you don't know why and it's just like the chemistry.
234320	241200	Before social media your social life was your immediate friends group your work groups
242080	245440	and arranging to go out with them was you know if you were going to meet someone
245440	250000	say you met a girl in the pub and you were trying to arrange a date
250000	252640	she lived in South Dublin you lived in North Dublin
253600	258080	you'd get if you got her number you would probably ring from a public phone box
258800	263520	to confirm the date and time and then you'd be meeting them the following Saturday under a
263520	269760	clock in old chemistry with the advent of social media you've got your you know your fourth group
269760	273360	everyone I imagine everyone has set up is their family connections
274000	277280	where you can connect with people you would not normally connect with
277280	281920	and a family who've gone abroad historically before the internet you would you would probably
281920	288160	never hear from them again in some on some occasions so you get people past jokes comments
288160	290880	statuses or whatever the children are doing.
290880	296160	I moved home from living in Scotland for five years because social media just couldn't cut
296160	301760	it for me I needed to be around people physically not just see them on social media and see what
301760	306160	they're doing get the snippets of their lives rather than just spending time with these people
306160	310560	I needed to have the actual interaction with people rather than reading a text and they're
310560	315200	always just posting pictures and things like that so at different points when I was over there it
315200	320160	either helped me feel connected to them but also made me feel a bit lonely as well so at different
320160	322880	points I'd be like oh it's so good to see that everyone's having a good time but then other
322880	327280	times I'd be like I know I really just want to be there with them it was really tough.
327280	334720	I follow I think 700 people on Instagram and I know what 300 of them have for breakfast every
334720	339680	morning I know what time they go to sleep at I know how they're feeling I feel connected to
339680	344960	these people because I know these personal things that I would only know if I lived with them or if
344960	350320	I was friends with them but I'm not I've never met this person and it is kind of a lonely feeling
351040	357440	to almost believe that you know someone when you've never even had a personal conversation with
357440	362160	when I'm on Instagram and I'm interacting with people and I I didn't come away from it I feel
362160	369920	less connected to people for example like if if you put up some that's you know like you're quite
369920	376160	upset about and you're kind of looking for support you know do I feel disconnected from people
376160	381040	because it's not it's almost it's not them that's saying it to me but it's it's just a voice
382400	389120	or do I feel connected because I can on hand talk to them so easy it is a big commitment or it can
389120	393840	be a lot of pressure to to be there for someone especially if you're if you're not all there
393840	399680	yourself or you you have stuff going on so to just send the text is a lot easier on you when
399680	406080	shit hits the fan things are tough things are shit that's when you start to realize who your real
406080	412720	friends are I started vine three years of vining made loads of friends vine died and then my dad got
412720	420320	cancer and I spent all of my time taking care of my dad after that and then suddenly every single
420320	425360	person I thought I was friends with just disappeared I think social media is almost like a a poison in
425360	428960	the sense that it can make you feel like you have lots of friends and it makes you feel like you
428960	435120	have a big social life and then when real life happens someone passes away somebody gets ill
435120	440720	you're depressed there really isn't the social media carries on and none of those people are there
440720	444080	for you despite the fact that the numbers are all there the followers are all there the comments
444080	448880	are all rolling in haha this is so funny you're the best creator ever you're just sitting there at
448880	454880	home like flicking through your phone your dad's ill like it's like it's so weird it's it's almost
454960	459360	like an episode of black mirror social media has definitely been a double-edged sword for me
459360	464880	in terms of improving my anxiety and also triggering it again um I think when I first started to talk
464880	469600	about my experience with mental health social media was an incredible tool for me to share and
470400	473680	realize that I wasn't on my own because I think such a characteristic anxiety is that you think
473680	476480	you're the only person going through it so by putting something out there whether it was
476480	480640	Facebook or Instagram instantly I could really I could realize that there was so many people
480640	483840	who were going through the exact same thing I don't know I don't like to talk about my emotions
483840	489440	in person very much I would go to Facebook messenger and message my very close friends
489440	493680	or go to text and text my friends I wouldn't want to be in person with them while discussing that
493680	498960	thing that was bothering me so in a way it kind of aids my ability to talk to them when it's just
498960	503680	text and an image or maybe a couple of emojis you're losing out on the tone of voice the body
503680	507680	language and all of the other elements that go into communication that help you actually
508240	512240	convey a message or receive a message I love face-to-face interaction I'm like I'm
512240	517680	all about it I will talk to someone and give them my undivided attention I love talking to people
518560	523760	face-to-face just sort of quite a gestury kind of person tone and sarcasm and all that kind of
523760	532400	thing is very much the sort of like all my kind of idiosyncrasies um how I get my points across
533840	537680	and there's none of that on social media through text and that it's all very cold
537680	541920	when you're on social media you're behind a screen you're behind several filters or whatever
542000	545760	apps you're using you're curating it you're putting up the best bits if you want to and
545760	548880	you're taking your time to edit your caption and think about what you want to put out there
548880	554000	I've had people say to me that they're annoyed at how long it takes me to respond to messages
554000	558960	I think I'm one of the few people that doesn't get very offended when when I'm left on red because
558960	564880	I feel like I can empathize with why someone would want to leave me on red a lot of the time and
564880	569360	it's not personal it's about their own experience and not about me that gives me anxiety of going
569360	573360	oh are they waiting for me to reply to the message but I'm doing this but should I be
573360	577920	replying to them and it just starts spiraling on my head so instead I just leave it I have a very
577920	582400	different experience of social media I think to a lot of other people because I have a chronic illness
583120	588160	and a disparity that means I can't really leave the house very much and I spend a lot of time
588720	593840	I guess I would feel incredibly alone if I didn't have the internet I didn't have a way
593840	598640	to connect with other people I had a lumber puncture where they accidentally pierced my spinal
598640	605120	fluid sack too many times and my spinal fluid bled out and into my body so for two years while
605120	611840	my spinal fluid grew back essentially I had to be in a dark room by myself I couldn't have
612480	617840	light touch sound I couldn't have anyone near me because it was such an excruciating pain
618640	624480	and for those two years I felt incredibly alone I've thought am I the only person here
624560	629680	who's like this who's in the situation and now I get to make videos that I know touch
630240	634960	the people who are in that place still and that's the most beautiful thing for me
634960	642320	last year I had a really horrific like medical scare I was in hospital for a month with a
642320	649120	flare-up of my ulcerative colitis and I had emergency surgery and now I have a stoma which
649200	655600	basically like a bag poo and I remember being in hospital after my surgery and one of the first
655600	662400	things I did was I was on YouTube I was on Twitter on Instagram trying to find other young women
662400	669840	in the same situation as me and I found these amazing vloggers and bloggers and just like
670400	675280	people on social media who were talking about it who had like been through what I was currently
675280	681440	going through and they were like out the other end like living their life thriving and that was
681440	688240	so comforting to me to just be like right where are my women in their 20s and 30s with stoma bags
688240	695040	I've made so many friends from it I've connected with other influencers or YouTubers whatever it is
695760	701040	even their boyfriends online so it's created like a whole other dimension of socializing
701040	706480	I just don't really see a difference between like online friend and real life friend it's like
706480	712640	the same and like I'm literally here in Ireland because I'm going to the birthday party of a
712640	718080	friend I met online but now we're real life friends face-to-face interaction is incredibly
718080	723280	important for me to feel connected to someone I think because like one of my love languages is
723280	730160	like quality time of physical church so like I do think that social media is very useful but it
730160	735440	doesn't replace for me like you know physical interaction and actually meeting someone maybe
735440	740800	it's like touch them because I'm like a big like squeeze and shoulder hoax kind of person so yeah
740800	745920	you can't replace that I've met so many people and connected with so many people that I wouldn't have
745920	751920	before especially like um creatives of color and like black writers and black performers it's just
751920	756960	pretty amazing to have that community of creatives social media has created something that could make
756960	762800	people very lonely because people are putting so much emphasis into their online life that if that
762800	768720	goes tomorrow what do you have left I think we forget that the impact of how we use social media
768720	775600	can affect other people um in real life I don't even mean about online connections when I go home
775600	780160	my parents aren't going to be around forever and they're there trying to communicate with me trying
780160	786160	to catch up and I'm like yeah yeah answering them and not giving them that attention you're never
786160	790800	going to get that time back so social media has done a lot for me in terms of creating communities
790800	795360	if I look back in 20 years time when social media's gone I'm like that's a really good thing that I left
795360	800640	behind and created a conversation around when I go to meet up my hiking group I promote it all online
800640	804800	I get down I go everyone get off their phones I don't really use it to stay in touch with people
804800	809040	because it forces you to stay in touch with everybody and you don't necessarily need everybody in
809040	817040	your life it's so tempting to vent your feelings or share what you're going through online literally
817040	823280	this morning I was so stressed with various things are going on that I posted a uh Instagram story
823280	827680	saying everything will be fine just carry on everything's fine I'm fine like I was stressed
827680	833120	and I'm like sharing that I'm there and then I got a message from my friend and on reading the
833120	837520	message being like are you okay what's going on I was like ah this isn't the place for that
837520	841600	this world is full of people and sometimes you feel like your interests are yours and
841600	847760	maybe you feel a bit outcast and no one gets it but social media shows you that there are people
847760	852720	around the world who do and that's a wonderful thing there are also those times when I'm sat there
852720	856800	and I've got my phone out and I'm scrolling through Instagram or whatever and I'm seeing people out
856800	861200	at parties living their lives and or people in couples and you'll sit there and you're like oh
861520	870960	I I've noticed a hole that I have in my life yeah so the children I was teaching were quite young
870960	875840	their forms of social media that I found they were using was online gaming and I found that
875840	879520	some of the children who maybe wouldn't have had access to technology at home they got a
879520	884640	little bit left out then because they weren't as involved I have had a parent come to me before
884640	890000	about four times and say my child doesn't use it they don't have it and because of that they're
890000	894480	being left out of conversations it really impacted them it was a really important part of their day
894480	899280	sometimes when I hear heard a conversation why weren't you in the group chat I do see the child
899280	903760	to give a reason but they're trying to go a bit down in themselves then they're not as chatty so
903760	907680	I'd have to go over and chat to them be playing online with somebody who they've never actually
907680	912160	met but they're like oh I have this is my friend and that's my friend it kind of gives a different
912160	917120	definition to what they'd call a friend now I think I think social media can benefit children
917120	922640	that are shy and that they come into themselves online in an online persona they can make connections
922640	928080	with peers in their class online however it might not always translate then into the classroom if
928080	932240	they're not able to express themselves in real life they're not able to respond to that they
932240	936480	want to sit inside and be on a phone or a computer because that's what everyone else is doing which
936480	942480	is really worrying because it can it could give them a sense of really being involved in something
942480	947920	but then they could end up feeling quite isolated if these social media friends or online friends
947920	954560	aren't actively present in their life I do think social media makes you feel lonelier I find the
954560	958160	times where I've gone off it and I go away on holiday and I'm doing loads of stuff I feel great
958720	962480	when I'm hanging out with all my friends I feel amazing you spend a week alone with my laptop
962480	967840	and just my social media I'm not getting that connection I need to hear someone I need to
967840	971920	see them it's I think social media makes you feel lonelier because you're seeing everyone's
971920	979520	highlight reel there are 3.4 billion active social media users and on average people have 7.6
979520	985680	social media accounts it would appear to me that asking if social media makes you lonely is a little
985680	993680	like asking if eating makes you gain weight the answer is it can of course but not necessarily
993680	1000640	and not in everyone and not forever it depends on how you use it and why just as it depends on how
1000640	1008640	much you eat and what social media use can be fine wonderful even in moderation but as with
1008640	1014480	any lifestyle loaded with processed foods an excessive intake of social media could be bad
1014480	1019920	for your mental health and for your quality of life and just as people need education around
1019920	1027440	nutrition we need it badly around technology it seems like social media makes us lonely when we
1027520	1034160	expect it to replace our real social lives rather than to aid them or when we allow it to take time
1034160	1043360	away from relationships that make our lives meaningful
1057440	1058820	you
