00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,640
My name is Melanie Murphy and I love asking people questions that are difficult to answer.

2
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,600
Something I've been fascinated by recently is how much social media has blown up over

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,880
the past 20 years and let's be honest 20 years is a drop in the ocean of the timeline of humanity

4
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,320
and yet it's completely changed our lives. I create online content for a living mostly alone

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,160
as well as writing books the loneliest of jobs and while I feel that I spend plenty of time with

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,440
real-life human beings my average daily screen time leaves much to be desired.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,600
So how many hours on average do you spend on your screen per day?

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,920
Four hours a day Lucy. Over four hours that is like two movies I could be watching a day.

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,480
I could be running a whole marathon every day. A lot of time spent with family and friends.

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,360
Ever since I graduated I've been partial to that mental nourishment that comes with having

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,760
different voices contribute to important conversations and the conversation around

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,040
social media and loneliness couldn't be more significant right now. What with study after

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,960
study and headline after headline pointing to higher rates of social isolation and depression

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,720
in those who replace most of their face-to-face encounters with cliques.

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,240
All the while 81% of teenagers feel that social media has a positive effect on their lives

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
and the credit for helping them to build stronger friendships.

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,440
Almost half of the people on this planet use social media every day for hours

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,520
and as humans time is our most valuable resource so are all these things like Twitter and Instagram

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,720
and Facebook detrimental to our social lives our well-being here is some food for thought.

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,440
Face-to-face interaction is like so important I just feel you get a good read of someone

21
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,440
when you're like looking at them looking at their expressions or the way they say something like it's

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,960
it's you can't compare that to like a text message or anything like that.

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,200
I've met people and I'm friends with people and I've gone on dates with people

24
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,360
I would never have met only for social media. You know it is intense and it is overwhelming

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,680
to go online and go on social media and see that 300 of the people that you follow are active

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:42,400
and they are accessible to talk to to interact with but they're not really there.

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,240
Social media was created to be social with people and I try to always remember that.

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,840
Ironically even though it's supposed to make us feel more connected can actually enhance

29
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,640
feelings of loneliness. I think social media can be really beneficial to people who are

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,600
experiencing something that can be really isolating like going through an illness.

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,360
The internet has been such a bridge for me such a lifeline.

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,680
I think social media makes me less lonely definitely.

33
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
I have to put my phone on did not disturb all the time because my brain can't handle it.

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
If children had phones in schools they wouldn't be locking up from the phone

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,960
they would be texting each other through the phone.

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,440
I would say that like 80% of my friendship circle has come from social media.

37
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,760
It would not surprise me if a lot of young people growing up nowadays

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,720
with who only know social media are terrified of conversation.

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,840
But from their point of view they're looking at people like us and going wow

40
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,000
I want to be like them they have loads of friends and meanwhile I'm sitting at home

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,640
with my dad with his cancer and no one's there.

42
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Sometimes you'll like chat a lot online and you see that person in person and it's really

43
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,960
awkward and you don't know why and it's just like the chemistry.

44
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,200
Before social media your social life was your immediate friends group your work groups

45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,440
and arranging to go out with them was you know if you were going to meet someone

46
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,000
say you met a girl in the pub and you were trying to arrange a date

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
she lived in South Dublin you lived in North Dublin

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,080
you'd get if you got her number you would probably ring from a public phone box

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,520
to confirm the date and time and then you'd be meeting them the following Saturday under a

50
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,760
clock in old chemistry with the advent of social media you've got your you know your fourth group

51
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,360
everyone I imagine everyone has set up is their family connections

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,280
where you can connect with people you would not normally connect with

53
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,920
and a family who've gone abroad historically before the internet you would you would probably

54
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,160
never hear from them again in some on some occasions so you get people past jokes comments

55
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,880
statuses or whatever the children are doing.

56
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,160
I moved home from living in Scotland for five years because social media just couldn't cut

57
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,760
it for me I needed to be around people physically not just see them on social media and see what

58
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,160
they're doing get the snippets of their lives rather than just spending time with these people

59
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,560
I needed to have the actual interaction with people rather than reading a text and they're

60
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,200
always just posting pictures and things like that so at different points when I was over there it

61
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,160
either helped me feel connected to them but also made me feel a bit lonely as well so at different

62
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
points I'd be like oh it's so good to see that everyone's having a good time but then other

63
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,280
times I'd be like I know I really just want to be there with them it was really tough.

64
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,720
I follow I think 700 people on Instagram and I know what 300 of them have for breakfast every

65
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,680
morning I know what time they go to sleep at I know how they're feeling I feel connected to

66
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,960
these people because I know these personal things that I would only know if I lived with them or if

67
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,320
I was friends with them but I'm not I've never met this person and it is kind of a lonely feeling

68
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,440
to almost believe that you know someone when you've never even had a personal conversation with

69
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,160
when I'm on Instagram and I'm interacting with people and I I didn't come away from it I feel

70
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,920
less connected to people for example like if if you put up some that's you know like you're quite

71
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,160
upset about and you're kind of looking for support you know do I feel disconnected from people

72
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,040
because it's not it's almost it's not them that's saying it to me but it's it's just a voice

73
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,120
or do I feel connected because I can on hand talk to them so easy it is a big commitment or it can

74
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
be a lot of pressure to to be there for someone especially if you're if you're not all there

75
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,680
yourself or you you have stuff going on so to just send the text is a lot easier on you when

76
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,080
shit hits the fan things are tough things are shit that's when you start to realize who your real

77
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,720
friends are I started vine three years of vining made loads of friends vine died and then my dad got

78
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,320
cancer and I spent all of my time taking care of my dad after that and then suddenly every single

79
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,360
person I thought I was friends with just disappeared I think social media is almost like a a poison in

80
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,960
the sense that it can make you feel like you have lots of friends and it makes you feel like you

81
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,120
have a big social life and then when real life happens someone passes away somebody gets ill

82
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,720
you're depressed there really isn't the social media carries on and none of those people are there

83
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,080
for you despite the fact that the numbers are all there the followers are all there the comments

84
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,880
are all rolling in haha this is so funny you're the best creator ever you're just sitting there at

85
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,880
home like flicking through your phone your dad's ill like it's like it's so weird it's it's almost

86
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,360
like an episode of black mirror social media has definitely been a double-edged sword for me

87
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,880
in terms of improving my anxiety and also triggering it again um I think when I first started to talk

88
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,600
about my experience with mental health social media was an incredible tool for me to share and

89
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,680
realize that I wasn't on my own because I think such a characteristic anxiety is that you think

90
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,480
you're the only person going through it so by putting something out there whether it was

91
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,640
Facebook or Instagram instantly I could really I could realize that there was so many people

92
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,840
who were going through the exact same thing I don't know I don't like to talk about my emotions

93
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,440
in person very much I would go to Facebook messenger and message my very close friends

94
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,680
or go to text and text my friends I wouldn't want to be in person with them while discussing that

95
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,960
thing that was bothering me so in a way it kind of aids my ability to talk to them when it's just

96
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,680
text and an image or maybe a couple of emojis you're losing out on the tone of voice the body

97
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,680
language and all of the other elements that go into communication that help you actually

98
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,240
convey a message or receive a message I love face-to-face interaction I'm like I'm

99
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,680
all about it I will talk to someone and give them my undivided attention I love talking to people

100
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,760
face-to-face just sort of quite a gestury kind of person tone and sarcasm and all that kind of

101
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:52,400
thing is very much the sort of like all my kind of idiosyncrasies um how I get my points across

102
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,680
and there's none of that on social media through text and that it's all very cold

103
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,920
when you're on social media you're behind a screen you're behind several filters or whatever

104
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,760
apps you're using you're curating it you're putting up the best bits if you want to and

105
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,880
you're taking your time to edit your caption and think about what you want to put out there

106
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,000
I've had people say to me that they're annoyed at how long it takes me to respond to messages

107
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,960
I think I'm one of the few people that doesn't get very offended when when I'm left on red because

108
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,880
I feel like I can empathize with why someone would want to leave me on red a lot of the time and

109
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,360
it's not personal it's about their own experience and not about me that gives me anxiety of going

110
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,360
oh are they waiting for me to reply to the message but I'm doing this but should I be

111
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,920
replying to them and it just starts spiraling on my head so instead I just leave it I have a very

112
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,400
different experience of social media I think to a lot of other people because I have a chronic illness

113
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,160
and a disparity that means I can't really leave the house very much and I spend a lot of time

114
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,840
I guess I would feel incredibly alone if I didn't have the internet I didn't have a way

115
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,640
to connect with other people I had a lumber puncture where they accidentally pierced my spinal

116
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,120
fluid sack too many times and my spinal fluid bled out and into my body so for two years while

117
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,840
my spinal fluid grew back essentially I had to be in a dark room by myself I couldn't have

118
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,840
light touch sound I couldn't have anyone near me because it was such an excruciating pain

119
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,480
and for those two years I felt incredibly alone I've thought am I the only person here

120
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,680
who's like this who's in the situation and now I get to make videos that I know touch

121
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,960
the people who are in that place still and that's the most beautiful thing for me

122
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:42,320
last year I had a really horrific like medical scare I was in hospital for a month with a

123
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,120
flare-up of my ulcerative colitis and I had emergency surgery and now I have a stoma which

124
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,600
basically like a bag poo and I remember being in hospital after my surgery and one of the first

125
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,400
things I did was I was on YouTube I was on Twitter on Instagram trying to find other young women

126
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:09,840
in the same situation as me and I found these amazing vloggers and bloggers and just like

127
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,280
people on social media who were talking about it who had like been through what I was currently

128
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,440
going through and they were like out the other end like living their life thriving and that was

129
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,240
so comforting to me to just be like right where are my women in their 20s and 30s with stoma bags

130
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,040
I've made so many friends from it I've connected with other influencers or YouTubers whatever it is

131
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,040
even their boyfriends online so it's created like a whole other dimension of socializing

132
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,480
I just don't really see a difference between like online friend and real life friend it's like

133
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,640
the same and like I'm literally here in Ireland because I'm going to the birthday party of a

134
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,080
friend I met online but now we're real life friends face-to-face interaction is incredibly

135
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,280
important for me to feel connected to someone I think because like one of my love languages is

136
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,160
like quality time of physical church so like I do think that social media is very useful but it

137
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,440
doesn't replace for me like you know physical interaction and actually meeting someone maybe

138
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,800
it's like touch them because I'm like a big like squeeze and shoulder hoax kind of person so yeah

139
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,920
you can't replace that I've met so many people and connected with so many people that I wouldn't have

140
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,920
before especially like um creatives of color and like black writers and black performers it's just

141
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,960
pretty amazing to have that community of creatives social media has created something that could make

142
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,800
people very lonely because people are putting so much emphasis into their online life that if that

143
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,720
goes tomorrow what do you have left I think we forget that the impact of how we use social media

144
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,600
can affect other people um in real life I don't even mean about online connections when I go home

145
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,160
my parents aren't going to be around forever and they're there trying to communicate with me trying

146
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,160
to catch up and I'm like yeah yeah answering them and not giving them that attention you're never

147
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,800
going to get that time back so social media has done a lot for me in terms of creating communities

148
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,360
if I look back in 20 years time when social media's gone I'm like that's a really good thing that I left

149
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,640
behind and created a conversation around when I go to meet up my hiking group I promote it all online

150
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,800
I get down I go everyone get off their phones I don't really use it to stay in touch with people

151
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,040
because it forces you to stay in touch with everybody and you don't necessarily need everybody in

152
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:37,040
your life it's so tempting to vent your feelings or share what you're going through online literally

153
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,280
this morning I was so stressed with various things are going on that I posted a uh Instagram story

154
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,680
saying everything will be fine just carry on everything's fine I'm fine like I was stressed

155
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,120
and I'm like sharing that I'm there and then I got a message from my friend and on reading the

156
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,520
message being like are you okay what's going on I was like ah this isn't the place for that

157
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,600
this world is full of people and sometimes you feel like your interests are yours and

158
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,760
maybe you feel a bit outcast and no one gets it but social media shows you that there are people

159
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,720
around the world who do and that's a wonderful thing there are also those times when I'm sat there

160
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,800
and I've got my phone out and I'm scrolling through Instagram or whatever and I'm seeing people out

161
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,200
at parties living their lives and or people in couples and you'll sit there and you're like oh

162
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:30,960
I I've noticed a hole that I have in my life yeah so the children I was teaching were quite young

163
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,840
their forms of social media that I found they were using was online gaming and I found that

164
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,520
some of the children who maybe wouldn't have had access to technology at home they got a

165
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,640
little bit left out then because they weren't as involved I have had a parent come to me before

166
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,000
about four times and say my child doesn't use it they don't have it and because of that they're

167
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,480
being left out of conversations it really impacted them it was a really important part of their day

168
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,280
sometimes when I hear heard a conversation why weren't you in the group chat I do see the child

169
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,760
to give a reason but they're trying to go a bit down in themselves then they're not as chatty so

170
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,680
I'd have to go over and chat to them be playing online with somebody who they've never actually

171
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,160
met but they're like oh I have this is my friend and that's my friend it kind of gives a different

172
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,120
definition to what they'd call a friend now I think I think social media can benefit children

173
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,640
that are shy and that they come into themselves online in an online persona they can make connections

174
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,080
with peers in their class online however it might not always translate then into the classroom if

175
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:32,240
they're not able to express themselves in real life they're not able to respond to that they

176
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,480
want to sit inside and be on a phone or a computer because that's what everyone else is doing which

177
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,480
is really worrying because it can it could give them a sense of really being involved in something

178
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,920
but then they could end up feeling quite isolated if these social media friends or online friends

179
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,560
aren't actively present in their life I do think social media makes you feel lonelier I find the

180
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,160
times where I've gone off it and I go away on holiday and I'm doing loads of stuff I feel great

181
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,480
when I'm hanging out with all my friends I feel amazing you spend a week alone with my laptop

182
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,840
and just my social media I'm not getting that connection I need to hear someone I need to

183
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,920
see them it's I think social media makes you feel lonelier because you're seeing everyone's

184
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:19,520
highlight reel there are 3.4 billion active social media users and on average people have 7.6

185
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,680
social media accounts it would appear to me that asking if social media makes you lonely is a little

186
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:33,680
like asking if eating makes you gain weight the answer is it can of course but not necessarily

187
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,640
and not in everyone and not forever it depends on how you use it and why just as it depends on how

188
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:48,640
much you eat and what social media use can be fine wonderful even in moderation but as with

189
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,480
any lifestyle loaded with processed foods an excessive intake of social media could be bad

190
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,920
for your mental health and for your quality of life and just as people need education around

191
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,440
nutrition we need it badly around technology it seems like social media makes us lonely when we

192
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,160
expect it to replace our real social lives rather than to aid them or when we allow it to take time

193
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:23,360
away from relationships that make our lives meaningful

194
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,820
you
