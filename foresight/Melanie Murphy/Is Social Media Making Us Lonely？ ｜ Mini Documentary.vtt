00:00.000 --> 00:20.640
My name is Melanie Murphy and I love asking people questions that are difficult to answer.

00:20.640 --> 00:25.600
Something I've been fascinated by recently is how much social media has blown up over

00:25.600 --> 00:32.880
the past 20 years and let's be honest 20 years is a drop in the ocean of the timeline of humanity

00:32.880 --> 00:40.320
and yet it's completely changed our lives. I create online content for a living mostly alone

00:40.320 --> 00:46.160
as well as writing books the loneliest of jobs and while I feel that I spend plenty of time with

00:46.160 --> 00:51.440
real-life human beings my average daily screen time leaves much to be desired.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.600
So how many hours on average do you spend on your screen per day?

00:56.240 --> 01:01.920
Four hours a day Lucy. Over four hours that is like two movies I could be watching a day.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.480
I could be running a whole marathon every day. A lot of time spent with family and friends.

01:08.480 --> 01:13.360
Ever since I graduated I've been partial to that mental nourishment that comes with having

01:13.360 --> 01:17.760
different voices contribute to important conversations and the conversation around

01:17.760 --> 01:23.040
social media and loneliness couldn't be more significant right now. What with study after

01:23.040 --> 01:28.960
study and headline after headline pointing to higher rates of social isolation and depression

01:28.960 --> 01:32.720
in those who replace most of their face-to-face encounters with cliques.

01:33.760 --> 01:40.240
All the while 81% of teenagers feel that social media has a positive effect on their lives

01:40.240 --> 01:43.600
and the credit for helping them to build stronger friendships.

01:44.320 --> 01:49.440
Almost half of the people on this planet use social media every day for hours

01:49.440 --> 01:55.520
and as humans time is our most valuable resource so are all these things like Twitter and Instagram

01:55.520 --> 02:02.720
and Facebook detrimental to our social lives our well-being here is some food for thought.

02:04.400 --> 02:09.440
Face-to-face interaction is like so important I just feel you get a good read of someone

02:09.440 --> 02:13.440
when you're like looking at them looking at their expressions or the way they say something like it's

02:14.000 --> 02:16.960
it's you can't compare that to like a text message or anything like that.

02:16.960 --> 02:21.200
I've met people and I'm friends with people and I've gone on dates with people

02:21.200 --> 02:25.360
I would never have met only for social media. You know it is intense and it is overwhelming

02:26.080 --> 02:33.680
to go online and go on social media and see that 300 of the people that you follow are active

02:33.680 --> 02:42.400
and they are accessible to talk to to interact with but they're not really there.

02:42.480 --> 02:46.240
Social media was created to be social with people and I try to always remember that.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.840
Ironically even though it's supposed to make us feel more connected can actually enhance

02:49.840 --> 02:54.640
feelings of loneliness. I think social media can be really beneficial to people who are

02:55.200 --> 03:01.600
experiencing something that can be really isolating like going through an illness.

03:01.600 --> 03:05.360
The internet has been such a bridge for me such a lifeline.

03:05.360 --> 03:09.680
I think social media makes me less lonely definitely.

03:09.680 --> 03:13.360
I have to put my phone on did not disturb all the time because my brain can't handle it.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.720
If children had phones in schools they wouldn't be locking up from the phone

03:16.720 --> 03:18.960
they would be texting each other through the phone.

03:18.960 --> 03:23.440
I would say that like 80% of my friendship circle has come from social media.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.760
It would not surprise me if a lot of young people growing up nowadays

03:28.800 --> 03:34.720
with who only know social media are terrified of conversation.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.840
But from their point of view they're looking at people like us and going wow

03:37.920 --> 03:42.000
I want to be like them they have loads of friends and meanwhile I'm sitting at home

03:42.000 --> 03:44.640
with my dad with his cancer and no one's there.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.640
Sometimes you'll like chat a lot online and you see that person in person and it's really

03:48.640 --> 03:50.960
awkward and you don't know why and it's just like the chemistry.

03:54.320 --> 04:01.200
Before social media your social life was your immediate friends group your work groups

04:02.080 --> 04:05.440
and arranging to go out with them was you know if you were going to meet someone

04:05.440 --> 04:10.000
say you met a girl in the pub and you were trying to arrange a date

04:10.000 --> 04:12.640
she lived in South Dublin you lived in North Dublin

04:13.600 --> 04:18.080
you'd get if you got her number you would probably ring from a public phone box

04:18.800 --> 04:23.520
to confirm the date and time and then you'd be meeting them the following Saturday under a

04:23.520 --> 04:29.760
clock in old chemistry with the advent of social media you've got your you know your fourth group

04:29.760 --> 04:33.360
everyone I imagine everyone has set up is their family connections

04:34.000 --> 04:37.280
where you can connect with people you would not normally connect with

04:37.280 --> 04:41.920
and a family who've gone abroad historically before the internet you would you would probably

04:41.920 --> 04:48.160
never hear from them again in some on some occasions so you get people past jokes comments

04:48.160 --> 04:50.880
statuses or whatever the children are doing.

04:50.880 --> 04:56.160
I moved home from living in Scotland for five years because social media just couldn't cut

04:56.160 --> 05:01.760
it for me I needed to be around people physically not just see them on social media and see what

05:01.760 --> 05:06.160
they're doing get the snippets of their lives rather than just spending time with these people

05:06.160 --> 05:10.560
I needed to have the actual interaction with people rather than reading a text and they're

05:10.560 --> 05:15.200
always just posting pictures and things like that so at different points when I was over there it

05:15.200 --> 05:20.160
either helped me feel connected to them but also made me feel a bit lonely as well so at different

05:20.160 --> 05:22.880
points I'd be like oh it's so good to see that everyone's having a good time but then other

05:22.880 --> 05:27.280
times I'd be like I know I really just want to be there with them it was really tough.

05:27.280 --> 05:34.720
I follow I think 700 people on Instagram and I know what 300 of them have for breakfast every

05:34.720 --> 05:39.680
morning I know what time they go to sleep at I know how they're feeling I feel connected to

05:39.680 --> 05:44.960
these people because I know these personal things that I would only know if I lived with them or if

05:44.960 --> 05:50.320
I was friends with them but I'm not I've never met this person and it is kind of a lonely feeling

05:51.040 --> 05:57.440
to almost believe that you know someone when you've never even had a personal conversation with

05:57.440 --> 06:02.160
when I'm on Instagram and I'm interacting with people and I I didn't come away from it I feel

06:02.160 --> 06:09.920
less connected to people for example like if if you put up some that's you know like you're quite

06:09.920 --> 06:16.160
upset about and you're kind of looking for support you know do I feel disconnected from people

06:16.160 --> 06:21.040
because it's not it's almost it's not them that's saying it to me but it's it's just a voice

06:22.400 --> 06:29.120
or do I feel connected because I can on hand talk to them so easy it is a big commitment or it can

06:29.120 --> 06:33.840
be a lot of pressure to to be there for someone especially if you're if you're not all there

06:33.840 --> 06:39.680
yourself or you you have stuff going on so to just send the text is a lot easier on you when

06:39.680 --> 06:46.080
shit hits the fan things are tough things are shit that's when you start to realize who your real

06:46.080 --> 06:52.720
friends are I started vine three years of vining made loads of friends vine died and then my dad got

06:52.720 --> 07:00.320
cancer and I spent all of my time taking care of my dad after that and then suddenly every single

07:00.320 --> 07:05.360
person I thought I was friends with just disappeared I think social media is almost like a a poison in

07:05.360 --> 07:08.960
the sense that it can make you feel like you have lots of friends and it makes you feel like you

07:08.960 --> 07:15.120
have a big social life and then when real life happens someone passes away somebody gets ill

07:15.120 --> 07:20.720
you're depressed there really isn't the social media carries on and none of those people are there

07:20.720 --> 07:24.080
for you despite the fact that the numbers are all there the followers are all there the comments

07:24.080 --> 07:28.880
are all rolling in haha this is so funny you're the best creator ever you're just sitting there at

07:28.880 --> 07:34.880
home like flicking through your phone your dad's ill like it's like it's so weird it's it's almost

07:34.960 --> 07:39.360
like an episode of black mirror social media has definitely been a double-edged sword for me

07:39.360 --> 07:44.880
in terms of improving my anxiety and also triggering it again um I think when I first started to talk

07:44.880 --> 07:49.600
about my experience with mental health social media was an incredible tool for me to share and

07:50.400 --> 07:53.680
realize that I wasn't on my own because I think such a characteristic anxiety is that you think

07:53.680 --> 07:56.480
you're the only person going through it so by putting something out there whether it was

07:56.480 --> 08:00.640
Facebook or Instagram instantly I could really I could realize that there was so many people

08:00.640 --> 08:03.840
who were going through the exact same thing I don't know I don't like to talk about my emotions

08:03.840 --> 08:09.440
in person very much I would go to Facebook messenger and message my very close friends

08:09.440 --> 08:13.680
or go to text and text my friends I wouldn't want to be in person with them while discussing that

08:13.680 --> 08:18.960
thing that was bothering me so in a way it kind of aids my ability to talk to them when it's just

08:18.960 --> 08:23.680
text and an image or maybe a couple of emojis you're losing out on the tone of voice the body

08:23.680 --> 08:27.680
language and all of the other elements that go into communication that help you actually

08:28.240 --> 08:32.240
convey a message or receive a message I love face-to-face interaction I'm like I'm

08:32.240 --> 08:37.680
all about it I will talk to someone and give them my undivided attention I love talking to people

08:38.560 --> 08:43.760
face-to-face just sort of quite a gestury kind of person tone and sarcasm and all that kind of

08:43.760 --> 08:52.400
thing is very much the sort of like all my kind of idiosyncrasies um how I get my points across

08:53.840 --> 08:57.680
and there's none of that on social media through text and that it's all very cold

08:57.680 --> 09:01.920
when you're on social media you're behind a screen you're behind several filters or whatever

09:02.000 --> 09:05.760
apps you're using you're curating it you're putting up the best bits if you want to and

09:05.760 --> 09:08.880
you're taking your time to edit your caption and think about what you want to put out there

09:08.880 --> 09:14.000
I've had people say to me that they're annoyed at how long it takes me to respond to messages

09:14.000 --> 09:18.960
I think I'm one of the few people that doesn't get very offended when when I'm left on red because

09:18.960 --> 09:24.880
I feel like I can empathize with why someone would want to leave me on red a lot of the time and

09:24.880 --> 09:29.360
it's not personal it's about their own experience and not about me that gives me anxiety of going

09:29.360 --> 09:33.360
oh are they waiting for me to reply to the message but I'm doing this but should I be

09:33.360 --> 09:37.920
replying to them and it just starts spiraling on my head so instead I just leave it I have a very

09:37.920 --> 09:42.400
different experience of social media I think to a lot of other people because I have a chronic illness

09:43.120 --> 09:48.160
and a disparity that means I can't really leave the house very much and I spend a lot of time

09:48.720 --> 09:53.840
I guess I would feel incredibly alone if I didn't have the internet I didn't have a way

09:53.840 --> 09:58.640
to connect with other people I had a lumber puncture where they accidentally pierced my spinal

09:58.640 --> 10:05.120
fluid sack too many times and my spinal fluid bled out and into my body so for two years while

10:05.120 --> 10:11.840
my spinal fluid grew back essentially I had to be in a dark room by myself I couldn't have

10:12.480 --> 10:17.840
light touch sound I couldn't have anyone near me because it was such an excruciating pain

10:18.640 --> 10:24.480
and for those two years I felt incredibly alone I've thought am I the only person here

10:24.560 --> 10:29.680
who's like this who's in the situation and now I get to make videos that I know touch

10:30.240 --> 10:34.960
the people who are in that place still and that's the most beautiful thing for me

10:34.960 --> 10:42.320
last year I had a really horrific like medical scare I was in hospital for a month with a

10:42.320 --> 10:49.120
flare-up of my ulcerative colitis and I had emergency surgery and now I have a stoma which

10:49.200 --> 10:55.600
basically like a bag poo and I remember being in hospital after my surgery and one of the first

10:55.600 --> 11:02.400
things I did was I was on YouTube I was on Twitter on Instagram trying to find other young women

11:02.400 --> 11:09.840
in the same situation as me and I found these amazing vloggers and bloggers and just like

11:10.400 --> 11:15.280
people on social media who were talking about it who had like been through what I was currently

11:15.280 --> 11:21.440
going through and they were like out the other end like living their life thriving and that was

11:21.440 --> 11:28.240
so comforting to me to just be like right where are my women in their 20s and 30s with stoma bags

11:28.240 --> 11:35.040
I've made so many friends from it I've connected with other influencers or YouTubers whatever it is

11:35.760 --> 11:41.040
even their boyfriends online so it's created like a whole other dimension of socializing

11:41.040 --> 11:46.480
I just don't really see a difference between like online friend and real life friend it's like

11:46.480 --> 11:52.640
the same and like I'm literally here in Ireland because I'm going to the birthday party of a

11:52.640 --> 11:58.080
friend I met online but now we're real life friends face-to-face interaction is incredibly

11:58.080 --> 12:03.280
important for me to feel connected to someone I think because like one of my love languages is

12:03.280 --> 12:10.160
like quality time of physical church so like I do think that social media is very useful but it

12:10.160 --> 12:15.440
doesn't replace for me like you know physical interaction and actually meeting someone maybe

12:15.440 --> 12:20.800
it's like touch them because I'm like a big like squeeze and shoulder hoax kind of person so yeah

12:20.800 --> 12:25.920
you can't replace that I've met so many people and connected with so many people that I wouldn't have

12:25.920 --> 12:31.920
before especially like um creatives of color and like black writers and black performers it's just

12:31.920 --> 12:36.960
pretty amazing to have that community of creatives social media has created something that could make

12:36.960 --> 12:42.800
people very lonely because people are putting so much emphasis into their online life that if that

12:42.800 --> 12:48.720
goes tomorrow what do you have left I think we forget that the impact of how we use social media

12:48.720 --> 12:55.600
can affect other people um in real life I don't even mean about online connections when I go home

12:55.600 --> 13:00.160
my parents aren't going to be around forever and they're there trying to communicate with me trying

13:00.160 --> 13:06.160
to catch up and I'm like yeah yeah answering them and not giving them that attention you're never

13:06.160 --> 13:10.800
going to get that time back so social media has done a lot for me in terms of creating communities

13:10.800 --> 13:15.360
if I look back in 20 years time when social media's gone I'm like that's a really good thing that I left

13:15.360 --> 13:20.640
behind and created a conversation around when I go to meet up my hiking group I promote it all online

13:20.640 --> 13:24.800
I get down I go everyone get off their phones I don't really use it to stay in touch with people

13:24.800 --> 13:29.040
because it forces you to stay in touch with everybody and you don't necessarily need everybody in

13:29.040 --> 13:37.040
your life it's so tempting to vent your feelings or share what you're going through online literally

13:37.040 --> 13:43.280
this morning I was so stressed with various things are going on that I posted a uh Instagram story

13:43.280 --> 13:47.680
saying everything will be fine just carry on everything's fine I'm fine like I was stressed

13:47.680 --> 13:53.120
and I'm like sharing that I'm there and then I got a message from my friend and on reading the

13:53.120 --> 13:57.520
message being like are you okay what's going on I was like ah this isn't the place for that

13:57.520 --> 14:01.600
this world is full of people and sometimes you feel like your interests are yours and

14:01.600 --> 14:07.760
maybe you feel a bit outcast and no one gets it but social media shows you that there are people

14:07.760 --> 14:12.720
around the world who do and that's a wonderful thing there are also those times when I'm sat there

14:12.720 --> 14:16.800
and I've got my phone out and I'm scrolling through Instagram or whatever and I'm seeing people out

14:16.800 --> 14:21.200
at parties living their lives and or people in couples and you'll sit there and you're like oh

14:21.520 --> 14:30.960
I I've noticed a hole that I have in my life yeah so the children I was teaching were quite young

14:30.960 --> 14:35.840
their forms of social media that I found they were using was online gaming and I found that

14:35.840 --> 14:39.520
some of the children who maybe wouldn't have had access to technology at home they got a

14:39.520 --> 14:44.640
little bit left out then because they weren't as involved I have had a parent come to me before

14:44.640 --> 14:50.000
about four times and say my child doesn't use it they don't have it and because of that they're

14:50.000 --> 14:54.480
being left out of conversations it really impacted them it was a really important part of their day

14:54.480 --> 14:59.280
sometimes when I hear heard a conversation why weren't you in the group chat I do see the child

14:59.280 --> 15:03.760
to give a reason but they're trying to go a bit down in themselves then they're not as chatty so

15:03.760 --> 15:07.680
I'd have to go over and chat to them be playing online with somebody who they've never actually

15:07.680 --> 15:12.160
met but they're like oh I have this is my friend and that's my friend it kind of gives a different

15:12.160 --> 15:17.120
definition to what they'd call a friend now I think I think social media can benefit children

15:17.120 --> 15:22.640
that are shy and that they come into themselves online in an online persona they can make connections

15:22.640 --> 15:28.080
with peers in their class online however it might not always translate then into the classroom if

15:28.080 --> 15:32.240
they're not able to express themselves in real life they're not able to respond to that they

15:32.240 --> 15:36.480
want to sit inside and be on a phone or a computer because that's what everyone else is doing which

15:36.480 --> 15:42.480
is really worrying because it can it could give them a sense of really being involved in something

15:42.480 --> 15:47.920
but then they could end up feeling quite isolated if these social media friends or online friends

15:47.920 --> 15:54.560
aren't actively present in their life I do think social media makes you feel lonelier I find the

15:54.560 --> 15:58.160
times where I've gone off it and I go away on holiday and I'm doing loads of stuff I feel great

15:58.720 --> 16:02.480
when I'm hanging out with all my friends I feel amazing you spend a week alone with my laptop

16:02.480 --> 16:07.840
and just my social media I'm not getting that connection I need to hear someone I need to

16:07.840 --> 16:11.920
see them it's I think social media makes you feel lonelier because you're seeing everyone's

16:11.920 --> 16:19.520
highlight reel there are 3.4 billion active social media users and on average people have 7.6

16:19.520 --> 16:25.680
social media accounts it would appear to me that asking if social media makes you lonely is a little

16:25.680 --> 16:33.680
like asking if eating makes you gain weight the answer is it can of course but not necessarily

16:33.680 --> 16:40.640
and not in everyone and not forever it depends on how you use it and why just as it depends on how

16:40.640 --> 16:48.640
much you eat and what social media use can be fine wonderful even in moderation but as with

16:48.640 --> 16:54.480
any lifestyle loaded with processed foods an excessive intake of social media could be bad

16:54.480 --> 16:59.920
for your mental health and for your quality of life and just as people need education around

nutrition we need it badly around technology it seems like social media makes us lonely when we

17:07.520 --> 17:14.160
expect it to replace our real social lives rather than to aid them or when we allow it to take time

17:14.160 --> 17:23.360
away from relationships that make our lives meaningful

17:37.440 --> 17:38.820
