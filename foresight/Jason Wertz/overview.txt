1. **Set Command Usage**: The `set` command in Unix-like systems allows you to perform search and replace operations on data. It can be used to modify files or streams of data based on regular expressions. You can use the `set` command with the `-E` (extended regex) option for more advanced pattern matching.

2. **Regular Expressions**: Regular expressions are patterns used to match strings within text. They are powerful tools for data manipulation and can be used for complex searches and replacements.

3. **Example Usage**: The instructor demonstrated how to use `set` with regular expressions to:
   - Remove specific characters (like colons from a file) using `set -E 's/:/---\//g'`.
   - Replace a word only at the beginning of a line using `set -E 's/\bbin\b/JSON\n/'`.

4. **Global and Multiline Matches**: The `g` (global) flag is used to replace all instances of a pattern in the data, not just the first one. The word boundary `\b` ensures that the replacement only occurs when "bin" is at the start of a line.

5. **Practical Applications**: This command can be used for various tasks like batch renaming, data cleaning, and transforming text files. It's particularly useful when you need to make consistent changes across large datasets.

6. **Output Redirection**: The results of the `set` command can be redirected to a file or displayed on the screen. If you want to edit a file in place, more advanced options and flags are available.

7. **Learning Opportunity**: As the course progresses, students will learn more about the power of regular expressions and how they can leverage them for complex text processing tasks.
