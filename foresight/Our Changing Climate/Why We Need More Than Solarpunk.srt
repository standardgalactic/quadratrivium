1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
The world today can feel soul-crushing.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,440
Whether you're churning out emails in a cubicle for eight hours a day, or force the

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,720
sow t-shirts around the clock that are only worn once, or you're bombarded by headlines

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,920
of sea-level rise, droughts, and disasters, the crushing weight of global capitalism

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,720
feels inescapable.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,560
But all is not lost.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,720
While the destruction of climate chaos and the chains of fossil capitalism feel suffocating,

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,800
this science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin argues,

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,160
We live in capitalism.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,880
Its power seems inescapable.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,600
So did the divine right of kings.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,800
She goes on to add,

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings.

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,840
Resistance and change often begin in our art, the art of words.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,680
The story is a powerful tool, one that harnesses the future to create change in the present.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,080
Stories plant seeds, beautiful visions that have the potential to germinate into alternative

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,520
worlds that show us that business as usual is not inevitable.

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,960
So as we struggle to upend the current status quo of rampant admissions and extraction

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,320
at any cost, what role do visions of the future hold?

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,360
Are they useful, and what stories and artistic utopias are out there right now that might

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,240
bring a light to the looming darkness of climate chaos?

If you want to learn more, make sure to stick around until the end.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,760
In the days of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, utopias were under attack.

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,400
Convinced that the utopian socialism of their predecessors was not an effective way to end

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,880
capitalism, Marx and Engels rejected any form of utopianism.

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,120
They immersed themselves instead in the material realities of history, and developed critiques

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,440
alongside a theory of change that they called scientific socialism.

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,040
This framework, unlike utopian socialism, argued that society wouldn't be changed by

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,680
appealing to reason or ideals.

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,920
It would only be transformed by changing the material conditions of the economy, or in

37
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,960
other words, the direct overthrow of the ruling classes by the working class.

38
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,520
As a result, Marx and Engels were critical of sketching out what possible future worlds

39
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,000
would look like, and relying on those visions to create revolution.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,720
For them, socialism was to be achieved not by attempting to appeal to people's minds,

41
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,080
but instead revealing and exacerbating the already present contradictions within capitalism,

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,000
the core of which was the struggle between the working class and the capitalist class.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,880
This is not to say that Marxists never once dreamed of the future, nor that speculative

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,000
fiction is useless in the struggle for a world beyond fossil capitalism.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,560
But instead that as much as we need the backbone of scientific socialism to critique fossil

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,880
capitalism and guide us through ending it, we also need visions of the future that give

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,040
us something to struggle for.

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,260
We need to imagine what's on the horizon, because those imaginings, those brushstrokes

49
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,320
of the future, are what fuel our fire.

50
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,600
Visualizing different worlds, at least for me, gives energy and purpose to the hard

51
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,120
struggle of the present.

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,480
So bringing these fictions to the page, to the canvas, and to the screen are powerful

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,320
tools of revolution.

54
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,560
Which is why, as Ashley C. Ford writes, the goal of oppressors is to limit your imagination

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,840
about what is possible without them.

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,280
So you might never imagine more for yourself and the world you live in.

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,440
Imagine something better, get curious about what it actually takes to make it happen,

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,840
and then fight for it every day.

59
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,800
But these utopias or visionary fictions don't have to be, and indeed shouldn't be, perfect

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,920
goalposts that railroad us into a strict path towards liberation.

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,680
Indeed, as DeGro's scholar Giorgio Colas writes, paraphrasing Marxist scholar David

62
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Harvey,

63
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,120
Those utopias that are meant as models or blueprints, not so much because they are unrealistic,

64
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,640
but because the realization of a perfect ideal tolerates no objection and crushes everything

65
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,080
that stands in its way.

66
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,680
Colas goes on to say that we need dialectical utopias.

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,520
Ones that are contradictory, messy, and incomplete that challenge us and make us reflect on our

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
own world.

69
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,360
Ultimately, this means we need to envision, in the words of the Zapatistas, a world where

70
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,360
many worlds fit.

71
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,400
These authors, filmmakers, artists, and creatives need to develop a diverse range of future worlds.

72
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,360
So that it's not just Elon Musk,

73
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,120
The sky will be cleaner and quieter if yours is going to be good,

74
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,800
Or a white guy like me controlling the narrative of what's possible.

75
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,560
So if we know that these visionary fictions are crucial to sustaining the fire of an ecologically

76
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,200
just struggle for a better world, who's dreaming up those futures right now?

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:11,400
Which artists and what stories are bringing light to the darkness of climate chaos?

78
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,120
The worlds of the future are bright, and coursing through those future worlds are political

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,280
currents that show us that a life without capitalism is possible.

80
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,440
Degrowth, eco-anarchism, and eco-socialism all seek an economy beyond capitalism that

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,480
is just and ecologically sound.

82
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,680
But often, the political discussions of how to achieve these tendencies lack engaging narratives.

83
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,160
It's hard to get excited about the future when technical terms like means of production

84
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,960
and metabolic rift are all you hear.

85
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,560
While it is crucial to understand these terms in the political and economic theory behind

86
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,040
tendencies like socialism, we need stories to fill those frameworks with emotion and passion.

87
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,600
The story is the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down, or the Trojan horse

88
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:03,640
that plants the seed of resistance by revealing the beauty and flaws of more liberatory worlds.

89
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,160
Trains and power have long understood the potency of envisioning future worlds.

90
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,000
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, didn't just submit a jargon-heavy Green New Deal

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,880
proposal to Congress and wipe her hands clean.

92
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,600
She, together with Naomi Klein, painted her own vision of what a future with a Green New

93
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,360
Deal could be in order to sway people's hearts.

94
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,360
The biggest problem in those early years was a labor shortage.

95
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,280
We were building a national smart grid, retrofitting every building in America, putting trains

96
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,840
like this one all across the country.

97
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,920
And on the campaign trail, candidates will often ground their platform in personal anecdotes.

98
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,280
Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place.

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,600
Because as neuroscientist Paul Zak reveals in his research, when we hear a narrative

100
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,520
rich with emotion and tension, our brain releases chemicals that influence us to create change.

101
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,880
So for the anti-capitalist climate movement, we need not only direct action and political

102
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,400
struggle, but also stories, narratives and visuals that reveal suffering and success

103
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,440
not just in the present, but visionary fictions that explore the possibilities of the future.

104
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,560
And there are already countless artists out there doing exactly that.

105
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,360
One of the core examples is Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed, a sci-fi classic that delves

106
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,680
into the specific contours of ecological anarchism.

107
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,960
The Dispossessed gives us two possible futures.

108
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,000
One on the resource-rich planet of Urus that squanders its abundant resources through an

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,040
over-producing market economy, and another on the resource-scarce planet of Inaris,

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,200
a planet of exiled anarchists who thrive communally on very little.

111
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,000
The Dispossessed is ultimately a story of opposite planets and opposite futures.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,040
Opposite in the sense that the planet of Inaris is the moon of Urus and vice versa, but opposite

113
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,920
in the sense that as D-Roth theorists Georgios Kalas and Hugh March write, Inaris is what

114
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,440
Urus is not, and Urus is what Inaris is not.

115
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,840
Dispossessed possessed, barren lush, horizontal hierarchical.

116
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,000
Le Guin doesn't just tell us what anarchism can be, she shows us through, for example,

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,040
the small vignettes of honorasti children who are unable to conceive of a prison because

118
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,520
their society doesn't function on the punitive basis of our current world.

119
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,680
They had picked up the idea of prisons from episodes in the life of Odo, which all of them

120
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,240
who had elected to work on history were reading, and when a circuit history teacher came through

121
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,560
the town he expounded the subject with the reluctance of a decent adult forced to explain

122
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,000
an obscenity to children.

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,320
War through the massive aphorization projects that the people of Inaris collectively maintain.

124
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,160
He worked now in a planting crew, thousands of seedlings raised in the green mountains,

125
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,840
they planted the little trees in the dust, and they looked back as they went.

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,120
There was a mist of green, very faint, on the pallid curves and terraces of the desert.

127
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,880
The dead land lay, very likely, a veil of life.

128
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,440
The dispossessed reveals the quiet, yet messy possibilities of a liberatory future.

129
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,160
As philosopher Andrei Gorsnotes, the book crafts the most striking description I know

130
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,680
of the seductions and snares of anarchist society, and the work of speculative fiction

131
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,640
and ecological utopias has blossomed since Le Guin published her book in 1974.

132
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,000
SolarPunk, for example, has witnessed a bright new emergence of artists and writers developing

133
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,240
futures that look very different from the capitalist extraction economies of today.

134
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,040
Animation Studio delines SolarPunk world of electric apple harvesters, lush farming

135
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,840
cooperatives run on solar and wind power, and small technologies that tighten the connection

136
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,720
between humanity and nature is a perfect example of a SolarPunk future.

137
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,840
One that mends the relationship between nature and humanity through appropriate and community

138
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,400
centric technologies, cooperatives, and decentralization.

139
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,080
The imaginings of SolarPunk artists reveal that an ecological future doesn't have to

140
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,520
mean living in scarcity or giving things up, it instead shows us how beautiful the world

141
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,400
could be when we live with appropriate abundance.

142
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,080
Writer Susan Kay Quinn's short story, The Seven Sisters, gives us another glimpse into

143
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,640
a SolarPunk world.

144
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,360
One that isn't a romanticized and unrealistic view of the future, but instead reveals that

145
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,200
struggle and loss will still exist in a post-capitalist ecological world.

146
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,720
Quinn's future zooms in on a tea farming cooperative in the American South that seeks

147
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,720
to decolonize tea through education and fair practices.

148
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,800
At the farm, a close-knit community of chosen family all grows the tea together.

149
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,720
The whole farm met the mandates to be net, zero, on carbon, and make your own energy,

150
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,280
but the tea house was quite the spectacle of green tech, from the passive solar design

151
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,640
and geothermal heat pumps, to the solar glass windows and rooftop windmills.

152
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,480
But in a very SolarPunk manner, the farm doesn't rely on the backbreaking work of harvesting

153
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,120
tea in the blistering sun of a hotter world.

154
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,360
They instead use solar power harvest bots.

155
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,200
But of course, not everything is pure bliss.

156
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,480
The Seven Sisters' cooperative struggles to stay afloat after a heat dome scorches

157
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,680
seven acres of their crop to ashes, and their harvest drones fall into disrepair.

158
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,280
She had only four harvest bots running, out of ten in the fleet, and it wasn't near

159
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
enough.

160
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,120
Two were out for repairs, the rest needing one thing or another.

161
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,520
Aubrey, the farm's botkeeper, was laid up sick in the guesthouse.

162
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,720
Quinn shows that while the future is promising, there's still loss and pain, revealing that

163
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,720
an ecologically just world will certainly be more pleasant to live within, but it won't

164
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,400
be without scuffs and bruises.

165
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,640
Alongside SolarPunk, there are also visions of decolonial, anti-racist realities embodied

166
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,400
in the Afrofuturistic visions of movies like Black Panther.

167
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:52,240
Specifically, the capital city of Wakanda imagines a vibrant urban center that seamlessly melds

168
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,560
accessible transit with pedestrian-centric roads, local fisheries, thrumming markets,

169
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,120
and the use of advanced technology in the service of ecological living.

170
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,320
All the while trying to answer the question, what does the world look like without the

171
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,160
destructive influence of white capitalist colonialism?

172
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,440
This imagery is crucial, and is expanded in the indigenous futures of storytellers like

173
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,640
Gina McGuire, who drills down into the complicated impacts of a future where meat is banned in

174
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
the US.

175
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,160
It had been twenty years since the meat industry had been shut down, and US production had fully

176
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,960
switched over to plant-based replacements.

177
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,360
And how that ban might impact those indigenous to the Hawaiian islands?

178
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,480
He himself had never liked the idea of the plant-based proteins of meat being made and

179
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,200
had watched with fear for his people, as the rising protein prices had come along with

180
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
the industry.

181
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,520
He had watched as their waters had been increasingly fished by all those who couldn't afford the

182
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
protein.

183
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,720
Each of these fictions grounds notions of degrowth, anarchism, eco-socialism, anti-racism, and

184
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,240
anti-colonialism intangible vignettes.

185
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,520
They imbue these politics with humanity and emotions, and allow us to stretch out our

186
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,720
legs and walk around in the world we're fighting for, if just for a moment.

187
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,520
But there are also future visions from scholars and activists, those that want to bring the

188
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,520
power of the story to their political framework.

189
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,640
This includes work stretching all the way back to the utopian socialist William Morris'

190
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,360
1890 book News From Nowhere, which describes a socialist world in the year 2000.

191
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,720
A world without private property, hierarchies, money, class, or prisons.

192
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,040
And since Morris, there's been a long tradition of transforming the political into the fictional

193
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,260
to give the struggle emotion and purpose.

194
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,440
Fiction allows the reader or viewer to step into another world or another person's shoes

195
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,960
and feel the result.

196
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,960
As professor of English, Patricia Valderrama writes,

197
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,320
Fiction can transmit information really effectively in non-technical language.

198
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,600
Troy Vitesse and Drew Pendergrass tap into this tradition in the last chapter of their

199
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
book Half-Earth Socialism.

200
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,880
After mapping out the political technicalities of Half-Earth Socialism through discussions

201
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,840
of planning algorithms, transitions to renewable economies, and creating a decolonial and

202
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,360
biodiverse world, they paint a very tangible narrative of a person waking up in a future

203
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,000
that has achieved some level of Half-Earth socialism.

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,520
While the world the protagonist inhabits does sound beautiful, Pendergrass and Vitesse attempt

205
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,600
not to romanticize their vision.

206
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,360
The solar factory workers in their world still want to go on vacation.

207
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,960
Albeit in this future world that that vacation is furnished by the community.

208
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Edith mentioned the extra vacation time, and I do like taking the train to the beach and

209
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,960
staying in one of those fancy houses they converted into a resort.

210
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,520
And there's still cafeteria arguments, but this time it's about what the cap on energy

211
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,560
usage should be for the community.

212
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,880
I can't believe those self-righteous people you hang out with on that farm are pushing

213
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,000
for a 750 watt quota.

214
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,280
I'll just be voting for a little more energy.

215
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,160
1,750 watts is not luxurious, and you know it.

216
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,440
And characters still put in work harvesting at local cooperative-owned farms that service

217
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,040
the regional area.

218
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,160
But at the same time, it's a completely different future from our present.

219
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,720
There is no fossil fuel extraction, and the economy is democratically and ecologically

220
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
planned.

221
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,120
There are shared communal living situations, not unlike very nice dorms, where families

222
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,680
can raise their kids together, share and community meals, and enjoy quiet or rowdy games of cards

223
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,200
after a filling meal.

224
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,920
But this future lays out just one vignette of a political possibility.

225
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,200
In contrast, the YouTube channel Prolacult shows something radically different, a world

226
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,560
built on hemp-based production, an economy that sequesters far more carbon than it produces

227
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,520
due to the fast-growing and carbon-sucking properties of hemp, and builds a socialist

228
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,680
and ultimately a communist world in the husk of a capitalist one.

229
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,560
What we require is the reindustrialization of the globe with a plant-based economy.

230
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:02,400
We must increase the production of goods, using a combination of the natural sciences,

231
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,760
engineering, and carbon-negative raw materials, like hemp.

232
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,560
All of these worlds, from the coastal waters of Hawaii to the deserts of Anaris, reveal

233
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,320
the energizing possibilities of a post-capitalist zero-carbon world.

234
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,480
But these are just possibilities.

235
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,720
To make the many worlds of our imagination real, we need to join the struggle of building

236
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,720
liberatory zero-carbon and anti-capitalist worlds right now.

237
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,360
But where do we start?

238
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,280
That's Murray Bookchin, a political theorist who believed in the importance of developing

239
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,560
an ecological vision of the world that seeps into the unconscious minds of the masses and

240
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,160
sparks change.

241
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,120
And hopefully the glimpses of the future worlds we've just witnessed do just that.

242
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,800
But daydreams can be a double-edged sword.

243
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,180
They can change us, but they can also paralyze us, trapping us in the comfort and beauty

244
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,080
of an unrealized future.

245
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,920
So the purpose of these speculative fictions is not to numb the pain of the current ecological

246
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,600
and capitalist crisis.

247
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,200
It's to ignite a fire under us by revealing that other worlds are possible.

248
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,480
We only get to live in those messy, complicated, but beautiful futures if we struggle for them

249
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
in the present.

250
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,760
This means building those decolonial farmers' collectives like the Seven Sisters Farm right

251
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
now.

252
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,640
It means for some in Atlanta, defending their largest remaining urban forest from destruction.

253
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,240
It means organizing your workplace to demand stronger control of production, and it means

254
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,520
developing ecological, post-capitalist solutions like regional environmental planning of half

255
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,080
their socialism or hemp-based production.

256
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,880
This work of building those visionary fictions today is exemplified in the anarchist practices

257
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,440
of Naotopias.

258
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,400
These political spaces develop more ecological and just pockets in the world right now that

259
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,720
seek self-administration, DIY attitudes, and a strong relationship with nature.

260
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,000
The free town of Christiania, right in the middle of Copenhagen, is a perfect example

261
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
of this Naotopia model.

262
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,880
After a group of anarchists and ecological activists squatted in an abandoned military

263
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,200
base, the Danish government ceded the rights to that growing community.

264
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,480
A community that, while still having to navigate the realities of living in a capitalist economy,

265
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,960
is carving out ecological and anarchist organizational models that are reminiscent of Ursula K. Le Guin's

266
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Anaris.

267
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,360
But on some fundamental areas, we've tried to work on being independent.

268
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,080
We collect our own garbage, we do our own road works, for the younger children we have

269
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,360
our own children's institutions, a lot of stuff is done independently.

270
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,840
Christiania is just one future world realized today.

271
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,160
There are so many other communities out there, like the 2500 strong Catalan integral cooperative

272
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,480
in Spain that are struggling for worlds beyond ecologically destructive capitalism.

273
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,240
So I invite you to dream.

274
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,680
Take a moment out of your day and sculpt a beautiful, ecological, post-capitalist, decolonial,

275
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,920
and just glimpse of the future.

276
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:13,800
Write it down if you want to, draw it if you can, but most importantly, start the work

277
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,200
and struggle to make that world possible today.

278
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,680
And I did exactly that.

279
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:24,200
I just made a whole speculative fiction bonus video which envisions what would happen 100

280
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,880
years in the future if the city of Chicago defunded their police department and invested

281
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,760
in green infrastructure and jobs.

282
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,640
Most of the green jobs created after we divested from the police department were focused on

283
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,240
universal aid and crisis management.

284
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,040
That video would do terribly with a YouTube algorithm.

285
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,000
Which is why I've uploaded it to the creator-owned streaming platform Nebula.

286
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,520
On Nebula, I don't have to worry about the algorithm or video restrictions, because if

287
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,760
you don't know by now, Nebula is a streaming platform built by and for a growing collective

288
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
of creators like me.

289
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,600
It's where I publish all of my videos a month early and release exclusive bonus videos regularly.

290
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,640
Like the one I just released about Chicago's ecological future.

291
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,360
I've already produced over 20 bonus and extended videos that are only available on Nebula.

292
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,080
Like one on the problems with carbon capture, or another on how the wellness industry preys

293
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,760
on your climate anxiety.

294
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,840
You can even watch next month's OCC video on whether China is the blame for the climate

295
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,760
crisis right now on Nebula.

296
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,760
In the eyes of the world, and especially those in the US, China is the boogie man of climate

297
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
change.

298
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,360
Because on Nebula, I'm always one video ahead.

299
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,400
Signing up for Nebula using my link, and this is crucial, you need to use my link, is the

300
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,840
best way to support our changing climate.

301
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,960
It's like Patreon combined with Netflix, but better for me and you.

302
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,400
Because when you sign up, you don't just get access to my videos ad-free.

303
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,800
You get to watch all the insanely well-produced Nebula exclusive videos from your favorite

304
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,000
creators like Second Thought, who has an ongoing series on the history of fascism,

305
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,440
and how fascism so effectively became the way of life for an entire country, or Wendover

306
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,760
Productions, who made an hour-long documentary on sea level rise in the Marshall Islands.

307
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,040
The implications are dire.

308
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,400
And there are hundreds of other Nebula exclusive videos and creator classes available for your

309
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
