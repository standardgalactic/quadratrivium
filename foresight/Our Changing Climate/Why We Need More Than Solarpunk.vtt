00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
The world today can feel soul-crushing.

00:02.720 --> 00:06.440
Whether you're churning out emails in a cubicle for eight hours a day, or force the

00:06.440 --> 00:10.720
sow t-shirts around the clock that are only worn once, or you're bombarded by headlines

00:10.720 --> 00:15.920
of sea-level rise, droughts, and disasters, the crushing weight of global capitalism

00:15.920 --> 00:17.720
feels inescapable.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.560
But all is not lost.

00:19.560 --> 00:24.720
While the destruction of climate chaos and the chains of fossil capitalism feel suffocating,

00:24.720 --> 00:27.800
this science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin argues,

00:27.800 --> 00:30.160
We live in capitalism.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.880
Its power seems inescapable.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.600
So did the divine right of kings.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.800
She goes on to add,

00:36.800 --> 00:42.800
Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings.

00:42.800 --> 00:48.840
Resistance and change often begin in our art, the art of words.

00:48.840 --> 00:54.680
The story is a powerful tool, one that harnesses the future to create change in the present.

00:54.680 --> 01:00.080
Stories plant seeds, beautiful visions that have the potential to germinate into alternative

01:00.080 --> 01:04.520
worlds that show us that business as usual is not inevitable.

01:04.520 --> 01:08.960
So as we struggle to upend the current status quo of rampant admissions and extraction

01:08.960 --> 01:13.320
at any cost, what role do visions of the future hold?

01:13.320 --> 01:18.360
Are they useful, and what stories and artistic utopias are out there right now that might

01:18.360 --> 01:22.240
bring a light to the looming darkness of climate chaos?

01:46.160 --> 01:51.000
If you want to learn more, make sure to stick around until the end.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.760
In the days of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, utopias were under attack.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.400
Convinced that the utopian socialism of their predecessors was not an effective way to end

02:00.400 --> 02:04.880
capitalism, Marx and Engels rejected any form of utopianism.

02:04.880 --> 02:10.120
They immersed themselves instead in the material realities of history, and developed critiques

02:10.120 --> 02:14.440
alongside a theory of change that they called scientific socialism.

02:14.440 --> 02:19.040
This framework, unlike utopian socialism, argued that society wouldn't be changed by

02:19.040 --> 02:21.680
appealing to reason or ideals.

02:21.680 --> 02:26.920
It would only be transformed by changing the material conditions of the economy, or in

02:26.920 --> 02:31.960
other words, the direct overthrow of the ruling classes by the working class.

02:31.960 --> 02:36.520
As a result, Marx and Engels were critical of sketching out what possible future worlds

02:36.520 --> 02:40.000
would look like, and relying on those visions to create revolution.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.720
For them, socialism was to be achieved not by attempting to appeal to people's minds,

02:44.720 --> 02:50.080
but instead revealing and exacerbating the already present contradictions within capitalism,

02:50.080 --> 02:54.000
the core of which was the struggle between the working class and the capitalist class.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.880
This is not to say that Marxists never once dreamed of the future, nor that speculative

02:58.880 --> 03:03.000
fiction is useless in the struggle for a world beyond fossil capitalism.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.560
But instead that as much as we need the backbone of scientific socialism to critique fossil

03:07.560 --> 03:12.880
capitalism and guide us through ending it, we also need visions of the future that give

03:12.880 --> 03:15.040
us something to struggle for.

03:15.040 --> 03:20.260
We need to imagine what's on the horizon, because those imaginings, those brushstrokes

03:20.260 --> 03:23.320
of the future, are what fuel our fire.

03:23.320 --> 03:27.600
Visualizing different worlds, at least for me, gives energy and purpose to the hard

03:27.600 --> 03:29.120
struggle of the present.

03:29.120 --> 03:33.480
So bringing these fictions to the page, to the canvas, and to the screen are powerful

03:33.480 --> 03:35.320
tools of revolution.

03:35.320 --> 03:40.560
Which is why, as Ashley C. Ford writes, the goal of oppressors is to limit your imagination

03:40.560 --> 03:42.840
about what is possible without them.

03:42.840 --> 03:47.280
So you might never imagine more for yourself and the world you live in.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.440
Imagine something better, get curious about what it actually takes to make it happen,

03:51.440 --> 03:53.840
and then fight for it every day.

03:53.840 --> 03:59.800
But these utopias or visionary fictions don't have to be, and indeed shouldn't be, perfect

03:59.800 --> 04:03.920
goalposts that railroad us into a strict path towards liberation.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.680
Indeed, as DeGro's scholar Giorgio Colas writes, paraphrasing Marxist scholar David

04:08.680 --> 04:09.680
Harvey,

04:09.680 --> 04:15.120
Those utopias that are meant as models or blueprints, not so much because they are unrealistic,

04:15.120 --> 04:20.640
but because the realization of a perfect ideal tolerates no objection and crushes everything

04:20.640 --> 04:22.080
that stands in its way.

04:22.080 --> 04:25.680
Colas goes on to say that we need dialectical utopias.

04:25.680 --> 04:30.520
Ones that are contradictory, messy, and incomplete that challenge us and make us reflect on our

04:30.520 --> 04:31.520
own world.

04:31.520 --> 04:36.360
Ultimately, this means we need to envision, in the words of the Zapatistas, a world where

04:36.360 --> 04:38.360
many worlds fit.

04:38.360 --> 04:44.400
These authors, filmmakers, artists, and creatives need to develop a diverse range of future worlds.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.360
So that it's not just Elon Musk,

04:46.360 --> 04:51.120
The sky will be cleaner and quieter if yours is going to be good,

04:51.120 --> 04:54.800
Or a white guy like me controlling the narrative of what's possible.

04:54.800 --> 04:59.560
So if we know that these visionary fictions are crucial to sustaining the fire of an ecologically

04:59.560 --> 05:04.200
just struggle for a better world, who's dreaming up those futures right now?

05:04.200 --> 05:11.400
Which artists and what stories are bringing light to the darkness of climate chaos?

05:11.400 --> 05:16.120
The worlds of the future are bright, and coursing through those future worlds are political

05:16.120 --> 05:20.280
currents that show us that a life without capitalism is possible.

05:20.280 --> 05:25.440
Degrowth, eco-anarchism, and eco-socialism all seek an economy beyond capitalism that

05:25.440 --> 05:27.480
is just and ecologically sound.

05:27.480 --> 05:33.680
But often, the political discussions of how to achieve these tendencies lack engaging narratives.

05:33.680 --> 05:38.160
It's hard to get excited about the future when technical terms like means of production

05:38.160 --> 05:40.960
and metabolic rift are all you hear.

05:40.960 --> 05:45.560
While it is crucial to understand these terms in the political and economic theory behind

05:45.560 --> 05:52.040
tendencies like socialism, we need stories to fill those frameworks with emotion and passion.

05:52.040 --> 05:56.600
The story is the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down, or the Trojan horse

05:56.600 --> 06:03.640
that plants the seed of resistance by revealing the beauty and flaws of more liberatory worlds.

06:03.640 --> 06:08.160
Trains and power have long understood the potency of envisioning future worlds.

06:08.160 --> 06:13.000
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, didn't just submit a jargon-heavy Green New Deal

06:13.000 --> 06:15.880
proposal to Congress and wipe her hands clean.

06:15.880 --> 06:20.600
She, together with Naomi Klein, painted her own vision of what a future with a Green New

06:20.600 --> 06:24.360
Deal could be in order to sway people's hearts.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.360
The biggest problem in those early years was a labor shortage.

06:27.360 --> 06:32.280
We were building a national smart grid, retrofitting every building in America, putting trains

06:32.280 --> 06:34.840
like this one all across the country.

06:34.840 --> 06:40.920
And on the campaign trail, candidates will often ground their platform in personal anecdotes.

06:40.920 --> 06:46.280
Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place.

06:46.280 --> 06:50.600
Because as neuroscientist Paul Zak reveals in his research, when we hear a narrative

06:50.600 --> 06:56.520
rich with emotion and tension, our brain releases chemicals that influence us to create change.

06:56.520 --> 07:00.880
So for the anti-capitalist climate movement, we need not only direct action and political

07:00.920 --> 07:06.400
struggle, but also stories, narratives and visuals that reveal suffering and success

07:06.400 --> 07:12.440
not just in the present, but visionary fictions that explore the possibilities of the future.

07:12.440 --> 07:16.560
And there are already countless artists out there doing exactly that.

07:16.560 --> 07:21.360
One of the core examples is Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed, a sci-fi classic that delves

07:21.360 --> 07:24.680
into the specific contours of ecological anarchism.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.960
The Dispossessed gives us two possible futures.

07:27.960 --> 07:33.000
One on the resource-rich planet of Urus that squanders its abundant resources through an

07:33.000 --> 07:38.040
over-producing market economy, and another on the resource-scarce planet of Inaris,

07:38.040 --> 07:43.200
a planet of exiled anarchists who thrive communally on very little.

07:43.200 --> 07:49.000
The Dispossessed is ultimately a story of opposite planets and opposite futures.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.040
Opposite in the sense that the planet of Inaris is the moon of Urus and vice versa, but opposite

07:54.120 --> 07:59.920
in the sense that as D-Roth theorists Georgios Kalas and Hugh March write, Inaris is what

07:59.920 --> 08:03.440
Urus is not, and Urus is what Inaris is not.

08:03.440 --> 08:08.840
Dispossessed possessed, barren lush, horizontal hierarchical.

08:08.840 --> 08:14.000
Le Guin doesn't just tell us what anarchism can be, she shows us through, for example,

08:14.000 --> 08:19.040
the small vignettes of honorasti children who are unable to conceive of a prison because

08:19.040 --> 08:23.520
their society doesn't function on the punitive basis of our current world.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.680
They had picked up the idea of prisons from episodes in the life of Odo, which all of them

08:27.680 --> 08:31.240
who had elected to work on history were reading, and when a circuit history teacher came through

08:31.240 --> 08:35.560
the town he expounded the subject with the reluctance of a decent adult forced to explain

08:35.560 --> 08:37.000
an obscenity to children.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.320
War through the massive aphorization projects that the people of Inaris collectively maintain.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.160
He worked now in a planting crew, thousands of seedlings raised in the green mountains,

08:46.160 --> 08:48.840
they planted the little trees in the dust, and they looked back as they went.

08:48.840 --> 08:52.120
There was a mist of green, very faint, on the pallid curves and terraces of the desert.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.880
The dead land lay, very likely, a veil of life.

08:55.880 --> 09:01.440
The dispossessed reveals the quiet, yet messy possibilities of a liberatory future.

09:01.440 --> 09:06.160
As philosopher Andrei Gorsnotes, the book crafts the most striking description I know

09:06.160 --> 09:11.680
of the seductions and snares of anarchist society, and the work of speculative fiction

09:11.680 --> 09:17.640
and ecological utopias has blossomed since Le Guin published her book in 1974.

09:17.640 --> 09:23.000
SolarPunk, for example, has witnessed a bright new emergence of artists and writers developing

09:23.000 --> 09:28.240
futures that look very different from the capitalist extraction economies of today.

09:28.240 --> 09:33.040
Animation Studio delines SolarPunk world of electric apple harvesters, lush farming

09:33.040 --> 09:37.840
cooperatives run on solar and wind power, and small technologies that tighten the connection

09:37.840 --> 09:42.720
between humanity and nature is a perfect example of a SolarPunk future.

09:42.720 --> 09:47.840
One that mends the relationship between nature and humanity through appropriate and community

09:47.840 --> 09:52.400
centric technologies, cooperatives, and decentralization.

09:52.400 --> 09:57.080
The imaginings of SolarPunk artists reveal that an ecological future doesn't have to

09:57.080 --> 10:02.520
mean living in scarcity or giving things up, it instead shows us how beautiful the world

10:02.520 --> 10:06.400
could be when we live with appropriate abundance.

10:06.400 --> 10:11.080
Writer Susan Kay Quinn's short story, The Seven Sisters, gives us another glimpse into

10:11.080 --> 10:12.640
a SolarPunk world.

10:12.640 --> 10:17.360
One that isn't a romanticized and unrealistic view of the future, but instead reveals that

10:17.360 --> 10:22.200
struggle and loss will still exist in a post-capitalist ecological world.

10:22.200 --> 10:26.720
Quinn's future zooms in on a tea farming cooperative in the American South that seeks

10:26.720 --> 10:30.720
to decolonize tea through education and fair practices.

10:30.720 --> 10:35.800
At the farm, a close-knit community of chosen family all grows the tea together.

10:35.800 --> 10:39.720
The whole farm met the mandates to be net, zero, on carbon, and make your own energy,

10:39.720 --> 10:44.280
but the tea house was quite the spectacle of green tech, from the passive solar design

10:44.280 --> 10:48.640
and geothermal heat pumps, to the solar glass windows and rooftop windmills.

10:48.640 --> 10:53.480
But in a very SolarPunk manner, the farm doesn't rely on the backbreaking work of harvesting

10:53.480 --> 10:56.120
tea in the blistering sun of a hotter world.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.360
They instead use solar power harvest bots.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.200
But of course, not everything is pure bliss.

11:01.200 --> 11:05.480
The Seven Sisters' cooperative struggles to stay afloat after a heat dome scorches

11:05.480 --> 11:10.680
seven acres of their crop to ashes, and their harvest drones fall into disrepair.

11:10.680 --> 11:15.280
She had only four harvest bots running, out of ten in the fleet, and it wasn't near

11:15.280 --> 11:16.280
enough.

11:16.280 --> 11:19.120
Two were out for repairs, the rest needing one thing or another.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.520
Aubrey, the farm's botkeeper, was laid up sick in the guesthouse.

11:22.520 --> 11:27.720
Quinn shows that while the future is promising, there's still loss and pain, revealing that

11:27.720 --> 11:32.720
an ecologically just world will certainly be more pleasant to live within, but it won't

11:32.720 --> 11:35.400
be without scuffs and bruises.

11:35.400 --> 11:40.640
Alongside SolarPunk, there are also visions of decolonial, anti-racist realities embodied

11:40.640 --> 11:45.400
in the Afrofuturistic visions of movies like Black Panther.

11:45.400 --> 11:52.240
Specifically, the capital city of Wakanda imagines a vibrant urban center that seamlessly melds

11:52.240 --> 11:57.560
accessible transit with pedestrian-centric roads, local fisheries, thrumming markets,

11:57.560 --> 12:02.120
and the use of advanced technology in the service of ecological living.

12:02.120 --> 12:06.320
All the while trying to answer the question, what does the world look like without the

12:06.320 --> 12:10.160
destructive influence of white capitalist colonialism?

12:10.160 --> 12:15.440
This imagery is crucial, and is expanded in the indigenous futures of storytellers like

12:15.440 --> 12:20.640
Gina McGuire, who drills down into the complicated impacts of a future where meat is banned in

12:20.640 --> 12:21.640
the US.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.160
It had been twenty years since the meat industry had been shut down, and US production had fully

12:25.160 --> 12:26.960
switched over to plant-based replacements.

12:26.960 --> 12:31.360
And how that ban might impact those indigenous to the Hawaiian islands?

12:31.560 --> 12:35.480
He himself had never liked the idea of the plant-based proteins of meat being made and

12:35.480 --> 12:39.200
had watched with fear for his people, as the rising protein prices had come along with

12:39.200 --> 12:40.200
the industry.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.520
He had watched as their waters had been increasingly fished by all those who couldn't afford the

12:43.520 --> 12:44.520
protein.

12:44.520 --> 12:50.720
Each of these fictions grounds notions of degrowth, anarchism, eco-socialism, anti-racism, and

12:50.720 --> 12:54.240
anti-colonialism intangible vignettes.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.520
They imbue these politics with humanity and emotions, and allow us to stretch out our

12:58.520 --> 13:03.720
legs and walk around in the world we're fighting for, if just for a moment.

13:03.720 --> 13:08.520
But there are also future visions from scholars and activists, those that want to bring the

13:08.520 --> 13:11.520
power of the story to their political framework.

13:11.520 --> 13:15.640
This includes work stretching all the way back to the utopian socialist William Morris'

13:15.640 --> 13:21.360
1890 book News From Nowhere, which describes a socialist world in the year 2000.

13:21.360 --> 13:26.720
A world without private property, hierarchies, money, class, or prisons.

13:26.720 --> 13:32.040
And since Morris, there's been a long tradition of transforming the political into the fictional

13:32.040 --> 13:35.260
to give the struggle emotion and purpose.

13:35.260 --> 13:40.440
Fiction allows the reader or viewer to step into another world or another person's shoes

13:40.440 --> 13:41.960
and feel the result.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.960
As professor of English, Patricia Valderrama writes,

13:44.960 --> 13:50.320
Fiction can transmit information really effectively in non-technical language.

13:50.320 --> 13:54.600
Troy Vitesse and Drew Pendergrass tap into this tradition in the last chapter of their

13:54.600 --> 13:56.600
book Half-Earth Socialism.

13:56.600 --> 14:00.880
After mapping out the political technicalities of Half-Earth Socialism through discussions

14:00.880 --> 14:05.840
of planning algorithms, transitions to renewable economies, and creating a decolonial and

14:05.840 --> 14:11.360
biodiverse world, they paint a very tangible narrative of a person waking up in a future

14:11.360 --> 14:15.000
that has achieved some level of Half-Earth socialism.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.520
While the world the protagonist inhabits does sound beautiful, Pendergrass and Vitesse attempt

14:20.520 --> 14:22.600
not to romanticize their vision.

14:22.600 --> 14:26.360
The solar factory workers in their world still want to go on vacation.

14:26.360 --> 14:30.960
Albeit in this future world that that vacation is furnished by the community.

14:30.960 --> 14:34.960
Edith mentioned the extra vacation time, and I do like taking the train to the beach and

14:34.960 --> 14:37.960
staying in one of those fancy houses they converted into a resort.

14:37.960 --> 14:42.520
And there's still cafeteria arguments, but this time it's about what the cap on energy

14:42.520 --> 14:44.560
usage should be for the community.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.880
I can't believe those self-righteous people you hang out with on that farm are pushing

14:47.880 --> 14:50.000
for a 750 watt quota.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.280
I'll just be voting for a little more energy.

14:52.280 --> 14:56.160
1,750 watts is not luxurious, and you know it.

14:56.160 --> 15:01.440
And characters still put in work harvesting at local cooperative-owned farms that service

15:01.440 --> 15:03.040
the regional area.

15:03.040 --> 15:07.160
But at the same time, it's a completely different future from our present.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.720
There is no fossil fuel extraction, and the economy is democratically and ecologically

15:11.720 --> 15:12.720
planned.

15:12.720 --> 15:18.120
There are shared communal living situations, not unlike very nice dorms, where families

15:18.120 --> 15:24.680
can raise their kids together, share and community meals, and enjoy quiet or rowdy games of cards

15:24.680 --> 15:26.200
after a filling meal.

15:26.200 --> 15:29.920
But this future lays out just one vignette of a political possibility.

15:29.920 --> 15:34.200
In contrast, the YouTube channel Prolacult shows something radically different, a world

15:34.200 --> 15:39.560
built on hemp-based production, an economy that sequesters far more carbon than it produces

15:39.560 --> 15:44.520
due to the fast-growing and carbon-sucking properties of hemp, and builds a socialist

15:44.520 --> 15:48.680
and ultimately a communist world in the husk of a capitalist one.

15:48.680 --> 15:55.560
What we require is the reindustrialization of the globe with a plant-based economy.

15:55.560 --> 16:02.400
We must increase the production of goods, using a combination of the natural sciences,

16:02.400 --> 16:07.760
engineering, and carbon-negative raw materials, like hemp.

16:07.760 --> 16:12.560
All of these worlds, from the coastal waters of Hawaii to the deserts of Anaris, reveal

16:12.560 --> 16:17.320
the energizing possibilities of a post-capitalist zero-carbon world.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.480
But these are just possibilities.

16:19.480 --> 16:23.720
To make the many worlds of our imagination real, we need to join the struggle of building

16:23.720 --> 16:27.720
liberatory zero-carbon and anti-capitalist worlds right now.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.360
But where do we start?

16:40.360 --> 16:44.280
That's Murray Bookchin, a political theorist who believed in the importance of developing

16:44.280 --> 16:49.560
an ecological vision of the world that seeps into the unconscious minds of the masses and

16:49.560 --> 16:51.160
sparks change.

16:51.160 --> 16:56.120
And hopefully the glimpses of the future worlds we've just witnessed do just that.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.800
But daydreams can be a double-edged sword.

16:58.800 --> 17:04.180
They can change us, but they can also paralyze us, trapping us in the comfort and beauty

17:04.180 --> 17:06.080
of an unrealized future.

17:06.080 --> 17:10.920
So the purpose of these speculative fictions is not to numb the pain of the current ecological

17:10.920 --> 17:12.600
and capitalist crisis.

17:12.600 --> 17:17.200
It's to ignite a fire under us by revealing that other worlds are possible.

17:17.200 --> 17:22.480
We only get to live in those messy, complicated, but beautiful futures if we struggle for them

17:22.480 --> 17:23.480
in the present.

17:23.480 --> 17:27.760
This means building those decolonial farmers' collectives like the Seven Sisters Farm right

17:27.760 --> 17:28.760
now.

17:28.760 --> 17:33.640
It means for some in Atlanta, defending their largest remaining urban forest from destruction.

17:33.640 --> 17:38.240
It means organizing your workplace to demand stronger control of production, and it means

17:38.240 --> 17:43.520
developing ecological, post-capitalist solutions like regional environmental planning of half

17:43.520 --> 17:47.080
their socialism or hemp-based production.

17:47.080 --> 17:52.880
This work of building those visionary fictions today is exemplified in the anarchist practices

17:52.880 --> 17:54.440
of Naotopias.

17:54.440 --> 18:00.400
These political spaces develop more ecological and just pockets in the world right now that

18:00.400 --> 18:05.720
seek self-administration, DIY attitudes, and a strong relationship with nature.

18:05.720 --> 18:10.000
The free town of Christiania, right in the middle of Copenhagen, is a perfect example

18:10.000 --> 18:11.840
of this Naotopia model.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.880
After a group of anarchists and ecological activists squatted in an abandoned military

18:15.880 --> 18:20.200
base, the Danish government ceded the rights to that growing community.

18:20.200 --> 18:25.480
A community that, while still having to navigate the realities of living in a capitalist economy,

18:25.480 --> 18:31.960
is carving out ecological and anarchist organizational models that are reminiscent of Ursula K. Le Guin's

18:31.960 --> 18:32.960
Anaris.

18:33.200 --> 18:37.360
But on some fundamental areas, we've tried to work on being independent.

18:37.360 --> 18:41.080
We collect our own garbage, we do our own road works, for the younger children we have

18:41.080 --> 18:45.360
our own children's institutions, a lot of stuff is done independently.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.840
Christiania is just one future world realized today.

18:48.840 --> 18:54.160
There are so many other communities out there, like the 2500 strong Catalan integral cooperative

18:54.160 --> 18:59.480
in Spain that are struggling for worlds beyond ecologically destructive capitalism.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.240
So I invite you to dream.

19:01.240 --> 19:06.680
Take a moment out of your day and sculpt a beautiful, ecological, post-capitalist, decolonial,

19:06.680 --> 19:08.920
and just glimpse of the future.

19:08.920 --> 19:13.800
Write it down if you want to, draw it if you can, but most importantly, start the work

19:13.800 --> 19:17.200
and struggle to make that world possible today.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.680
And I did exactly that.

19:18.680 --> 19:24.200
I just made a whole speculative fiction bonus video which envisions what would happen 100

19:24.200 --> 19:28.880
years in the future if the city of Chicago defunded their police department and invested

19:28.880 --> 19:31.760
in green infrastructure and jobs.

19:31.760 --> 19:36.640
Most of the green jobs created after we divested from the police department were focused on

19:36.640 --> 19:39.240
universal aid and crisis management.

19:39.240 --> 19:42.040
That video would do terribly with a YouTube algorithm.

19:42.040 --> 19:46.000
Which is why I've uploaded it to the creator-owned streaming platform Nebula.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.520
On Nebula, I don't have to worry about the algorithm or video restrictions, because if

19:50.520 --> 19:55.760
you don't know by now, Nebula is a streaming platform built by and for a growing collective

19:55.760 --> 19:57.440
of creators like me.

19:57.440 --> 20:03.600
It's where I publish all of my videos a month early and release exclusive bonus videos regularly.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.640
Like the one I just released about Chicago's ecological future.

20:06.640 --> 20:12.360
I've already produced over 20 bonus and extended videos that are only available on Nebula.

20:12.360 --> 20:17.080
Like one on the problems with carbon capture, or another on how the wellness industry preys

20:17.080 --> 20:18.760
on your climate anxiety.

20:18.760 --> 20:22.840
You can even watch next month's OCC video on whether China is the blame for the climate

20:22.840 --> 20:24.760
crisis right now on Nebula.

20:24.920 --> 20:29.760
In the eyes of the world, and especially those in the US, China is the boogie man of climate

20:29.760 --> 20:30.760
change.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.360
Because on Nebula, I'm always one video ahead.

20:33.360 --> 20:37.400
Signing up for Nebula using my link, and this is crucial, you need to use my link, is the

20:37.400 --> 20:39.840
best way to support our changing climate.

20:39.840 --> 20:43.960
It's like Patreon combined with Netflix, but better for me and you.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.400
Because when you sign up, you don't just get access to my videos ad-free.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.800
You get to watch all the insanely well-produced Nebula exclusive videos from your favorite

20:51.800 --> 20:56.000
creators like Second Thought, who has an ongoing series on the history of fascism,

20:56.000 --> 21:00.440
and how fascism so effectively became the way of life for an entire country, or Wendover

21:00.440 --> 21:05.760
Productions, who made an hour-long documentary on sea level rise in the Marshall Islands.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.040
The implications are dire.

21:08.040 --> 21:12.400
And there are hundreds of other Nebula exclusive videos and creator classes available for your

21:12.400 --> 21:13.400
consumption.

21:13.400 --> 21:17.360
