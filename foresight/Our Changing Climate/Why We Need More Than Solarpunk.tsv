0	2720	The world today can feel soul-crushing.
2720	6440	Whether you're churning out emails in a cubicle for eight hours a day, or force the
6440	10720	sow t-shirts around the clock that are only worn once, or you're bombarded by headlines
10720	15920	of sea-level rise, droughts, and disasters, the crushing weight of global capitalism
15920	17720	feels inescapable.
17720	19560	But all is not lost.
19560	24720	While the destruction of climate chaos and the chains of fossil capitalism feel suffocating,
24720	27800	this science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin argues,
27800	30160	We live in capitalism.
30160	32880	Its power seems inescapable.
32880	35600	So did the divine right of kings.
35600	36800	She goes on to add,
36800	42800	Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings.
42800	48840	Resistance and change often begin in our art, the art of words.
48840	54680	The story is a powerful tool, one that harnesses the future to create change in the present.
54680	60080	Stories plant seeds, beautiful visions that have the potential to germinate into alternative
60080	64520	worlds that show us that business as usual is not inevitable.
64520	68960	So as we struggle to upend the current status quo of rampant admissions and extraction
68960	73320	at any cost, what role do visions of the future hold?
73320	78360	Are they useful, and what stories and artistic utopias are out there right now that might
78360	82240	bring a light to the looming darkness of climate chaos?

106160	111000	If you want to learn more, make sure to stick around until the end.
111000	115760	In the days of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, utopias were under attack.
115760	120400	Convinced that the utopian socialism of their predecessors was not an effective way to end
120400	124880	capitalism, Marx and Engels rejected any form of utopianism.
124880	130120	They immersed themselves instead in the material realities of history, and developed critiques
130120	134440	alongside a theory of change that they called scientific socialism.
134440	139040	This framework, unlike utopian socialism, argued that society wouldn't be changed by
139040	141680	appealing to reason or ideals.
141680	146920	It would only be transformed by changing the material conditions of the economy, or in
146920	151960	other words, the direct overthrow of the ruling classes by the working class.
151960	156520	As a result, Marx and Engels were critical of sketching out what possible future worlds
156520	160000	would look like, and relying on those visions to create revolution.
160000	164720	For them, socialism was to be achieved not by attempting to appeal to people's minds,
164720	170080	but instead revealing and exacerbating the already present contradictions within capitalism,
170080	174000	the core of which was the struggle between the working class and the capitalist class.
174000	178880	This is not to say that Marxists never once dreamed of the future, nor that speculative
178880	183000	fiction is useless in the struggle for a world beyond fossil capitalism.
183000	187560	But instead that as much as we need the backbone of scientific socialism to critique fossil
187560	192880	capitalism and guide us through ending it, we also need visions of the future that give
192880	195040	us something to struggle for.
195040	200260	We need to imagine what's on the horizon, because those imaginings, those brushstrokes
200260	203320	of the future, are what fuel our fire.
203320	207600	Visualizing different worlds, at least for me, gives energy and purpose to the hard
207600	209120	struggle of the present.
209120	213480	So bringing these fictions to the page, to the canvas, and to the screen are powerful
213480	215320	tools of revolution.
215320	220560	Which is why, as Ashley C. Ford writes, the goal of oppressors is to limit your imagination
220560	222840	about what is possible without them.
222840	227280	So you might never imagine more for yourself and the world you live in.
227280	231440	Imagine something better, get curious about what it actually takes to make it happen,
231440	233840	and then fight for it every day.
233840	239800	But these utopias or visionary fictions don't have to be, and indeed shouldn't be, perfect
239800	243920	goalposts that railroad us into a strict path towards liberation.
243920	248680	Indeed, as DeGro's scholar Giorgio Colas writes, paraphrasing Marxist scholar David
248680	249680	Harvey,
249680	255120	Those utopias that are meant as models or blueprints, not so much because they are unrealistic,
255120	260640	but because the realization of a perfect ideal tolerates no objection and crushes everything
260640	262080	that stands in its way.
262080	265680	Colas goes on to say that we need dialectical utopias.
265680	270520	Ones that are contradictory, messy, and incomplete that challenge us and make us reflect on our
270520	271520	own world.
271520	276360	Ultimately, this means we need to envision, in the words of the Zapatistas, a world where
276360	278360	many worlds fit.
278360	284400	These authors, filmmakers, artists, and creatives need to develop a diverse range of future worlds.
284400	286360	So that it's not just Elon Musk,
286360	291120	The sky will be cleaner and quieter if yours is going to be good,
291120	294800	Or a white guy like me controlling the narrative of what's possible.
294800	299560	So if we know that these visionary fictions are crucial to sustaining the fire of an ecologically
299560	304200	just struggle for a better world, who's dreaming up those futures right now?
304200	311400	Which artists and what stories are bringing light to the darkness of climate chaos?
311400	316120	The worlds of the future are bright, and coursing through those future worlds are political
316120	320280	currents that show us that a life without capitalism is possible.
320280	325440	Degrowth, eco-anarchism, and eco-socialism all seek an economy beyond capitalism that
325440	327480	is just and ecologically sound.
327480	333680	But often, the political discussions of how to achieve these tendencies lack engaging narratives.
333680	338160	It's hard to get excited about the future when technical terms like means of production
338160	340960	and metabolic rift are all you hear.
340960	345560	While it is crucial to understand these terms in the political and economic theory behind
345560	352040	tendencies like socialism, we need stories to fill those frameworks with emotion and passion.
352040	356600	The story is the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down, or the Trojan horse
356600	363640	that plants the seed of resistance by revealing the beauty and flaws of more liberatory worlds.
363640	368160	Trains and power have long understood the potency of envisioning future worlds.
368160	373000	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, didn't just submit a jargon-heavy Green New Deal
373000	375880	proposal to Congress and wipe her hands clean.
375880	380600	She, together with Naomi Klein, painted her own vision of what a future with a Green New
380600	384360	Deal could be in order to sway people's hearts.
384360	387360	The biggest problem in those early years was a labor shortage.
387360	392280	We were building a national smart grid, retrofitting every building in America, putting trains
392280	394840	like this one all across the country.
394840	400920	And on the campaign trail, candidates will often ground their platform in personal anecdotes.
400920	406280	Through hard work and perseverance, my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place.
406280	410600	Because as neuroscientist Paul Zak reveals in his research, when we hear a narrative
410600	416520	rich with emotion and tension, our brain releases chemicals that influence us to create change.
416520	420880	So for the anti-capitalist climate movement, we need not only direct action and political
420920	426400	struggle, but also stories, narratives and visuals that reveal suffering and success
426400	432440	not just in the present, but visionary fictions that explore the possibilities of the future.
432440	436560	And there are already countless artists out there doing exactly that.
436560	441360	One of the core examples is Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed, a sci-fi classic that delves
441360	444680	into the specific contours of ecological anarchism.
444680	447960	The Dispossessed gives us two possible futures.
447960	453000	One on the resource-rich planet of Urus that squanders its abundant resources through an
453000	458040	over-producing market economy, and another on the resource-scarce planet of Inaris,
458040	463200	a planet of exiled anarchists who thrive communally on very little.
463200	469000	The Dispossessed is ultimately a story of opposite planets and opposite futures.
469000	474040	Opposite in the sense that the planet of Inaris is the moon of Urus and vice versa, but opposite
474120	479920	in the sense that as D-Roth theorists Georgios Kalas and Hugh March write, Inaris is what
479920	483440	Urus is not, and Urus is what Inaris is not.
483440	488840	Dispossessed possessed, barren lush, horizontal hierarchical.
488840	494000	Le Guin doesn't just tell us what anarchism can be, she shows us through, for example,
494000	499040	the small vignettes of honorasti children who are unable to conceive of a prison because
499040	503520	their society doesn't function on the punitive basis of our current world.
503520	507680	They had picked up the idea of prisons from episodes in the life of Odo, which all of them
507680	511240	who had elected to work on history were reading, and when a circuit history teacher came through
511240	515560	the town he expounded the subject with the reluctance of a decent adult forced to explain
515560	517000	an obscenity to children.
517000	522320	War through the massive aphorization projects that the people of Inaris collectively maintain.
522320	526160	He worked now in a planting crew, thousands of seedlings raised in the green mountains,
526160	528840	they planted the little trees in the dust, and they looked back as they went.
528840	532120	There was a mist of green, very faint, on the pallid curves and terraces of the desert.
532320	535880	The dead land lay, very likely, a veil of life.
535880	541440	The dispossessed reveals the quiet, yet messy possibilities of a liberatory future.
541440	546160	As philosopher Andrei Gorsnotes, the book crafts the most striking description I know
546160	551680	of the seductions and snares of anarchist society, and the work of speculative fiction
551680	557640	and ecological utopias has blossomed since Le Guin published her book in 1974.
557640	563000	SolarPunk, for example, has witnessed a bright new emergence of artists and writers developing
563000	568240	futures that look very different from the capitalist extraction economies of today.
568240	573040	Animation Studio delines SolarPunk world of electric apple harvesters, lush farming
573040	577840	cooperatives run on solar and wind power, and small technologies that tighten the connection
577840	582720	between humanity and nature is a perfect example of a SolarPunk future.
582720	587840	One that mends the relationship between nature and humanity through appropriate and community
587840	592400	centric technologies, cooperatives, and decentralization.
592400	597080	The imaginings of SolarPunk artists reveal that an ecological future doesn't have to
597080	602520	mean living in scarcity or giving things up, it instead shows us how beautiful the world
602520	606400	could be when we live with appropriate abundance.
606400	611080	Writer Susan Kay Quinn's short story, The Seven Sisters, gives us another glimpse into
611080	612640	a SolarPunk world.
612640	617360	One that isn't a romanticized and unrealistic view of the future, but instead reveals that
617360	622200	struggle and loss will still exist in a post-capitalist ecological world.
622200	626720	Quinn's future zooms in on a tea farming cooperative in the American South that seeks
626720	630720	to decolonize tea through education and fair practices.
630720	635800	At the farm, a close-knit community of chosen family all grows the tea together.
635800	639720	The whole farm met the mandates to be net, zero, on carbon, and make your own energy,
639720	644280	but the tea house was quite the spectacle of green tech, from the passive solar design
644280	648640	and geothermal heat pumps, to the solar glass windows and rooftop windmills.
648640	653480	But in a very SolarPunk manner, the farm doesn't rely on the backbreaking work of harvesting
653480	656120	tea in the blistering sun of a hotter world.
656120	658360	They instead use solar power harvest bots.
658360	661200	But of course, not everything is pure bliss.
661200	665480	The Seven Sisters' cooperative struggles to stay afloat after a heat dome scorches
665480	670680	seven acres of their crop to ashes, and their harvest drones fall into disrepair.
670680	675280	She had only four harvest bots running, out of ten in the fleet, and it wasn't near
675280	676280	enough.
676280	679120	Two were out for repairs, the rest needing one thing or another.
679120	682520	Aubrey, the farm's botkeeper, was laid up sick in the guesthouse.
682520	687720	Quinn shows that while the future is promising, there's still loss and pain, revealing that
687720	692720	an ecologically just world will certainly be more pleasant to live within, but it won't
692720	695400	be without scuffs and bruises.
695400	700640	Alongside SolarPunk, there are also visions of decolonial, anti-racist realities embodied
700640	705400	in the Afrofuturistic visions of movies like Black Panther.
705400	712240	Specifically, the capital city of Wakanda imagines a vibrant urban center that seamlessly melds
712240	717560	accessible transit with pedestrian-centric roads, local fisheries, thrumming markets,
717560	722120	and the use of advanced technology in the service of ecological living.
722120	726320	All the while trying to answer the question, what does the world look like without the
726320	730160	destructive influence of white capitalist colonialism?
730160	735440	This imagery is crucial, and is expanded in the indigenous futures of storytellers like
735440	740640	Gina McGuire, who drills down into the complicated impacts of a future where meat is banned in
740640	741640	the US.
741640	745160	It had been twenty years since the meat industry had been shut down, and US production had fully
745160	746960	switched over to plant-based replacements.
746960	751360	And how that ban might impact those indigenous to the Hawaiian islands?
751560	755480	He himself had never liked the idea of the plant-based proteins of meat being made and
755480	759200	had watched with fear for his people, as the rising protein prices had come along with
759200	760200	the industry.
760200	763520	He had watched as their waters had been increasingly fished by all those who couldn't afford the
763520	764520	protein.
764520	770720	Each of these fictions grounds notions of degrowth, anarchism, eco-socialism, anti-racism, and
770720	774240	anti-colonialism intangible vignettes.
774240	778520	They imbue these politics with humanity and emotions, and allow us to stretch out our
778520	783720	legs and walk around in the world we're fighting for, if just for a moment.
783720	788520	But there are also future visions from scholars and activists, those that want to bring the
788520	791520	power of the story to their political framework.
791520	795640	This includes work stretching all the way back to the utopian socialist William Morris'
795640	801360	1890 book News From Nowhere, which describes a socialist world in the year 2000.
801360	806720	A world without private property, hierarchies, money, class, or prisons.
806720	812040	And since Morris, there's been a long tradition of transforming the political into the fictional
812040	815260	to give the struggle emotion and purpose.
815260	820440	Fiction allows the reader or viewer to step into another world or another person's shoes
820440	821960	and feel the result.
821960	824960	As professor of English, Patricia Valderrama writes,
824960	830320	Fiction can transmit information really effectively in non-technical language.
830320	834600	Troy Vitesse and Drew Pendergrass tap into this tradition in the last chapter of their
834600	836600	book Half-Earth Socialism.
836600	840880	After mapping out the political technicalities of Half-Earth Socialism through discussions
840880	845840	of planning algorithms, transitions to renewable economies, and creating a decolonial and
845840	851360	biodiverse world, they paint a very tangible narrative of a person waking up in a future
851360	855000	that has achieved some level of Half-Earth socialism.
855000	860520	While the world the protagonist inhabits does sound beautiful, Pendergrass and Vitesse attempt
860520	862600	not to romanticize their vision.
862600	866360	The solar factory workers in their world still want to go on vacation.
866360	870960	Albeit in this future world that that vacation is furnished by the community.
870960	874960	Edith mentioned the extra vacation time, and I do like taking the train to the beach and
874960	877960	staying in one of those fancy houses they converted into a resort.
877960	882520	And there's still cafeteria arguments, but this time it's about what the cap on energy
882520	884560	usage should be for the community.
884560	887880	I can't believe those self-righteous people you hang out with on that farm are pushing
887880	890000	for a 750 watt quota.
890000	892280	I'll just be voting for a little more energy.
892280	896160	1,750 watts is not luxurious, and you know it.
896160	901440	And characters still put in work harvesting at local cooperative-owned farms that service
901440	903040	the regional area.
903040	907160	But at the same time, it's a completely different future from our present.
907160	911720	There is no fossil fuel extraction, and the economy is democratically and ecologically
911720	912720	planned.
912720	918120	There are shared communal living situations, not unlike very nice dorms, where families
918120	924680	can raise their kids together, share and community meals, and enjoy quiet or rowdy games of cards
924680	926200	after a filling meal.
926200	929920	But this future lays out just one vignette of a political possibility.
929920	934200	In contrast, the YouTube channel Prolacult shows something radically different, a world
934200	939560	built on hemp-based production, an economy that sequesters far more carbon than it produces
939560	944520	due to the fast-growing and carbon-sucking properties of hemp, and builds a socialist
944520	948680	and ultimately a communist world in the husk of a capitalist one.
948680	955560	What we require is the reindustrialization of the globe with a plant-based economy.
955560	962400	We must increase the production of goods, using a combination of the natural sciences,
962400	967760	engineering, and carbon-negative raw materials, like hemp.
967760	972560	All of these worlds, from the coastal waters of Hawaii to the deserts of Anaris, reveal
972560	977320	the energizing possibilities of a post-capitalist zero-carbon world.
977800	979480	But these are just possibilities.
979480	983720	To make the many worlds of our imagination real, we need to join the struggle of building
983720	987720	liberatory zero-carbon and anti-capitalist worlds right now.
987720	989360	But where do we start?
1000360	1004280	That's Murray Bookchin, a political theorist who believed in the importance of developing
1004280	1009560	an ecological vision of the world that seeps into the unconscious minds of the masses and
1009560	1011160	sparks change.
1011160	1016120	And hopefully the glimpses of the future worlds we've just witnessed do just that.
1016120	1018800	But daydreams can be a double-edged sword.
1018800	1024180	They can change us, but they can also paralyze us, trapping us in the comfort and beauty
1024180	1026080	of an unrealized future.
1026080	1030920	So the purpose of these speculative fictions is not to numb the pain of the current ecological
1030920	1032600	and capitalist crisis.
1032600	1037200	It's to ignite a fire under us by revealing that other worlds are possible.
1037200	1042480	We only get to live in those messy, complicated, but beautiful futures if we struggle for them
1042480	1043480	in the present.
1043480	1047760	This means building those decolonial farmers' collectives like the Seven Sisters Farm right
1047760	1048760	now.
1048760	1053640	It means for some in Atlanta, defending their largest remaining urban forest from destruction.
1053640	1058240	It means organizing your workplace to demand stronger control of production, and it means
1058240	1063520	developing ecological, post-capitalist solutions like regional environmental planning of half
1063520	1067080	their socialism or hemp-based production.
1067080	1072880	This work of building those visionary fictions today is exemplified in the anarchist practices
1072880	1074440	of Naotopias.
1074440	1080400	These political spaces develop more ecological and just pockets in the world right now that
1080400	1085720	seek self-administration, DIY attitudes, and a strong relationship with nature.
1085720	1090000	The free town of Christiania, right in the middle of Copenhagen, is a perfect example
1090000	1091840	of this Naotopia model.
1091840	1095880	After a group of anarchists and ecological activists squatted in an abandoned military
1095880	1100200	base, the Danish government ceded the rights to that growing community.
1100200	1105480	A community that, while still having to navigate the realities of living in a capitalist economy,
1105480	1111960	is carving out ecological and anarchist organizational models that are reminiscent of Ursula K. Le Guin's
1111960	1112960	Anaris.
1113200	1117360	But on some fundamental areas, we've tried to work on being independent.
1117360	1121080	We collect our own garbage, we do our own road works, for the younger children we have
1121080	1125360	our own children's institutions, a lot of stuff is done independently.
1125360	1128840	Christiania is just one future world realized today.
1128840	1134160	There are so many other communities out there, like the 2500 strong Catalan integral cooperative
1134160	1139480	in Spain that are struggling for worlds beyond ecologically destructive capitalism.
1139480	1141240	So I invite you to dream.
1141240	1146680	Take a moment out of your day and sculpt a beautiful, ecological, post-capitalist, decolonial,
1146680	1148920	and just glimpse of the future.
1148920	1153800	Write it down if you want to, draw it if you can, but most importantly, start the work
1153800	1157200	and struggle to make that world possible today.
1157200	1158680	And I did exactly that.
1158680	1164200	I just made a whole speculative fiction bonus video which envisions what would happen 100
1164200	1168880	years in the future if the city of Chicago defunded their police department and invested
1168880	1171760	in green infrastructure and jobs.
1171760	1176640	Most of the green jobs created after we divested from the police department were focused on
1176640	1179240	universal aid and crisis management.
1179240	1182040	That video would do terribly with a YouTube algorithm.
1182040	1186000	Which is why I've uploaded it to the creator-owned streaming platform Nebula.
1186000	1190520	On Nebula, I don't have to worry about the algorithm or video restrictions, because if
1190520	1195760	you don't know by now, Nebula is a streaming platform built by and for a growing collective
1195760	1197440	of creators like me.
1197440	1203600	It's where I publish all of my videos a month early and release exclusive bonus videos regularly.
1203600	1206640	Like the one I just released about Chicago's ecological future.
1206640	1212360	I've already produced over 20 bonus and extended videos that are only available on Nebula.
1212360	1217080	Like one on the problems with carbon capture, or another on how the wellness industry preys
1217080	1218760	on your climate anxiety.
1218760	1222840	You can even watch next month's OCC video on whether China is the blame for the climate
1222840	1224760	crisis right now on Nebula.
1224920	1229760	In the eyes of the world, and especially those in the US, China is the boogie man of climate
1229760	1230760	change.
1230760	1233360	Because on Nebula, I'm always one video ahead.
1233360	1237400	Signing up for Nebula using my link, and this is crucial, you need to use my link, is the
1237400	1239840	best way to support our changing climate.
1239840	1243960	It's like Patreon combined with Netflix, but better for me and you.
1243960	1247400	Because when you sign up, you don't just get access to my videos ad-free.
1247400	1251800	You get to watch all the insanely well-produced Nebula exclusive videos from your favorite
1251800	1256000	creators like Second Thought, who has an ongoing series on the history of fascism,
1256000	1260440	and how fascism so effectively became the way of life for an entire country, or Wendover
1260440	1265760	Productions, who made an hour-long documentary on sea level rise in the Marshall Islands.
1265760	1268040	The implications are dire.
1268040	1272400	And there are hundreds of other Nebula exclusive videos and creator classes available for your
1272400	1273400	consumption.
1273400	1277360	And if you sign up for Nebula using my link on screen right now, or in the description,

1289400	1294320	exclusive videos, and support a blossoming collective of educational creators.
