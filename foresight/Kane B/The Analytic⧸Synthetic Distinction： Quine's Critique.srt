00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Hello YouTube, in this video I'm going to outline Quine's criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,500
This is one of the central distinctions in philosophy.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,500
And the basic idea of this distinction can be stated quite easily.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,500
So, there are two kinds of propositions.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Analytic propositions are propositions that are true or false in virtue of the meanings of the terms alone.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:35,000
So, examples include all bachelors are unmarried, if it's raining then it's raining, 2 plus 2 equals 4, triangles have 5 sides.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then, synthetic propositions are propositions that are true or false partly in virtue of meaning and also partly in virtue of the way the world is.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, Frank Zappel is a musician, smoking causes cancer, the sky is green, all philosophers are poor and so on.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, you know, it's true that smoking causes cancer.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now, this is true partly in virtue of the meanings of the terms.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,500
If the word smoking had referred to running instead, then smoking causes cancer would have been false.

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,500
But its truth is also dependent on the facts in the world, right?

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:18,000
So, nothing about like the word smoking in itself entailed that it causes cancer, we might have discovered that smoking prevented cancer.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,500
I mean, indeed it was once thought that smoking had health benefits, right?

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,000
So, you know, the world could have turned out that way, but it didn't.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,500
The point is, what makes this sentence true is something about the way the world is.

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,500
By contrast, take a statement like, all bachelors are unmarried.

18
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, what makes this true is just the meanings of the terms.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Part of what it is to be a bachelor is to be unmarried.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So, there's no scenario that could render this false, no matter what happens, no matter what way the world turns out to be.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,500
This could not be false.

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,500
If you think you can conceive of a bachelor who is married, you just fail to understand the words.

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
So, this is the basic distinction, right?

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Some propositions are true because of what the world is like.

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Some propositions are true just because of the meanings of the terms involved, and similarly for false propositions.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now, this distinction is important because it has been applied to many other topics and problems within philosophy.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, many philosophers have thought that if we have some notion of analytic truths,

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
if we have this notion of analyticity, then we can make sense of a priori knowledge,

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that is, truths that are known independently of experience.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,500
So, we don't need to investigate the world to discover that all bachelors are unmarried.

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,500
We can know that all bachelors are unmarried just by understanding the terms in the sentence.

32
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Provided we understand the words, there can be no doubters to its truth.

33
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,500
So, like, analytic truths can be known independent of experience.

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,500
For the same reason, analytic truths are necessary.

35
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
They could not have been false.

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,000
They are true in all possible worlds to use the modern parlance.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now, this permits a neat account of the truths of logic and mathematics.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Logic and mathematics appear to be a priori disciplines.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
They don't depend on empirical investigation.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's last theorem, he didn't proceed by deriving predictions from the theorem

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and then performing experiments.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's not generally how mathematics works, right?

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Instead, you work out the consequences of various axioms.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The truths of logic and mathematics are also necessary.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There's no possible world in which Fermat's last theorem is false.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And there's something of a puzzle about how these non-empirical disciplines work, right?

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There's something kind of strange about the idea that, well, there is something that calls for explanation

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
in that, you know, it seems like there are truths that we can know,

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
but where they're not in any way, you know, we don't know them by performing experiments

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and they seem to be necessarily true.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
There's a puzzle. What kind of truths are these?

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And if the truths of logic and mathematics are analytic,

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
well, okay, we at least have the beginnings of a solution to this puzzle.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's like, okay, we're working out what follows from what in virtue of meaning.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The analytic synthetic distinction also lays the ground for a substantive role for philosophy.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
For much of the 20th century, it was thought that the basic method of philosophy was conceptual analysis,

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
where this involves trying to specify the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of a concept.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So take the concept bachelor, for instance.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We might sort of break that down into the concept of, like, not being married and the concept of man.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So all unmarried men are bachelors and only unmarried men are bachelors.

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
A bachelor is an unmarried man.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And the point is, is that being an unmarried man is necessary and sufficient for being a bachelor.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Now, bachelor, of course, is not a particularly interesting concept in itself.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But think about a concept like knowledge.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Much of the literature on knowledge involves conceptual analysis of knowledge.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Traditionally, it was held that knowledge is justified true belief.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So we'd say that S knows that P just in case P is true, S believes that P and S is believed that P is justified.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But this is famously challenged by Getier cases.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Cases in which a person has justified true belief but does not have knowledge.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So think about a case where somebody, you know, wakes up in the morning, they go downstairs, they look at the clock,

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
it says eight o'clock, and it is in fact eight o'clock.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So it looks like they have a justified true belief that it's eight o'clock.

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But now imagine that the clock had stopped at eight o'clock the night before.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, do they know that it's eight o'clock?

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Arguably not. So we have justified true belief without knowledge.

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge.

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So knowledge is not justified true belief.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And then of course, other epistemologists will try to propose other analyses of knowledge that get around these sorts of cases.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So essentially conceptual analysis of some concept involves proposing the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and then testing that against our intuitions about various cases.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You know, we look for cases where the proposed conditions are satisfied but where the concept would not be applied

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
or cases where we would apply the concept but where the conditions are not satisfied.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There's a lot of philosophy that works in this sort of mould.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And of course, you know, one very straightforward way to account what's going on here is to say,

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
well, philosophers are investigating the analytic truths, right?

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They're trying to work out what's true in virtue of meaning.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now, I mean, look, what I've just said here is all it's very brief.

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And there are many objections we might have to this way of characterising things.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Still, I think that it's reasonably intuitive that there's a gap between the conceptual parts of inquiry,

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
which proceed by investigating meaning and working out what follows from what,

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and the empirical parts of inquiry, which require us to perform experiments and make observations of the world.

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There seems to be a difference here and the analytic synthetic distinction kind of can underlie this gap

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
between the different areas of inquiry, right?

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So when we're sort of doing the conceptual stuff, we're dealing with analytic truths

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and when we're doing the empirical stuff, we're investigating the synthetic truths.

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So, yeah, philosophers have tried to use analyticity to explain notions like a priori knowledge

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and necessary truths and maybe even try to create a role for philosophy as a sort of autonomous discipline.

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So this is a very nice picture.

99
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's a nice picture, very influential.

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But a critique of this was presented by W.B.O. Quine in his paper, Two Dogmas of Empiricism.

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Now, Two Dogmas of Empiricism was written primarily in response to logical positivism,

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
which is a bit outside the scope of this particular video.

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But the arguments that were given by Quine have obviously been influential beyond this.

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So Quine argues that there is no analytic synthetic distinction.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There are no statements that are true purely in virtue of meaning.

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And of course, this is something to follow.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, you know, nothing can be known a priori.

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
All statements must in one way or the other be tested against experience.

109
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,000
As Quine sees it, there's no way to isolate some set of substantive truths that are not vulnerable to empirical disconfirmation.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So in the rest of this video, we're going to outline Quine's arguments.

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Alright then.

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So our question is, what exactly is analyticity?

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So I gave a brief sort of intuitive characterization of the analytic synthetic distinction when I began this video.

114
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But, you know, we want to define it precisely.

115
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Like, what exactly is analyticity?

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What is it for a statement to be analytic?

117
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, the obvious place to begin is by looking at how past philosophers have understood analyticity.

118
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Quine says, he attributes to Kant the following view,

119
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:53,000
that analytic statements are those which attribute to the subject no more than is already conceptually contained in the subject concept.

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So if I say bachelors are unmarried, the predicate concept unmarried is already contained within the subject concept bachelor.

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So anything that's a bachelor must be unmarried, because when I apply this concept bachelor,

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
that just is to apply the concept unmarried.

123
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Like one of the things I'm doing when I call something a bachelor is I'm calling it unmarried,

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
because like being unmarried is just contained within the concept of bachelor.

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, okay, this sounds nice.

126
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
There are a couple of drawbacks to this.

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
First of all, this is only going to apply to subject predicate sentences.

128
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not obvious how to extend this characterization of analyticity to other sentences,

129
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
like if it's raining, then water is pouring from the sky.

130
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
More seriously, the notion of conceptual containment is not really any better understood than the notion of analyticity.

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This notion of one concept containing another, that's just a metaphor.

132
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I mean, a concept isn't literally a box into which other concepts might be put.

133
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So Quine says, well, you know, this doesn't really get us as much further

134
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
in terms of having a clear characterization of analyticity.

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, so another attempt then is to say that a statement is analytic

136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
just in case its denial results in a contradiction.

137
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So if you take the sentence like bachelors are unmarried,

138
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
the idea is going to be that if I deny this, if I claim that some bachelors are married,

139
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
then I have contradicted myself.

140
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay, what's the problem with this?

141
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So Alex Miller in his introduction to philosophy of language suggests that we can kind of distinguish between two senses of contradiction.

142
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
First of all, there's a purely syntactic notion of contradiction.

143
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,000
In this case, a statement is self-contradictory only if it has the syntactic form p and not p.

144
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So if I say Frank is a bachelor and it is not the case that Frank is a bachelor,

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
that would be an example of a syntactic contradiction.

146
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Now this notion is perfectly well understood.

147
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We have no problem formalizing statements and identifying logical contradictions in this sense.

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The trouble is that in many cases, denying an analytic truth is not going to take this form.

149
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So if I claim that Frank is a married bachelor,

150
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I realize that I'm looking at my slides here and I've messed up because that should say,

151
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
second, there is a broader sense of contradiction which includes statements such as,

152
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Frank is a married bachelor.

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So just flip that in your head.

154
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So Frank is a married bachelor.

155
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
This is supposed to be an example of the second sort of contradiction.

156
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If I claim that Frank is a married bachelor, that statement does not have the syntactic form p and not p.

157
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So if this is a contradiction, we must be assuming some broader notion of contradiction.

158
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This isn't just a purely syntactic contradiction.

159
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So corresponding to these two notions of contradiction,

160
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Quine distinguishes two classes of analytic statement.

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So analytic statements of the first class are logical truths,

162
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and we identify these purely in virtue of their syntactic form.

163
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What makes these statements true are the arrangement of their purely logical terms.

164
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So these are terms like all, some, not, and if, then, etc.

165
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
These are the terms that we would use when describing the logical operators basically.

166
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
When we're dealing with logical truths,

167
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
we can give any interpretation we like of the non-logical terms.

168
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So I say all unmarried men are unmarried,

169
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and then we can sort of put this in slightly more formal notation as,

170
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
for all x, if ux, then ux.

171
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It doesn't matter how you interpret the terms unmarried and men here.

172
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You can have any interpretation of those that you like.

173
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is going to come out as being true.

174
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is true just as a matter of logic.

175
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Quine accepts this notion,

176
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
but then there are analytic statements of the second class,

177
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and these are more problematic.

178
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So when I say all bachelors are unmarried,

179
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
or all vixens are female foxes,

180
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
well, these are not true in virtue of syntactic form alone.

181
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
These are not true in virtue of their sort of surface logical form.

182
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So what exactly is it that makes them true?

183
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Now notice, of course, that it's going to be analytic statements of the second class

184
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
that are of interest to philosophers.

185
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
When we propose a conceptual analysis, for instance,

186
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
such as that knowledge is justified through belief,

187
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
that's an analytic statement of the second class.

188
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's not just a trivial truth of logical form.

189
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So the question is,

190
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
how do we make sense of analytic statements of the second class?

191
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Well, initial idea that Quine considers is to appeal to synonymy.

192
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So here's the idea.

193
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We can say that an analytic truth, p is an analytic truth,

194
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
just in case either, one, p is a logical truth,

195
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
or two, p can be transformed into a logical truth

196
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
by substituting synonymous terms.

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So this is going to be, if it's a logical truth,

198
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
it's an analytic statement of the first class.

199
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If it can be transformed into a logical truth by substituting synonymous terms,

200
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
it's an analytic statement of the second class.

201
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So basically via synonymy,

202
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
we can transform analytic statements of the second class

203
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
into analytic statements of the first class.

204
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let's say I take all female foxes are vixens.

205
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The idea is that the word vixen is synonymous with female fox.

206
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So we can replace female fox in that initial sentence

207
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
to get all vixens are vixens,

208
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
which is just a straightforward logical truth.

209
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And that's going to remain true no matter how you interpret the statement vixen.

210
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No matter what vixens refers to, that's going to be true.

211
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So there we have it.

212
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Similarly, if you take all bachelors are unmarried

213
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
by substituting synonyms for synonyms,

214
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
we get all unmarried men are unmarried, a logical truth.

215
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We can make all bachelors are unmarried into a logical truth

216
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
by substituting synonyms for synonyms.

217
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But now, what exactly is it for two terms to be synonymous?

218
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What is synonymy?

219
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I mean clearly, when we have two synonymous terms,

220
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
they're not exactly the same, right?

221
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So we're not dealing with a sort of complete identity

222
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
of all of the things that we might call meaning,

223
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
such as, as Quine says, psychological associations or poetic quality.

224
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
In that sense, vixen and female fox are clearly not synonymous.

225
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
They're not exactly identical in terms of poetic quality.

226
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So, okay, what the hell is synonymy then?

227
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well, it seems simple enough.

228
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Two terms are synonymous, just in case those terms have the same definition.

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So, now we're appealing to the idea that there is a correct definition of terms, right?

230
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
If we say that two terms have the same definition,

231
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and we can say that they're synonymous,

232
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and then we can use that to ground this notion of analyticity.

233
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Now, Quine does grant that in one context,

234
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
this idea of correct definition is perfectly acceptable.

235
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And this is where we give stipulative definitions.

236
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So suppose that I introduce the abbreviation ff,

237
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and I just stipulate that ff abbreviates female fox.

238
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Well, I mean, this doesn't, you know,

239
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm not appealing to any prior notion of analyticity or synonymy

240
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
or sameness of meaning or anything like that.

241
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm just stipulating an abbreviation.

242
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm saying like, okay, I'm going to adopt a convention

243
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
that any use of the words female fox can be substituted for ff.

244
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I mean, just imagine like, you know, you're sort of, I don't know,

245
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
writing down a speech or something like that.

246
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And then as you're writing it down,

247
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
when the person says female fox, you just write it as ff, just for convenience.

248
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So, you know, I can say all female foxes are ffs,

249
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and then transform that into all female foxes are female foxes,

250
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
because the term ff is just stipulated as an abbreviation for female fox.

251
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The problem is that most analytic truths are not supposed to be mere

252
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
stipulative definitions.

253
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I mean, in fact, most definitions are not mere stipulative definitions.

254
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
So, when I propose a definition of the word vixen,

255
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm not just stipulating that it abbreviates female fox.

256
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No, I have to think about how that word is used.

257
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I have to think about what the word means.

258
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You know, in this case, the language already exists.

259
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm saying something about meanings that are pre-existent within a language, right?

260
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Like, we have this, so we have this language already, which has the word vixen,

261
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and it has the expression female fox.

262
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And I'm saying, you know, vixen means female fox.

263
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That's something I'm working out, I'm not stipulating it.

264
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So, Quine says, in this kind of case, giving a definition of a term

265
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
can't explain synonymy because it presupposes synonymy, right?

266
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What it is to define some term a as b is to suppose that a and b are synonymous.

267
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So think about, like, I don't know, the process of writing a dictionary.

268
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
When you do that, you might make an error, right?

269
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I mean, you know, you could get it wrong.

270
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If all definitions were just stipulative definitions,

271
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
it would make no sense to speak of an error here.

272
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
When you stipulate that ff abbreviates female fox,

273
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
you can't be wrong about that.

274
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's not like, you know, you haven't made some mistake.

275
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But a dictionary, well, that can obviously contain errors, that can contain mistakes.

276
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So, you know, when we're giving a definition,

277
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
we're trying to stake the meanings that are implicit in some prior usage of the word.

278
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And that means it's not a stipulation.

279
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's going to presuppose synonymy.

280
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Now, there is a worry about this part of Quine's argument,

281
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
because you might say, well, you know, hang on a minute.

282
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Quine is granting that there is such a thing as synonymy.

283
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Synonymy occurs in stipulative definitions.

284
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Moreover, Quine seems to grant that if there is synonymy,

285
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
then we can define analyticity in terms of it.

286
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We can say that the analytic truths of the second class

287
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
are those that can be transformed into analytic truths of the first class

288
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
by substituting synonymous terms.

289
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So, you know, we've got synonymy,

290
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
we've got the link between synonymy and analyticity.

291
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What more do you want?

292
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It seems strange that Quine grants all of this,

293
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
but then goes on to deny the analytic synthetic distinction.

294
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And I guess to push the point further, we might say,

295
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
if there is this property of synonymy,

296
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and this property can be created by stipulative definition,

297
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
why can't it be created in other ways?

298
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So, I think to be clear, the problem as Quine sees it

299
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
is that stipulative definitions are just these sort of devices of convenience.

300
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
We can dot them or drop them without altering our theories,

301
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
without any kind of epistemic loss.

302
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I mean, again, you know, it's like I'm just sort of copying a speech,

303
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
and then I just introduce a new symbol.

304
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And that's all I'm doing.

305
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And maybe this does give us some kind of analyticity,

306
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
but it's not going to be a kind that can do any important philosophical work.

307
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You know, remember, philosophers don't just draw this distinction

308
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
between analytic and synthetic truths, like just for its own sake.

309
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
They see this distinction as doing important work,

310
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
such as explaining a priori knowledge,

311
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
or explaining necessary truths,

312
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
or providing some foundation for logical, mathematical, and philosophical inquiry.

313
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
A mere stipulative definition is not going to bear this weight.

314
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So, I do think, you know, Quine is,

315
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
he's at times sort of a little bit unclear about the,

316
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
about how force, about maybe how general his thesis is supposed to be, right?

317
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Because on the one hand, you know, he denies the analytic synthetic distinction,

318
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
but then he does just kind of grant for the sake of argument

319
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
that there are analytic truths of the first class.

320
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So there is a kind of analyticity that he's granting.

321
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And similarly, you know, he grants the, okay, yeah,

322
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
you know, you can have stipulative definitions.

323
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But I think the important thing to see

324
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
is that analytic truths of the first class,

325
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
stipulative definitions, this sort of thing,

326
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
this isn't going to do the work that philosophers have put

327
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
the analytic synthetic distinction to, right?

328
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You know, they're using this distinction for certain purposes.

329
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And we're not going to be able to get that out of the,

330
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
the sort of trivial kinds of analyticity that Quine is just granting.

331
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You know, when philosophers debate about the correct analysis of knowledge,

332
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
they're not just stipulating some, you know,

333
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
some abbreviation for the term knowledge, right?

334
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Okay, when I say, you know, vixen is synonymous with female fox,

335
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm not just stipulating a definition.

336
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So Quine concludes, well, this appeal to definition

337
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
is really not going to help, right?

338
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Because you're either going to end up talking about

339
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
stipulative definitions, which are just too trivial

340
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
to do the sorts of work that we're wanting,

341
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
or you're going to end up presupposing synonymy.

342
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So you haven't explained synonymy,

343
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
you're just going to end up presupposing it.

344
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Okay then, quick advert.

345
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000

347
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
there's a lot of bonus content there.

348

bonus videos available, so you can experience more of me.

350
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Most of them are sort of further thoughts on the topics

351
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
that I talk about in these videos.

352
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I also have a PayPal if you just want to send a one-off donation.

353
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Obviously, every little helps, it really does.

354
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I offer private tutoring in philosophy.

355
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I have a degree, a master's and a PhD in philosophy,

356
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
so I'm more than qualified to do that.

357
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Send an email if you're interested, and I have a Discord.

358
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The link to all of this stuff will be in the description.

359
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Okay then, let's move on.

360
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So, synonymy doesn't work, Quine says.

361
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So he then turns to another idea, another suggestion,

362
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
which is, or might say, that two expressions are synonymous,

363
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
just in case they are interchangeable, salva veritate.

364
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What the hell does this mean?

365
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Well, the idea is, is that one expression can be replaced

366
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
with the other expression without altering the truth value

367
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
of the sentences in which those expressions occur.

368
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So if I take vixen and female fox, the idea is,

369
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
well, any sentence containing the term vixen,

370
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
in any sentence which has that term,

371
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
this term can be replaced with the phrase female fox

372
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
without changing the truth value of the sentence,

373
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and vice versa.

374
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So if I take verity is a vixen,

375
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I can change that to verity is a female fox,

376
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and these are going to be true under the same conditions.

377
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So the same conditions under which verity is a vixen is true

378
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
will be the conditions under which verity is a female fox is true.

379
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
No matter how we alter the world,

380
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
these are going to have the same truth value.

381
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Or vixens have four legs,

382
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
to female foxes have four legs,

383
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
again, true under the same conditions.

384
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
There are vixens on Mars,

385
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
there are female foxes on Mars,

386
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
true under the same conditions.

387
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Hunting vixens ought to be banned,

388
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
hunting female foxes ought to be banned,

389
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
true under the same conditions,

390
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and so on and so on for any sentence.

391
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So for any sentence of the language,

392
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
we can sort of switch these terms out,

393
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and they're going to be true under the same conditions.

394
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And of course that's not the case

395
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
for just any pair of terms, obviously.

396
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So verity is a vixen,

397
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
replace vixen with the term bachelor.

398
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Verity is a vixen, verity is a bachelor.

399
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
These are not true under the same conditions.

400
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
One can be true and the other can be false.

401
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But this is not the case with vixen and female fox.

402
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It can't be that one of these sentences is true

403
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
and the other one is false.

404
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Now there are immediate limitations to this idea.

405
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So take for instance the statement,

406
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
vixen has five letters.

407
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
That's true.

408
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Female fox has five letters,

409
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
well that's false.

410
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Now Quine does point out,

411
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
well you can get around this pretty straightforwardly

412
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
by appealing to a use-mention distinction, right?

413
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
When I say that vixen has five letters,

414
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
the word vixen is mentioned not used.

415
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm not actually using the word vixen.

416
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So the idea is that when we can treat

417
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
vixen enclosed in quotation marks

418
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
as a new word which refers to the word vixen.

419
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
So when I say vixen has five letters,

420
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm mentioning the word vixen.

421
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm essentially using a new word

422
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
that's constructed by enclosing vixen in quotation marks

423
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
to refer to the word vixen

424
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and then I'm talking about the properties of that word.

425
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I mean I could just as well say that the word fred

426
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
refers to the word vixen

427
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and then I could say fred has five letters

428
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
and that would be true if we've stipulated

429
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
that fred is referring to vixen,

430
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
the word vixen, right?

431
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
fred is referring to the word vixen.

432
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So when I say fred has five letters,

433
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
that's like a name.

434
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
That's a name for the word vixen.

435
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Similarly, when I enclose vixen in quotation marks

436
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and I say quote, quote, vixen, end quote,

437
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
has five letters, right?

438
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
When I say that, I'm using this vixen

439
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
enclosed in quotation marks as a name for the word vixen.

440
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So of course, we can't then substitute it for female fox

441
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
because it's a new word.

442
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So this is not a counter-example

443
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
to interchangeability salva veritate.

444
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
A more serious concern, though, raised by Quine

445
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
is that whether two expressions

446
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
are interchangeable salva veritate

447
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
depends on the expressive resources

448
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
of the language that we're dealing with.

449
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So take the phrases creature with heart

450
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
and creature with kidneys.

451
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
These phrases have the same extension.

452
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That is to say, they pick out the same things

453
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
in the actual world.

454
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So as a matter of fact,

455
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
any creature that has a heart

456
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
is also a creature with a kidney.

457
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So consider the following statements, right?

458
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
All creatures with hearts are creatures with hearts.

459
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
All creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.

460
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Both of these statements are true.

461
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Now, if our language contains only the resources

462
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
to refer to the actual world,

463
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
then creature with heart and creature with kidney

464
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
will be interchangeable salva veritate.

465
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So if you imagine a language where, like,

466
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
it's a sort of simple language

467
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and all the language can do

468
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
is just refer to, like, concrete objects

469
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
in the actual world.

470
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So, you know, I have the ability to talk about, like,

471
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
the table, the cup,

472
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
the creature with a heart,

473
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
the creature with a kidney.

474
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But, like, that's it.

475
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You know, I can't talk about what might have been

476
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
or could have been.

477
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I can't talk about what people believe

478
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
to be the case or anything like that.

479
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Like, all I can do is just refer to objects

480
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and attribute properties to them.

481
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And the objects in the actual world.

482
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
You know, no fiction, no imagination, nothing like that.

483
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Just...

484
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm just talking about the objects that actually exist.

485
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
In this language,

486
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
creature with heart and creature with kidneys

487
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
will be interchangeable because, in fact,

488
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.

489
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So clearly, interchangeability in this language

490
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
is not going to be sufficient to explain analyticity.

491
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
We don't want to say that it's an analytic truth

492
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
that all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.

493
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So, you know, this is going to be a problem

494
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
if we're just dealing with this...

495
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
if we're dealing with this, you know,

496
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
somewhat impoverished language.

497
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Interchangeability in this kind of language isn't sufficient.

498
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Because the interchangeability of the terms in this language

499
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
rests on matters of fact, not on meaning.

500
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So, okay, let's say we add some more predicates to our language.

501
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Suppose we add modal operators.

502
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So we're now able to say things like,

503
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
necessarily, all creatures with hearts are creatures with hearts.

504
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Necessarily, all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.

505
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Well, the first statement here is true.

506
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The second is false.

507
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's true that necessarily all creatures with hearts are creatures with hearts.

508
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
False that necessarily all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.

509
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So, by substituting the term creature with hearts in this case,

510
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
we do not have interchangeability, Salva Veritate.

511
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Had evolution taken a different path,

512
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
then perhaps there could have been creatures with hearts

513
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
that are not creatures with kidneys.

514
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So we've introduced modal terms in our language,

515
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
terms like necessarily and possibly,

516
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
terms for describing how things must have been

517
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
or how things could have been.

518
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And in that case, the expressions

519
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
creature with heart and creature with kidneys

520
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
are no longer interchangeable Salva Veritate.

521
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
By contrast, it looks like we preserve the interchangeability

522
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
of vixen and female fox.

523
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So, you know, compare necessarily all vixens of vixens,

524
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
necessarily all vixens are female foxes.

525
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Well, yeah, that's still true, right?

526
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So, if we had a good grasp of this term necessarily,

527
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
then perhaps we could say that two expressions are synonymous,

528
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
just in case they are necessarily interchangeable Salva Veritate.

529
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
The trouble, as far as Quine is concerned,

530
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
is that we have no better understanding of necessity

531
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and these other modal notions than we do of analyticity.

532
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Indeed, remember, as we noted at the beginning,

533
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
part of the work that philosophers are using

534
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
the analytic synthetic distinction for

535
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
was to explain necessary truths.

536
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So, like, necessity is explained in terms of analyticity,

537
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
in which case we can't presuppose necessity

538
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
in order to explain analyticity.

539
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Now, I mean, of course, these days,

540
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
we might challenge Quine's argument here,

541
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
the development of modal logic and possible world semantics

542
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
has, as far as most philosophers are concerned,

543
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
given as a solid foundation

544
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
for understanding these sorts of modal claims.

545
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But, you know, this is the problem, right?

546
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Like, as far as Quine is concerned,

547
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
well, appealing to necessity, right?

548
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Well, one of the problems, right?

549
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
One problem here is this appeal to necessity

550
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
isn't really going to help

551
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
because necessity is no better understood than analyticity is.

552
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Analyticity is supposed to explain necessity.

553
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And it might actually be worth noting

554
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
that even if we did grant this prior understanding of necessity,

555
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
there are actually other contexts

556
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
that are going to raise trouble for the interchangeability criterion.

557
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So, suppose I say,

558
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Sydney believes that there is a female fox in his garden

559
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
versus Sydney believes that there's a vixen in his garden.

560
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Now, suppose that Sydney is unaware

561
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
that vixens are female foxes.

562
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Sydney thinks that vixen is a term for female stoats.

563
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Then, arguably, it may be true

564
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
that Sydney has the belief

565
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
there is a female fox in my garden,

566
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
but false that Sydney has the belief

567
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
there is a vixen in my garden.

568
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I mean, if you were to ask Sydney, like,

569
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
okay, do you think there's a vixen in your garden?

570
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
He'd say no.

571
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Do you think there's a female fox in your garden?

572
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
He'd say yes.

573
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And, you know, I mean,

574
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
appealing to necessity doesn't really seem to help

575
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
with this kind of case.

576
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
In fact, you know, if you have,

577
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
you could have a sort of more impoverished language,

578
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
which does not have modal operators,

579
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
but as long as it's got the, you know, the belief operator,

580
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
as long as we can refer to people's beliefs,

581
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
well, now it looks like interchangeability fails here.

582
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Because we want to say that vixen is synonymous with female fox,

583
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
but they're not interchangeable salveratate.

584
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
That might be a worry.

585
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Like, okay, so, yeah, this is a concern.

586
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The general point is this, right?

587
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
If we consider a simple language that's purely extensional,

588
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
but only describes the actual matters of fact,

589
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
interchangeability cannot define analyticity,

590
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
because any co-referring terms will be interchangeable.

591
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
If the language contains operators like necessarily,

592
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
well, yeah, in that case, interchangeability might be sufficient,

593
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
but we don't understand necessity,

594
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
so we're no further in an explanation of analyticity.

595
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And of course, if the language contains, you know, belief operators,

596
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
then it seems again that interchangeability no longer works.

597
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So interchangeability, like whether or not two terms are interchangeable,

598
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
depends on the expressive resources of the language in question.

599
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Okay, Quine then moves on to a final suggestion.

600
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Perhaps the problem here is ordinary language.

601
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Natural languages are vague and messy,

602
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and it can be unclear where to draw the lines between different concepts.

603
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So we have this intuitive grasp of the analytic synthetic distinction,

604
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
but maybe it's unsurprising that a precise characterization of this distinction

605
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
would be unavailable for ordinary languages.

606
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
We can perhaps gain greater clarity by proposing an artificial language

607
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
with explicit semantical rules.

608
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So think about, you know, propositional logic with its precise vocabulary

609
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and logical operators whose behavior is precisely defined according to the truth tables.

610
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So, you know, we construct a new language, an artificial language,

611
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
where we just lay down the rules of the language.

612
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Now according to Quine, analyticity is going to remain unclear,

613
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
even if we just consider the artificial languages.

614
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Okay, so the most straightforward way to appeal to semantic rules here

615
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
is to think about a formal language that explicitly specifies all of its analytic statements.

616
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So imagine a set of rules where the rules just tell us directly

617
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
which statements count as analytic and which count as synthetic.

618
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Quine says, well, this isn't going to help us understand analyticity.

619
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
In a language with such rules, we can understand what statements,

620
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
the rules, attribute analyticity to,

621
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
but we won't by this method understand what analyticity is.

622
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Indeed, there won't really be anything that analyticity is,

623
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
just from a set of rules that say these things are analytic.

624
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I mean, like, if I just introduce some new word, you know, phlob, right,

625
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
and you don't know what, like, and you don't have an understanding of what phlob is,

626
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and then I say, well, look, I've got this artificial language,

627
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and the artificial language has these rules which, you know, distinguish,

628
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
okay, these are the phlob statements, these are the non-phlob statements.

629
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
That's useless, right, that doesn't help you understand phlob at all.

630
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Something, in the case of analyticity, right, think about, you know,

631
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
you could have an artificial language where there's just some rule which says,

632
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
a statement s is analytic for l, just in case s contains at least 10 letters.

633
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I mean, nothing stops you from constructing an artificial language

634
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and then just having that as one of the rules of the language.

635
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And you would have a very straightforward way of identifying the analytic statements

636
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
within that language, but clearly this is an unusual use of the term analytic.

637
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It has nothing to do with the analytic synthetic distinction as philosophers have used it.

638
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You know, it doesn't have anything to do with the analytic, synthetic distinction

639
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
in the intuitive sense that we explained at the beginning of this video.

640
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But, you know, maybe this is a bit too simplistic.

641
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
So, instead of using semantic rules to specify the analytic statements directly,

642
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
there's an alternative way to approach this.

643
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
We might say, well, look, a language is going to contain semantic rules

644
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
which tell us that certain statements must be among the truths.

645
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So, certain statements are among the truths.

646
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The rules, these rules are not going to appeal to some prior understanding of analyticity.

647
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
They just stipulate certain statements of the language that are true.

648
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So, we just postulate certain truths.

649
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
So, all we need is the notion of truth.

650
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
For instance, a semantic rule in an artificial language like this based on classical logic

651
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
might be all statements of the form not p and not p are true.

652
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Or maybe, you know, if p is false, then if p then q is true.

653
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Now, these rules do not tell us all of the truths of the language.

654
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
They specify a class of statements that are to count as true.

655
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And having stipulated certain truths within the language that we can then take for granted,

656
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
we can then apply the language in other areas of inquiry and, you know,

657
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
work out what other things are true within the language and so on.

658
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
But, maybe we can now characterize analyticity by saying,

659
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
a statement s is analytic for l, just in case s is not just true,

660
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
but true according to the semantic rules of l.

661
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
We might have an artificial language with the rule that not p and not p is true,

662
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
from which it follows that it is not the case that there are unicorns

663
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
and there are no unicorns is true.

664
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Or consider a language for describing colours.

665
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
We might stipulate as a rule of this language that objects can only have one colour

666
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
in the same respect from the same perspective.

667
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So, you know, this language attributes to each surface one colour and one colour only.

668
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And it follows from this that the statement,

669
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
nothing is both red all over and green all over at the same time is true.

670
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So, you know, this kind of thing is presumably only going to work for artificial languages.

671
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Natural languages, you know, I mean, don't appear to have explicitly stated semantic rules like this,

672
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
but even in the context of artificial languages, there is a problem.

673
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
What exactly counts as a semantic rule?

674
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
We don't want to say that every true statement which says that some statements are true

675
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
counts as a semantic rule, because otherwise, literally all of the truths in the language

676
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
would come out as analytic.

677
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
For instance, it's true that there are eight planets.

678
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So now imagine I was to just say, well, it's a semantic, here's a semantic rule.

679
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
The sentence, there are eight planets is true.

680
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Okay, surely this doesn't count as a semantic rule,

681
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
because otherwise we could, we could just have a semantic rule for every true sentence,

682
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
and then every true sentence would, would end up being analytic.

683
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So the difficulty is how do we distinguish the genuine semantic rules,

684
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
rules like all statements of the form not p and not p are true.

685
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
How do we distinguish those from these kind of artificial gerrymandered semantic rules?

686
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Like the statement, there are eight planets is true.

687
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
What's the difference?

688
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
The general problem here is that if we're constructing an artificial language,

689
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
then in principle, we can, we can just take any statements we like as the basic postulates.

690
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So we can actually just postulate that there are eight planets is true.

691
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
On the other hand, if we're investigating a language that already exists, like English,

692
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
well, how, yeah, I mean, how do we tell which statements count as postulates?

693
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I mean, there's not, it doesn't look like there's any facts of the matter.

694
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
As Quine says, any finite selection of statements, preferably true ones perhaps,

695
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
is as much a set of postulates as any other.

696
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And that's the case regardless of whether we're dealing with, with natural languages or artificial languages.

697
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So Quine says that we have gotten no further here.

698
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I mean, obviously the natural, the natural answer to like what distinguishes a genuine semantic rule from a merely artificial one is going to be something about,

699
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
well, the meanings of the terms.

700
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But then that's presupposing analyticity.

701
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So Quine summarizes semantical rules determining the analytic statements of an artificial language are of interest only in so far as we already understand the notion of analyticity.

702
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
They are of no help in gaining this understanding.

703
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So Quine concludes that we have no way of drawing the distinction between analytic and synthetic truths.

704
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The general idea of his argument is that the term analytic is one of a circle of terms where if any one of those terms could be adequately understood,

705
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
then we could define the others in terms of it.

706
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So there's terms like self contradictory, necessarily synonymous, definition, semantic rule.

707
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The problem is none of these terms have been adequately explained.

708
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Any attempt to explain one of them will end up appealing to the other terms in the circle.

709
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So, you know, to explain analyticity, we appeal to synonymy, to explain synonymy, we appeal to necessity, to explain necessity, we appeal to analyticity.

710
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So at some point we always end up either bottoming out in some just, you know, vague term that's poorly understood, or we circle back around to analyticity itself.

711
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So we end up, you know, it ends up becoming circular.

712
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
None of these concepts have been shown to be capable of bearing the weight that philosophers have placed on them.

713
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:34,000
And as far as Quine is concerned, there's no reason to think that there is actually a distinction between the analytic and the synthetic.

714
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Now, it's worth noting before we end that many philosophers have taken Quine's argument to have the fairly radical consequence that there actually just isn't any such thing as the meaning of a sentence.

715
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:55,000
In fact, in later work, Quine himself is explicit that he, you know, he's sort of attacking the very notion of meaning.

716
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It's not just that there are no sentences that are true in virtue of meaning.

717
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's that there's no such thing as like the meaning of a sentence, period.

718
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
See my videos on Quine's arguments for the indeterminacy of meaning for more on this.

719
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
But with respect to the analytic-synthetic distinction, here's the reason in brief.

720
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Suppose that sentences have meanings.

721
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:25,000
In their response to Quine, Gries and Strausson point out that this would allow a very straightforward definition of synonymy.

722
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:38,000
As follows, we could say two sentences are synonymous if and only if any true answer to the question, what does it mean, asked of one of them, is a true answer to the same question asked of the other.

723
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So if you take verity as a vixen and verity as a female fox, right, ask for each of these sentences, what does it mean?

724
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
The correct answer will be the same in both cases.

725
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So two sentences are synonymous just in case they mean the same thing.

726
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And with this, you know, we break into the circle of terms and can define analyticity.

727
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Of course, Quine is going to say, well, we can't do that.

728
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
If we give up analyticity, then we seem to have to give up sentence meaning.

729
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
At the very least, we have to give up the idea that there is a determinate fact of a matter about the meaning of a sentence.

730
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Now, in practice, we might well ask the question, what does it mean of two different sentences?

731
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And we might give the same answer each time.

732
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But on Quine's view, we can't say that this answer is correct or incorrect.

733
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
When we talk about the meaning of a sentence, that's going to be more like a useful fiction or an idealization.

734
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Indeed, as far as Quine is concerned, the sort of unit of meaning is an entire language or an entire theory of the world.

735
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Some sentences are more resistant to refutation than others, but it's the whole theory that is tested against experience.

736
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And there's no sharp line between synthetic statements that can be refuted and analytic statements that are true come what may.

737
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And there's no determinate fact of the matter about what a sentence means.

738
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:11,000
For any sentence, its truth is going to be, the kind of conceptual and the empirical is intertwined.

739
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:20,000
For any sentence, the truth is going to be a matter of meaning and the matter of fact,

740
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:33,000
but where we are not going to be able to identify or sort of isolate the meaning of the sentence independently of this sentence's role in the whole theory.

741
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It was noting as well that Quine's argument also threatens the idea of logical truths, what Quine called analytic statements of the first class.

742
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:56,000
We noted that Quine does not object to logical truths. He grants in his argument that if we could define synonymy, then we could say that an analytic truth is any statement that can be transformed into a logical truth by substituting synonymous terms.

743
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So he seems to, at least in his article, he's granting logical truth, but we might think well actually there's a bit of a problem here, because let's take logical truth of the form for all x if vx then vx,

744
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:23,000
or for all x if x is a vixen then x is a vixen or more colloquially all vixens are vixens. That's an instance of a logical truth, but this only works if each instance of vixen has the same meaning.

745
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Right, so if the first token of vixen means female foxes and the second token of vixen means attractive women, then obviously this statement is false.

746
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:44,000
So ordinarily we would say that this kind of thing isn't a counter example to logical truth because it would be equivocating on the term vixen.

747
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:53,000
When we characterize logical truths, we have to specify that different tokens of the same expressions have the same meaning.

748
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It must be that the first token of vixen is synonymous with the second token of vixen. Without sameness of meaning, it's not quite so obvious how we are to understand logical truth.

749
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So maybe Quine's argument is a bit more radical than even he initially intended.

750
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And with that said, I'm going to leave that video there.

751
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Those were Quine's arguments against the analytic synthetic distinction.

752
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
And that's all for today. Thanks for watching. Bye!
