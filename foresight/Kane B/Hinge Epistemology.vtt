00:00.000 --> 00:05.460
Hello YouTube! In this video I'm going to outline hinge epistemology, an approach

00:05.460 --> 00:10.000
to knowledge and justification that has its roots in Wittgenstein's book On

00:10.000 --> 00:14.160
Certainty. Now I want to be clear from the outset that the goal of this video is

00:14.160 --> 00:18.040
not to explain Wittgenstein's own views, which are very much open to

00:18.040 --> 00:22.720
interpretation, rather we're going to look at how hinge epistemology has been

00:22.720 --> 00:27.240
developed in contemporary epistemology. I'm going to focus in particular on the

00:27.240 --> 00:32.100
work of Duncan Pritchard. Okay, so first of all we need to consider

00:32.100 --> 00:38.560
skepticism. Hinge epistemology is often sort of initially developed at least as

00:38.560 --> 00:44.600
a response to skepticism. The skeptic aims to call into question all of our

00:44.600 --> 00:49.080
beliefs, or at least a very large class of our beliefs. So here's a classic

00:49.080 --> 00:55.880
argument for skepticism. If I don't know that not S, I don't know that P, I don't

00:55.880 --> 01:02.040
know that not S, so I don't know that P, where S is a skeptical hypothesis, like

01:02.040 --> 01:06.200
the hypothesis that I'm a brain in a vat, or that I'm dreaming, or that I'm a

01:06.200 --> 01:09.600
Boltzmann brain. You can see my previous video for a discussion of Boltzmann

01:09.600 --> 01:14.960
brains. P is a claim about the external world, like I have hands, right? If I

01:14.960 --> 01:19.360
don't know that I'm not a brain in a vat, I don't know that I have hands. I don't

01:19.360 --> 01:22.800
know I'm not a brain in a vat, so I don't know I have hands. In general I don't

01:22.800 --> 01:26.680
know whether there are any external objects at all. If this argument is

01:26.680 --> 01:32.360
successful it throws doubt on basically all our common-sense beliefs about the

01:32.360 --> 01:39.600
external world. Now it was noticed by philosophers like GE Moore that there is

01:39.600 --> 01:45.080
something a bit odd about this kind of argument. Moore responded that surely a

01:45.080 --> 01:51.720
proposition like I know I have hands is is more certain, more secure than almost

01:51.720 --> 01:55.520
any other proposition. There's nothing that could be more obvious than that I

01:55.520 --> 02:00.800
know I have hands. So Moore argued that no philosophical argument, which you know

02:00.800 --> 02:05.160
I mean a philosophical argument will inevitably appeal to premises less

02:05.160 --> 02:10.600
certain than the premise I know I have hands, no argument like that should lead

02:10.600 --> 02:15.480
me to reject the claim that I have hands. Moore famously responded to this by

02:15.480 --> 02:21.400
simply holding up his hands saying you know here's one hand here's another so

02:21.440 --> 02:25.600
there are two external objects so the external world exists you know you just

02:25.600 --> 02:31.200
sort of flip the argument around right here's one hand here's another so

02:31.200 --> 02:36.920
clearly I'm not a brain in a vat. Again I have a whole video discussing Moore's

02:36.920 --> 02:42.440
argument that I'll link in the comments. So it was this sort of Mauryan kind of

02:42.440 --> 02:46.960
response that prompted Wittgenstein's initial reflections on certainty.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.400
Wittgenstein agreed with Moore that a proposition like I have hands is held

02:52.400 --> 02:56.680
with a kind of certainty even so Wittgenstein felt that there was something

02:56.680 --> 03:05.080
odd about asserting the proposition I know that I have hands and the key the

03:05.080 --> 03:10.000
key problem here is that in ordinary circumstances claims that we have

03:10.000 --> 03:14.560
knowledge or indeed that we fail to have knowledge makes sense only where there

03:14.560 --> 03:19.520
might be genuine doubt about what we claim to know or where we can offer some

03:19.520 --> 03:25.200
sort of justification for what we claim to know like if I say I know that P it's

03:25.200 --> 03:30.880
perfectly legitimate to then ask me well how do you know that P what reasons can

03:30.880 --> 03:37.960
you cite to justify P but in ordinary circumstances these sorts of questions

03:37.960 --> 03:44.080
about you know doubts and reasons and justification they just don't arise when

03:44.080 --> 03:51.280
it comes to a claim like I have hands I mean you know what what sort of possible

03:51.280 --> 03:57.520
justification could be given for the claim that I have hands well I mean when

03:57.520 --> 04:03.280
Moore responded to the skeptic he simply held up his hands and said here are two

04:03.280 --> 04:08.800
hands so you know Moore must be assuming that he can justify the claim

04:08.800 --> 04:13.120
that he has hands by perceiving his hands and I mean you know you might think

04:13.120 --> 04:17.440
okay yeah well surely you know like if you if you ask for a justification for

04:17.440 --> 04:23.320
the claim that I have hands then well I know that I have hands via perception

04:23.320 --> 04:27.120
right I perceive that I have hands maybe that's the justification but

04:27.120 --> 04:34.240
Wittgenstein says there this isn't gonna work because well as he says I quote if a

04:34.240 --> 04:38.440
blind man were to ask me have you got two hands I should not make sure by

04:38.440 --> 04:42.880
looking if I were to have any doubt of it then I don't know why I should trust

04:42.880 --> 04:47.800
my eyes for why shouldn't I test my eyes by looking to find out whether I

04:47.800 --> 04:54.560
whether I see my two hands what is to be tested by what so basically if I were

04:54.560 --> 04:58.960
to have like genuine doubt about whether or not I have two hands then I wouldn't

04:58.960 --> 05:03.840
be able to rely on my visual impressions to test this because you know if I'm

05:03.840 --> 05:08.120
doubting if I'm calling into question the existence of my hands if I'm calling

05:08.120 --> 05:12.640
into question something as obvious as that then I'm also probably you know I

05:12.640 --> 05:16.600
should also be calling into question the testimony of my eyes you know I'm

05:16.600 --> 05:21.320
gonna I'm gonna call into question the testimony of anything else like the

05:21.320 --> 05:27.360
claim that I have hands is sort of I'm just as certain of that as I am of the

05:27.360 --> 05:32.880
claim that my eyes are reliable so you know why why shouldn't I instead doubt

05:32.880 --> 05:37.000
my eyes and then check that my eyes are working by looking to see whether I have

05:37.000 --> 05:40.120
two hands I mean this is actually something that we will sometimes do in

05:40.160 --> 05:44.440
circumstances where you know our vision is impaired like if I'm in a fog or

05:44.440 --> 05:48.480
something I might actually like hold my hands out in front of me and look and

05:48.480 --> 05:53.020
find if I can see them you know like I and then I'm like oh my goodness you

05:53.020 --> 05:58.120
know this is a really thick fog because I don't see my hands there so you know

05:58.120 --> 06:05.080
we the point is is that like the testimony of my if if we're calling

06:05.080 --> 06:08.400
into question the test whether or not I have hands I'm gonna be calling into

06:08.440 --> 06:12.720
question whether or not my eyes are trustworthy so I can't test whether or

06:12.720 --> 06:17.160
not I have hands by by like looking to see whether or not my hands are there

06:17.160 --> 06:23.400
that at least that's not a genuine justification yeah so there's no way to

06:23.400 --> 06:28.920
test this proposition I have hands so questions of doubt can't really arise I

06:28.920 --> 06:36.280
mean there are situations of course where genuine doubt can arise so if for

06:36.320 --> 06:40.560
example I have been in a serious car accident I wake up in a hospital

06:40.560 --> 06:45.360
afterwards I find that my arms are bandaged I can't see my hands in that

06:45.360 --> 06:50.320
situation I might genuinely doubt whether I have hands and since you know I

06:50.320 --> 06:55.400
trust my visual perception I can remove the bandages to confirm whether there

06:55.400 --> 07:00.120
are hands there and this is of course a procedure that I can perform that resolves

07:00.120 --> 07:06.120
my doubt in that situation but for the radical skeptic there is no procedure

07:06.160 --> 07:09.200
that could resolve her doubt there is nothing I can do there's nothing I can

07:09.200 --> 07:15.360
perceive that would resolve the doubt about whether or not I have hands which

07:15.360 --> 07:21.560
for Wittgenstein means that that's not a genuine doubt at all I mean what like

07:21.560 --> 07:25.320
what would it be you know what would it be to genuinely doubt whether I have

07:25.320 --> 07:30.520
hands well maybe it would be that like I wouldn't flinch if I were to see a knife

07:30.520 --> 07:35.680
coming towards my hands of course the this the external world skeptic doesn't

07:35.720 --> 07:40.440
give up these ordinary behaviors if you if you start to try to stab her hands

07:40.440 --> 07:44.680
she's gonna move her hands and if somebody really didn't flinch when they

07:44.680 --> 07:49.120
saw a knife coming towards their hands no doubt their behavior would quickly be

07:49.120 --> 07:52.040
corrected right the knife would hit their hands they'd feel pain and they'd

07:52.040 --> 07:57.520
they'd start behaving accordingly okay so with that in mind then let's say

07:57.520 --> 08:04.680
let's say that in ordinary circumstances I was to claim I know I have hands well

08:04.720 --> 08:10.160
what possible justification could be given for this I mean I mean nothing

08:10.160 --> 08:15.240
right I can't say well I can't justify that claim by saying that I see my hands

08:15.240 --> 08:18.360
because if I'm doubting whether I have hands then I'm not gonna trust my eyes

08:18.360 --> 08:21.800
so you know I can't appeal to the testimony of my eyes in the same goes

08:21.800 --> 08:26.400
for any other perceptual capacity there's no there's no justification available

08:26.400 --> 08:34.160
here so you know there's no there's no justification there's no it seems that

08:34.160 --> 08:38.640
there's no there's no real possibility of doubt like for knowledge to be possible

08:38.640 --> 08:43.280
there must be the there must be the space for for doubt and justification like

08:43.280 --> 08:49.360
when I when I say I know that P this is sort of presupposing the the

08:49.360 --> 08:53.020
possibility that there are like circumstances where I don't know that

08:53.020 --> 08:56.680
P or like maybe I don't know the P right and and what I'm doing is giving a

08:56.680 --> 09:02.440
justification for P knowledge is based on evidential grounds like when I claim

09:02.480 --> 09:06.920
to know something I must be able to cite evidence for it and that evidence you

09:06.920 --> 09:10.360
know might be undermined in which case my claim to knowledge would be undermined

09:10.360 --> 09:16.040
so you know in ordinary circumstances the idea would be that knowledge claims

09:16.040 --> 09:21.120
are appropriate when we have you know arrived at some claim through investigation

09:21.120 --> 09:26.480
when we can when we can ask questions like how do you know but but when it

09:26.480 --> 09:31.960
comes to a claim like I have hands this sort of doubt and sighting of evidence

09:32.000 --> 09:37.480
and investigation this just isn't part of it right I don't investigate whether

09:37.480 --> 09:46.300
or not I have hands I just do things with my hands so the idea is that I have

09:46.300 --> 09:50.920
hands has this sort of special status it's a proposition with a very special

09:50.920 --> 09:56.360
status or claim with a very special status it's a a hinge commitment or a

09:56.400 --> 10:02.920
hinge proposition that Wittgenstein calls these commitments hinges because they

10:02.920 --> 10:08.600
are the presuppositions around which the rest of our language and epistemic

10:08.600 --> 10:17.160
practices turn the the thought is that there are certain commitments that just

10:17.160 --> 10:22.360
have to be assumed in order for various practices to be possible just like the

10:22.360 --> 10:26.640
hinges of a door must stay in place in order for the door to step to stay up

10:26.640 --> 10:30.280
and to open and close like in order for the door to turn the hinges have to stay

10:30.280 --> 10:37.720
in place hinge commitments are required for practices for various practices to

10:37.720 --> 10:40.760
be possible in particular hinge commitments are required in order to

10:40.760 --> 10:46.720
for the practice of rational evaluation to be possible so like rational

10:46.720 --> 10:53.440
evaluation would be like doubt justification giving evidence in order

10:53.440 --> 10:57.120
for that practice to occur there have to be certain commitments that are in place

10:57.120 --> 11:01.640
that make it possible but this means that those commitments cannot themselves be

11:01.640 --> 11:06.040
subject to this rational evaluation they cannot themselves be called into doubt

11:06.040 --> 11:11.640
so so like rational evaluation involves doubt okay I asked myself could this

11:11.640 --> 11:16.240
proposition be false right like I I believe that all you know the all

11:16.280 --> 11:20.840
species share a common ancestor okay but you know why do I believe that could

11:20.840 --> 11:25.600
that be false okay then I then I start to engage in a rational evaluation I

11:25.600 --> 11:32.720
search for reasons to accept or reject the proposition hinges must be exempt

11:32.720 --> 11:37.120
from this sort of doubt because the very act of raising doubts and performing

11:37.120 --> 11:44.720
investigations is itself predicated upon these hinges so since hinge

11:44.800 --> 11:48.920
commitments are outside of rational evaluation they do not themselves have

11:48.920 --> 11:53.400
any rational support so we saw this in the case of I have hands in ordinary

11:53.400 --> 11:57.880
circumstances it wouldn't make sense to try to offer a justification for this

11:57.880 --> 12:04.200
claim so hinge commitments are neither justified nor unjustified they are

12:04.200 --> 12:08.960
neither known nor unknown right so so they're not justified they're not known

12:08.960 --> 12:13.600
so actually when I say something like I know I have hands that would be again

12:13.600 --> 12:18.800
in ordinary circumstances at least that would be kind of you know sort of a

12:18.800 --> 12:23.680
misuse a misuse of language right it would be the mistake is is that no this

12:23.680 --> 12:29.920
just isn't it doesn't have a kind of this sort of epistemic status for the

12:29.920 --> 12:35.920
very same reason they can't be doubted if I was to ask a question like what

12:35.920 --> 12:40.160
reason is there to believe a hinge commitment that would be a mistake

12:40.320 --> 12:48.320
because hinge commitments are what enable the giving of reasons yeah I mean so if

12:48.320 --> 12:51.400
I were to doubt whether I have hands that would just call into question the

12:51.400 --> 12:55.480
whole practice of making claims or doubting claims like even even to doubt

12:55.480 --> 13:01.520
requires a background of assumptions such as I have hands and of course this

13:01.520 --> 13:05.480
accounts for the special kind of certainty that is associated with hinge

13:05.480 --> 13:10.720
commitments hinge commitments cannot be doubted but at the same time we can't

13:10.720 --> 13:15.160
offer a compelling argument for them the certainty of hinge commitments is not

13:15.160 --> 13:19.560
based on our being able to offer a proof for them it's based on the fact that

13:19.560 --> 13:23.880
these are the presuppositions that make inquiry possible or indeed that make our

13:23.880 --> 13:29.880
general form of life possible our general practice as possible okay so let's

13:29.880 --> 13:34.160
sort of see this maybe with another example so consider these two claims so

13:34.160 --> 13:37.560
we have a claim like there is milk in the fridge and then we have a claim like

13:37.560 --> 13:41.800
there are external objects now in the case of there is milk in the fridge there

13:41.800 --> 13:44.720
are very straightforward empirical procedures for establishing this

13:44.720 --> 13:50.720
establishing claim M here I know what to do to test it one way or the other okay

13:50.720 --> 13:55.320
I go to the fridge I open the door I search for a bottle of a particular

13:55.320 --> 13:58.800
size and shape and if I find such a bottle I'm gonna take it that M is true

13:58.800 --> 14:02.040
I'll be like okay I've established that there is milk in the fridge now

14:02.080 --> 14:06.960
obviously further questions could be raised here like how do I know that the

14:06.960 --> 14:10.840
bottle really contains milk how do I know that you know my brother isn't

14:10.840 --> 14:14.240
pulling some sort of prank and he's replaced the milk with something else

14:14.240 --> 14:19.400
but again there are straightforward procedures for answering such questions

14:19.400 --> 14:24.080
if I am really questioning whether or not my brother has pulled this prank I

14:24.080 --> 14:28.160
can you know pour the milk pour the liquid out of the bottle and then I can

14:28.160 --> 14:32.920
taste it and so on so again you know straightforward empirical procedures

14:32.920 --> 14:39.600
for testing this claim M what about claim E that there are external objects

14:39.600 --> 14:43.600
well clearly this cannot be approached in the same kind of way no

14:43.600 --> 14:48.560
observation could establish E it won't help to take you know a microscope and

14:48.560 --> 14:51.720
look through it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna have a microscope and be like

14:51.720 --> 14:56.840
okay I've looked through the microscope and there it is an external object the

14:56.840 --> 15:01.200
difference of course is that in accepting that there are external objects

15:01.200 --> 15:05.680
I'm I'm not accepting a straightforward empirical claim I'm instead I'm

15:05.680 --> 15:12.480
accepting a sort of way of inquiring I'm you know this is the sort of claim that

15:12.480 --> 15:17.680
allows me to gather evidence for and against other propositions and so this

15:17.680 --> 15:20.800
is what the this is a hinge commitment right it's hinge commitments are what

15:20.800 --> 15:25.360
allows to gather evidence for and against other propositions so I might say

15:25.360 --> 15:29.440
something like you know there are three chairs in this room or I might say

15:29.440 --> 15:34.000
that the universe is 13.8 billion years old I can assess evidence for these

15:34.000 --> 15:40.400
claims crucially however this evidence like this this evidence that presupposes

15:40.400 --> 15:45.800
that there are external objects and it it can't the evidence can't provide

15:45.800 --> 15:50.720
support to the hinge commitment because the hinge commitment is what is making

15:50.720 --> 15:56.720
possible the gathering of evidence in the first place so any any justification

15:56.720 --> 16:00.640
given of a hinge commitment would be less firm than the hinge commitment

16:00.640 --> 16:06.280
itself so like I can cite evidence for the claim that the universe has existed

16:06.280 --> 16:12.600
for 13.8 billion years now given that I am significantly younger than 13.8

16:12.600 --> 16:16.640
billion years this is going to entail that there are external objects there

16:16.640 --> 16:23.680
are objects outside my mind objects other than me so you entails E but you

16:23.680 --> 16:28.600
cannot be evidence for E and and evidence for you cannot be evidence for E

16:28.600 --> 16:33.760
because the evidence that bears on you presupposes E all the evidence in

16:33.760 --> 16:37.360
favor of you from physics and chemistry and astronomy and geology would make no

16:37.360 --> 16:41.680
sense without E like we can only bring claims about so if I take the you know

16:41.680 --> 16:45.440
redshifting of starlight or something like that well that's only going to bear

16:45.440 --> 16:50.520
on the evaluation of you if we're assuming E if I'm assuming that you know

16:50.520 --> 16:54.120
there isn't it there are these external objects and I'm not just you know

16:54.120 --> 17:01.960
currently dreaming or whatever so that's the idea of hinge commitments so which

17:01.960 --> 17:07.040
propositions which propositions count as the hinge commitments well different

17:07.040 --> 17:10.960
hinge epistemologists are going to have different answers to this but you know

17:10.960 --> 17:16.400
there are some some some general answers we can give here so that some types of

17:16.400 --> 17:19.720
some hinge commitments are going to include sort of specific propositions

17:19.720 --> 17:24.520
about myself and my own experience propositions that express the sort of

17:24.520 --> 17:30.200
basic pieces of evidence I have from my own experience like I have hands my name

17:30.200 --> 17:35.880
is Kane I am speaking English I have never been to the moon then there are

17:35.880 --> 17:40.840
going to be more general claims bearing on my sort of general worldview and how

17:40.840 --> 17:45.640
I form beliefs so there is an external world sense perception is reliable

17:45.640 --> 17:51.880
reasoning is reliable the universe is older than I am and so on right where

17:51.880 --> 17:58.280
well okay if you like my channel you can support me on patreon where I upload

17:58.280 --> 18:03.280
bonus videos where I offer my own thoughts about the topics I talk about

18:03.280 --> 18:09.720
on the on these on these videos or a one-off donation on PayPal I also offer

18:09.720 --> 18:14.160
private tutoring so email if you're interested in that private tutoring in

18:14.160 --> 18:18.400
philosophy and I have a discord link store this will be in the description

18:18.400 --> 18:24.280
right then so we've seen the role that hinge commitments play in inquiry but

18:24.280 --> 18:28.960
what exactly is the nature of these hinge commitments well a standard

18:28.960 --> 18:33.080
interpretation is that hinge commitments are something like rules they're not

18:33.080 --> 18:37.840
exactly you know they have the form of descriptive propositions but really

18:37.840 --> 18:42.480
they're more like rules so as Wittgenstein says their role is like

18:42.480 --> 18:46.280
that of rules of a game and the game can be learned purely practically without

18:46.280 --> 18:51.520
learning any explicit rules so yeah hinge commitment is going to appear to be a

18:51.520 --> 18:56.920
descriptive claim like if I say I have hands that has the appearance of merely

18:56.920 --> 19:00.640
describing the arrangement of objects in the world it's like okay there is

19:00.640 --> 19:06.080
this thing a hand which is attached to this person so descriptive claim but

19:06.120 --> 19:10.120
really what's happening when we say something like I have hands is we are

19:10.120 --> 19:14.480
we're sort of stating conditions that must be in place in order for certain

19:14.480 --> 19:20.720
practices to occur or we're stating the rules of certain practices so under

19:20.720 --> 19:25.240
normal circumstances I wouldn't explicitly say something like I have

19:25.240 --> 19:31.560
hands in philosophical contexts we use this seemingly descriptive claim to

19:31.560 --> 19:37.480
express certain rules that govern our practices and these rules are manifested

19:37.480 --> 19:43.040
in our actions so when I was writing the script for this video I was typing on my

19:43.040 --> 19:49.200
computer and to do this I I had to have hands I use my hands to type on the

19:49.200 --> 19:53.600
computer and maybe I find that a letter doesn't come up and then I wonder like

19:53.600 --> 19:58.760
does this key still work I try it again I tap it with my hands right I'm using

19:58.760 --> 20:04.360
my hands so my behavior with respect to the computer is governed by certain

20:04.360 --> 20:10.440
rules and I need not be explicitly aware of these rules like I don't have to

20:10.440 --> 20:15.880
consciously think to myself that I have hands in order to use my hands right

20:15.880 --> 20:19.720
often I'll just use my hands I won't I won't sort of have some proposition in

20:19.720 --> 20:25.360
my head that says I have hands I'll just use my hands indeed this rule is not

20:25.400 --> 20:29.760
something that even has to be taught at least not in the way that I was taught

20:29.760 --> 20:34.760
say the theory of evolution by natural selection like I'm not taught the

20:34.760 --> 20:40.120
proposition that I have hands I'm taught how to use my hands to do various

20:40.120 --> 20:47.640
things and in in being taught these practices I adopt these rules these

20:47.640 --> 20:53.760
hinge commitments Danielle Moyle-Sharic put it like this the hinge certainty

20:54.040 --> 20:59.760
verbalized as I have a body is a disposition of a living creature which

20:59.760 --> 21:06.680
manifests itself in her acting in the certainty of having a body so the

21:06.680 --> 21:11.880
certainty is of these rules it's certainly these rules these commitments is

21:11.880 --> 21:17.880
manifested in our actions the fact that I'm acting just shows that I accept these

21:17.920 --> 21:24.200
rules that I'm conforming to these rules and this is why even when I recognize

21:24.200 --> 21:30.120
that there is no rational basis for the truth of the proposition I have hands

21:30.120 --> 21:35.040
like even when I recognize that I have no reasons for this as a belief my

21:35.040 --> 21:40.760
certainty in it is unchanged it will continue to function as a rule that

21:40.760 --> 21:45.160
guides my behavior I can notice that there's no rational basis for the belief

21:45.160 --> 21:50.240
that I have hands and then I sit down and start typing things on my computer

21:50.240 --> 21:54.200
right so this approach gives voice to the worry that skepticism as the

21:54.200 --> 22:01.160
philosopher conceives of it is in some way inert or meaningless so as we noted

22:01.160 --> 22:05.440
earlier there are circumstances where I will experience genuine doubt about

22:05.440 --> 22:09.600
whether or not I have hands as when I wake up in a hospital bed after a car

22:09.600 --> 22:15.160
crash I can resolve such doubts by applying certain standard empirical

22:15.160 --> 22:19.760
procedures that I've learned like you know looking under the bandages and then

22:19.760 --> 22:23.920
I see I see the hands there and I'm like oh I might say in relief oh I know I have

22:23.920 --> 22:28.280
two hands thank God you know this isn't the kind of thing the skeptic is

22:28.280 --> 22:32.840
talking about of course the skeptic tries to ask for a rational justification of

22:32.840 --> 22:37.040
our whole world view and tries to cast doubt on whether I have hands even in

22:37.040 --> 22:41.640
ordinary context but the skeptics doubt it's a doubt that makes no difference

22:41.640 --> 22:45.560
whatsoever the skeptic doesn't change her actions she continues to use her

22:45.560 --> 22:49.840
hands just as the rest of us do and the skeptic doesn't propose any procedure

22:49.840 --> 22:53.720
for resolving the doubt indeed by her lights there can be no procedure for

22:53.720 --> 22:57.280
resolving the doubt because the the skeptical hypotheses are designed to be

22:57.280 --> 23:01.480
consistent with all possible experience so yeah so it's not it's not really a

23:01.480 --> 23:04.840
doubt at all I mean I can ponder these skeptical arguments all I like but at

23:04.840 --> 23:08.960
the end of the day I still know how to use a keyboard and it's this knowing how

23:08.960 --> 23:17.080
to use a keyboard that manifests the hinge commitment that I have hands so

23:17.080 --> 23:23.640
that is the basic idea of hinge epistemology now there are three immediate

23:23.640 --> 23:30.560
challenges to this kind of approach so the first the first challenge is whether

23:30.560 --> 23:34.480
this sort of view actually provides a response to skepticism we've talked about

23:34.520 --> 23:38.800
skepticism a lot and contrasted the hinge the hinge epistemologist with the

23:38.800 --> 23:44.480
skeptic but we might worry whether whether the difference is as great as

23:44.480 --> 23:50.080
it seems to be so notice that the hinge epistemologist identifies certain

23:50.080 --> 23:54.920
commitments as being the hinge commitments and there are two relevant

23:54.920 --> 24:00.680
features of hinge commitments as the hinge epistemologist sees it first they

24:00.680 --> 24:04.480
are the presuppositions on which the rest of our inquiries are built they're

24:04.480 --> 24:12.320
the you know the hinges on which the rest of our practices turn second they are

24:12.320 --> 24:18.960
not justified they are not known no reason can be given in support of them

24:18.960 --> 24:24.600
no justification can be given for them but then you might think well hang on a

24:24.600 --> 24:28.760
minute isn't this exactly what a skeptic would say like all of our beliefs

24:28.960 --> 24:34.400
rest on these presuppositions that cannot be justified so all of our beliefs

24:34.400 --> 24:39.440
are ultimately unsupported now of course a hinge epistemologist will reject this

24:39.440 --> 24:43.320
final inference right all of our beliefs rest on propositions that cannot be

24:43.320 --> 24:49.080
justified sure it does not follow that all of our beliefs are unsupported we

24:49.080 --> 24:53.320
have to pay attention to what it means to give support to a belief this is a

24:53.320 --> 24:58.280
matter of giving reasons of engaging in investigation of assuaging doubts but

24:58.320 --> 25:04.360
this activity presupposes certain hinge commitments the trouble is is that even

25:04.360 --> 25:08.440
a skeptic might be willing to accept what we could call you know conditional

25:08.440 --> 25:13.360
justification or conditional support so the skeptic might accept that look if

25:13.360 --> 25:16.960
you take certain propositions for granted say the proposition that

25:16.960 --> 25:21.280
perception presents a generally reliable picture of the external world if I take

25:21.280 --> 25:25.800
that for granted then I can give support to further propositions on that

25:25.800 --> 25:32.000
basis like if we take P for granted we can get ourselves to Q the issue for

25:32.000 --> 25:37.080
the skeptic is that there's no justification for P but then I mean but

25:37.080 --> 25:40.400
then like where exactly is the line between the hinge epistemology and the

25:40.400 --> 25:45.640
skeptic here is it just that they have like different attitudes to these

25:45.640 --> 25:50.080
presuppositions so like both of them seem to agree that okay there are certain

25:50.080 --> 25:54.240
presuppositions that you can make which like there are certain presuppositions

25:54.240 --> 26:00.800
we make which you know which then allows us to engage in further inquiry you

26:00.800 --> 26:03.840
know which then makes possible all of these other practices or which you know

26:03.840 --> 26:07.920
like if we take these presuppositions for granted then you know this practice of

26:07.920 --> 26:12.480
justification is possible so okay looks like we both agree on that and more

26:12.480 --> 26:15.720
over they both agree that these presuppositions are themselves without

26:15.720 --> 26:21.040
justification is it just that the hinge epistemologist is okay with this

26:21.040 --> 26:26.280
whereas the skeptic is not okay with it like it's just a difference in attitude

26:26.280 --> 26:30.800
so this is one sort of worry that like okay maybe the line is starting to look

26:30.800 --> 26:37.840
quite thin we'll come back to this point later so second challenge is that hinge

26:37.840 --> 26:44.600
epistemology appears to be committed to epistemic relativism basic problem here

26:44.600 --> 26:48.200
is well it looks like people could have could adopt very different hinge

26:48.240 --> 26:52.760
commitments which would lead to different systems of justification suppose

26:52.760 --> 26:57.320
that Verity selects as a hinge commitment that the Bible is the infallible

26:57.320 --> 27:02.040
world of word of God Verity is fervently religious she interprets all other

27:02.040 --> 27:06.640
practices in terms of her literal Christian faith her literalist faith as a

27:06.640 --> 27:10.480
result she endorses young earth creationism as an account of the history

27:10.480 --> 27:15.480
of life now since the Bible is a hinge commitment for Verity it's not open to

27:15.520 --> 27:20.400
doubt or justification in which case it looks like there's no room for debate

27:20.400 --> 27:26.320
with Verity Verity is not making any kind of rational error you know all I can

27:26.320 --> 27:31.240
say is well we have different hinge commitments and our hinge commitments

27:31.240 --> 27:36.880
are immovable so I mean there's a worry that like hinge hinge epistemology

27:36.880 --> 27:41.600
seems to sort of close down rational inquiry and there's also a worry that

27:41.600 --> 27:47.600
it sort of licenses a kind of just dogmatism you know like we just end up

27:47.600 --> 27:53.280
accepting certain things and they're kind of quarantined from from criticism

27:53.280 --> 27:57.800
and justification and of course this this only makes this this specter of

27:57.800 --> 28:02.000
skepticism more vivid because you know we can recognize that Verity's hinge

28:02.000 --> 28:05.960
commitments have led her to a radically mistaken view of the world so we're like

28:05.960 --> 28:10.680
okay these hinge commitments have led somebody massively astray in which case

28:10.720 --> 28:14.040
we might wonder well why shouldn't that be the same for our own hinge

28:14.040 --> 28:17.800
commitments then I mean just insisting that hinge commitments can't be open to

28:17.800 --> 28:22.880
doubt is not a particularly comforting response here you know it's like there

28:22.880 --> 28:25.920
seems to be something defective about the way that Verity the creationist

28:25.920 --> 28:30.600
justifies her worldview if I recognize that the only difference between us is

28:30.600 --> 28:36.320
that we happen to have different hinge commitments I mean maybe my worldview is

28:36.360 --> 28:42.040
defective also you know this is the worry a third problem is that it seems

28:42.040 --> 28:49.320
that hinge commitments can change over time and in response to new evidence so

28:49.320 --> 28:53.920
I have hands is currently a hinge commitment but we've already seen that

28:53.920 --> 28:59.120
there are circumstances where I might genuinely come to doubt this what is it

28:59.120 --> 29:05.200
that makes me doubt this well it looks like it's the changing evidence so you

29:05.200 --> 29:08.680
know or think about a statement like no human being has ever walked on the moon

29:08.680 --> 29:12.840
that was a hinge commitment prior to the 1960s these days we think it's simply

29:12.840 --> 29:17.640
false now the trouble here is that it looks like what's happening is that

29:17.640 --> 29:23.280
these hinge commitments are changing as a result of rational evaluation so when I

29:23.280 --> 29:27.040
wake up in the hospital bed with my arms bandaged and I can't feel my hands in

29:27.040 --> 29:30.280
this situation it's perfectly rational for me to doubt whether I still have

29:30.280 --> 29:36.000
hands but it's like okay so I've received evidence which has now cast out

29:36.000 --> 29:40.280
on whether I have hands but but hinge commitments are supposed to be exempt

29:40.280 --> 29:44.240
from doubt exempt from rational justification so how is it possible

29:44.240 --> 29:50.240
for hinge commitments to change in this manner you know that that like giving

29:50.240 --> 29:53.600
up the belief that I have hands in that situation looks like an almost

29:53.600 --> 29:58.600
paradigmatic example of change due to rational evaluation so how does the hinge

29:58.720 --> 30:05.200
epistemologist account for this sort of case well Duncan Prichard has proposed

30:05.200 --> 30:09.880
an approach to hinge epistemology that he argues solves many of these problems

30:09.880 --> 30:15.800
Prichard suggests that all hinge commitments follow from a commitment to

30:15.800 --> 30:20.840
what he calls the uber hinge commitment the uber hinge commitment is the

30:20.840 --> 30:26.840
proposition I am not radically and fundamentally in error this is the

30:26.840 --> 30:31.680
single basic hinge commitment which all people must share other hinge

30:31.680 --> 30:36.480
commitments are merely expressions of this more general uber hinge commitment

30:36.480 --> 30:42.840
they are how the uber hinge commitment manifests in particular contexts suppose

30:42.840 --> 30:46.720
for example that it would you know suppose it would somehow true that I

30:46.720 --> 30:51.320
don't have hands right now as I'm typing the script for this on the computer in

30:51.320 --> 30:54.800
that case I would have to be radically and fundamentally in error something

30:54.800 --> 30:59.240
would have gone deeply wrong with my belief-forming processes but you know I

30:59.240 --> 31:02.440
take it for granted that I'm not radically and fundamentally in error I

31:02.440 --> 31:06.280
have to take this for granted in order to sensibly investigate anything there

31:06.280 --> 31:10.640
would be no point undertaking an investigation if I could not trust my

31:10.640 --> 31:14.720
capacities to investigate but I can only trust my capacities to investigate if

31:14.720 --> 31:19.720
I take it that I'm not radically and fundamentally in error so this uber

31:19.720 --> 31:25.440
hinge commitment grounds the rest of my inquiries the the uber hinge

31:25.440 --> 31:31.080
commitment is universal but of course different circumstances in conjunction

31:31.080 --> 31:35.360
with the uber hinge commitment will lead us to form more specific hinge

31:35.360 --> 31:41.080
commitments my present circumstances lead to the hinge commitment I have hands

31:41.080 --> 31:44.680
but if I were to wake up in the hospital bed my circumstances would be

31:44.680 --> 31:48.840
different so the uber hinge commitment would require different things of me so

31:48.840 --> 31:52.880
this neatly deals with the problem that hinge commitments seem to change over

31:52.880 --> 31:59.320
time right the the uber hinge commitment remains in place so like right now I

31:59.320 --> 32:04.920
have hands that's not open to genuine doubt because to deny that I have hands

32:04.920 --> 32:09.040
I'd have to take myself to be radically and fundamentally in error contrary to

32:09.040 --> 32:13.640
the uber hinge but this need not be the case in all possible

32:13.680 --> 32:18.800
circumstances right there are circumstances where I have hands could be

32:18.800 --> 32:24.440
genuinely doubted but with the uber hinge still in place what what cannot

32:24.440 --> 32:29.440
like what fundamentally cannot be doubted is the the uber hinge Pritchard

32:29.440 --> 32:34.080
argues that this understanding of the histology hinge epistemology allows us

32:34.080 --> 32:38.880
to address the challenge of relativism so the key point is that not just

32:38.880 --> 32:43.680
anything can count as a hinge commitment you know in particular merely

32:43.680 --> 32:47.280
having the attitude of certainty to a proposition does not make it a hinge

32:47.280 --> 32:54.440
commitment our hinge commitments are only those claims that manifest the uber

32:54.440 --> 32:59.080
hinge commitment so I mean in a sense this will still involve a kind of

32:59.080 --> 33:03.200
relativism because there's the universal uber hinge commitment and then other

33:03.200 --> 33:07.000
hinge commitments will be relative to different circumstances but crucially

33:07.000 --> 33:11.240
this does not entail that you know disagreements are going to be rationally

33:11.240 --> 33:15.400
irresolvable so take a case where two people are debating the same topic so

33:15.400 --> 33:19.440
I'm debating whether creationism ought to be taught in schools as an

33:19.440 --> 33:24.280
alternative to the modern evolutionary synthesis the creationist can say that

33:24.280 --> 33:29.120
she is certain of the Bible even so I mean that's not gonna be a hinge

33:29.120 --> 33:35.400
commitment so both myself and the creationist clearly share various

33:35.400 --> 33:39.720
practices these are going to be everyday behaviors like eating food driving

33:39.720 --> 33:44.360
cars and so on I mean we're both concerned with the education system of

33:44.360 --> 33:48.920
the same country so we share a society we share various practices within that

33:48.920 --> 33:54.280
society so we must have a great deal of common ground and of course we both

33:54.280 --> 33:59.160
share the uber hinge commitment we both take it I am not radically and

33:59.160 --> 34:03.680
fundamentally in error but in that case we should expect substantial overlap in

34:03.680 --> 34:07.880
our beliefs in our beliefs about how the external world works in our common sense

34:07.880 --> 34:11.560
beliefs about what we observe on a day-to-day basis so yeah the creationist

34:11.560 --> 34:15.560
can claim to be certain that the Bible is the infallible world of God word of

34:15.560 --> 34:21.240
God but mere certainty does not make something a hinge commitment because

34:21.240 --> 34:27.440
like even so like suppose the Bible turned out not to be the word of God

34:27.440 --> 34:31.880
would this mean that the creationist is radically and fundamentally in error

34:31.880 --> 34:36.280
well no because the vast majority of her beliefs and practices don't actually

34:36.280 --> 34:40.040
have anything to do with the Bible when the creationist gets into a car and

34:40.040 --> 34:43.720
drives to the grocery store her picture of the world is only tangentially related

34:43.720 --> 34:49.280
to the Bible if related at all so that the real sort of challenge of

34:49.280 --> 34:54.720
relativism is the idea that there can be disagreements that cannot be rationally

34:54.720 --> 34:59.120
resolved if if you accept relativism you have to grant that people with

34:59.120 --> 35:02.600
fundamentally different worldviews might be equally rational and that there's

35:02.600 --> 35:07.240
nothing that we can say to them that would compel them at least rationally

35:07.240 --> 35:12.080
compel them to change their minds but on Pritchard's view everybody shares the

35:12.080 --> 35:16.120
same fundamental hinge commitment and everybody shares a variety of practices

35:16.120 --> 35:21.120
which gives us significant common ground so there's no reason to expect that I

35:21.120 --> 35:26.480
would be unable to present evidence to the creationist that would in fact

35:26.520 --> 35:31.280
connect with the creationist's worldview and that would rationally compel the

35:31.280 --> 35:38.680
creationist to agree with me. Appealing to the Uber hinge commitment can also

35:38.680 --> 35:42.200
so appealing to the Uber hinge commitment can resolve the problem of

35:42.200 --> 35:47.160
changing hinges and the problem of relativism what about skepticism this

35:47.160 --> 35:52.520
this big challenge well here we run into the problem that the Uber hinge

35:52.640 --> 35:57.040
commitment is itself held without justification so the hinge epistemologist

35:57.040 --> 36:00.320
is going to need some other way to you know distinguish her view from the

36:00.320 --> 36:06.560
from the skeptic so as as Pritchard sees it skepticism assumes what he calls the

36:06.560 --> 36:11.720
universality of rational evaluation basically the skeptic assumes that

36:11.720 --> 36:16.720
there are universal rational evaluations where all of one's beliefs are

36:16.720 --> 36:22.400
rationally evaluated all at once what the skeptic tries to do is step outside

36:22.520 --> 36:27.040
of all inquiries suspend all presuppositions and give a general

36:27.040 --> 36:32.040
rational evaluation of all of them bringing them all into doubt when the

36:32.040 --> 36:35.920
skeptic says that a particular claim is not justified this is a kind of

36:35.920 --> 36:42.800
rational evaluation. So the skeptical argument like it rests on the claim

36:42.800 --> 36:45.720
that you know if I don't know that I'm not a brain of that I don't know that P

36:45.720 --> 36:49.520
where you know the argument asks us to consider the basis of any beliefs about

36:49.520 --> 36:52.640
the world whether they be everyday beliefs or scientific beliefs or

36:52.640 --> 36:56.360
religious beliefs or anything else you know can can the basis of our beliefs

36:56.360 --> 37:01.000
exclude skeptical scenarios like the brain in the VAT scenario it thereby

37:01.000 --> 37:06.560
seeks a universal rational evaluation of those beliefs by contrast the hinge

37:06.560 --> 37:11.440
epistemologist proposes that hinge commitments are exempt from rational

37:11.440 --> 37:15.920
evaluation in particular the the Uber hinge that Uber hinge commitment is

37:15.920 --> 37:19.800
non-optional it's non-optional because again as we saw in order for me to

37:19.800 --> 37:23.840
perform a rational evaluation I must trust my rational capacities so I must

37:23.840 --> 37:29.000
assume that I'm not radically in error. So it's perfectly legitimate to doubt

37:29.000 --> 37:33.320
particular beliefs in particular contexts where the skeptic goes wrong is

37:33.320 --> 37:38.400
that she tries to generalize this she tries to doubt beliefs across the board

37:38.400 --> 37:43.360
but why suppose that this is legitimate I mean that's a substantive

37:43.360 --> 37:48.400
theoretical assumption that the hinge epistemologist denies so as Pritchard

37:48.400 --> 37:54.080
puts it I quote the locality of our everyday rational evaluations is not an

37:54.080 --> 37:59.160
incidental feature of these practices as if we were merely lacking in time or

37:59.160 --> 38:04.280
imagination but rather essential to what it is to undertake a rational

38:04.280 --> 38:10.160
evaluation. Okay so the skeptic and the hinge epistemologist agree that hinge

38:10.200 --> 38:13.800
commitments are groundless where they disagree is that the skeptic takes it

38:13.800 --> 38:17.160
that we can genuinely doubt such commitments and we can we can perform

38:17.160 --> 38:21.360
this rational evaluation of them but the hinge epistemologist the groundlessness

38:21.360 --> 38:25.200
of such commitments is precisely what shields them from rational evaluation.

38:25.200 --> 38:29.800
I mean in a sense we can so there are two ways that a belief can fail to have

38:29.800 --> 38:34.520
justification it might have no justification because it is unjustified

38:34.520 --> 38:38.720
where you know that's a negative rational evaluation it might have no

38:38.760 --> 38:43.400
justification because it just has no status as either justified or unjustified

38:43.400 --> 38:46.760
and that's what the hinge epistemologist will say of our hinge

38:46.760 --> 38:54.040
commitments. So is that convincing well here's just one worry although it there

38:54.040 --> 38:57.680
are arguments for radical skepticism that target beliefs across the board like

38:57.680 --> 39:01.840
a gripper's trilemma say not all skeptical arguments are intended to be

39:01.840 --> 39:05.480
global this is the case for the skeptical argument that we encountered

39:05.520 --> 39:10.520
earlier in this video which aims to establish external world skepticism it's

39:10.520 --> 39:15.560
not actually obvious in what sense this argument involves a universal rational

39:15.560 --> 39:20.320
evaluation because this argument is only targeting a specific subset of our

39:20.320 --> 39:26.360
beliefs many beliefs such as beliefs about logic about mathematics about my own

39:26.360 --> 39:31.840
mind beliefs about you know our trust in methods of inductive inference and so

39:31.880 --> 39:36.240
on are not actually threatened by scenarios like the brain in the bat

39:36.240 --> 39:42.920
scenario at least not obviously so so we might object that really this is just

39:42.920 --> 39:48.680
another kind of local evaluation like the the external world skeptic does not

39:48.680 --> 39:52.640
have to doubt the uber hinge commitment so I can think that my rational

39:52.640 --> 39:56.200
capacities are perfectly reliable that you know I have a good understanding of

39:56.200 --> 40:00.160
deductive and inductive inference that I can reliably introspect my own mental

40:00.160 --> 40:04.920
states it's just well turns out that the external world is not as it seems to

40:04.920 --> 40:09.720
be so it's not I don't know it's not obvious that that would involve a

40:09.720 --> 40:15.160
doubt of the uber hinge commitment right like maybe we might think that yeah I

40:15.160 --> 40:21.080
can have I can have sort of better reasons so you know you know perception

40:21.080 --> 40:27.320
is is not perfectly reliable obviously right everybody accepts that on the

40:27.320 --> 40:30.840
other hand there are many many other capacities beyond perception that I use

40:30.840 --> 40:35.240
for forming beliefs and maybe those other capacities can cast greater doubt on

40:35.240 --> 40:39.760
perception right why not that seems to be what's going on in the the argument

40:39.760 --> 40:45.400
for external world skepticism now obviously you know a Wittgensteinian

40:45.400 --> 40:50.120
would object to this solipsistic sort of picture but there's the question is

40:50.120 --> 40:52.880
whether there's anything in hinge epistemology in itself that rules this

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
out and certainly if the issue with skepticism is universal is that it tries

40:59.000 --> 41:02.560
to perform a universal rational evaluation it's not clear that that's going

41:02.560 --> 41:09.800
to work as an objection to to external world skepticism all right then well

41:09.800 --> 41:18.120
that was hinge epistemology so I'm gonna leave the video there I hope you

41:18.120 --> 41:27.840
found that interesting and I will see you next time right goodbye
