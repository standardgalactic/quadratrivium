00:00.000 --> 00:06.500
Hello YouTube, in this video I'm going to outline Quine's criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction.

00:06.500 --> 00:10.500
This is one of the central distinctions in philosophy.

00:10.500 --> 00:14.500
And the basic idea of this distinction can be stated quite easily.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.500
So, there are two kinds of propositions.

00:18.500 --> 00:25.500
Analytic propositions are propositions that are true or false in virtue of the meanings of the terms alone.

00:25.500 --> 00:35.000
So, examples include all bachelors are unmarried, if it's raining then it's raining, 2 plus 2 equals 4, triangles have 5 sides.

00:35.000 --> 00:44.000
Then, synthetic propositions are propositions that are true or false partly in virtue of meaning and also partly in virtue of the way the world is.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
So, Frank Zappel is a musician, smoking causes cancer, the sky is green, all philosophers are poor and so on.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
So, you know, it's true that smoking causes cancer.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
Now, this is true partly in virtue of the meanings of the terms.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.500
If the word smoking had referred to running instead, then smoking causes cancer would have been false.

01:05.500 --> 01:09.500
But its truth is also dependent on the facts in the world, right?

01:09.500 --> 01:18.000
So, nothing about like the word smoking in itself entailed that it causes cancer, we might have discovered that smoking prevented cancer.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.500
I mean, indeed it was once thought that smoking had health benefits, right?

01:21.500 --> 01:27.000
So, you know, the world could have turned out that way, but it didn't.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.500
The point is, what makes this sentence true is something about the way the world is.

01:34.500 --> 01:38.500
By contrast, take a statement like, all bachelors are unmarried.

01:38.500 --> 01:42.000
Well, what makes this true is just the meanings of the terms.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Part of what it is to be a bachelor is to be unmarried.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
So, there's no scenario that could render this false, no matter what happens, no matter what way the world turns out to be.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.500
This could not be false.

01:52.500 --> 01:58.500
If you think you can conceive of a bachelor who is married, you just fail to understand the words.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.500
So, this is the basic distinction, right?

02:00.500 --> 02:04.500
Some propositions are true because of what the world is like.

02:04.500 --> 02:13.500
Some propositions are true just because of the meanings of the terms involved, and similarly for false propositions.

02:14.000 --> 02:24.000
Now, this distinction is important because it has been applied to many other topics and problems within philosophy.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
So, many philosophers have thought that if we have some notion of analytic truths,

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
if we have this notion of analyticity, then we can make sense of a priori knowledge,

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
that is, truths that are known independently of experience.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.500
So, we don't need to investigate the world to discover that all bachelors are unmarried.

02:46.500 --> 02:51.500
We can know that all bachelors are unmarried just by understanding the terms in the sentence.

02:51.500 --> 02:55.500
Provided we understand the words, there can be no doubters to its truth.

02:55.500 --> 03:01.500
So, like, analytic truths can be known independent of experience.

03:01.500 --> 03:05.500
For the same reason, analytic truths are necessary.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.500
They could not have been false.

03:07.500 --> 03:13.000
They are true in all possible worlds to use the modern parlance.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Now, this permits a neat account of the truths of logic and mathematics.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Logic and mathematics appear to be a priori disciplines.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
They don't depend on empirical investigation.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
When Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's last theorem, he didn't proceed by deriving predictions from the theorem

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
and then performing experiments.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
That's not generally how mathematics works, right?

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Instead, you work out the consequences of various axioms.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
The truths of logic and mathematics are also necessary.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
There's no possible world in which Fermat's last theorem is false.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
And there's something of a puzzle about how these non-empirical disciplines work, right?

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
There's something kind of strange about the idea that, well, there is something that calls for explanation

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
in that, you know, it seems like there are truths that we can know,

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
but where they're not in any way, you know, we don't know them by performing experiments

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
and they seem to be necessarily true.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
There's a puzzle. What kind of truths are these?

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
And if the truths of logic and mathematics are analytic,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
well, okay, we at least have the beginnings of a solution to this puzzle.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
It's like, okay, we're working out what follows from what in virtue of meaning.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
The analytic synthetic distinction also lays the ground for a substantive role for philosophy.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
For much of the 20th century, it was thought that the basic method of philosophy was conceptual analysis,

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
where this involves trying to specify the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of a concept.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
So take the concept bachelor, for instance.

04:46.000 --> 04:54.000
We might sort of break that down into the concept of, like, not being married and the concept of man.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
So all unmarried men are bachelors and only unmarried men are bachelors.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
A bachelor is an unmarried man.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
And the point is, is that being an unmarried man is necessary and sufficient for being a bachelor.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
Now, bachelor, of course, is not a particularly interesting concept in itself.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
But think about a concept like knowledge.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Much of the literature on knowledge involves conceptual analysis of knowledge.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Traditionally, it was held that knowledge is justified true belief.

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
So we'd say that S knows that P just in case P is true, S believes that P and S is believed that P is justified.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
But this is famously challenged by Getier cases.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
Cases in which a person has justified true belief but does not have knowledge.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
So think about a case where somebody, you know, wakes up in the morning, they go downstairs, they look at the clock,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
it says eight o'clock, and it is in fact eight o'clock.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
So it looks like they have a justified true belief that it's eight o'clock.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
But now imagine that the clock had stopped at eight o'clock the night before.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Well, do they know that it's eight o'clock?

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Arguably not. So we have justified true belief without knowledge.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
So knowledge is not justified true belief.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
And then of course, other epistemologists will try to propose other analyses of knowledge that get around these sorts of cases.

06:17.000 --> 06:26.000
So essentially conceptual analysis of some concept involves proposing the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
and then testing that against our intuitions about various cases.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
You know, we look for cases where the proposed conditions are satisfied but where the concept would not be applied

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
or cases where we would apply the concept but where the conditions are not satisfied.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
There's a lot of philosophy that works in this sort of mould.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
And of course, you know, one very straightforward way to account what's going on here is to say,

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
well, philosophers are investigating the analytic truths, right?

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
They're trying to work out what's true in virtue of meaning.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Now, I mean, look, what I've just said here is all it's very brief.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
And there are many objections we might have to this way of characterising things.

07:07.000 --> 07:16.000
Still, I think that it's reasonably intuitive that there's a gap between the conceptual parts of inquiry,

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
which proceed by investigating meaning and working out what follows from what,

07:22.000 --> 07:29.000
and the empirical parts of inquiry, which require us to perform experiments and make observations of the world.

07:29.000 --> 07:36.000
There seems to be a difference here and the analytic synthetic distinction kind of can underlie this gap

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
between the different areas of inquiry, right?

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
So when we're sort of doing the conceptual stuff, we're dealing with analytic truths

07:45.000 --> 07:51.000
and when we're doing the empirical stuff, we're investigating the synthetic truths.

07:51.000 --> 07:59.000
So, yeah, philosophers have tried to use analyticity to explain notions like a priori knowledge

07:59.000 --> 08:10.000
and necessary truths and maybe even try to create a role for philosophy as a sort of autonomous discipline.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
So this is a very nice picture.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
It's a nice picture, very influential.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.000
But a critique of this was presented by W.B.O. Quine in his paper, Two Dogmas of Empiricism.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Now, Two Dogmas of Empiricism was written primarily in response to logical positivism,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
which is a bit outside the scope of this particular video.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
But the arguments that were given by Quine have obviously been influential beyond this.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
So Quine argues that there is no analytic synthetic distinction.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
There are no statements that are true purely in virtue of meaning.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And of course, this is something to follow.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Well, you know, nothing can be known a priori.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
All statements must in one way or the other be tested against experience.

08:53.000 --> 09:03.000
As Quine sees it, there's no way to isolate some set of substantive truths that are not vulnerable to empirical disconfirmation.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
So in the rest of this video, we're going to outline Quine's arguments.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Alright then.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
So our question is, what exactly is analyticity?

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
So I gave a brief sort of intuitive characterization of the analytic synthetic distinction when I began this video.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
But, you know, we want to define it precisely.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Like, what exactly is analyticity?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
What is it for a statement to be analytic?

09:29.000 --> 09:36.000
Well, the obvious place to begin is by looking at how past philosophers have understood analyticity.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Quine says, he attributes to Kant the following view,

09:41.000 --> 09:53.000
that analytic statements are those which attribute to the subject no more than is already conceptually contained in the subject concept.

09:53.000 --> 10:02.000
So if I say bachelors are unmarried, the predicate concept unmarried is already contained within the subject concept bachelor.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
So anything that's a bachelor must be unmarried, because when I apply this concept bachelor,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
that just is to apply the concept unmarried.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Like one of the things I'm doing when I call something a bachelor is I'm calling it unmarried,

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
because like being unmarried is just contained within the concept of bachelor.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Well, okay, this sounds nice.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
There are a couple of drawbacks to this.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
First of all, this is only going to apply to subject predicate sentences.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
It's not obvious how to extend this characterization of analyticity to other sentences,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
like if it's raining, then water is pouring from the sky.

10:37.000 --> 10:46.000
More seriously, the notion of conceptual containment is not really any better understood than the notion of analyticity.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
This notion of one concept containing another, that's just a metaphor.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
I mean, a concept isn't literally a box into which other concepts might be put.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
So Quine says, well, you know, this doesn't really get us as much further

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
in terms of having a clear characterization of analyticity.

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
Okay, so another attempt then is to say that a statement is analytic

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
just in case its denial results in a contradiction.

11:14.000 --> 11:20.000
So if you take the sentence like bachelors are unmarried,

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
the idea is going to be that if I deny this, if I claim that some bachelors are married,

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
then I have contradicted myself.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Okay, what's the problem with this?

11:31.000 --> 11:40.000
So Alex Miller in his introduction to philosophy of language suggests that we can kind of distinguish between two senses of contradiction.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
First of all, there's a purely syntactic notion of contradiction.

11:44.000 --> 11:52.000
In this case, a statement is self-contradictory only if it has the syntactic form p and not p.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
So if I say Frank is a bachelor and it is not the case that Frank is a bachelor,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
that would be an example of a syntactic contradiction.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Now this notion is perfectly well understood.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
We have no problem formalizing statements and identifying logical contradictions in this sense.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
The trouble is that in many cases, denying an analytic truth is not going to take this form.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
So if I claim that Frank is a married bachelor,

12:20.000 --> 12:28.000
I realize that I'm looking at my slides here and I've messed up because that should say,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
second, there is a broader sense of contradiction which includes statements such as,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Frank is a married bachelor.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
So just flip that in your head.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
So Frank is a married bachelor.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.000
This is supposed to be an example of the second sort of contradiction.

12:46.000 --> 12:53.000
If I claim that Frank is a married bachelor, that statement does not have the syntactic form p and not p.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
So if this is a contradiction, we must be assuming some broader notion of contradiction.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
This isn't just a purely syntactic contradiction.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
So corresponding to these two notions of contradiction,

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
Quine distinguishes two classes of analytic statement.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.000
So analytic statements of the first class are logical truths,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
and we identify these purely in virtue of their syntactic form.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
What makes these statements true are the arrangement of their purely logical terms.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
So these are terms like all, some, not, and if, then, etc.

13:29.000 --> 13:37.000
These are the terms that we would use when describing the logical operators basically.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
When we're dealing with logical truths,

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
we can give any interpretation we like of the non-logical terms.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
So I say all unmarried men are unmarried,

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
and then we can sort of put this in slightly more formal notation as,

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
for all x, if ux, then ux.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
It doesn't matter how you interpret the terms unmarried and men here.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
You can have any interpretation of those that you like.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
This is going to come out as being true.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
This is true just as a matter of logic.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Quine accepts this notion,

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
but then there are analytic statements of the second class,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
and these are more problematic.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
So when I say all bachelors are unmarried,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
or all vixens are female foxes,

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
well, these are not true in virtue of syntactic form alone.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.000
These are not true in virtue of their sort of surface logical form.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
So what exactly is it that makes them true?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Now notice, of course, that it's going to be analytic statements of the second class

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
that are of interest to philosophers.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
When we propose a conceptual analysis, for instance,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
such as that knowledge is justified through belief,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
that's an analytic statement of the second class.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
It's not just a trivial truth of logical form.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
So the question is,

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
how do we make sense of analytic statements of the second class?

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
Well, initial idea that Quine considers is to appeal to synonymy.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
So here's the idea.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
We can say that an analytic truth, p is an analytic truth,

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
just in case either, one, p is a logical truth,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
or two, p can be transformed into a logical truth

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
by substituting synonymous terms.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
So this is going to be, if it's a logical truth,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
it's an analytic statement of the first class.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
If it can be transformed into a logical truth by substituting synonymous terms,

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
it's an analytic statement of the second class.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
So basically via synonymy,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
we can transform analytic statements of the second class

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
into analytic statements of the first class.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Let's say I take all female foxes are vixens.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
The idea is that the word vixen is synonymous with female fox.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
So we can replace female fox in that initial sentence

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
to get all vixens are vixens,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
which is just a straightforward logical truth.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
And that's going to remain true no matter how you interpret the statement vixen.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
No matter what vixens refers to, that's going to be true.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
So there we have it.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Similarly, if you take all bachelors are unmarried

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
by substituting synonyms for synonyms,

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
we get all unmarried men are unmarried, a logical truth.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
We can make all bachelors are unmarried into a logical truth

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
by substituting synonyms for synonyms.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
But now, what exactly is it for two terms to be synonymous?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
What is synonymy?

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
I mean clearly, when we have two synonymous terms,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
they're not exactly the same, right?

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
So we're not dealing with a sort of complete identity

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
of all of the things that we might call meaning,

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
such as, as Quine says, psychological associations or poetic quality.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
In that sense, vixen and female fox are clearly not synonymous.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
They're not exactly identical in terms of poetic quality.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
So, okay, what the hell is synonymy then?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Well, it seems simple enough.

17:03.000 --> 17:09.000
Two terms are synonymous, just in case those terms have the same definition.

17:09.000 --> 17:17.000
So, now we're appealing to the idea that there is a correct definition of terms, right?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
If we say that two terms have the same definition,

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
and we can say that they're synonymous,

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
and then we can use that to ground this notion of analyticity.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Now, Quine does grant that in one context,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
this idea of correct definition is perfectly acceptable.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
And this is where we give stipulative definitions.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
So suppose that I introduce the abbreviation ff,

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
and I just stipulate that ff abbreviates female fox.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Well, I mean, this doesn't, you know,

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
I'm not appealing to any prior notion of analyticity or synonymy

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
or sameness of meaning or anything like that.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
I'm just stipulating an abbreviation.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
I'm saying like, okay, I'm going to adopt a convention

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
that any use of the words female fox can be substituted for ff.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
I mean, just imagine like, you know, you're sort of, I don't know,

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
writing down a speech or something like that.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
And then as you're writing it down,

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
when the person says female fox, you just write it as ff, just for convenience.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
So, you know, I can say all female foxes are ffs,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
and then transform that into all female foxes are female foxes,

18:26.000 --> 18:33.000
because the term ff is just stipulated as an abbreviation for female fox.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
The problem is that most analytic truths are not supposed to be mere

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
stipulative definitions.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
I mean, in fact, most definitions are not mere stipulative definitions.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
So, when I propose a definition of the word vixen,

18:49.000 --> 18:55.000
I'm not just stipulating that it abbreviates female fox.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
No, I have to think about how that word is used.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I have to think about what the word means.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
You know, in this case, the language already exists.

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
I'm saying something about meanings that are pre-existent within a language, right?

19:12.000 --> 19:17.000
Like, we have this, so we have this language already, which has the word vixen,

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
and it has the expression female fox.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
And I'm saying, you know, vixen means female fox.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
That's something I'm working out, I'm not stipulating it.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
So, Quine says, in this kind of case, giving a definition of a term

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
can't explain synonymy because it presupposes synonymy, right?

19:36.000 --> 19:42.000
What it is to define some term a as b is to suppose that a and b are synonymous.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
So think about, like, I don't know, the process of writing a dictionary.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
When you do that, you might make an error, right?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I mean, you know, you could get it wrong.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
If all definitions were just stipulative definitions,

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
it would make no sense to speak of an error here.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
When you stipulate that ff abbreviates female fox,

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
you can't be wrong about that.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
It's not like, you know, you haven't made some mistake.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
But a dictionary, well, that can obviously contain errors, that can contain mistakes.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
So, you know, when we're giving a definition,

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
we're trying to stake the meanings that are implicit in some prior usage of the word.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
And that means it's not a stipulation.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
It's going to presuppose synonymy.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
Now, there is a worry about this part of Quine's argument,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
because you might say, well, you know, hang on a minute.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
Quine is granting that there is such a thing as synonymy.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Synonymy occurs in stipulative definitions.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
Moreover, Quine seems to grant that if there is synonymy,

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
then we can define analyticity in terms of it.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
We can say that the analytic truths of the second class

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
are those that can be transformed into analytic truths of the first class

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
by substituting synonymous terms.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
So, you know, we've got synonymy,

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
we've got the link between synonymy and analyticity.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
What more do you want?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
It seems strange that Quine grants all of this,

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
but then goes on to deny the analytic synthetic distinction.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
And I guess to push the point further, we might say,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
if there is this property of synonymy,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
and this property can be created by stipulative definition,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
why can't it be created in other ways?

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
So, I think to be clear, the problem as Quine sees it

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
is that stipulative definitions are just these sort of devices of convenience.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
We can dot them or drop them without altering our theories,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
without any kind of epistemic loss.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
I mean, again, you know, it's like I'm just sort of copying a speech,

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
and then I just introduce a new symbol.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
And that's all I'm doing.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
And maybe this does give us some kind of analyticity,

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
but it's not going to be a kind that can do any important philosophical work.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
You know, remember, philosophers don't just draw this distinction

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
between analytic and synthetic truths, like just for its own sake.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
They see this distinction as doing important work,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
such as explaining a priori knowledge,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
or explaining necessary truths,

22:04.000 --> 22:09.000
or providing some foundation for logical, mathematical, and philosophical inquiry.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
A mere stipulative definition is not going to bear this weight.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
So, I do think, you know, Quine is,

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
he's at times sort of a little bit unclear about the,

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
about how force, about maybe how general his thesis is supposed to be, right?

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
Because on the one hand, you know, he denies the analytic synthetic distinction,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
but then he does just kind of grant for the sake of argument

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
that there are analytic truths of the first class.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
So there is a kind of analyticity that he's granting.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
And similarly, you know, he grants the, okay, yeah,

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
you know, you can have stipulative definitions.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
But I think the important thing to see

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
is that analytic truths of the first class,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
stipulative definitions, this sort of thing,

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
this isn't going to do the work that philosophers have put

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
the analytic synthetic distinction to, right?

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
You know, they're using this distinction for certain purposes.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
And we're not going to be able to get that out of the,

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
the sort of trivial kinds of analyticity that Quine is just granting.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
You know, when philosophers debate about the correct analysis of knowledge,

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
they're not just stipulating some, you know,

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
some abbreviation for the term knowledge, right?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
Okay, when I say, you know, vixen is synonymous with female fox,

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I'm not just stipulating a definition.

23:25.000 --> 23:32.000
So Quine concludes, well, this appeal to definition

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
is really not going to help, right?

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
Because you're either going to end up talking about

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
stipulative definitions, which are just too trivial

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
to do the sorts of work that we're wanting,

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
or you're going to end up presupposing synonymy.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
So you haven't explained synonymy,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
you're just going to end up presupposing it.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Okay then, quick advert.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
If you like my videos, you can support me on Patreon.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
And if you check out my Patreon, there is,

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
there's a lot of bonus content there.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
If you sign up to the Hume tier, there's a bunch of

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
bonus videos available, so you can experience more of me.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
Most of them are sort of further thoughts on the topics

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
that I talk about in these videos.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
I also have a PayPal if you just want to send a one-off donation.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
Obviously, every little helps, it really does.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I offer private tutoring in philosophy.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
I have a degree, a master's and a PhD in philosophy,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
so I'm more than qualified to do that.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Send an email if you're interested, and I have a Discord.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
The link to all of this stuff will be in the description.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
Okay then, let's move on.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
So, synonymy doesn't work, Quine says.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
So he then turns to another idea, another suggestion,

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
which is, or might say, that two expressions are synonymous,

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
just in case they are interchangeable, salva veritate.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
What the hell does this mean?

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
Well, the idea is, is that one expression can be replaced

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
with the other expression without altering the truth value

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
of the sentences in which those expressions occur.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
So if I take vixen and female fox, the idea is,

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
well, any sentence containing the term vixen,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
in any sentence which has that term,

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
this term can be replaced with the phrase female fox

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
without changing the truth value of the sentence,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
and vice versa.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
So if I take verity is a vixen,

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I can change that to verity is a female fox,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
and these are going to be true under the same conditions.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
So the same conditions under which verity is a vixen is true

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
will be the conditions under which verity is a female fox is true.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
No matter how we alter the world,

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
these are going to have the same truth value.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
Or vixens have four legs,

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
to female foxes have four legs,

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
again, true under the same conditions.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
There are vixens on Mars,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
there are female foxes on Mars,

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
true under the same conditions.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Hunting vixens ought to be banned,

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
hunting female foxes ought to be banned,

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
true under the same conditions,

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
and so on and so on for any sentence.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
So for any sentence of the language,

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
we can sort of switch these terms out,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
and they're going to be true under the same conditions.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
And of course that's not the case

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
for just any pair of terms, obviously.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
So verity is a vixen,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
replace vixen with the term bachelor.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Verity is a vixen, verity is a bachelor.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
These are not true under the same conditions.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
One can be true and the other can be false.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
But this is not the case with vixen and female fox.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
It can't be that one of these sentences is true

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
and the other one is false.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
Now there are immediate limitations to this idea.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
So take for instance the statement,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
vixen has five letters.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
That's true.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Female fox has five letters,

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
well that's false.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Now Quine does point out,

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
well you can get around this pretty straightforwardly

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
by appealing to a use-mention distinction, right?

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
When I say that vixen has five letters,

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
the word vixen is mentioned not used.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I'm not actually using the word vixen.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
So the idea is that when we can treat

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
vixen enclosed in quotation marks

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
as a new word which refers to the word vixen.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
So when I say vixen has five letters,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
I'm mentioning the word vixen.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I'm essentially using a new word

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
that's constructed by enclosing vixen in quotation marks

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
to refer to the word vixen

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
and then I'm talking about the properties of that word.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
I mean I could just as well say that the word fred

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
refers to the word vixen

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
and then I could say fred has five letters

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
and that would be true if we've stipulated

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
that fred is referring to vixen,

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
the word vixen, right?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
fred is referring to the word vixen.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
So when I say fred has five letters,

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
that's like a name.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
That's a name for the word vixen.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Similarly, when I enclose vixen in quotation marks

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
and I say quote, quote, vixen, end quote,

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
has five letters, right?

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
When I say that, I'm using this vixen

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
enclosed in quotation marks as a name for the word vixen.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
So of course, we can't then substitute it for female fox

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
because it's a new word.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
So this is not a counter-example

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
to interchangeability salva veritate.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
A more serious concern, though, raised by Quine

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
is that whether two expressions

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
are interchangeable salva veritate

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
depends on the expressive resources

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
of the language that we're dealing with.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
So take the phrases creature with heart

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
and creature with kidneys.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
These phrases have the same extension.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
That is to say, they pick out the same things

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
in the actual world.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
So as a matter of fact,

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
any creature that has a heart

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
is also a creature with a kidney.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
So consider the following statements, right?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
All creatures with hearts are creatures with hearts.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
All creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Both of these statements are true.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
Now, if our language contains only the resources

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
to refer to the actual world,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
then creature with heart and creature with kidney

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
will be interchangeable salva veritate.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
So if you imagine a language where, like,

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
it's a sort of simple language

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
and all the language can do

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
is just refer to, like, concrete objects

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
in the actual world.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
So, you know, I have the ability to talk about, like,

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
the table, the cup,

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
the creature with a heart,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
the creature with a kidney.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
But, like, that's it.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
You know, I can't talk about what might have been

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
or could have been.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I can't talk about what people believe

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
to be the case or anything like that.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
Like, all I can do is just refer to objects

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
and attribute properties to them.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
And the objects in the actual world.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
You know, no fiction, no imagination, nothing like that.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Just...

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
I'm just talking about the objects that actually exist.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
In this language,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
creature with heart and creature with kidneys

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
will be interchangeable because, in fact,

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
So clearly, interchangeability in this language

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
is not going to be sufficient to explain analyticity.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
We don't want to say that it's an analytic truth

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
that all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
So, you know, this is going to be a problem

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
if we're just dealing with this...

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
if we're dealing with this, you know,

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
somewhat impoverished language.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
Interchangeability in this kind of language isn't sufficient.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
Because the interchangeability of the terms in this language

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
rests on matters of fact, not on meaning.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
So, okay, let's say we add some more predicates to our language.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
Suppose we add modal operators.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
So we're now able to say things like,

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
necessarily, all creatures with hearts are creatures with hearts.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
Necessarily, all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Well, the first statement here is true.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
The second is false.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
It's true that necessarily all creatures with hearts are creatures with hearts.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
False that necessarily all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.

31:33.000 --> 31:39.000
So, by substituting the term creature with hearts in this case,

31:39.000 --> 31:43.000
we do not have interchangeability, Salva Veritate.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Had evolution taken a different path,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
then perhaps there could have been creatures with hearts

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
that are not creatures with kidneys.

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
So we've introduced modal terms in our language,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
terms like necessarily and possibly,

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
terms for describing how things must have been

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
or how things could have been.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
And in that case, the expressions

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
creature with heart and creature with kidneys

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
are no longer interchangeable Salva Veritate.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
By contrast, it looks like we preserve the interchangeability

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
of vixen and female fox.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
So, you know, compare necessarily all vixens of vixens,

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
necessarily all vixens are female foxes.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
Well, yeah, that's still true, right?

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
So, if we had a good grasp of this term necessarily,

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
then perhaps we could say that two expressions are synonymous,

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
just in case they are necessarily interchangeable Salva Veritate.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
The trouble, as far as Quine is concerned,

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
is that we have no better understanding of necessity

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
and these other modal notions than we do of analyticity.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Indeed, remember, as we noted at the beginning,

32:49.000 --> 32:54.000
part of the work that philosophers are using

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
the analytic synthetic distinction for

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
was to explain necessary truths.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
So, like, necessity is explained in terms of analyticity,

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
in which case we can't presuppose necessity

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
in order to explain analyticity.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
Now, I mean, of course, these days,

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
we might challenge Quine's argument here,

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
the development of modal logic and possible world semantics

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
has, as far as most philosophers are concerned,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
given as a solid foundation

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
for understanding these sorts of modal claims.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
But, you know, this is the problem, right?

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Like, as far as Quine is concerned,

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
well, appealing to necessity, right?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
Well, one of the problems, right?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
One problem here is this appeal to necessity

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
isn't really going to help

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
because necessity is no better understood than analyticity is.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
Analyticity is supposed to explain necessity.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
And it might actually be worth noting

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
that even if we did grant this prior understanding of necessity,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
there are actually other contexts

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
that are going to raise trouble for the interchangeability criterion.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
So, suppose I say,

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
Sydney believes that there is a female fox in his garden

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
versus Sydney believes that there's a vixen in his garden.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
Now, suppose that Sydney is unaware

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
that vixens are female foxes.

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
Sydney thinks that vixen is a term for female stoats.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Then, arguably, it may be true

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
that Sydney has the belief

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
there is a female fox in my garden,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
but false that Sydney has the belief

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
there is a vixen in my garden.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I mean, if you were to ask Sydney, like,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
okay, do you think there's a vixen in your garden?

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
He'd say no.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Do you think there's a female fox in your garden?

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
He'd say yes.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And, you know, I mean,

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
appealing to necessity doesn't really seem to help

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
with this kind of case.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
In fact, you know, if you have,

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
you could have a sort of more impoverished language,

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
which does not have modal operators,

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
but as long as it's got the, you know, the belief operator,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
as long as we can refer to people's beliefs,

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
well, now it looks like interchangeability fails here.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
Because we want to say that vixen is synonymous with female fox,

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
but they're not interchangeable salveratate.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
That might be a worry.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
Like, okay, so, yeah, this is a concern.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
The general point is this, right?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
If we consider a simple language that's purely extensional,

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
but only describes the actual matters of fact,

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
interchangeability cannot define analyticity,

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
because any co-referring terms will be interchangeable.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
If the language contains operators like necessarily,

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
well, yeah, in that case, interchangeability might be sufficient,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
but we don't understand necessity,

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
so we're no further in an explanation of analyticity.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
And of course, if the language contains, you know, belief operators,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
then it seems again that interchangeability no longer works.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.000
So interchangeability, like whether or not two terms are interchangeable,

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
depends on the expressive resources of the language in question.

35:44.000 --> 35:50.000
Okay, Quine then moves on to a final suggestion.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
Perhaps the problem here is ordinary language.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
Natural languages are vague and messy,

35:59.000 --> 36:03.000
and it can be unclear where to draw the lines between different concepts.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
So we have this intuitive grasp of the analytic synthetic distinction,

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
but maybe it's unsurprising that a precise characterization of this distinction

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
would be unavailable for ordinary languages.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
We can perhaps gain greater clarity by proposing an artificial language

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
with explicit semantical rules.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
So think about, you know, propositional logic with its precise vocabulary

36:25.000 --> 36:30.000
and logical operators whose behavior is precisely defined according to the truth tables.

36:30.000 --> 36:36.000
So, you know, we construct a new language, an artificial language,

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
where we just lay down the rules of the language.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
Now according to Quine, analyticity is going to remain unclear,

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
even if we just consider the artificial languages.

36:48.000 --> 36:53.000
Okay, so the most straightforward way to appeal to semantic rules here

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
is to think about a formal language that explicitly specifies all of its analytic statements.

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
So imagine a set of rules where the rules just tell us directly

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
which statements count as analytic and which count as synthetic.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
Quine says, well, this isn't going to help us understand analyticity.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
In a language with such rules, we can understand what statements,

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
the rules, attribute analyticity to,

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
but we won't by this method understand what analyticity is.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Indeed, there won't really be anything that analyticity is,

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
just from a set of rules that say these things are analytic.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
I mean, like, if I just introduce some new word, you know, phlob, right,

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
and you don't know what, like, and you don't have an understanding of what phlob is,

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
and then I say, well, look, I've got this artificial language,

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
and the artificial language has these rules which, you know, distinguish,

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
okay, these are the phlob statements, these are the non-phlob statements.

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
That's useless, right, that doesn't help you understand phlob at all.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
Something, in the case of analyticity, right, think about, you know,

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
you could have an artificial language where there's just some rule which says,

38:03.000 --> 38:08.000
a statement s is analytic for l, just in case s contains at least 10 letters.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
I mean, nothing stops you from constructing an artificial language

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
and then just having that as one of the rules of the language.

38:16.000 --> 38:21.000
And you would have a very straightforward way of identifying the analytic statements

38:21.000 --> 38:25.000
within that language, but clearly this is an unusual use of the term analytic.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000
It has nothing to do with the analytic synthetic distinction as philosophers have used it.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
You know, it doesn't have anything to do with the analytic, synthetic distinction

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
in the intuitive sense that we explained at the beginning of this video.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
But, you know, maybe this is a bit too simplistic.

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
So, instead of using semantic rules to specify the analytic statements directly,

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
there's an alternative way to approach this.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
We might say, well, look, a language is going to contain semantic rules

38:53.000 --> 38:58.000
which tell us that certain statements must be among the truths.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
So, certain statements are among the truths.

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
The rules, these rules are not going to appeal to some prior understanding of analyticity.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.000
They just stipulate certain statements of the language that are true.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
So, we just postulate certain truths.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
So, all we need is the notion of truth.

39:16.000 --> 39:22.000
For instance, a semantic rule in an artificial language like this based on classical logic

39:22.000 --> 39:28.000
might be all statements of the form not p and not p are true.

39:28.000 --> 39:35.000
Or maybe, you know, if p is false, then if p then q is true.

39:35.000 --> 39:40.000
Now, these rules do not tell us all of the truths of the language.

39:40.000 --> 39:46.000
They specify a class of statements that are to count as true.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
And having stipulated certain truths within the language that we can then take for granted,

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
we can then apply the language in other areas of inquiry and, you know,

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
work out what other things are true within the language and so on.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
But, maybe we can now characterize analyticity by saying,

40:01.000 --> 40:06.000
a statement s is analytic for l, just in case s is not just true,

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
but true according to the semantic rules of l.

40:10.000 --> 40:17.000
We might have an artificial language with the rule that not p and not p is true,

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
from which it follows that it is not the case that there are unicorns

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
and there are no unicorns is true.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
Or consider a language for describing colours.

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
We might stipulate as a rule of this language that objects can only have one colour

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
in the same respect from the same perspective.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.000
So, you know, this language attributes to each surface one colour and one colour only.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
And it follows from this that the statement,

40:43.000 --> 40:49.000
nothing is both red all over and green all over at the same time is true.

40:49.000 --> 40:54.000
So, you know, this kind of thing is presumably only going to work for artificial languages.

40:54.000 --> 41:00.000
Natural languages, you know, I mean, don't appear to have explicitly stated semantic rules like this,

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
but even in the context of artificial languages, there is a problem.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
What exactly counts as a semantic rule?

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
We don't want to say that every true statement which says that some statements are true

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
counts as a semantic rule, because otherwise, literally all of the truths in the language

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
would come out as analytic.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
For instance, it's true that there are eight planets.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
So now imagine I was to just say, well, it's a semantic, here's a semantic rule.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
The sentence, there are eight planets is true.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Okay, surely this doesn't count as a semantic rule,

41:33.000 --> 41:39.000
because otherwise we could, we could just have a semantic rule for every true sentence,

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
and then every true sentence would, would end up being analytic.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
So the difficulty is how do we distinguish the genuine semantic rules,

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
rules like all statements of the form not p and not p are true.

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
How do we distinguish those from these kind of artificial gerrymandered semantic rules?

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
Like the statement, there are eight planets is true.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
What's the difference?

42:06.000 --> 42:12.000
The general problem here is that if we're constructing an artificial language,

42:12.000 --> 42:18.000
then in principle, we can, we can just take any statements we like as the basic postulates.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
So we can actually just postulate that there are eight planets is true.

42:23.000 --> 42:29.000
On the other hand, if we're investigating a language that already exists, like English,

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
well, how, yeah, I mean, how do we tell which statements count as postulates?

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I mean, there's not, it doesn't look like there's any facts of the matter.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
As Quine says, any finite selection of statements, preferably true ones perhaps,

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
is as much a set of postulates as any other.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
And that's the case regardless of whether we're dealing with, with natural languages or artificial languages.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
So Quine says that we have gotten no further here.

42:50.000 --> 43:00.000
I mean, obviously the natural, the natural answer to like what distinguishes a genuine semantic rule from a merely artificial one is going to be something about,

43:00.000 --> 43:03.000
well, the meanings of the terms.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
But then that's presupposing analyticity.

43:06.000 --> 43:16.000
So Quine summarizes semantical rules determining the analytic statements of an artificial language are of interest only in so far as we already understand the notion of analyticity.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
They are of no help in gaining this understanding.

43:20.000 --> 43:29.000
So Quine concludes that we have no way of drawing the distinction between analytic and synthetic truths.

43:29.000 --> 43:39.000
The general idea of his argument is that the term analytic is one of a circle of terms where if any one of those terms could be adequately understood,

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
then we could define the others in terms of it.

43:42.000 --> 43:50.000
So there's terms like self contradictory, necessarily synonymous, definition, semantic rule.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
The problem is none of these terms have been adequately explained.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
Any attempt to explain one of them will end up appealing to the other terms in the circle.

43:57.000 --> 44:05.000
So, you know, to explain analyticity, we appeal to synonymy, to explain synonymy, we appeal to necessity, to explain necessity, we appeal to analyticity.

44:05.000 --> 44:15.000
So at some point we always end up either bottoming out in some just, you know, vague term that's poorly understood, or we circle back around to analyticity itself.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
So we end up, you know, it ends up becoming circular.

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
None of these concepts have been shown to be capable of bearing the weight that philosophers have placed on them.

44:24.000 --> 44:34.000
And as far as Quine is concerned, there's no reason to think that there is actually a distinction between the analytic and the synthetic.

44:34.000 --> 44:48.000
Now, it's worth noting before we end that many philosophers have taken Quine's argument to have the fairly radical consequence that there actually just isn't any such thing as the meaning of a sentence.

44:48.000 --> 44:55.000
In fact, in later work, Quine himself is explicit that he, you know, he's sort of attacking the very notion of meaning.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
It's not just that there are no sentences that are true in virtue of meaning.

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
It's that there's no such thing as like the meaning of a sentence, period.

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
See my videos on Quine's arguments for the indeterminacy of meaning for more on this.

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
But with respect to the analytic-synthetic distinction, here's the reason in brief.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
Suppose that sentences have meanings.

45:17.000 --> 45:25.000
In their response to Quine, Gries and Strausson point out that this would allow a very straightforward definition of synonymy.

45:25.000 --> 45:38.000
As follows, we could say two sentences are synonymous if and only if any true answer to the question, what does it mean, asked of one of them, is a true answer to the same question asked of the other.

45:38.000 --> 45:46.000
So if you take verity as a vixen and verity as a female fox, right, ask for each of these sentences, what does it mean?

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
The correct answer will be the same in both cases.

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
So two sentences are synonymous just in case they mean the same thing.

45:53.000 --> 45:59.000
And with this, you know, we break into the circle of terms and can define analyticity.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
Of course, Quine is going to say, well, we can't do that.

46:03.000 --> 46:08.000
If we give up analyticity, then we seem to have to give up sentence meaning.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
At the very least, we have to give up the idea that there is a determinate fact of a matter about the meaning of a sentence.

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
Now, in practice, we might well ask the question, what does it mean of two different sentences?

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
And we might give the same answer each time.

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
But on Quine's view, we can't say that this answer is correct or incorrect.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
When we talk about the meaning of a sentence, that's going to be more like a useful fiction or an idealization.

46:31.000 --> 46:38.000
Indeed, as far as Quine is concerned, the sort of unit of meaning is an entire language or an entire theory of the world.

46:38.000 --> 46:46.000
Some sentences are more resistant to refutation than others, but it's the whole theory that is tested against experience.

46:46.000 --> 46:54.000
And there's no sharp line between synthetic statements that can be refuted and analytic statements that are true come what may.

46:54.000 --> 47:00.000
And there's no determinate fact of the matter about what a sentence means.

47:00.000 --> 47:11.000
For any sentence, its truth is going to be, the kind of conceptual and the empirical is intertwined.

47:11.000 --> 47:20.000
For any sentence, the truth is going to be a matter of meaning and the matter of fact,

47:20.000 --> 47:33.000
but where we are not going to be able to identify or sort of isolate the meaning of the sentence independently of this sentence's role in the whole theory.

47:33.000 --> 47:42.000
It was noting as well that Quine's argument also threatens the idea of logical truths, what Quine called analytic statements of the first class.

47:42.000 --> 47:56.000
We noted that Quine does not object to logical truths. He grants in his argument that if we could define synonymy, then we could say that an analytic truth is any statement that can be transformed into a logical truth by substituting synonymous terms.

47:56.000 --> 48:09.000
So he seems to, at least in his article, he's granting logical truth, but we might think well actually there's a bit of a problem here, because let's take logical truth of the form for all x if vx then vx,

48:09.000 --> 48:23.000
or for all x if x is a vixen then x is a vixen or more colloquially all vixens are vixens. That's an instance of a logical truth, but this only works if each instance of vixen has the same meaning.

48:23.000 --> 48:36.000
Right, so if the first token of vixen means female foxes and the second token of vixen means attractive women, then obviously this statement is false.

48:36.000 --> 48:44.000
So ordinarily we would say that this kind of thing isn't a counter example to logical truth because it would be equivocating on the term vixen.

48:45.000 --> 48:53.000
When we characterize logical truths, we have to specify that different tokens of the same expressions have the same meaning.

48:53.000 --> 49:05.000
It must be that the first token of vixen is synonymous with the second token of vixen. Without sameness of meaning, it's not quite so obvious how we are to understand logical truth.

49:05.000 --> 49:12.000
So maybe Quine's argument is a bit more radical than even he initially intended.

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
And with that said, I'm going to leave that video there.

49:16.000 --> 49:23.000
Those were Quine's arguments against the analytic synthetic distinction.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.000
And that's all for today. Thanks for watching. Bye!
