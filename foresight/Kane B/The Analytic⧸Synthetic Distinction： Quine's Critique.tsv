0	6500	Hello YouTube, in this video I'm going to outline Quine's criticism of the analytic-synthetic distinction.
6500	10500	This is one of the central distinctions in philosophy.
10500	14500	And the basic idea of this distinction can be stated quite easily.
14500	18500	So, there are two kinds of propositions.
18500	25500	Analytic propositions are propositions that are true or false in virtue of the meanings of the terms alone.
25500	35000	So, examples include all bachelors are unmarried, if it's raining then it's raining, 2 plus 2 equals 4, triangles have 5 sides.
35000	44000	Then, synthetic propositions are propositions that are true or false partly in virtue of meaning and also partly in virtue of the way the world is.
44000	51000	So, Frank Zappel is a musician, smoking causes cancer, the sky is green, all philosophers are poor and so on.
51000	55000	So, you know, it's true that smoking causes cancer.
55000	59000	Now, this is true partly in virtue of the meanings of the terms.
59000	65500	If the word smoking had referred to running instead, then smoking causes cancer would have been false.
65500	69500	But its truth is also dependent on the facts in the world, right?
69500	78000	So, nothing about like the word smoking in itself entailed that it causes cancer, we might have discovered that smoking prevented cancer.
78000	81500	I mean, indeed it was once thought that smoking had health benefits, right?
81500	87000	So, you know, the world could have turned out that way, but it didn't.
87000	94500	The point is, what makes this sentence true is something about the way the world is.
94500	98500	By contrast, take a statement like, all bachelors are unmarried.
98500	102000	Well, what makes this true is just the meanings of the terms.
102000	105000	Part of what it is to be a bachelor is to be unmarried.
105000	111000	So, there's no scenario that could render this false, no matter what happens, no matter what way the world turns out to be.
111000	112500	This could not be false.
112500	118500	If you think you can conceive of a bachelor who is married, you just fail to understand the words.
118500	120500	So, this is the basic distinction, right?
120500	124500	Some propositions are true because of what the world is like.
124500	133500	Some propositions are true just because of the meanings of the terms involved, and similarly for false propositions.
134000	144000	Now, this distinction is important because it has been applied to many other topics and problems within philosophy.
144000	150000	So, many philosophers have thought that if we have some notion of analytic truths,
150000	156000	if we have this notion of analyticity, then we can make sense of a priori knowledge,
156000	161000	that is, truths that are known independently of experience.
161000	166500	So, we don't need to investigate the world to discover that all bachelors are unmarried.
166500	171500	We can know that all bachelors are unmarried just by understanding the terms in the sentence.
171500	175500	Provided we understand the words, there can be no doubters to its truth.
175500	181500	So, like, analytic truths can be known independent of experience.
181500	185500	For the same reason, analytic truths are necessary.
185500	187500	They could not have been false.
187500	193000	They are true in all possible worlds to use the modern parlance.
193000	198000	Now, this permits a neat account of the truths of logic and mathematics.
198000	201000	Logic and mathematics appear to be a priori disciplines.
201000	203000	They don't depend on empirical investigation.
203000	209000	When Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's last theorem, he didn't proceed by deriving predictions from the theorem
209000	211000	and then performing experiments.
211000	213000	That's not generally how mathematics works, right?
213000	216000	Instead, you work out the consequences of various axioms.
216000	220000	The truths of logic and mathematics are also necessary.
220000	224000	There's no possible world in which Fermat's last theorem is false.
224000	230000	And there's something of a puzzle about how these non-empirical disciplines work, right?
230000	237000	There's something kind of strange about the idea that, well, there is something that calls for explanation
237000	241000	in that, you know, it seems like there are truths that we can know,
241000	247000	but where they're not in any way, you know, we don't know them by performing experiments
247000	249000	and they seem to be necessarily true.
249000	252000	There's a puzzle. What kind of truths are these?
252000	255000	And if the truths of logic and mathematics are analytic,
255000	259000	well, okay, we at least have the beginnings of a solution to this puzzle.
259000	265000	It's like, okay, we're working out what follows from what in virtue of meaning.
265000	272000	The analytic synthetic distinction also lays the ground for a substantive role for philosophy.
272000	277000	For much of the 20th century, it was thought that the basic method of philosophy was conceptual analysis,
277000	283000	where this involves trying to specify the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of a concept.
283000	286000	So take the concept bachelor, for instance.
286000	294000	We might sort of break that down into the concept of, like, not being married and the concept of man.
294000	299000	So all unmarried men are bachelors and only unmarried men are bachelors.
299000	302000	A bachelor is an unmarried man.
302000	307000	And the point is, is that being an unmarried man is necessary and sufficient for being a bachelor.
307000	312000	Now, bachelor, of course, is not a particularly interesting concept in itself.
312000	315000	But think about a concept like knowledge.
315000	321000	Much of the literature on knowledge involves conceptual analysis of knowledge.
321000	325000	Traditionally, it was held that knowledge is justified true belief.
325000	334000	So we'd say that S knows that P just in case P is true, S believes that P and S is believed that P is justified.
334000	337000	But this is famously challenged by Getier cases.
337000	342000	Cases in which a person has justified true belief but does not have knowledge.
342000	347000	So think about a case where somebody, you know, wakes up in the morning, they go downstairs, they look at the clock,
347000	350000	it says eight o'clock, and it is in fact eight o'clock.
350000	353000	So it looks like they have a justified true belief that it's eight o'clock.
353000	357000	But now imagine that the clock had stopped at eight o'clock the night before.
357000	360000	Well, do they know that it's eight o'clock?
360000	363000	Arguably not. So we have justified true belief without knowledge.
363000	366000	Justified true belief is not sufficient for knowledge.
366000	369000	So knowledge is not justified true belief.
369000	377000	And then of course, other epistemologists will try to propose other analyses of knowledge that get around these sorts of cases.
377000	386000	So essentially conceptual analysis of some concept involves proposing the necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the concept
386000	389000	and then testing that against our intuitions about various cases.
389000	395000	You know, we look for cases where the proposed conditions are satisfied but where the concept would not be applied
395000	399000	or cases where we would apply the concept but where the conditions are not satisfied.
399000	403000	There's a lot of philosophy that works in this sort of mould.
403000	408000	And of course, you know, one very straightforward way to account what's going on here is to say,
408000	413000	well, philosophers are investigating the analytic truths, right?
413000	419000	They're trying to work out what's true in virtue of meaning.
419000	423000	Now, I mean, look, what I've just said here is all it's very brief.
423000	427000	And there are many objections we might have to this way of characterising things.
427000	436000	Still, I think that it's reasonably intuitive that there's a gap between the conceptual parts of inquiry,
436000	442000	which proceed by investigating meaning and working out what follows from what,
442000	449000	and the empirical parts of inquiry, which require us to perform experiments and make observations of the world.
449000	456000	There seems to be a difference here and the analytic synthetic distinction kind of can underlie this gap
456000	458000	between the different areas of inquiry, right?
458000	465000	So when we're sort of doing the conceptual stuff, we're dealing with analytic truths
465000	471000	and when we're doing the empirical stuff, we're investigating the synthetic truths.
471000	479000	So, yeah, philosophers have tried to use analyticity to explain notions like a priori knowledge
479000	490000	and necessary truths and maybe even try to create a role for philosophy as a sort of autonomous discipline.
490000	492000	So this is a very nice picture.
492000	496000	It's a nice picture, very influential.
496000	503000	But a critique of this was presented by W.B.O. Quine in his paper, Two Dogmas of Empiricism.
503000	508000	Now, Two Dogmas of Empiricism was written primarily in response to logical positivism,
508000	511000	which is a bit outside the scope of this particular video.
511000	516000	But the arguments that were given by Quine have obviously been influential beyond this.
516000	520000	So Quine argues that there is no analytic synthetic distinction.
520000	523000	There are no statements that are true purely in virtue of meaning.
524000	526000	And of course, this is something to follow.
526000	528000	Well, you know, nothing can be known a priori.
528000	533000	All statements must in one way or the other be tested against experience.
533000	543000	As Quine sees it, there's no way to isolate some set of substantive truths that are not vulnerable to empirical disconfirmation.
543000	549000	So in the rest of this video, we're going to outline Quine's arguments.
550000	551000	Alright then.
551000	555000	So our question is, what exactly is analyticity?
555000	562000	So I gave a brief sort of intuitive characterization of the analytic synthetic distinction when I began this video.
562000	565000	But, you know, we want to define it precisely.
565000	567000	Like, what exactly is analyticity?
567000	569000	What is it for a statement to be analytic?
569000	576000	Well, the obvious place to begin is by looking at how past philosophers have understood analyticity.
577000	581000	Quine says, he attributes to Kant the following view,
581000	593000	that analytic statements are those which attribute to the subject no more than is already conceptually contained in the subject concept.
593000	602000	So if I say bachelors are unmarried, the predicate concept unmarried is already contained within the subject concept bachelor.
602000	608000	So anything that's a bachelor must be unmarried, because when I apply this concept bachelor,
608000	611000	that just is to apply the concept unmarried.
611000	616000	Like one of the things I'm doing when I call something a bachelor is I'm calling it unmarried,
616000	622000	because like being unmarried is just contained within the concept of bachelor.
622000	624000	Well, okay, this sounds nice.
624000	626000	There are a couple of drawbacks to this.
626000	629000	First of all, this is only going to apply to subject predicate sentences.
629000	634000	It's not obvious how to extend this characterization of analyticity to other sentences,
634000	637000	like if it's raining, then water is pouring from the sky.
637000	646000	More seriously, the notion of conceptual containment is not really any better understood than the notion of analyticity.
646000	652000	This notion of one concept containing another, that's just a metaphor.
652000	657000	I mean, a concept isn't literally a box into which other concepts might be put.
657000	661000	So Quine says, well, you know, this doesn't really get us as much further
661000	665000	in terms of having a clear characterization of analyticity.
665000	669000	Okay, so another attempt then is to say that a statement is analytic
669000	674000	just in case its denial results in a contradiction.
674000	680000	So if you take the sentence like bachelors are unmarried,
680000	685000	the idea is going to be that if I deny this, if I claim that some bachelors are married,
685000	689000	then I have contradicted myself.
689000	691000	Okay, what's the problem with this?
691000	700000	So Alex Miller in his introduction to philosophy of language suggests that we can kind of distinguish between two senses of contradiction.
700000	704000	First of all, there's a purely syntactic notion of contradiction.
704000	712000	In this case, a statement is self-contradictory only if it has the syntactic form p and not p.
712000	717000	So if I say Frank is a bachelor and it is not the case that Frank is a bachelor,
717000	720000	that would be an example of a syntactic contradiction.
720000	723000	Now this notion is perfectly well understood.
723000	728000	We have no problem formalizing statements and identifying logical contradictions in this sense.
728000	734000	The trouble is that in many cases, denying an analytic truth is not going to take this form.
734000	740000	So if I claim that Frank is a married bachelor,
740000	748000	I realize that I'm looking at my slides here and I've messed up because that should say,
748000	752000	second, there is a broader sense of contradiction which includes statements such as,
752000	755000	Frank is a married bachelor.
755000	759000	So just flip that in your head.
759000	761000	So Frank is a married bachelor.
761000	766000	This is supposed to be an example of the second sort of contradiction.
766000	773000	If I claim that Frank is a married bachelor, that statement does not have the syntactic form p and not p.
773000	779000	So if this is a contradiction, we must be assuming some broader notion of contradiction.
779000	783000	This isn't just a purely syntactic contradiction.
783000	785000	So corresponding to these two notions of contradiction,
785000	789000	Quine distinguishes two classes of analytic statement.
789000	793000	So analytic statements of the first class are logical truths,
793000	797000	and we identify these purely in virtue of their syntactic form.
797000	802000	What makes these statements true are the arrangement of their purely logical terms.
802000	809000	So these are terms like all, some, not, and if, then, etc.
809000	817000	These are the terms that we would use when describing the logical operators basically.
817000	819000	When we're dealing with logical truths,
819000	823000	we can give any interpretation we like of the non-logical terms.
823000	826000	So I say all unmarried men are unmarried,
826000	830000	and then we can sort of put this in slightly more formal notation as,
830000	834000	for all x, if ux, then ux.
834000	839000	It doesn't matter how you interpret the terms unmarried and men here.
839000	842000	You can have any interpretation of those that you like.
842000	844000	This is going to come out as being true.
844000	847000	This is true just as a matter of logic.
847000	850000	Quine accepts this notion,
850000	854000	but then there are analytic statements of the second class,
854000	856000	and these are more problematic.
856000	859000	So when I say all bachelors are unmarried,
859000	862000	or all vixens are female foxes,
862000	865000	well, these are not true in virtue of syntactic form alone.
865000	870000	These are not true in virtue of their sort of surface logical form.
870000	874000	So what exactly is it that makes them true?
874000	877000	Now notice, of course, that it's going to be analytic statements of the second class
877000	879000	that are of interest to philosophers.
879000	882000	When we propose a conceptual analysis, for instance,
882000	885000	such as that knowledge is justified through belief,
885000	887000	that's an analytic statement of the second class.
887000	891000	It's not just a trivial truth of logical form.
891000	893000	So the question is,
893000	897000	how do we make sense of analytic statements of the second class?
897000	903000	Well, initial idea that Quine considers is to appeal to synonymy.
903000	905000	So here's the idea.
905000	909000	We can say that an analytic truth, p is an analytic truth,
909000	913000	just in case either, one, p is a logical truth,
913000	917000	or two, p can be transformed into a logical truth
917000	920000	by substituting synonymous terms.
920000	923000	So this is going to be, if it's a logical truth,
923000	925000	it's an analytic statement of the first class.
925000	929000	If it can be transformed into a logical truth by substituting synonymous terms,
929000	932000	it's an analytic statement of the second class.
932000	934000	So basically via synonymy,
934000	937000	we can transform analytic statements of the second class
937000	940000	into analytic statements of the first class.
940000	944000	Let's say I take all female foxes are vixens.
944000	949000	The idea is that the word vixen is synonymous with female fox.
949000	953000	So we can replace female fox in that initial sentence
953000	956000	to get all vixens are vixens,
956000	959000	which is just a straightforward logical truth.
959000	964000	And that's going to remain true no matter how you interpret the statement vixen.
964000	968000	No matter what vixens refers to, that's going to be true.
968000	970000	So there we have it.
970000	973000	Similarly, if you take all bachelors are unmarried
973000	975000	by substituting synonyms for synonyms,
975000	979000	we get all unmarried men are unmarried, a logical truth.
979000	983000	We can make all bachelors are unmarried into a logical truth
983000	986000	by substituting synonyms for synonyms.
986000	989000	But now, what exactly is it for two terms to be synonymous?
989000	991000	What is synonymy?
991000	995000	I mean clearly, when we have two synonymous terms,
995000	998000	they're not exactly the same, right?
998000	1001000	So we're not dealing with a sort of complete identity
1001000	1004000	of all of the things that we might call meaning,
1004000	1009000	such as, as Quine says, psychological associations or poetic quality.
1009000	1014000	In that sense, vixen and female fox are clearly not synonymous.
1014000	1018000	They're not exactly identical in terms of poetic quality.
1018000	1021000	So, okay, what the hell is synonymy then?
1021000	1023000	Well, it seems simple enough.
1023000	1029000	Two terms are synonymous, just in case those terms have the same definition.
1029000	1037000	So, now we're appealing to the idea that there is a correct definition of terms, right?
1037000	1039000	If we say that two terms have the same definition,
1039000	1041000	and we can say that they're synonymous,
1041000	1045000	and then we can use that to ground this notion of analyticity.
1045000	1048000	Now, Quine does grant that in one context,
1048000	1051000	this idea of correct definition is perfectly acceptable.
1051000	1056000	And this is where we give stipulative definitions.
1056000	1059000	So suppose that I introduce the abbreviation ff,
1059000	1064000	and I just stipulate that ff abbreviates female fox.
1064000	1066000	Well, I mean, this doesn't, you know,
1066000	1070000	I'm not appealing to any prior notion of analyticity or synonymy
1070000	1072000	or sameness of meaning or anything like that.
1072000	1075000	I'm just stipulating an abbreviation.
1075000	1079000	I'm saying like, okay, I'm going to adopt a convention
1079000	1085000	that any use of the words female fox can be substituted for ff.
1085000	1089000	I mean, just imagine like, you know, you're sort of, I don't know,
1089000	1091000	writing down a speech or something like that.
1091000	1093000	And then as you're writing it down,
1093000	1099000	when the person says female fox, you just write it as ff, just for convenience.
1099000	1102000	So, you know, I can say all female foxes are ffs,
1102000	1106000	and then transform that into all female foxes are female foxes,
1106000	1113000	because the term ff is just stipulated as an abbreviation for female fox.
1113000	1118000	The problem is that most analytic truths are not supposed to be mere
1118000	1120000	stipulative definitions.
1120000	1125000	I mean, in fact, most definitions are not mere stipulative definitions.
1125000	1129000	So, when I propose a definition of the word vixen,
1129000	1135000	I'm not just stipulating that it abbreviates female fox.
1135000	1139000	No, I have to think about how that word is used.
1139000	1142000	I have to think about what the word means.
1143000	1146000	You know, in this case, the language already exists.
1146000	1152000	I'm saying something about meanings that are pre-existent within a language, right?
1152000	1157000	Like, we have this, so we have this language already, which has the word vixen,
1157000	1160000	and it has the expression female fox.
1160000	1164000	And I'm saying, you know, vixen means female fox.
1164000	1167000	That's something I'm working out, I'm not stipulating it.
1167000	1172000	So, Quine says, in this kind of case, giving a definition of a term
1172000	1176000	can't explain synonymy because it presupposes synonymy, right?
1176000	1182000	What it is to define some term a as b is to suppose that a and b are synonymous.
1182000	1186000	So think about, like, I don't know, the process of writing a dictionary.
1186000	1189000	When you do that, you might make an error, right?
1189000	1191000	I mean, you know, you could get it wrong.
1191000	1194000	If all definitions were just stipulative definitions,
1194000	1196000	it would make no sense to speak of an error here.
1196000	1200000	When you stipulate that ff abbreviates female fox,
1200000	1202000	you can't be wrong about that.
1202000	1205000	It's not like, you know, you haven't made some mistake.
1205000	1211000	But a dictionary, well, that can obviously contain errors, that can contain mistakes.
1211000	1213000	So, you know, when we're giving a definition,
1213000	1219000	we're trying to stake the meanings that are implicit in some prior usage of the word.
1219000	1222000	And that means it's not a stipulation.
1222000	1225000	It's going to presuppose synonymy.
1226000	1231000	Now, there is a worry about this part of Quine's argument,
1231000	1233000	because you might say, well, you know, hang on a minute.
1233000	1237000	Quine is granting that there is such a thing as synonymy.
1237000	1239000	Synonymy occurs in stipulative definitions.
1239000	1244000	Moreover, Quine seems to grant that if there is synonymy,
1244000	1248000	then we can define analyticity in terms of it.
1248000	1250000	We can say that the analytic truths of the second class
1250000	1254000	are those that can be transformed into analytic truths of the first class
1254000	1256000	by substituting synonymous terms.
1256000	1259000	So, you know, we've got synonymy,
1259000	1261000	we've got the link between synonymy and analyticity.
1261000	1263000	What more do you want?
1263000	1265000	It seems strange that Quine grants all of this,
1265000	1269000	but then goes on to deny the analytic synthetic distinction.
1269000	1271000	And I guess to push the point further, we might say,
1271000	1274000	if there is this property of synonymy,
1274000	1277000	and this property can be created by stipulative definition,
1277000	1280000	why can't it be created in other ways?
1280000	1283000	So, I think to be clear, the problem as Quine sees it
1283000	1288000	is that stipulative definitions are just these sort of devices of convenience.
1288000	1291000	We can dot them or drop them without altering our theories,
1291000	1293000	without any kind of epistemic loss.
1293000	1297000	I mean, again, you know, it's like I'm just sort of copying a speech,
1297000	1300000	and then I just introduce a new symbol.
1300000	1302000	And that's all I'm doing.
1302000	1306000	And maybe this does give us some kind of analyticity,
1306000	1311000	but it's not going to be a kind that can do any important philosophical work.
1311000	1314000	You know, remember, philosophers don't just draw this distinction
1314000	1318000	between analytic and synthetic truths, like just for its own sake.
1318000	1320000	They see this distinction as doing important work,
1320000	1322000	such as explaining a priori knowledge,
1322000	1324000	or explaining necessary truths,
1324000	1329000	or providing some foundation for logical, mathematical, and philosophical inquiry.
1329000	1333000	A mere stipulative definition is not going to bear this weight.
1333000	1337000	So, I do think, you know, Quine is,
1337000	1340000	he's at times sort of a little bit unclear about the,
1340000	1345000	about how force, about maybe how general his thesis is supposed to be, right?
1345000	1348000	Because on the one hand, you know, he denies the analytic synthetic distinction,
1348000	1351000	but then he does just kind of grant for the sake of argument
1351000	1353000	that there are analytic truths of the first class.
1353000	1356000	So there is a kind of analyticity that he's granting.
1356000	1358000	And similarly, you know, he grants the, okay, yeah,
1358000	1362000	you know, you can have stipulative definitions.
1362000	1365000	But I think the important thing to see
1365000	1368000	is that analytic truths of the first class,
1368000	1371000	stipulative definitions, this sort of thing,
1371000	1375000	this isn't going to do the work that philosophers have put
1375000	1378000	the analytic synthetic distinction to, right?
1378000	1381000	You know, they're using this distinction for certain purposes.
1381000	1384000	And we're not going to be able to get that out of the,
1384000	1389000	the sort of trivial kinds of analyticity that Quine is just granting.
1389000	1393000	You know, when philosophers debate about the correct analysis of knowledge,
1393000	1397000	they're not just stipulating some, you know,
1397000	1400000	some abbreviation for the term knowledge, right?
1400000	1403000	Okay, when I say, you know, vixen is synonymous with female fox,
1403000	1405000	I'm not just stipulating a definition.
1405000	1412000	So Quine concludes, well, this appeal to definition
1412000	1414000	is really not going to help, right?
1414000	1417000	Because you're either going to end up talking about
1417000	1421000	stipulative definitions, which are just too trivial
1421000	1424000	to do the sorts of work that we're wanting,
1424000	1428000	or you're going to end up presupposing synonymy.
1428000	1431000	So you haven't explained synonymy,
1431000	1433000	you're just going to end up presupposing it.

1471000	1474000	The link to all of this stuff will be in the description.
1475000	1479000	Okay then, let's move on.
1479000	1484000	So, synonymy doesn't work, Quine says.
1484000	1487000	So he then turns to another idea, another suggestion,
1487000	1491000	which is, or might say, that two expressions are synonymous,
1491000	1496000	just in case they are interchangeable, salva veritate.
1496000	1498000	What the hell does this mean?
1498000	1503000	Well, the idea is, is that one expression can be replaced
1503000	1508000	with the other expression without altering the truth value
1508000	1512000	of the sentences in which those expressions occur.
1512000	1516000	So if I take vixen and female fox, the idea is,
1516000	1520000	well, any sentence containing the term vixen,
1520000	1522000	in any sentence which has that term,
1522000	1526000	this term can be replaced with the phrase female fox
1526000	1529000	without changing the truth value of the sentence,
1529000	1531000	and vice versa.
1531000	1534000	So if I take verity is a vixen,
1534000	1537000	I can change that to verity is a female fox,
1537000	1540000	and these are going to be true under the same conditions.
1540000	1544000	So the same conditions under which verity is a vixen is true
1544000	1547000	will be the conditions under which verity is a female fox is true.
1547000	1549000	No matter how we alter the world,
1549000	1552000	these are going to have the same truth value.
1552000	1555000	Or vixens have four legs,
1555000	1558000	to female foxes have four legs,
1558000	1561000	again, true under the same conditions.
1561000	1563000	There are vixens on Mars,
1563000	1565000	there are female foxes on Mars,
1565000	1567000	true under the same conditions.
1567000	1569000	Hunting vixens ought to be banned,
1569000	1571000	hunting female foxes ought to be banned,
1571000	1573000	true under the same conditions,
1573000	1575000	and so on and so on for any sentence.
1575000	1577000	So for any sentence of the language,
1577000	1580000	we can sort of switch these terms out,
1580000	1582000	and they're going to be true under the same conditions.
1582000	1584000	And of course that's not the case
1584000	1587000	for just any pair of terms, obviously.
1588000	1590000	So verity is a vixen,
1590000	1592000	replace vixen with the term bachelor.
1592000	1594000	Verity is a vixen, verity is a bachelor.
1594000	1597000	These are not true under the same conditions.
1597000	1599000	One can be true and the other can be false.
1599000	1602000	But this is not the case with vixen and female fox.
1602000	1605000	It can't be that one of these sentences is true
1605000	1607000	and the other one is false.
1607000	1611000	Now there are immediate limitations to this idea.
1611000	1614000	So take for instance the statement,
1614000	1617000	vixen has five letters.
1617000	1618000	That's true.
1618000	1620000	Female fox has five letters,
1620000	1622000	well that's false.
1622000	1623000	Now Quine does point out,
1623000	1625000	well you can get around this pretty straightforwardly
1625000	1628000	by appealing to a use-mention distinction, right?
1628000	1631000	When I say that vixen has five letters,
1631000	1636000	the word vixen is mentioned not used.
1636000	1638000	I'm not actually using the word vixen.
1638000	1641000	So the idea is that when we can treat
1641000	1645000	vixen enclosed in quotation marks
1645000	1649000	as a new word which refers to the word vixen.
1649000	1651000	So when I say vixen has five letters,
1651000	1654000	I'm mentioning the word vixen.
1654000	1656000	I'm essentially using a new word
1656000	1659000	that's constructed by enclosing vixen in quotation marks
1659000	1661000	to refer to the word vixen
1661000	1664000	and then I'm talking about the properties of that word.
1664000	1668000	I mean I could just as well say that the word fred
1668000	1671000	refers to the word vixen
1671000	1673000	and then I could say fred has five letters
1673000	1675000	and that would be true if we've stipulated
1675000	1678000	that fred is referring to vixen,
1678000	1679000	the word vixen, right?
1679000	1681000	fred is referring to the word vixen.
1681000	1682000	So when I say fred has five letters,
1682000	1683000	that's like a name.
1683000	1685000	That's a name for the word vixen.
1685000	1689000	Similarly, when I enclose vixen in quotation marks
1689000	1693000	and I say quote, quote, vixen, end quote,
1693000	1694000	has five letters, right?
1694000	1698000	When I say that, I'm using this vixen
1698000	1702000	enclosed in quotation marks as a name for the word vixen.
1702000	1706000	So of course, we can't then substitute it for female fox
1706000	1708000	because it's a new word.
1708000	1710000	So this is not a counter-example
1710000	1713000	to interchangeability salva veritate.
1713000	1716000	A more serious concern, though, raised by Quine
1716000	1718000	is that whether two expressions
1718000	1721000	are interchangeable salva veritate
1721000	1724000	depends on the expressive resources
1724000	1727000	of the language that we're dealing with.
1727000	1729000	So take the phrases creature with heart
1729000	1732000	and creature with kidneys.
1732000	1734000	These phrases have the same extension.
1734000	1737000	That is to say, they pick out the same things
1737000	1738000	in the actual world.
1738000	1740000	So as a matter of fact,
1740000	1742000	any creature that has a heart
1742000	1744000	is also a creature with a kidney.
1744000	1747000	So consider the following statements, right?
1747000	1749000	All creatures with hearts are creatures with hearts.
1749000	1752000	All creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.
1752000	1754000	Both of these statements are true.
1754000	1758000	Now, if our language contains only the resources
1758000	1761000	to refer to the actual world,
1761000	1764000	then creature with heart and creature with kidney
1764000	1768000	will be interchangeable salva veritate.
1768000	1771000	So if you imagine a language where, like,
1771000	1773000	it's a sort of simple language
1773000	1776000	and all the language can do
1776000	1779000	is just refer to, like, concrete objects
1779000	1781000	in the actual world.
1781000	1784000	So, you know, I have the ability to talk about, like,
1784000	1786000	the table, the cup,
1786000	1788000	the creature with a heart,
1788000	1790000	the creature with a kidney.
1790000	1792000	But, like, that's it.
1792000	1795000	You know, I can't talk about what might have been
1795000	1796000	or could have been.
1796000	1798000	I can't talk about what people believe
1798000	1800000	to be the case or anything like that.
1800000	1803000	Like, all I can do is just refer to objects
1803000	1805000	and attribute properties to them.
1805000	1807000	And the objects in the actual world.
1807000	1810000	You know, no fiction, no imagination, nothing like that.
1810000	1811000	Just...
1811000	1814000	I'm just talking about the objects that actually exist.
1814000	1816000	In this language,
1816000	1818000	creature with heart and creature with kidneys
1818000	1820000	will be interchangeable because, in fact,
1820000	1824000	all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.
1824000	1830000	So clearly, interchangeability in this language
1830000	1834000	is not going to be sufficient to explain analyticity.
1834000	1837000	We don't want to say that it's an analytic truth
1837000	1840000	that all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.
1840000	1846000	So, you know, this is going to be a problem
1846000	1848000	if we're just dealing with this...
1848000	1851000	if we're dealing with this, you know,
1851000	1854000	somewhat impoverished language.
1854000	1859000	Interchangeability in this kind of language isn't sufficient.
1859000	1863000	Because the interchangeability of the terms in this language
1863000	1866000	rests on matters of fact, not on meaning.
1866000	1870000	So, okay, let's say we add some more predicates to our language.
1870000	1873000	Suppose we add modal operators.
1873000	1875000	So we're now able to say things like,
1875000	1879000	necessarily, all creatures with hearts are creatures with hearts.
1879000	1883000	Necessarily, all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.
1883000	1885000	Well, the first statement here is true.
1885000	1887000	The second is false.
1887000	1890000	It's true that necessarily all creatures with hearts are creatures with hearts.
1890000	1893000	False that necessarily all creatures with hearts are creatures with kidneys.
1893000	1899000	So, by substituting the term creature with hearts in this case,
1899000	1903000	we do not have interchangeability, Salva Veritate.
1903000	1905000	Had evolution taken a different path,
1905000	1907000	then perhaps there could have been creatures with hearts
1907000	1909000	that are not creatures with kidneys.
1909000	1913000	So we've introduced modal terms in our language,
1913000	1915000	terms like necessarily and possibly,
1915000	1918000	terms for describing how things must have been
1918000	1920000	or how things could have been.
1920000	1922000	And in that case, the expressions
1922000	1924000	creature with heart and creature with kidneys
1924000	1927000	are no longer interchangeable Salva Veritate.
1927000	1931000	By contrast, it looks like we preserve the interchangeability
1931000	1933000	of vixen and female fox.
1933000	1937000	So, you know, compare necessarily all vixens of vixens,
1937000	1940000	necessarily all vixens are female foxes.
1940000	1943000	Well, yeah, that's still true, right?
1944000	1949000	So, if we had a good grasp of this term necessarily,
1949000	1952000	then perhaps we could say that two expressions are synonymous,
1952000	1958000	just in case they are necessarily interchangeable Salva Veritate.
1958000	1961000	The trouble, as far as Quine is concerned,
1961000	1964000	is that we have no better understanding of necessity
1964000	1967000	and these other modal notions than we do of analyticity.
1967000	1969000	Indeed, remember, as we noted at the beginning,
1969000	1974000	part of the work that philosophers are using
1974000	1976000	the analytic synthetic distinction for
1976000	1978000	was to explain necessary truths.
1978000	1983000	So, like, necessity is explained in terms of analyticity,
1983000	1986000	in which case we can't presuppose necessity
1986000	1988000	in order to explain analyticity.
1988000	1991000	Now, I mean, of course, these days,
1991000	1994000	we might challenge Quine's argument here,
1994000	1998000	the development of modal logic and possible world semantics
1998000	2001000	has, as far as most philosophers are concerned,
2001000	2003000	given as a solid foundation
2003000	2006000	for understanding these sorts of modal claims.
2006000	2009000	But, you know, this is the problem, right?
2009000	2011000	Like, as far as Quine is concerned,
2011000	2014000	well, appealing to necessity, right?
2014000	2015000	Well, one of the problems, right?
2015000	2017000	One problem here is this appeal to necessity
2017000	2019000	isn't really going to help
2019000	2022000	because necessity is no better understood than analyticity is.
2022000	2025000	Analyticity is supposed to explain necessity.
2025000	2027000	And it might actually be worth noting
2027000	2030000	that even if we did grant this prior understanding of necessity,
2030000	2032000	there are actually other contexts
2032000	2035000	that are going to raise trouble for the interchangeability criterion.
2035000	2037000	So, suppose I say,
2037000	2040000	Sydney believes that there is a female fox in his garden
2040000	2043000	versus Sydney believes that there's a vixen in his garden.
2043000	2046000	Now, suppose that Sydney is unaware
2046000	2048000	that vixens are female foxes.
2048000	2052000	Sydney thinks that vixen is a term for female stoats.
2052000	2055000	Then, arguably, it may be true
2055000	2057000	that Sydney has the belief
2057000	2060000	there is a female fox in my garden,
2060000	2062000	but false that Sydney has the belief
2062000	2064000	there is a vixen in my garden.
2064000	2066000	I mean, if you were to ask Sydney, like,
2066000	2068000	okay, do you think there's a vixen in your garden?
2068000	2069000	He'd say no.
2069000	2071000	Do you think there's a female fox in your garden?
2071000	2072000	He'd say yes.
2072000	2074000	And, you know, I mean,
2074000	2076000	appealing to necessity doesn't really seem to help
2076000	2077000	with this kind of case.
2077000	2079000	In fact, you know, if you have,
2079000	2082000	you could have a sort of more impoverished language,
2082000	2084000	which does not have modal operators,
2084000	2087000	but as long as it's got the, you know, the belief operator,
2087000	2089000	as long as we can refer to people's beliefs,
2089000	2093000	well, now it looks like interchangeability fails here.
2093000	2097000	Because we want to say that vixen is synonymous with female fox,
2097000	2100000	but they're not interchangeable salveratate.
2100000	2102000	That might be a worry.
2102000	2106000	Like, okay, so, yeah, this is a concern.
2106000	2108000	The general point is this, right?
2108000	2110000	If we consider a simple language that's purely extensional,
2110000	2113000	but only describes the actual matters of fact,
2113000	2116000	interchangeability cannot define analyticity,
2116000	2119000	because any co-referring terms will be interchangeable.
2119000	2122000	If the language contains operators like necessarily,
2122000	2126000	well, yeah, in that case, interchangeability might be sufficient,
2126000	2128000	but we don't understand necessity,
2128000	2130000	so we're no further in an explanation of analyticity.
2130000	2133000	And of course, if the language contains, you know, belief operators,
2133000	2136000	then it seems again that interchangeability no longer works.
2136000	2140000	So interchangeability, like whether or not two terms are interchangeable,
2140000	2144000	depends on the expressive resources of the language in question.
2144000	2150000	Okay, Quine then moves on to a final suggestion.
2150000	2155000	Perhaps the problem here is ordinary language.
2155000	2159000	Natural languages are vague and messy,
2159000	2163000	and it can be unclear where to draw the lines between different concepts.
2163000	2166000	So we have this intuitive grasp of the analytic synthetic distinction,
2166000	2170000	but maybe it's unsurprising that a precise characterization of this distinction
2170000	2173000	would be unavailable for ordinary languages.
2173000	2178000	We can perhaps gain greater clarity by proposing an artificial language
2178000	2181000	with explicit semantical rules.
2181000	2185000	So think about, you know, propositional logic with its precise vocabulary
2185000	2190000	and logical operators whose behavior is precisely defined according to the truth tables.
2190000	2196000	So, you know, we construct a new language, an artificial language,
2196000	2200000	where we just lay down the rules of the language.
2200000	2204000	Now according to Quine, analyticity is going to remain unclear,
2204000	2208000	even if we just consider the artificial languages.
2208000	2213000	Okay, so the most straightforward way to appeal to semantic rules here
2213000	2219000	is to think about a formal language that explicitly specifies all of its analytic statements.
2219000	2223000	So imagine a set of rules where the rules just tell us directly
2223000	2227000	which statements count as analytic and which count as synthetic.
2227000	2231000	Quine says, well, this isn't going to help us understand analyticity.
2231000	2236000	In a language with such rules, we can understand what statements,
2236000	2239000	the rules, attribute analyticity to,
2239000	2243000	but we won't by this method understand what analyticity is.
2243000	2246000	Indeed, there won't really be anything that analyticity is,
2246000	2250000	just from a set of rules that say these things are analytic.
2250000	2255000	I mean, like, if I just introduce some new word, you know, phlob, right,
2255000	2259000	and you don't know what, like, and you don't have an understanding of what phlob is,
2259000	2263000	and then I say, well, look, I've got this artificial language,
2263000	2267000	and the artificial language has these rules which, you know, distinguish,
2267000	2271000	okay, these are the phlob statements, these are the non-phlob statements.
2272000	2276000	That's useless, right, that doesn't help you understand phlob at all.
2276000	2279000	Something, in the case of analyticity, right, think about, you know,
2279000	2283000	you could have an artificial language where there's just some rule which says,
2283000	2288000	a statement s is analytic for l, just in case s contains at least 10 letters.
2288000	2293000	I mean, nothing stops you from constructing an artificial language
2293000	2296000	and then just having that as one of the rules of the language.
2296000	2301000	And you would have a very straightforward way of identifying the analytic statements
2301000	2305000	within that language, but clearly this is an unusual use of the term analytic.
2305000	2310000	It has nothing to do with the analytic synthetic distinction as philosophers have used it.
2310000	2314000	You know, it doesn't have anything to do with the analytic, synthetic distinction
2314000	2318000	in the intuitive sense that we explained at the beginning of this video.
2318000	2321000	But, you know, maybe this is a bit too simplistic.
2321000	2326000	So, instead of using semantic rules to specify the analytic statements directly,
2326000	2328000	there's an alternative way to approach this.
2328000	2333000	We might say, well, look, a language is going to contain semantic rules
2333000	2338000	which tell us that certain statements must be among the truths.
2338000	2341000	So, certain statements are among the truths.
2341000	2346000	The rules, these rules are not going to appeal to some prior understanding of analyticity.
2346000	2351000	They just stipulate certain statements of the language that are true.
2351000	2354000	So, we just postulate certain truths.
2354000	2356000	So, all we need is the notion of truth.
2356000	2362000	For instance, a semantic rule in an artificial language like this based on classical logic
2362000	2368000	might be all statements of the form not p and not p are true.
2368000	2375000	Or maybe, you know, if p is false, then if p then q is true.
2375000	2380000	Now, these rules do not tell us all of the truths of the language.
2380000	2386000	They specify a class of statements that are to count as true.
2386000	2390000	And having stipulated certain truths within the language that we can then take for granted,
2390000	2393000	we can then apply the language in other areas of inquiry and, you know,
2393000	2397000	work out what other things are true within the language and so on.
2397000	2401000	But, maybe we can now characterize analyticity by saying,
2401000	2406000	a statement s is analytic for l, just in case s is not just true,
2406000	2410000	but true according to the semantic rules of l.
2410000	2417000	We might have an artificial language with the rule that not p and not p is true,
2417000	2421000	from which it follows that it is not the case that there are unicorns
2421000	2425000	and there are no unicorns is true.
2425000	2428000	Or consider a language for describing colours.
2428000	2433000	We might stipulate as a rule of this language that objects can only have one colour
2433000	2435000	in the same respect from the same perspective.
2435000	2440000	So, you know, this language attributes to each surface one colour and one colour only.
2440000	2443000	And it follows from this that the statement,
2443000	2449000	nothing is both red all over and green all over at the same time is true.
2449000	2454000	So, you know, this kind of thing is presumably only going to work for artificial languages.
2454000	2460000	Natural languages, you know, I mean, don't appear to have explicitly stated semantic rules like this,
2460000	2465000	but even in the context of artificial languages, there is a problem.
2465000	2468000	What exactly counts as a semantic rule?
2468000	2473000	We don't want to say that every true statement which says that some statements are true
2473000	2478000	counts as a semantic rule, because otherwise, literally all of the truths in the language
2478000	2480000	would come out as analytic.
2480000	2483000	For instance, it's true that there are eight planets.
2483000	2487000	So now imagine I was to just say, well, it's a semantic, here's a semantic rule.
2487000	2490000	The sentence, there are eight planets is true.
2490000	2493000	Okay, surely this doesn't count as a semantic rule,
2493000	2499000	because otherwise we could, we could just have a semantic rule for every true sentence,
2499000	2502000	and then every true sentence would, would end up being analytic.
2502000	2508000	So the difficulty is how do we distinguish the genuine semantic rules,
2508000	2512000	rules like all statements of the form not p and not p are true.
2512000	2518000	How do we distinguish those from these kind of artificial gerrymandered semantic rules?
2518000	2523000	Like the statement, there are eight planets is true.
2523000	2526000	What's the difference?
2526000	2532000	The general problem here is that if we're constructing an artificial language,
2532000	2538000	then in principle, we can, we can just take any statements we like as the basic postulates.
2538000	2543000	So we can actually just postulate that there are eight planets is true.
2543000	2549000	On the other hand, if we're investigating a language that already exists, like English,
2549000	2553000	well, how, yeah, I mean, how do we tell which statements count as postulates?
2553000	2555000	I mean, there's not, it doesn't look like there's any facts of the matter.
2555000	2559000	As Quine says, any finite selection of statements, preferably true ones perhaps,
2559000	2562000	is as much a set of postulates as any other.
2562000	2567000	And that's the case regardless of whether we're dealing with, with natural languages or artificial languages.
2567000	2570000	So Quine says that we have gotten no further here.
2570000	2580000	I mean, obviously the natural, the natural answer to like what distinguishes a genuine semantic rule from a merely artificial one is going to be something about,
2580000	2583000	well, the meanings of the terms.
2583000	2586000	But then that's presupposing analyticity.
2586000	2596000	So Quine summarizes semantical rules determining the analytic statements of an artificial language are of interest only in so far as we already understand the notion of analyticity.
2596000	2600000	They are of no help in gaining this understanding.
2600000	2609000	So Quine concludes that we have no way of drawing the distinction between analytic and synthetic truths.
2609000	2619000	The general idea of his argument is that the term analytic is one of a circle of terms where if any one of those terms could be adequately understood,
2619000	2622000	then we could define the others in terms of it.
2622000	2630000	So there's terms like self contradictory, necessarily synonymous, definition, semantic rule.
2630000	2633000	The problem is none of these terms have been adequately explained.
2633000	2637000	Any attempt to explain one of them will end up appealing to the other terms in the circle.
2637000	2645000	So, you know, to explain analyticity, we appeal to synonymy, to explain synonymy, we appeal to necessity, to explain necessity, we appeal to analyticity.
2645000	2655000	So at some point we always end up either bottoming out in some just, you know, vague term that's poorly understood, or we circle back around to analyticity itself.
2655000	2658000	So we end up, you know, it ends up becoming circular.
2658000	2664000	None of these concepts have been shown to be capable of bearing the weight that philosophers have placed on them.
2664000	2674000	And as far as Quine is concerned, there's no reason to think that there is actually a distinction between the analytic and the synthetic.
2674000	2688000	Now, it's worth noting before we end that many philosophers have taken Quine's argument to have the fairly radical consequence that there actually just isn't any such thing as the meaning of a sentence.
2688000	2695000	In fact, in later work, Quine himself is explicit that he, you know, he's sort of attacking the very notion of meaning.
2695000	2699000	It's not just that there are no sentences that are true in virtue of meaning.
2699000	2704000	It's that there's no such thing as like the meaning of a sentence, period.
2704000	2709000	See my videos on Quine's arguments for the indeterminacy of meaning for more on this.
2709000	2714000	But with respect to the analytic-synthetic distinction, here's the reason in brief.
2714000	2717000	Suppose that sentences have meanings.
2717000	2725000	In their response to Quine, Gries and Strausson point out that this would allow a very straightforward definition of synonymy.
2725000	2738000	As follows, we could say two sentences are synonymous if and only if any true answer to the question, what does it mean, asked of one of them, is a true answer to the same question asked of the other.
2738000	2746000	So if you take verity as a vixen and verity as a female fox, right, ask for each of these sentences, what does it mean?
2746000	2749000	The correct answer will be the same in both cases.
2749000	2753000	So two sentences are synonymous just in case they mean the same thing.
2753000	2759000	And with this, you know, we break into the circle of terms and can define analyticity.
2759000	2763000	Of course, Quine is going to say, well, we can't do that.
2763000	2768000	If we give up analyticity, then we seem to have to give up sentence meaning.
2768000	2774000	At the very least, we have to give up the idea that there is a determinate fact of a matter about the meaning of a sentence.
2774000	2779000	Now, in practice, we might well ask the question, what does it mean of two different sentences?
2779000	2781000	And we might give the same answer each time.
2781000	2786000	But on Quine's view, we can't say that this answer is correct or incorrect.
2786000	2791000	When we talk about the meaning of a sentence, that's going to be more like a useful fiction or an idealization.
2791000	2798000	Indeed, as far as Quine is concerned, the sort of unit of meaning is an entire language or an entire theory of the world.
2798000	2806000	Some sentences are more resistant to refutation than others, but it's the whole theory that is tested against experience.
2806000	2814000	And there's no sharp line between synthetic statements that can be refuted and analytic statements that are true come what may.
2814000	2820000	And there's no determinate fact of the matter about what a sentence means.
2820000	2831000	For any sentence, its truth is going to be, the kind of conceptual and the empirical is intertwined.
2831000	2840000	For any sentence, the truth is going to be a matter of meaning and the matter of fact,
2840000	2853000	but where we are not going to be able to identify or sort of isolate the meaning of the sentence independently of this sentence's role in the whole theory.
2853000	2862000	It was noting as well that Quine's argument also threatens the idea of logical truths, what Quine called analytic statements of the first class.
2862000	2876000	We noted that Quine does not object to logical truths. He grants in his argument that if we could define synonymy, then we could say that an analytic truth is any statement that can be transformed into a logical truth by substituting synonymous terms.
2876000	2889000	So he seems to, at least in his article, he's granting logical truth, but we might think well actually there's a bit of a problem here, because let's take logical truth of the form for all x if vx then vx,
2889000	2903000	or for all x if x is a vixen then x is a vixen or more colloquially all vixens are vixens. That's an instance of a logical truth, but this only works if each instance of vixen has the same meaning.
2903000	2916000	Right, so if the first token of vixen means female foxes and the second token of vixen means attractive women, then obviously this statement is false.
2916000	2924000	So ordinarily we would say that this kind of thing isn't a counter example to logical truth because it would be equivocating on the term vixen.
2925000	2933000	When we characterize logical truths, we have to specify that different tokens of the same expressions have the same meaning.
2933000	2945000	It must be that the first token of vixen is synonymous with the second token of vixen. Without sameness of meaning, it's not quite so obvious how we are to understand logical truth.
2945000	2952000	So maybe Quine's argument is a bit more radical than even he initially intended.
2952000	2956000	And with that said, I'm going to leave that video there.
2956000	2963000	Those were Quine's arguments against the analytic synthetic distinction.
2963000	2966000	And that's all for today. Thanks for watching. Bye!
