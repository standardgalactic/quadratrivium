0	5460	Hello YouTube! In this video I'm going to outline hinge epistemology, an approach
5460	10000	to knowledge and justification that has its roots in Wittgenstein's book On
10000	14160	Certainty. Now I want to be clear from the outset that the goal of this video is
14160	18040	not to explain Wittgenstein's own views, which are very much open to
18040	22720	interpretation, rather we're going to look at how hinge epistemology has been
22720	27240	developed in contemporary epistemology. I'm going to focus in particular on the
27240	32100	work of Duncan Pritchard. Okay, so first of all we need to consider
32100	38560	skepticism. Hinge epistemology is often sort of initially developed at least as
38560	44600	a response to skepticism. The skeptic aims to call into question all of our
44600	49080	beliefs, or at least a very large class of our beliefs. So here's a classic
49080	55880	argument for skepticism. If I don't know that not S, I don't know that P, I don't
55880	62040	know that not S, so I don't know that P, where S is a skeptical hypothesis, like
62040	66200	the hypothesis that I'm a brain in a vat, or that I'm dreaming, or that I'm a
66200	69600	Boltzmann brain. You can see my previous video for a discussion of Boltzmann
69600	74960	brains. P is a claim about the external world, like I have hands, right? If I
74960	79360	don't know that I'm not a brain in a vat, I don't know that I have hands. I don't
79360	82800	know I'm not a brain in a vat, so I don't know I have hands. In general I don't
82800	86680	know whether there are any external objects at all. If this argument is
86680	92360	successful it throws doubt on basically all our common-sense beliefs about the
92360	99600	external world. Now it was noticed by philosophers like GE Moore that there is
99600	105080	something a bit odd about this kind of argument. Moore responded that surely a
105080	111720	proposition like I know I have hands is is more certain, more secure than almost
111720	115520	any other proposition. There's nothing that could be more obvious than that I
115520	120800	know I have hands. So Moore argued that no philosophical argument, which you know
120800	125160	I mean a philosophical argument will inevitably appeal to premises less
125160	130600	certain than the premise I know I have hands, no argument like that should lead
130600	135480	me to reject the claim that I have hands. Moore famously responded to this by
135480	141400	simply holding up his hands saying you know here's one hand here's another so
141440	145600	there are two external objects so the external world exists you know you just
145600	151200	sort of flip the argument around right here's one hand here's another so
151200	156920	clearly I'm not a brain in a vat. Again I have a whole video discussing Moore's
156920	162440	argument that I'll link in the comments. So it was this sort of Mauryan kind of
162440	166960	response that prompted Wittgenstein's initial reflections on certainty.
167000	172400	Wittgenstein agreed with Moore that a proposition like I have hands is held
172400	176680	with a kind of certainty even so Wittgenstein felt that there was something
176680	185080	odd about asserting the proposition I know that I have hands and the key the
185080	190000	key problem here is that in ordinary circumstances claims that we have
190000	194560	knowledge or indeed that we fail to have knowledge makes sense only where there
194560	199520	might be genuine doubt about what we claim to know or where we can offer some
199520	205200	sort of justification for what we claim to know like if I say I know that P it's
205200	210880	perfectly legitimate to then ask me well how do you know that P what reasons can
210880	217960	you cite to justify P but in ordinary circumstances these sorts of questions
217960	224080	about you know doubts and reasons and justification they just don't arise when
224080	231280	it comes to a claim like I have hands I mean you know what what sort of possible
231280	237520	justification could be given for the claim that I have hands well I mean when
237520	243280	Moore responded to the skeptic he simply held up his hands and said here are two
243280	248800	hands so you know Moore must be assuming that he can justify the claim
248800	253120	that he has hands by perceiving his hands and I mean you know you might think
253120	257440	okay yeah well surely you know like if you if you ask for a justification for
257440	263320	the claim that I have hands then well I know that I have hands via perception
263320	267120	right I perceive that I have hands maybe that's the justification but
267120	274240	Wittgenstein says there this isn't gonna work because well as he says I quote if a
274240	278440	blind man were to ask me have you got two hands I should not make sure by
278440	282880	looking if I were to have any doubt of it then I don't know why I should trust
282880	287800	my eyes for why shouldn't I test my eyes by looking to find out whether I
287800	294560	whether I see my two hands what is to be tested by what so basically if I were
294560	298960	to have like genuine doubt about whether or not I have two hands then I wouldn't
298960	303840	be able to rely on my visual impressions to test this because you know if I'm
303840	308120	doubting if I'm calling into question the existence of my hands if I'm calling
308120	312640	into question something as obvious as that then I'm also probably you know I
312640	316600	should also be calling into question the testimony of my eyes you know I'm
316600	321320	gonna I'm gonna call into question the testimony of anything else like the
321320	327360	claim that I have hands is sort of I'm just as certain of that as I am of the
327360	332880	claim that my eyes are reliable so you know why why shouldn't I instead doubt
332880	337000	my eyes and then check that my eyes are working by looking to see whether I have
337000	340120	two hands I mean this is actually something that we will sometimes do in
340160	344440	circumstances where you know our vision is impaired like if I'm in a fog or
344440	348480	something I might actually like hold my hands out in front of me and look and
348480	353020	find if I can see them you know like I and then I'm like oh my goodness you
353020	358120	know this is a really thick fog because I don't see my hands there so you know
358120	365080	we the point is is that like the testimony of my if if we're calling
365080	368400	into question the test whether or not I have hands I'm gonna be calling into
368440	372720	question whether or not my eyes are trustworthy so I can't test whether or
372720	377160	not I have hands by by like looking to see whether or not my hands are there
377160	383400	that at least that's not a genuine justification yeah so there's no way to
383400	388920	test this proposition I have hands so questions of doubt can't really arise I
388920	396280	mean there are situations of course where genuine doubt can arise so if for
396320	400560	example I have been in a serious car accident I wake up in a hospital
400560	405360	afterwards I find that my arms are bandaged I can't see my hands in that
405360	410320	situation I might genuinely doubt whether I have hands and since you know I
410320	415400	trust my visual perception I can remove the bandages to confirm whether there
415400	420120	are hands there and this is of course a procedure that I can perform that resolves
420120	426120	my doubt in that situation but for the radical skeptic there is no procedure
426160	429200	that could resolve her doubt there is nothing I can do there's nothing I can
429200	435360	perceive that would resolve the doubt about whether or not I have hands which
435360	441560	for Wittgenstein means that that's not a genuine doubt at all I mean what like
441560	445320	what would it be you know what would it be to genuinely doubt whether I have
445320	450520	hands well maybe it would be that like I wouldn't flinch if I were to see a knife
450520	455680	coming towards my hands of course the this the external world skeptic doesn't
455720	460440	give up these ordinary behaviors if you if you start to try to stab her hands
460440	464680	she's gonna move her hands and if somebody really didn't flinch when they
464680	469120	saw a knife coming towards their hands no doubt their behavior would quickly be
469120	472040	corrected right the knife would hit their hands they'd feel pain and they'd
472040	477520	they'd start behaving accordingly okay so with that in mind then let's say
477520	484680	let's say that in ordinary circumstances I was to claim I know I have hands well
484720	490160	what possible justification could be given for this I mean I mean nothing
490160	495240	right I can't say well I can't justify that claim by saying that I see my hands
495240	498360	because if I'm doubting whether I have hands then I'm not gonna trust my eyes
498360	501800	so you know I can't appeal to the testimony of my eyes in the same goes
501800	506400	for any other perceptual capacity there's no there's no justification available
506400	514160	here so you know there's no there's no justification there's no it seems that
514160	518640	there's no there's no real possibility of doubt like for knowledge to be possible
518640	523280	there must be the there must be the space for for doubt and justification like
523280	529360	when I when I say I know that P this is sort of presupposing the the
529360	533020	possibility that there are like circumstances where I don't know that
533020	536680	P or like maybe I don't know the P right and and what I'm doing is giving a
536680	542440	justification for P knowledge is based on evidential grounds like when I claim
542480	546920	to know something I must be able to cite evidence for it and that evidence you
546920	550360	know might be undermined in which case my claim to knowledge would be undermined
550360	556040	so you know in ordinary circumstances the idea would be that knowledge claims
556040	561120	are appropriate when we have you know arrived at some claim through investigation
561120	566480	when we can when we can ask questions like how do you know but but when it
566480	571960	comes to a claim like I have hands this sort of doubt and sighting of evidence
572000	577480	and investigation this just isn't part of it right I don't investigate whether
577480	586300	or not I have hands I just do things with my hands so the idea is that I have
586300	590920	hands has this sort of special status it's a proposition with a very special
590920	596360	status or claim with a very special status it's a a hinge commitment or a
596400	602920	hinge proposition that Wittgenstein calls these commitments hinges because they
602920	608600	are the presuppositions around which the rest of our language and epistemic
608600	617160	practices turn the the thought is that there are certain commitments that just
617160	622360	have to be assumed in order for various practices to be possible just like the
622360	626640	hinges of a door must stay in place in order for the door to step to stay up
626640	630280	and to open and close like in order for the door to turn the hinges have to stay
630280	637720	in place hinge commitments are required for practices for various practices to
637720	640760	be possible in particular hinge commitments are required in order to
640760	646720	for the practice of rational evaluation to be possible so like rational
646720	653440	evaluation would be like doubt justification giving evidence in order
653440	657120	for that practice to occur there have to be certain commitments that are in place
657120	661640	that make it possible but this means that those commitments cannot themselves be
661640	666040	subject to this rational evaluation they cannot themselves be called into doubt
666040	671640	so so like rational evaluation involves doubt okay I asked myself could this
671640	676240	proposition be false right like I I believe that all you know the all
676280	680840	species share a common ancestor okay but you know why do I believe that could
680840	685600	that be false okay then I then I start to engage in a rational evaluation I
685600	692720	search for reasons to accept or reject the proposition hinges must be exempt
692720	697120	from this sort of doubt because the very act of raising doubts and performing
697120	704720	investigations is itself predicated upon these hinges so since hinge
704800	708920	commitments are outside of rational evaluation they do not themselves have
708920	713400	any rational support so we saw this in the case of I have hands in ordinary
713400	717880	circumstances it wouldn't make sense to try to offer a justification for this
717880	724200	claim so hinge commitments are neither justified nor unjustified they are
724200	728960	neither known nor unknown right so so they're not justified they're not known
728960	733600	so actually when I say something like I know I have hands that would be again
733600	738800	in ordinary circumstances at least that would be kind of you know sort of a
738800	743680	misuse a misuse of language right it would be the mistake is is that no this
743680	749920	just isn't it doesn't have a kind of this sort of epistemic status for the
749920	755920	very same reason they can't be doubted if I was to ask a question like what
755920	760160	reason is there to believe a hinge commitment that would be a mistake
760320	768320	because hinge commitments are what enable the giving of reasons yeah I mean so if
768320	771400	I were to doubt whether I have hands that would just call into question the
771400	775480	whole practice of making claims or doubting claims like even even to doubt
775480	781520	requires a background of assumptions such as I have hands and of course this
781520	785480	accounts for the special kind of certainty that is associated with hinge
785480	790720	commitments hinge commitments cannot be doubted but at the same time we can't
790720	795160	offer a compelling argument for them the certainty of hinge commitments is not
795160	799560	based on our being able to offer a proof for them it's based on the fact that
799560	803880	these are the presuppositions that make inquiry possible or indeed that make our
803880	809880	general form of life possible our general practice as possible okay so let's
809880	814160	sort of see this maybe with another example so consider these two claims so
814160	817560	we have a claim like there is milk in the fridge and then we have a claim like
817560	821800	there are external objects now in the case of there is milk in the fridge there
821800	824720	are very straightforward empirical procedures for establishing this
824720	830720	establishing claim M here I know what to do to test it one way or the other okay
830720	835320	I go to the fridge I open the door I search for a bottle of a particular
835320	838800	size and shape and if I find such a bottle I'm gonna take it that M is true
838800	842040	I'll be like okay I've established that there is milk in the fridge now
842080	846960	obviously further questions could be raised here like how do I know that the
846960	850840	bottle really contains milk how do I know that you know my brother isn't
850840	854240	pulling some sort of prank and he's replaced the milk with something else
854240	859400	but again there are straightforward procedures for answering such questions
859400	864080	if I am really questioning whether or not my brother has pulled this prank I
864080	868160	can you know pour the milk pour the liquid out of the bottle and then I can
868160	872920	taste it and so on so again you know straightforward empirical procedures
872920	879600	for testing this claim M what about claim E that there are external objects
879600	883600	well clearly this cannot be approached in the same kind of way no
883600	888560	observation could establish E it won't help to take you know a microscope and
888560	891720	look through it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna have a microscope and be like
891720	896840	okay I've looked through the microscope and there it is an external object the
896840	901200	difference of course is that in accepting that there are external objects
901200	905680	I'm I'm not accepting a straightforward empirical claim I'm instead I'm
905680	912480	accepting a sort of way of inquiring I'm you know this is the sort of claim that
912480	917680	allows me to gather evidence for and against other propositions and so this
917680	920800	is what the this is a hinge commitment right it's hinge commitments are what
920800	925360	allows to gather evidence for and against other propositions so I might say
925360	929440	something like you know there are three chairs in this room or I might say
929440	934000	that the universe is 13.8 billion years old I can assess evidence for these
934000	940400	claims crucially however this evidence like this this evidence that presupposes
940400	945800	that there are external objects and it it can't the evidence can't provide
945800	950720	support to the hinge commitment because the hinge commitment is what is making
950720	956720	possible the gathering of evidence in the first place so any any justification
956720	960640	given of a hinge commitment would be less firm than the hinge commitment
960640	966280	itself so like I can cite evidence for the claim that the universe has existed
966280	972600	for 13.8 billion years now given that I am significantly younger than 13.8
972600	976640	billion years this is going to entail that there are external objects there
976640	983680	are objects outside my mind objects other than me so you entails E but you
983680	988600	cannot be evidence for E and and evidence for you cannot be evidence for E
988600	993760	because the evidence that bears on you presupposes E all the evidence in
993760	997360	favor of you from physics and chemistry and astronomy and geology would make no
997360	1001680	sense without E like we can only bring claims about so if I take the you know
1001680	1005440	redshifting of starlight or something like that well that's only going to bear
1005440	1010520	on the evaluation of you if we're assuming E if I'm assuming that you know
1010520	1014120	there isn't it there are these external objects and I'm not just you know
1014120	1021960	currently dreaming or whatever so that's the idea of hinge commitments so which
1021960	1027040	propositions which propositions count as the hinge commitments well different
1027040	1030960	hinge epistemologists are going to have different answers to this but you know
1030960	1036400	there are some some some general answers we can give here so that some types of
1036400	1039720	some hinge commitments are going to include sort of specific propositions
1039720	1044520	about myself and my own experience propositions that express the sort of
1044520	1050200	basic pieces of evidence I have from my own experience like I have hands my name
1050200	1055880	is Kane I am speaking English I have never been to the moon then there are
1055880	1060840	going to be more general claims bearing on my sort of general worldview and how
1060840	1065640	I form beliefs so there is an external world sense perception is reliable
1065640	1071880	reasoning is reliable the universe is older than I am and so on right where
1071880	1078280	well okay if you like my channel you can support me on patreon where I upload
1078280	1083280	bonus videos where I offer my own thoughts about the topics I talk about
1083280	1089720	on the on these on these videos or a one-off donation on PayPal I also offer
1089720	1094160	private tutoring so email if you're interested in that private tutoring in
1094160	1098400	philosophy and I have a discord link store this will be in the description
1098400	1104280	right then so we've seen the role that hinge commitments play in inquiry but
1104280	1108960	what exactly is the nature of these hinge commitments well a standard
1108960	1113080	interpretation is that hinge commitments are something like rules they're not
1113080	1117840	exactly you know they have the form of descriptive propositions but really
1117840	1122480	they're more like rules so as Wittgenstein says their role is like
1122480	1126280	that of rules of a game and the game can be learned purely practically without
1126280	1131520	learning any explicit rules so yeah hinge commitment is going to appear to be a
1131520	1136920	descriptive claim like if I say I have hands that has the appearance of merely
1136920	1140640	describing the arrangement of objects in the world it's like okay there is
1140640	1146080	this thing a hand which is attached to this person so descriptive claim but
1146120	1150120	really what's happening when we say something like I have hands is we are
1150120	1154480	we're sort of stating conditions that must be in place in order for certain
1154480	1160720	practices to occur or we're stating the rules of certain practices so under
1160720	1165240	normal circumstances I wouldn't explicitly say something like I have
1165240	1171560	hands in philosophical contexts we use this seemingly descriptive claim to
1171560	1177480	express certain rules that govern our practices and these rules are manifested
1177480	1183040	in our actions so when I was writing the script for this video I was typing on my
1183040	1189200	computer and to do this I I had to have hands I use my hands to type on the
1189200	1193600	computer and maybe I find that a letter doesn't come up and then I wonder like
1193600	1198760	does this key still work I try it again I tap it with my hands right I'm using
1198760	1204360	my hands so my behavior with respect to the computer is governed by certain
1204360	1210440	rules and I need not be explicitly aware of these rules like I don't have to
1210440	1215880	consciously think to myself that I have hands in order to use my hands right
1215880	1219720	often I'll just use my hands I won't I won't sort of have some proposition in
1219720	1225360	my head that says I have hands I'll just use my hands indeed this rule is not
1225400	1229760	something that even has to be taught at least not in the way that I was taught
1229760	1234760	say the theory of evolution by natural selection like I'm not taught the
1234760	1240120	proposition that I have hands I'm taught how to use my hands to do various
1240120	1247640	things and in in being taught these practices I adopt these rules these
1247640	1253760	hinge commitments Danielle Moyle-Sharic put it like this the hinge certainty
1254040	1259760	verbalized as I have a body is a disposition of a living creature which
1259760	1266680	manifests itself in her acting in the certainty of having a body so the
1266680	1271880	certainty is of these rules it's certainly these rules these commitments is
1271880	1277880	manifested in our actions the fact that I'm acting just shows that I accept these
1277920	1284200	rules that I'm conforming to these rules and this is why even when I recognize
1284200	1290120	that there is no rational basis for the truth of the proposition I have hands
1290120	1295040	like even when I recognize that I have no reasons for this as a belief my
1295040	1300760	certainty in it is unchanged it will continue to function as a rule that
1300760	1305160	guides my behavior I can notice that there's no rational basis for the belief
1305160	1310240	that I have hands and then I sit down and start typing things on my computer
1310240	1314200	right so this approach gives voice to the worry that skepticism as the
1314200	1321160	philosopher conceives of it is in some way inert or meaningless so as we noted
1321160	1325440	earlier there are circumstances where I will experience genuine doubt about
1325440	1329600	whether or not I have hands as when I wake up in a hospital bed after a car
1329600	1335160	crash I can resolve such doubts by applying certain standard empirical
1335160	1339760	procedures that I've learned like you know looking under the bandages and then
1339760	1343920	I see I see the hands there and I'm like oh I might say in relief oh I know I have
1343920	1348280	two hands thank God you know this isn't the kind of thing the skeptic is
1348280	1352840	talking about of course the skeptic tries to ask for a rational justification of
1352840	1357040	our whole world view and tries to cast doubt on whether I have hands even in
1357040	1361640	ordinary context but the skeptics doubt it's a doubt that makes no difference
1361640	1365560	whatsoever the skeptic doesn't change her actions she continues to use her
1365560	1369840	hands just as the rest of us do and the skeptic doesn't propose any procedure
1369840	1373720	for resolving the doubt indeed by her lights there can be no procedure for
1373720	1377280	resolving the doubt because the the skeptical hypotheses are designed to be
1377280	1381480	consistent with all possible experience so yeah so it's not it's not really a
1381480	1384840	doubt at all I mean I can ponder these skeptical arguments all I like but at
1384840	1388960	the end of the day I still know how to use a keyboard and it's this knowing how
1388960	1397080	to use a keyboard that manifests the hinge commitment that I have hands so
1397080	1403640	that is the basic idea of hinge epistemology now there are three immediate
1403640	1410560	challenges to this kind of approach so the first the first challenge is whether
1410560	1414480	this sort of view actually provides a response to skepticism we've talked about
1414520	1418800	skepticism a lot and contrasted the hinge the hinge epistemologist with the
1418800	1424480	skeptic but we might worry whether whether the difference is as great as
1424480	1430080	it seems to be so notice that the hinge epistemologist identifies certain
1430080	1434920	commitments as being the hinge commitments and there are two relevant
1434920	1440680	features of hinge commitments as the hinge epistemologist sees it first they
1440680	1444480	are the presuppositions on which the rest of our inquiries are built they're
1444480	1452320	the you know the hinges on which the rest of our practices turn second they are
1452320	1458960	not justified they are not known no reason can be given in support of them
1458960	1464600	no justification can be given for them but then you might think well hang on a
1464600	1468760	minute isn't this exactly what a skeptic would say like all of our beliefs
1468960	1474400	rest on these presuppositions that cannot be justified so all of our beliefs
1474400	1479440	are ultimately unsupported now of course a hinge epistemologist will reject this
1479440	1483320	final inference right all of our beliefs rest on propositions that cannot be
1483320	1489080	justified sure it does not follow that all of our beliefs are unsupported we
1489080	1493320	have to pay attention to what it means to give support to a belief this is a
1493320	1498280	matter of giving reasons of engaging in investigation of assuaging doubts but
1498320	1504360	this activity presupposes certain hinge commitments the trouble is is that even
1504360	1508440	a skeptic might be willing to accept what we could call you know conditional
1508440	1513360	justification or conditional support so the skeptic might accept that look if
1513360	1516960	you take certain propositions for granted say the proposition that
1516960	1521280	perception presents a generally reliable picture of the external world if I take
1521280	1525800	that for granted then I can give support to further propositions on that
1525800	1532000	basis like if we take P for granted we can get ourselves to Q the issue for
1532000	1537080	the skeptic is that there's no justification for P but then I mean but
1537080	1540400	then like where exactly is the line between the hinge epistemology and the
1540400	1545640	skeptic here is it just that they have like different attitudes to these
1545640	1550080	presuppositions so like both of them seem to agree that okay there are certain
1550080	1554240	presuppositions that you can make which like there are certain presuppositions
1554240	1560800	we make which you know which then allows us to engage in further inquiry you
1560800	1563840	know which then makes possible all of these other practices or which you know
1563840	1567920	like if we take these presuppositions for granted then you know this practice of
1567920	1572480	justification is possible so okay looks like we both agree on that and more
1572480	1575720	over they both agree that these presuppositions are themselves without
1575720	1581040	justification is it just that the hinge epistemologist is okay with this
1581040	1586280	whereas the skeptic is not okay with it like it's just a difference in attitude
1586280	1590800	so this is one sort of worry that like okay maybe the line is starting to look
1590800	1597840	quite thin we'll come back to this point later so second challenge is that hinge
1597840	1604600	epistemology appears to be committed to epistemic relativism basic problem here
1604600	1608200	is well it looks like people could have could adopt very different hinge
1608240	1612760	commitments which would lead to different systems of justification suppose
1612760	1617320	that Verity selects as a hinge commitment that the Bible is the infallible
1617320	1622040	world of word of God Verity is fervently religious she interprets all other
1622040	1626640	practices in terms of her literal Christian faith her literalist faith as a
1626640	1630480	result she endorses young earth creationism as an account of the history
1630480	1635480	of life now since the Bible is a hinge commitment for Verity it's not open to
1635520	1640400	doubt or justification in which case it looks like there's no room for debate
1640400	1646320	with Verity Verity is not making any kind of rational error you know all I can
1646320	1651240	say is well we have different hinge commitments and our hinge commitments
1651240	1656880	are immovable so I mean there's a worry that like hinge hinge epistemology
1656880	1661600	seems to sort of close down rational inquiry and there's also a worry that
1661600	1667600	it sort of licenses a kind of just dogmatism you know like we just end up
1667600	1673280	accepting certain things and they're kind of quarantined from from criticism
1673280	1677800	and justification and of course this this only makes this this specter of
1677800	1682000	skepticism more vivid because you know we can recognize that Verity's hinge
1682000	1685960	commitments have led her to a radically mistaken view of the world so we're like
1685960	1690680	okay these hinge commitments have led somebody massively astray in which case
1690720	1694040	we might wonder well why shouldn't that be the same for our own hinge
1694040	1697800	commitments then I mean just insisting that hinge commitments can't be open to
1697800	1702880	doubt is not a particularly comforting response here you know it's like there
1702880	1705920	seems to be something defective about the way that Verity the creationist
1705920	1710600	justifies her worldview if I recognize that the only difference between us is
1710600	1716320	that we happen to have different hinge commitments I mean maybe my worldview is
1716360	1722040	defective also you know this is the worry a third problem is that it seems
1722040	1729320	that hinge commitments can change over time and in response to new evidence so
1729320	1733920	I have hands is currently a hinge commitment but we've already seen that
1733920	1739120	there are circumstances where I might genuinely come to doubt this what is it
1739120	1745200	that makes me doubt this well it looks like it's the changing evidence so you
1745200	1748680	know or think about a statement like no human being has ever walked on the moon
1748680	1752840	that was a hinge commitment prior to the 1960s these days we think it's simply
1752840	1757640	false now the trouble here is that it looks like what's happening is that
1757640	1763280	these hinge commitments are changing as a result of rational evaluation so when I
1763280	1767040	wake up in the hospital bed with my arms bandaged and I can't feel my hands in
1767040	1770280	this situation it's perfectly rational for me to doubt whether I still have
1770280	1776000	hands but it's like okay so I've received evidence which has now cast out
1776000	1780280	on whether I have hands but but hinge commitments are supposed to be exempt
1780280	1784240	from doubt exempt from rational justification so how is it possible
1784240	1790240	for hinge commitments to change in this manner you know that that like giving
1790240	1793600	up the belief that I have hands in that situation looks like an almost
1793600	1798600	paradigmatic example of change due to rational evaluation so how does the hinge
1798720	1805200	epistemologist account for this sort of case well Duncan Prichard has proposed
1805200	1809880	an approach to hinge epistemology that he argues solves many of these problems
1809880	1815800	Prichard suggests that all hinge commitments follow from a commitment to
1815800	1820840	what he calls the uber hinge commitment the uber hinge commitment is the
1820840	1826840	proposition I am not radically and fundamentally in error this is the
1826840	1831680	single basic hinge commitment which all people must share other hinge
1831680	1836480	commitments are merely expressions of this more general uber hinge commitment
1836480	1842840	they are how the uber hinge commitment manifests in particular contexts suppose
1842840	1846720	for example that it would you know suppose it would somehow true that I
1846720	1851320	don't have hands right now as I'm typing the script for this on the computer in
1851320	1854800	that case I would have to be radically and fundamentally in error something
1854800	1859240	would have gone deeply wrong with my belief-forming processes but you know I
1859240	1862440	take it for granted that I'm not radically and fundamentally in error I
1862440	1866280	have to take this for granted in order to sensibly investigate anything there
1866280	1870640	would be no point undertaking an investigation if I could not trust my
1870640	1874720	capacities to investigate but I can only trust my capacities to investigate if
1874720	1879720	I take it that I'm not radically and fundamentally in error so this uber
1879720	1885440	hinge commitment grounds the rest of my inquiries the the uber hinge
1885440	1891080	commitment is universal but of course different circumstances in conjunction
1891080	1895360	with the uber hinge commitment will lead us to form more specific hinge
1895360	1901080	commitments my present circumstances lead to the hinge commitment I have hands
1901080	1904680	but if I were to wake up in the hospital bed my circumstances would be
1904680	1908840	different so the uber hinge commitment would require different things of me so
1908840	1912880	this neatly deals with the problem that hinge commitments seem to change over
1912880	1919320	time right the the uber hinge commitment remains in place so like right now I
1919320	1924920	have hands that's not open to genuine doubt because to deny that I have hands
1924920	1929040	I'd have to take myself to be radically and fundamentally in error contrary to
1929040	1933640	the uber hinge but this need not be the case in all possible
1933680	1938800	circumstances right there are circumstances where I have hands could be
1938800	1944440	genuinely doubted but with the uber hinge still in place what what cannot
1944440	1949440	like what fundamentally cannot be doubted is the the uber hinge Pritchard
1949440	1954080	argues that this understanding of the histology hinge epistemology allows us
1954080	1958880	to address the challenge of relativism so the key point is that not just
1958880	1963680	anything can count as a hinge commitment you know in particular merely
1963680	1967280	having the attitude of certainty to a proposition does not make it a hinge
1967280	1974440	commitment our hinge commitments are only those claims that manifest the uber
1974440	1979080	hinge commitment so I mean in a sense this will still involve a kind of
1979080	1983200	relativism because there's the universal uber hinge commitment and then other
1983200	1987000	hinge commitments will be relative to different circumstances but crucially
1987000	1991240	this does not entail that you know disagreements are going to be rationally
1991240	1995400	irresolvable so take a case where two people are debating the same topic so
1995400	1999440	I'm debating whether creationism ought to be taught in schools as an
1999440	2004280	alternative to the modern evolutionary synthesis the creationist can say that
2004280	2009120	she is certain of the Bible even so I mean that's not gonna be a hinge
2009120	2015400	commitment so both myself and the creationist clearly share various
2015400	2019720	practices these are going to be everyday behaviors like eating food driving
2019720	2024360	cars and so on I mean we're both concerned with the education system of
2024360	2028920	the same country so we share a society we share various practices within that
2028920	2034280	society so we must have a great deal of common ground and of course we both
2034280	2039160	share the uber hinge commitment we both take it I am not radically and
2039160	2043680	fundamentally in error but in that case we should expect substantial overlap in
2043680	2047880	our beliefs in our beliefs about how the external world works in our common sense
2047880	2051560	beliefs about what we observe on a day-to-day basis so yeah the creationist
2051560	2055560	can claim to be certain that the Bible is the infallible world of God word of
2055560	2061240	God but mere certainty does not make something a hinge commitment because
2061240	2067440	like even so like suppose the Bible turned out not to be the word of God
2067440	2071880	would this mean that the creationist is radically and fundamentally in error
2071880	2076280	well no because the vast majority of her beliefs and practices don't actually
2076280	2080040	have anything to do with the Bible when the creationist gets into a car and
2080040	2083720	drives to the grocery store her picture of the world is only tangentially related
2083720	2089280	to the Bible if related at all so that the real sort of challenge of
2089280	2094720	relativism is the idea that there can be disagreements that cannot be rationally
2094720	2099120	resolved if if you accept relativism you have to grant that people with
2099120	2102600	fundamentally different worldviews might be equally rational and that there's
2102600	2107240	nothing that we can say to them that would compel them at least rationally
2107240	2112080	compel them to change their minds but on Pritchard's view everybody shares the
2112080	2116120	same fundamental hinge commitment and everybody shares a variety of practices
2116120	2121120	which gives us significant common ground so there's no reason to expect that I
2121120	2126480	would be unable to present evidence to the creationist that would in fact
2126520	2131280	connect with the creationist's worldview and that would rationally compel the
2131280	2138680	creationist to agree with me. Appealing to the Uber hinge commitment can also
2138680	2142200	so appealing to the Uber hinge commitment can resolve the problem of
2142200	2147160	changing hinges and the problem of relativism what about skepticism this
2147160	2152520	this big challenge well here we run into the problem that the Uber hinge
2152640	2157040	commitment is itself held without justification so the hinge epistemologist
2157040	2160320	is going to need some other way to you know distinguish her view from the
2160320	2166560	from the skeptic so as as Pritchard sees it skepticism assumes what he calls the
2166560	2171720	universality of rational evaluation basically the skeptic assumes that
2171720	2176720	there are universal rational evaluations where all of one's beliefs are
2176720	2182400	rationally evaluated all at once what the skeptic tries to do is step outside
2182520	2187040	of all inquiries suspend all presuppositions and give a general
2187040	2192040	rational evaluation of all of them bringing them all into doubt when the
2192040	2195920	skeptic says that a particular claim is not justified this is a kind of
2195920	2202800	rational evaluation. So the skeptical argument like it rests on the claim
2202800	2205720	that you know if I don't know that I'm not a brain of that I don't know that P
2205720	2209520	where you know the argument asks us to consider the basis of any beliefs about
2209520	2212640	the world whether they be everyday beliefs or scientific beliefs or
2212640	2216360	religious beliefs or anything else you know can can the basis of our beliefs
2216360	2221000	exclude skeptical scenarios like the brain in the VAT scenario it thereby
2221000	2226560	seeks a universal rational evaluation of those beliefs by contrast the hinge
2226560	2231440	epistemologist proposes that hinge commitments are exempt from rational
2231440	2235920	evaluation in particular the the Uber hinge that Uber hinge commitment is
2235920	2239800	non-optional it's non-optional because again as we saw in order for me to
2239800	2243840	perform a rational evaluation I must trust my rational capacities so I must
2243840	2249000	assume that I'm not radically in error. So it's perfectly legitimate to doubt
2249000	2253320	particular beliefs in particular contexts where the skeptic goes wrong is
2253320	2258400	that she tries to generalize this she tries to doubt beliefs across the board
2258400	2263360	but why suppose that this is legitimate I mean that's a substantive
2263360	2268400	theoretical assumption that the hinge epistemologist denies so as Pritchard
2268400	2274080	puts it I quote the locality of our everyday rational evaluations is not an
2274080	2279160	incidental feature of these practices as if we were merely lacking in time or
2279160	2284280	imagination but rather essential to what it is to undertake a rational
2284280	2290160	evaluation. Okay so the skeptic and the hinge epistemologist agree that hinge
2290200	2293800	commitments are groundless where they disagree is that the skeptic takes it
2293800	2297160	that we can genuinely doubt such commitments and we can we can perform
2297160	2301360	this rational evaluation of them but the hinge epistemologist the groundlessness
2301360	2305200	of such commitments is precisely what shields them from rational evaluation.
2305200	2309800	I mean in a sense we can so there are two ways that a belief can fail to have
2309800	2314520	justification it might have no justification because it is unjustified
2314520	2318720	where you know that's a negative rational evaluation it might have no
2318760	2323400	justification because it just has no status as either justified or unjustified
2323400	2326760	and that's what the hinge epistemologist will say of our hinge
2326760	2334040	commitments. So is that convincing well here's just one worry although it there
2334040	2337680	are arguments for radical skepticism that target beliefs across the board like
2337680	2341840	a gripper's trilemma say not all skeptical arguments are intended to be
2341840	2345480	global this is the case for the skeptical argument that we encountered
2345520	2350520	earlier in this video which aims to establish external world skepticism it's
2350520	2355560	not actually obvious in what sense this argument involves a universal rational
2355560	2360320	evaluation because this argument is only targeting a specific subset of our
2360320	2366360	beliefs many beliefs such as beliefs about logic about mathematics about my own
2366360	2371840	mind beliefs about you know our trust in methods of inductive inference and so
2371880	2376240	on are not actually threatened by scenarios like the brain in the bat
2376240	2382920	scenario at least not obviously so so we might object that really this is just
2382920	2388680	another kind of local evaluation like the the external world skeptic does not
2388680	2392640	have to doubt the uber hinge commitment so I can think that my rational
2392640	2396200	capacities are perfectly reliable that you know I have a good understanding of
2396200	2400160	deductive and inductive inference that I can reliably introspect my own mental
2400160	2404920	states it's just well turns out that the external world is not as it seems to
2404920	2409720	be so it's not I don't know it's not obvious that that would involve a
2409720	2415160	doubt of the uber hinge commitment right like maybe we might think that yeah I
2415160	2421080	can have I can have sort of better reasons so you know you know perception
2421080	2427320	is is not perfectly reliable obviously right everybody accepts that on the
2427320	2430840	other hand there are many many other capacities beyond perception that I use
2430840	2435240	for forming beliefs and maybe those other capacities can cast greater doubt on
2435240	2439760	perception right why not that seems to be what's going on in the the argument
2439760	2445400	for external world skepticism now obviously you know a Wittgensteinian
2445400	2450120	would object to this solipsistic sort of picture but there's the question is
2450120	2452880	whether there's anything in hinge epistemology in itself that rules this
2453000	2459000	out and certainly if the issue with skepticism is universal is that it tries
2459000	2462560	to perform a universal rational evaluation it's not clear that that's going
2462560	2469800	to work as an objection to to external world skepticism all right then well
2469800	2478120	that was hinge epistemology so I'm gonna leave the video there I hope you
2478120	2487840	found that interesting and I will see you next time right goodbye
