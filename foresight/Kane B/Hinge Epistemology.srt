00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
Hello YouTube! In this video I'm going to outline hinge epistemology, an approach

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,000
to knowledge and justification that has its roots in Wittgenstein's book On

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,160
Certainty. Now I want to be clear from the outset that the goal of this video is

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,040
not to explain Wittgenstein's own views, which are very much open to

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,720
interpretation, rather we're going to look at how hinge epistemology has been

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,240
developed in contemporary epistemology. I'm going to focus in particular on the

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,100
work of Duncan Pritchard. Okay, so first of all we need to consider

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,560
skepticism. Hinge epistemology is often sort of initially developed at least as

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,600
a response to skepticism. The skeptic aims to call into question all of our

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,080
beliefs, or at least a very large class of our beliefs. So here's a classic

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,880
argument for skepticism. If I don't know that not S, I don't know that P, I don't

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:02,040
know that not S, so I don't know that P, where S is a skeptical hypothesis, like

13
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,200
the hypothesis that I'm a brain in a vat, or that I'm dreaming, or that I'm a

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Boltzmann brain. You can see my previous video for a discussion of Boltzmann

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,960
brains. P is a claim about the external world, like I have hands, right? If I

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,360
don't know that I'm not a brain in a vat, I don't know that I have hands. I don't

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,800
know I'm not a brain in a vat, so I don't know I have hands. In general I don't

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,680
know whether there are any external objects at all. If this argument is

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,360
successful it throws doubt on basically all our common-sense beliefs about the

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,600
external world. Now it was noticed by philosophers like GE Moore that there is

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,080
something a bit odd about this kind of argument. Moore responded that surely a

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,720
proposition like I know I have hands is is more certain, more secure than almost

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,520
any other proposition. There's nothing that could be more obvious than that I

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,800
know I have hands. So Moore argued that no philosophical argument, which you know

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,160
I mean a philosophical argument will inevitably appeal to premises less

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,600
certain than the premise I know I have hands, no argument like that should lead

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,480
me to reject the claim that I have hands. Moore famously responded to this by

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,400
simply holding up his hands saying you know here's one hand here's another so

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,600
there are two external objects so the external world exists you know you just

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,200
sort of flip the argument around right here's one hand here's another so

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,920
clearly I'm not a brain in a vat. Again I have a whole video discussing Moore's

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,440
argument that I'll link in the comments. So it was this sort of Mauryan kind of

33
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,960
response that prompted Wittgenstein's initial reflections on certainty.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Wittgenstein agreed with Moore that a proposition like I have hands is held

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,680
with a kind of certainty even so Wittgenstein felt that there was something

36
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:05,080
odd about asserting the proposition I know that I have hands and the key the

37
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,000
key problem here is that in ordinary circumstances claims that we have

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,560
knowledge or indeed that we fail to have knowledge makes sense only where there

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,520
might be genuine doubt about what we claim to know or where we can offer some

40
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,200
sort of justification for what we claim to know like if I say I know that P it's

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,880
perfectly legitimate to then ask me well how do you know that P what reasons can

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,960
you cite to justify P but in ordinary circumstances these sorts of questions

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,080
about you know doubts and reasons and justification they just don't arise when

44
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,280
it comes to a claim like I have hands I mean you know what what sort of possible

45
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,520
justification could be given for the claim that I have hands well I mean when

46
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,280
Moore responded to the skeptic he simply held up his hands and said here are two

47
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,800
hands so you know Moore must be assuming that he can justify the claim

48
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,120
that he has hands by perceiving his hands and I mean you know you might think

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,440
okay yeah well surely you know like if you if you ask for a justification for

50
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,320
the claim that I have hands then well I know that I have hands via perception

51
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,120
right I perceive that I have hands maybe that's the justification but

52
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,240
Wittgenstein says there this isn't gonna work because well as he says I quote if a

53
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,440
blind man were to ask me have you got two hands I should not make sure by

54
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,880
looking if I were to have any doubt of it then I don't know why I should trust

55
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,800
my eyes for why shouldn't I test my eyes by looking to find out whether I

56
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,560
whether I see my two hands what is to be tested by what so basically if I were

57
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,960
to have like genuine doubt about whether or not I have two hands then I wouldn't

58
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,840
be able to rely on my visual impressions to test this because you know if I'm

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,120
doubting if I'm calling into question the existence of my hands if I'm calling

60
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,640
into question something as obvious as that then I'm also probably you know I

61
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,600
should also be calling into question the testimony of my eyes you know I'm

62
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,320
gonna I'm gonna call into question the testimony of anything else like the

63
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,360
claim that I have hands is sort of I'm just as certain of that as I am of the

64
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,880
claim that my eyes are reliable so you know why why shouldn't I instead doubt

65
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,000
my eyes and then check that my eyes are working by looking to see whether I have

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,120
two hands I mean this is actually something that we will sometimes do in

67
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,440
circumstances where you know our vision is impaired like if I'm in a fog or

68
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,480
something I might actually like hold my hands out in front of me and look and

69
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,020
find if I can see them you know like I and then I'm like oh my goodness you

70
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,120
know this is a really thick fog because I don't see my hands there so you know

71
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,080
we the point is is that like the testimony of my if if we're calling

72
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,400
into question the test whether or not I have hands I'm gonna be calling into

73
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,720
question whether or not my eyes are trustworthy so I can't test whether or

74
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,160
not I have hands by by like looking to see whether or not my hands are there

75
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,400
that at least that's not a genuine justification yeah so there's no way to

76
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,920
test this proposition I have hands so questions of doubt can't really arise I

77
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:36,280
mean there are situations of course where genuine doubt can arise so if for

78
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,560
example I have been in a serious car accident I wake up in a hospital

79
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,360
afterwards I find that my arms are bandaged I can't see my hands in that

80
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,320
situation I might genuinely doubt whether I have hands and since you know I

81
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,400
trust my visual perception I can remove the bandages to confirm whether there

82
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,120
are hands there and this is of course a procedure that I can perform that resolves

83
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,120
my doubt in that situation but for the radical skeptic there is no procedure

84
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,200
that could resolve her doubt there is nothing I can do there's nothing I can

85
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,360
perceive that would resolve the doubt about whether or not I have hands which

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,560
for Wittgenstein means that that's not a genuine doubt at all I mean what like

87
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,320
what would it be you know what would it be to genuinely doubt whether I have

88
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,520
hands well maybe it would be that like I wouldn't flinch if I were to see a knife

89
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,680
coming towards my hands of course the this the external world skeptic doesn't

90
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,440
give up these ordinary behaviors if you if you start to try to stab her hands

91
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,680
she's gonna move her hands and if somebody really didn't flinch when they

92
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,120
saw a knife coming towards their hands no doubt their behavior would quickly be

93
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,040
corrected right the knife would hit their hands they'd feel pain and they'd

94
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,520
they'd start behaving accordingly okay so with that in mind then let's say

95
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,680
let's say that in ordinary circumstances I was to claim I know I have hands well

96
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,160
what possible justification could be given for this I mean I mean nothing

97
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,240
right I can't say well I can't justify that claim by saying that I see my hands

98
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,360
because if I'm doubting whether I have hands then I'm not gonna trust my eyes

99
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,800
so you know I can't appeal to the testimony of my eyes in the same goes

100
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,400
for any other perceptual capacity there's no there's no justification available

101
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:34,160
here so you know there's no there's no justification there's no it seems that

102
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,640
there's no there's no real possibility of doubt like for knowledge to be possible

103
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,280
there must be the there must be the space for for doubt and justification like

104
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,360
when I when I say I know that P this is sort of presupposing the the

105
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,020
possibility that there are like circumstances where I don't know that

106
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,680
P or like maybe I don't know the P right and and what I'm doing is giving a

107
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,440
justification for P knowledge is based on evidential grounds like when I claim

108
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,920
to know something I must be able to cite evidence for it and that evidence you

109
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,360
know might be undermined in which case my claim to knowledge would be undermined

110
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,040
so you know in ordinary circumstances the idea would be that knowledge claims

111
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,120
are appropriate when we have you know arrived at some claim through investigation

112
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,480
when we can when we can ask questions like how do you know but but when it

113
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,960
comes to a claim like I have hands this sort of doubt and sighting of evidence

114
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,480
and investigation this just isn't part of it right I don't investigate whether

115
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:46,300
or not I have hands I just do things with my hands so the idea is that I have

116
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,920
hands has this sort of special status it's a proposition with a very special

117
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,360
status or claim with a very special status it's a a hinge commitment or a

118
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,920
hinge proposition that Wittgenstein calls these commitments hinges because they

119
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,600
are the presuppositions around which the rest of our language and epistemic

120
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:17,160
practices turn the the thought is that there are certain commitments that just

121
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,360
have to be assumed in order for various practices to be possible just like the

122
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,640
hinges of a door must stay in place in order for the door to step to stay up

123
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,280
and to open and close like in order for the door to turn the hinges have to stay

124
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:37,720
in place hinge commitments are required for practices for various practices to

125
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,760
be possible in particular hinge commitments are required in order to

126
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,720
for the practice of rational evaluation to be possible so like rational

127
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,440
evaluation would be like doubt justification giving evidence in order

128
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,120
for that practice to occur there have to be certain commitments that are in place

129
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,640
that make it possible but this means that those commitments cannot themselves be

130
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,040
subject to this rational evaluation they cannot themselves be called into doubt

131
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,640
so so like rational evaluation involves doubt okay I asked myself could this

132
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,240
proposition be false right like I I believe that all you know the all

133
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,840
species share a common ancestor okay but you know why do I believe that could

134
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,600
that be false okay then I then I start to engage in a rational evaluation I

135
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,720
search for reasons to accept or reject the proposition hinges must be exempt

136
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,120
from this sort of doubt because the very act of raising doubts and performing

137
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,720
investigations is itself predicated upon these hinges so since hinge

138
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,920
commitments are outside of rational evaluation they do not themselves have

139
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,400
any rational support so we saw this in the case of I have hands in ordinary

140
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,880
circumstances it wouldn't make sense to try to offer a justification for this

141
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:04,200
claim so hinge commitments are neither justified nor unjustified they are

142
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,960
neither known nor unknown right so so they're not justified they're not known

143
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,600
so actually when I say something like I know I have hands that would be again

144
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,800
in ordinary circumstances at least that would be kind of you know sort of a

145
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,680
misuse a misuse of language right it would be the mistake is is that no this

146
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,920
just isn't it doesn't have a kind of this sort of epistemic status for the

147
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,920
very same reason they can't be doubted if I was to ask a question like what

148
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,160
reason is there to believe a hinge commitment that would be a mistake

149
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:48,320
because hinge commitments are what enable the giving of reasons yeah I mean so if

150
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,400
I were to doubt whether I have hands that would just call into question the

151
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,480
whole practice of making claims or doubting claims like even even to doubt

152
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,520
requires a background of assumptions such as I have hands and of course this

153
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,480
accounts for the special kind of certainty that is associated with hinge

154
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,720
commitments hinge commitments cannot be doubted but at the same time we can't

155
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,160
offer a compelling argument for them the certainty of hinge commitments is not

156
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,560
based on our being able to offer a proof for them it's based on the fact that

157
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,880
these are the presuppositions that make inquiry possible or indeed that make our

158
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,880
general form of life possible our general practice as possible okay so let's

159
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,160
sort of see this maybe with another example so consider these two claims so

160
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,560
we have a claim like there is milk in the fridge and then we have a claim like

161
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,800
there are external objects now in the case of there is milk in the fridge there

162
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,720
are very straightforward empirical procedures for establishing this

163
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,720
establishing claim M here I know what to do to test it one way or the other okay

164
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,320
I go to the fridge I open the door I search for a bottle of a particular

165
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,800
size and shape and if I find such a bottle I'm gonna take it that M is true

166
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,040
I'll be like okay I've established that there is milk in the fridge now

167
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,960
obviously further questions could be raised here like how do I know that the

168
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,840
bottle really contains milk how do I know that you know my brother isn't

169
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,240
pulling some sort of prank and he's replaced the milk with something else

170
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,400
but again there are straightforward procedures for answering such questions

171
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,080
if I am really questioning whether or not my brother has pulled this prank I

172
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,160
can you know pour the milk pour the liquid out of the bottle and then I can

173
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,920
taste it and so on so again you know straightforward empirical procedures

174
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,600
for testing this claim M what about claim E that there are external objects

175
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
well clearly this cannot be approached in the same kind of way no

176
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,560
observation could establish E it won't help to take you know a microscope and

177
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,720
look through it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna have a microscope and be like

178
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,840
okay I've looked through the microscope and there it is an external object the

179
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,200
difference of course is that in accepting that there are external objects

180
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,680
I'm I'm not accepting a straightforward empirical claim I'm instead I'm

181
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,480
accepting a sort of way of inquiring I'm you know this is the sort of claim that

182
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,680
allows me to gather evidence for and against other propositions and so this

183
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,800
is what the this is a hinge commitment right it's hinge commitments are what

184
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,360
allows to gather evidence for and against other propositions so I might say

185
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,440
something like you know there are three chairs in this room or I might say

186
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,000
that the universe is 13.8 billion years old I can assess evidence for these

187
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,400
claims crucially however this evidence like this this evidence that presupposes

188
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,800
that there are external objects and it it can't the evidence can't provide

189
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,720
support to the hinge commitment because the hinge commitment is what is making

190
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,720
possible the gathering of evidence in the first place so any any justification

191
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,640
given of a hinge commitment would be less firm than the hinge commitment

192
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,280
itself so like I can cite evidence for the claim that the universe has existed

193
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:12,600
for 13.8 billion years now given that I am significantly younger than 13.8

194
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,640
billion years this is going to entail that there are external objects there

195
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:23,680
are objects outside my mind objects other than me so you entails E but you

196
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,600
cannot be evidence for E and and evidence for you cannot be evidence for E

197
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,760
because the evidence that bears on you presupposes E all the evidence in

198
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,360
favor of you from physics and chemistry and astronomy and geology would make no

199
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,680
sense without E like we can only bring claims about so if I take the you know

200
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,440
redshifting of starlight or something like that well that's only going to bear

201
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,520
on the evaluation of you if we're assuming E if I'm assuming that you know

202
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,120
there isn't it there are these external objects and I'm not just you know

203
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:01,960
currently dreaming or whatever so that's the idea of hinge commitments so which

204
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,040
propositions which propositions count as the hinge commitments well different

205
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,960
hinge epistemologists are going to have different answers to this but you know

206
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,400
there are some some some general answers we can give here so that some types of

207
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,720
some hinge commitments are going to include sort of specific propositions

208
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,520
about myself and my own experience propositions that express the sort of

209
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,200
basic pieces of evidence I have from my own experience like I have hands my name

210
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,880
is Kane I am speaking English I have never been to the moon then there are

211
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,840
going to be more general claims bearing on my sort of general worldview and how

212
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,640
I form beliefs so there is an external world sense perception is reliable

213
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,880
reasoning is reliable the universe is older than I am and so on right where

214
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,280
well okay if you like my channel you can support me on patreon where I upload

215
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,280
bonus videos where I offer my own thoughts about the topics I talk about

216
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,720
on the on these on these videos or a one-off donation on PayPal I also offer

217
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,160
private tutoring so email if you're interested in that private tutoring in

218
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,400
philosophy and I have a discord link store this will be in the description

219
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,280
right then so we've seen the role that hinge commitments play in inquiry but

220
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,960
what exactly is the nature of these hinge commitments well a standard

221
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,080
interpretation is that hinge commitments are something like rules they're not

222
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,840
exactly you know they have the form of descriptive propositions but really

223
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,480
they're more like rules so as Wittgenstein says their role is like

224
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,280
that of rules of a game and the game can be learned purely practically without

225
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,520
learning any explicit rules so yeah hinge commitment is going to appear to be a

226
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,920
descriptive claim like if I say I have hands that has the appearance of merely

227
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,640
describing the arrangement of objects in the world it's like okay there is

228
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,080
this thing a hand which is attached to this person so descriptive claim but

229
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,120
really what's happening when we say something like I have hands is we are

230
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,480
we're sort of stating conditions that must be in place in order for certain

231
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,720
practices to occur or we're stating the rules of certain practices so under

232
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,240
normal circumstances I wouldn't explicitly say something like I have

233
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,560
hands in philosophical contexts we use this seemingly descriptive claim to

234
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,480
express certain rules that govern our practices and these rules are manifested

235
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,040
in our actions so when I was writing the script for this video I was typing on my

236
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:49,200
computer and to do this I I had to have hands I use my hands to type on the

237
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,600
computer and maybe I find that a letter doesn't come up and then I wonder like

238
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,760
does this key still work I try it again I tap it with my hands right I'm using

239
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,360
my hands so my behavior with respect to the computer is governed by certain

240
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,440
rules and I need not be explicitly aware of these rules like I don't have to

241
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,880
consciously think to myself that I have hands in order to use my hands right

242
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,720
often I'll just use my hands I won't I won't sort of have some proposition in

243
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,360
my head that says I have hands I'll just use my hands indeed this rule is not

244
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,760
something that even has to be taught at least not in the way that I was taught

245
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,760
say the theory of evolution by natural selection like I'm not taught the

246
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,120
proposition that I have hands I'm taught how to use my hands to do various

247
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:47,640
things and in in being taught these practices I adopt these rules these

248
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,760
hinge commitments Danielle Moyle-Sharic put it like this the hinge certainty

249
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,760
verbalized as I have a body is a disposition of a living creature which

250
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,680
manifests itself in her acting in the certainty of having a body so the

251
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,880
certainty is of these rules it's certainly these rules these commitments is

252
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,880
manifested in our actions the fact that I'm acting just shows that I accept these

253
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,200
rules that I'm conforming to these rules and this is why even when I recognize

254
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,120
that there is no rational basis for the truth of the proposition I have hands

255
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,040
like even when I recognize that I have no reasons for this as a belief my

256
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,760
certainty in it is unchanged it will continue to function as a rule that

257
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,160
guides my behavior I can notice that there's no rational basis for the belief

258
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,240
that I have hands and then I sit down and start typing things on my computer

259
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,200
right so this approach gives voice to the worry that skepticism as the

260
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,160
philosopher conceives of it is in some way inert or meaningless so as we noted

261
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,440
earlier there are circumstances where I will experience genuine doubt about

262
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,600
whether or not I have hands as when I wake up in a hospital bed after a car

263
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,160
crash I can resolve such doubts by applying certain standard empirical

264
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,760
procedures that I've learned like you know looking under the bandages and then

265
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,920
I see I see the hands there and I'm like oh I might say in relief oh I know I have

266
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:28,280
two hands thank God you know this isn't the kind of thing the skeptic is

267
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,840
talking about of course the skeptic tries to ask for a rational justification of

268
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,040
our whole world view and tries to cast doubt on whether I have hands even in

269
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,640
ordinary context but the skeptics doubt it's a doubt that makes no difference

270
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,560
whatsoever the skeptic doesn't change her actions she continues to use her

271
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,840
hands just as the rest of us do and the skeptic doesn't propose any procedure

272
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,720
for resolving the doubt indeed by her lights there can be no procedure for

273
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,280
resolving the doubt because the the skeptical hypotheses are designed to be

274
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,480
consistent with all possible experience so yeah so it's not it's not really a

275
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,840
doubt at all I mean I can ponder these skeptical arguments all I like but at

276
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,960
the end of the day I still know how to use a keyboard and it's this knowing how

277
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:17,080
to use a keyboard that manifests the hinge commitment that I have hands so

278
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,640
that is the basic idea of hinge epistemology now there are three immediate

279
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:30,560
challenges to this kind of approach so the first the first challenge is whether

280
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,480
this sort of view actually provides a response to skepticism we've talked about

281
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,800
skepticism a lot and contrasted the hinge the hinge epistemologist with the

282
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,480
skeptic but we might worry whether whether the difference is as great as

283
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,080
it seems to be so notice that the hinge epistemologist identifies certain

284
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,920
commitments as being the hinge commitments and there are two relevant

285
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,680
features of hinge commitments as the hinge epistemologist sees it first they

286
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,480
are the presuppositions on which the rest of our inquiries are built they're

287
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,320
the you know the hinges on which the rest of our practices turn second they are

288
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,960
not justified they are not known no reason can be given in support of them

289
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,600
no justification can be given for them but then you might think well hang on a

290
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,760
minute isn't this exactly what a skeptic would say like all of our beliefs

291
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,400
rest on these presuppositions that cannot be justified so all of our beliefs

292
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,440
are ultimately unsupported now of course a hinge epistemologist will reject this

293
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,320
final inference right all of our beliefs rest on propositions that cannot be

294
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,080
justified sure it does not follow that all of our beliefs are unsupported we

295
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,320
have to pay attention to what it means to give support to a belief this is a

296
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,280
matter of giving reasons of engaging in investigation of assuaging doubts but

297
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,360
this activity presupposes certain hinge commitments the trouble is is that even

298
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,440
a skeptic might be willing to accept what we could call you know conditional

299
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,360
justification or conditional support so the skeptic might accept that look if

300
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,960
you take certain propositions for granted say the proposition that

301
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,280
perception presents a generally reliable picture of the external world if I take

302
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,800
that for granted then I can give support to further propositions on that

303
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:32,000
basis like if we take P for granted we can get ourselves to Q the issue for

304
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,080
the skeptic is that there's no justification for P but then I mean but

305
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,400
then like where exactly is the line between the hinge epistemology and the

306
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,640
skeptic here is it just that they have like different attitudes to these

307
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,080
presuppositions so like both of them seem to agree that okay there are certain

308
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,240
presuppositions that you can make which like there are certain presuppositions

309
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,800
we make which you know which then allows us to engage in further inquiry you

310
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,840
know which then makes possible all of these other practices or which you know

311
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,920
like if we take these presuppositions for granted then you know this practice of

312
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,480
justification is possible so okay looks like we both agree on that and more

313
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,720
over they both agree that these presuppositions are themselves without

314
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,040
justification is it just that the hinge epistemologist is okay with this

315
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,280
whereas the skeptic is not okay with it like it's just a difference in attitude

316
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,800
so this is one sort of worry that like okay maybe the line is starting to look

317
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:37,840
quite thin we'll come back to this point later so second challenge is that hinge

318
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,600
epistemology appears to be committed to epistemic relativism basic problem here

319
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,200
is well it looks like people could have could adopt very different hinge

320
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,760
commitments which would lead to different systems of justification suppose

321
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,320
that Verity selects as a hinge commitment that the Bible is the infallible

322
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,040
world of word of God Verity is fervently religious she interprets all other

323
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,640
practices in terms of her literal Christian faith her literalist faith as a

324
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,480
result she endorses young earth creationism as an account of the history

325
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,480
of life now since the Bible is a hinge commitment for Verity it's not open to

326
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,400
doubt or justification in which case it looks like there's no room for debate

327
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,320
with Verity Verity is not making any kind of rational error you know all I can

328
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,240
say is well we have different hinge commitments and our hinge commitments

329
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,880
are immovable so I mean there's a worry that like hinge hinge epistemology

330
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,600
seems to sort of close down rational inquiry and there's also a worry that

331
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,600
it sort of licenses a kind of just dogmatism you know like we just end up

332
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,280
accepting certain things and they're kind of quarantined from from criticism

333
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,800
and justification and of course this this only makes this this specter of

334
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,000
skepticism more vivid because you know we can recognize that Verity's hinge

335
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,960
commitments have led her to a radically mistaken view of the world so we're like

336
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,680
okay these hinge commitments have led somebody massively astray in which case

337
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,040
we might wonder well why shouldn't that be the same for our own hinge

338
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,800
commitments then I mean just insisting that hinge commitments can't be open to

339
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,880
doubt is not a particularly comforting response here you know it's like there

340
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,920
seems to be something defective about the way that Verity the creationist

341
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,600
justifies her worldview if I recognize that the only difference between us is

342
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,320
that we happen to have different hinge commitments I mean maybe my worldview is

343
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,040
defective also you know this is the worry a third problem is that it seems

344
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,320
that hinge commitments can change over time and in response to new evidence so

345
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,920
I have hands is currently a hinge commitment but we've already seen that

346
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,120
there are circumstances where I might genuinely come to doubt this what is it

347
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,200
that makes me doubt this well it looks like it's the changing evidence so you

348
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,680
know or think about a statement like no human being has ever walked on the moon

349
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,840
that was a hinge commitment prior to the 1960s these days we think it's simply

350
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,640
false now the trouble here is that it looks like what's happening is that

351
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,280
these hinge commitments are changing as a result of rational evaluation so when I

352
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,040
wake up in the hospital bed with my arms bandaged and I can't feel my hands in

353
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,280
this situation it's perfectly rational for me to doubt whether I still have

354
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,000
hands but it's like okay so I've received evidence which has now cast out

355
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,280
on whether I have hands but but hinge commitments are supposed to be exempt

356
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,240
from doubt exempt from rational justification so how is it possible

357
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,240
for hinge commitments to change in this manner you know that that like giving

358
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,600
up the belief that I have hands in that situation looks like an almost

359
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,600
paradigmatic example of change due to rational evaluation so how does the hinge

360
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,200
epistemologist account for this sort of case well Duncan Prichard has proposed

361
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,880
an approach to hinge epistemology that he argues solves many of these problems

362
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,800
Prichard suggests that all hinge commitments follow from a commitment to

363
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,840
what he calls the uber hinge commitment the uber hinge commitment is the

364
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,840
proposition I am not radically and fundamentally in error this is the

365
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,680
single basic hinge commitment which all people must share other hinge

366
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,480
commitments are merely expressions of this more general uber hinge commitment

367
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,840
they are how the uber hinge commitment manifests in particular contexts suppose

368
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,720
for example that it would you know suppose it would somehow true that I

369
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,320
don't have hands right now as I'm typing the script for this on the computer in

370
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,800
that case I would have to be radically and fundamentally in error something

371
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,240
would have gone deeply wrong with my belief-forming processes but you know I

372
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,440
take it for granted that I'm not radically and fundamentally in error I

373
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,280
have to take this for granted in order to sensibly investigate anything there

374
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,640
would be no point undertaking an investigation if I could not trust my

375
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,720
capacities to investigate but I can only trust my capacities to investigate if

376
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,720
I take it that I'm not radically and fundamentally in error so this uber

377
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,440
hinge commitment grounds the rest of my inquiries the the uber hinge

378
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,080
commitment is universal but of course different circumstances in conjunction

379
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,360
with the uber hinge commitment will lead us to form more specific hinge

380
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,080
commitments my present circumstances lead to the hinge commitment I have hands

381
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,680
but if I were to wake up in the hospital bed my circumstances would be

382
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,840
different so the uber hinge commitment would require different things of me so

383
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,880
this neatly deals with the problem that hinge commitments seem to change over

384
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,320
time right the the uber hinge commitment remains in place so like right now I

385
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,920
have hands that's not open to genuine doubt because to deny that I have hands

386
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,040
I'd have to take myself to be radically and fundamentally in error contrary to

387
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,640
the uber hinge but this need not be the case in all possible

388
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,800
circumstances right there are circumstances where I have hands could be

389
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:24,440
genuinely doubted but with the uber hinge still in place what what cannot

390
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,440
like what fundamentally cannot be doubted is the the uber hinge Pritchard

391
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,080
argues that this understanding of the histology hinge epistemology allows us

392
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,880
to address the challenge of relativism so the key point is that not just

393
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,680
anything can count as a hinge commitment you know in particular merely

394
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,280
having the attitude of certainty to a proposition does not make it a hinge

395
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:54,440
commitment our hinge commitments are only those claims that manifest the uber

396
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,080
hinge commitment so I mean in a sense this will still involve a kind of

397
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,200
relativism because there's the universal uber hinge commitment and then other

398
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,000
hinge commitments will be relative to different circumstances but crucially

399
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,240
this does not entail that you know disagreements are going to be rationally

400
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,400
irresolvable so take a case where two people are debating the same topic so

401
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,440
I'm debating whether creationism ought to be taught in schools as an

402
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,280
alternative to the modern evolutionary synthesis the creationist can say that

403
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,120
she is certain of the Bible even so I mean that's not gonna be a hinge

404
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,400
commitment so both myself and the creationist clearly share various

405
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,720
practices these are going to be everyday behaviors like eating food driving

406
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,360
cars and so on I mean we're both concerned with the education system of

407
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,920
the same country so we share a society we share various practices within that

408
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:54,280
society so we must have a great deal of common ground and of course we both

409
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:59,160
share the uber hinge commitment we both take it I am not radically and

410
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,680
fundamentally in error but in that case we should expect substantial overlap in

411
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,880
our beliefs in our beliefs about how the external world works in our common sense

412
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,560
beliefs about what we observe on a day-to-day basis so yeah the creationist

413
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,560
can claim to be certain that the Bible is the infallible world of God word of

414
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:21,240
God but mere certainty does not make something a hinge commitment because

415
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:27,440
like even so like suppose the Bible turned out not to be the word of God

416
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,880
would this mean that the creationist is radically and fundamentally in error

417
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,280
well no because the vast majority of her beliefs and practices don't actually

418
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,040
have anything to do with the Bible when the creationist gets into a car and

419
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,720
drives to the grocery store her picture of the world is only tangentially related

420
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:49,280
to the Bible if related at all so that the real sort of challenge of

421
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,720
relativism is the idea that there can be disagreements that cannot be rationally

422
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,120
resolved if if you accept relativism you have to grant that people with

423
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,600
fundamentally different worldviews might be equally rational and that there's

424
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,240
nothing that we can say to them that would compel them at least rationally

425
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,080
compel them to change their minds but on Pritchard's view everybody shares the

426
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,120
same fundamental hinge commitment and everybody shares a variety of practices

427
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,120
which gives us significant common ground so there's no reason to expect that I

428
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:26,480
would be unable to present evidence to the creationist that would in fact

429
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,280
connect with the creationist's worldview and that would rationally compel the

430
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,680
creationist to agree with me. Appealing to the Uber hinge commitment can also

431
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,200
so appealing to the Uber hinge commitment can resolve the problem of

432
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,160
changing hinges and the problem of relativism what about skepticism this

433
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,520
this big challenge well here we run into the problem that the Uber hinge

434
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,040
commitment is itself held without justification so the hinge epistemologist

435
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,320
is going to need some other way to you know distinguish her view from the

436
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,560
from the skeptic so as as Pritchard sees it skepticism assumes what he calls the

437
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,720
universality of rational evaluation basically the skeptic assumes that

438
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,720
there are universal rational evaluations where all of one's beliefs are

439
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,400
rationally evaluated all at once what the skeptic tries to do is step outside

440
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,040
of all inquiries suspend all presuppositions and give a general

441
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,040
rational evaluation of all of them bringing them all into doubt when the

442
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,920
skeptic says that a particular claim is not justified this is a kind of

443
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,800
rational evaluation. So the skeptical argument like it rests on the claim

444
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,720
that you know if I don't know that I'm not a brain of that I don't know that P

445
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,520
where you know the argument asks us to consider the basis of any beliefs about

446
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,640
the world whether they be everyday beliefs or scientific beliefs or

447
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,360
religious beliefs or anything else you know can can the basis of our beliefs

448
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:01,000
exclude skeptical scenarios like the brain in the VAT scenario it thereby

449
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,560
seeks a universal rational evaluation of those beliefs by contrast the hinge

450
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,440
epistemologist proposes that hinge commitments are exempt from rational

451
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,920
evaluation in particular the the Uber hinge that Uber hinge commitment is

452
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,800
non-optional it's non-optional because again as we saw in order for me to

453
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,840
perform a rational evaluation I must trust my rational capacities so I must

454
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,000
assume that I'm not radically in error. So it's perfectly legitimate to doubt

455
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,320
particular beliefs in particular contexts where the skeptic goes wrong is

456
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:38,400
that she tries to generalize this she tries to doubt beliefs across the board

457
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,360
but why suppose that this is legitimate I mean that's a substantive

458
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,400
theoretical assumption that the hinge epistemologist denies so as Pritchard

459
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,080
puts it I quote the locality of our everyday rational evaluations is not an

460
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,160
incidental feature of these practices as if we were merely lacking in time or

461
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,280
imagination but rather essential to what it is to undertake a rational

462
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:10,160
evaluation. Okay so the skeptic and the hinge epistemologist agree that hinge

463
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,800
commitments are groundless where they disagree is that the skeptic takes it

464
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,160
that we can genuinely doubt such commitments and we can we can perform

465
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,360
this rational evaluation of them but the hinge epistemologist the groundlessness

466
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,200
of such commitments is precisely what shields them from rational evaluation.

467
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,800
I mean in a sense we can so there are two ways that a belief can fail to have

468
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,520
justification it might have no justification because it is unjustified

469
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,720
where you know that's a negative rational evaluation it might have no

470
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,400
justification because it just has no status as either justified or unjustified

471
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,760
and that's what the hinge epistemologist will say of our hinge

472
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:54,040
commitments. So is that convincing well here's just one worry although it there

473
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,680
are arguments for radical skepticism that target beliefs across the board like

474
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,840
a gripper's trilemma say not all skeptical arguments are intended to be

475
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,480
global this is the case for the skeptical argument that we encountered

476
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,520
earlier in this video which aims to establish external world skepticism it's

477
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,560
not actually obvious in what sense this argument involves a universal rational

478
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,320
evaluation because this argument is only targeting a specific subset of our

479
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,360
beliefs many beliefs such as beliefs about logic about mathematics about my own

480
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,840
mind beliefs about you know our trust in methods of inductive inference and so

481
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,240
on are not actually threatened by scenarios like the brain in the bat

482
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,920
scenario at least not obviously so so we might object that really this is just

483
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,680
another kind of local evaluation like the the external world skeptic does not

484
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,640
have to doubt the uber hinge commitment so I can think that my rational

485
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,200
capacities are perfectly reliable that you know I have a good understanding of

486
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,160
deductive and inductive inference that I can reliably introspect my own mental

487
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,920
states it's just well turns out that the external world is not as it seems to

488
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,720
be so it's not I don't know it's not obvious that that would involve a

489
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,160
doubt of the uber hinge commitment right like maybe we might think that yeah I

490
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:21,080
can have I can have sort of better reasons so you know you know perception

491
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:27,320
is is not perfectly reliable obviously right everybody accepts that on the

492
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,840
other hand there are many many other capacities beyond perception that I use

493
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,240
for forming beliefs and maybe those other capacities can cast greater doubt on

494
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,760
perception right why not that seems to be what's going on in the the argument

495
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,400
for external world skepticism now obviously you know a Wittgensteinian

496
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:50,120
would object to this solipsistic sort of picture but there's the question is

497
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,880
whether there's anything in hinge epistemology in itself that rules this

498
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
out and certainly if the issue with skepticism is universal is that it tries

499
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,560
to perform a universal rational evaluation it's not clear that that's going

500
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:09,800
to work as an objection to to external world skepticism all right then well

501
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:18,120
that was hinge epistemology so I'm gonna leave the video there I hope you

502
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:27,840
found that interesting and I will see you next time right goodbye
