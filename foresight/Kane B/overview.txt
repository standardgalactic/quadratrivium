Checking Kane B/Hinge Epistemology.txt
 The discussion revolves around the debate between skeptics and hinge epistemologists regarding the rational evaluability of beliefs. Skeptics, like Descartes, advocate for a universal doubt about all our beliefs, including those we take for granted (hinge commitments), to ensure that our beliefs are not radically mistaken. However, hinge epistemologists argue that some beliefs, known as hinge commitments, are exempt from this universal doubt because they are foundational for rational evaluation itself.

The hinge epistemologist, following John McDowell and Duncan Pritchard, posits that the locality of our rational evaluations is essential and not merely a lack of time or imagination. They claim that to evaluate a belief rationally, one must trust one's own rational capacities, which implies accepting that one is not radically in error (the Uber hinge commitment).

The skeptic's mistake, according to hinge epistemologists, is attempting to doubt all beliefs universally, including this foundational trust. Hinge epistemologists maintain that such foundational beliefs cannot be rationally evaluated because they are groundless but not unjustified; they simply lack the status of being either justified or unjustified.

The video raises a concern that while radical skepticism may target specific subsets of beliefs, like the belief in an external world, it does not necessarily require doubting the Uber hinge commitment. Perception might be accepted as less reliable than other cognitive faculties, and the skeptic's argument may only doubt the reliability of perception, not the broader rational capacities or trust in them.

In summary, the video presents a nuanced view of how skepticism and hinge epistemology address the question of belief justification, with hinge epistemologists emphasizing the importance of certain beliefs as foundational for rational evaluation and skeptics questioning the universality of these accepted beliefs.

Checking Kane B/The Analytic⧸Synthetic Distinction： Quine's Critique.txt
1. W.V.O. Quine's argument against the analytic-synthetic distinction centers on the indeterminacy of translation and meaning, which he outlines in "Two Dogmas of Empiricism."
2. Quine's critique challenges the idea that there are sentences that are true by virtue of their meaning alone (analytic truths) versus those that are true due to empirical facts (synthetic truths).
3. The indeterminacy of translation suggests that we cannot fix a unique interpretation for the meanings of sentences; different interpretations can be equally good.
4. Gries and Strawson attempt to defend the analytic-synthetic distinction by appealing to the notion of synonymy, but Quine argues against this defense.
5. According to Quine, we cannot define synonymy in a way that gives us a clear criterion for analyticity because the meaning of sentences is indeterminate.
6. Instead of analytic and synthetic truths, Quine suggests that all truths are intertwined with both empirical facts and our conceptual framework.
7. The debate over logical truths also arises in this context: while Quine does not deny the existence of logical truths, he points out that their truth presupposes sameness of meaning across different uses (tokens) of language.
8. Without a fixed meaning for expressions, the distinction between logical truths and other kinds of truth becomes blurred.
9. The broader implication is that the notion of sentence meaning is problematic, and the unit of meaning might be better understood as an entire language or theory.
10. Quine's views have significant implications for philosophy of language and epistemology, influencing how we understand meaning, truth, and the relationship between linguistic expressions and empirical reality.
