0	10000	Well, everybody, great to be with you again. My name is Michael Millerman. And today we're going to go over this article called why AI will save the world.
10000	23000	Reading it together with you for the first time, although the author here was on the Lex Friedman show recently and it was a clip from their interview I saw that referred to this article and intrigued me enough to want to read it together with you.
24000	31000	So in just a minute, we'll do that. Like, share, subscribe, visit millermanschool.com for courses on philosophy and politics.
31000	42000	More and more of my students are talking to me these days about the implications of artificial intelligence for sovereignty and for the common good for our basic ideas of political order.
42000	53000	And therefore it's a good idea for us to get more into the details of how some people are speculating about the political and human significance of these new systems.
53000	61000	Okay, so let's begin. The era of artificial intelligence is here and boy are people freaking out.
61000	69000	Fortunately, I'm here to bring the good news. AI will not destroy the world and in fact may save it.
69000	82000	First, the short description of what AI is the application of mathematics and software code to teach computers how to understand, synthesize and generate knowledge in ways similar to how people do it.
82000	88000	AI is a computer program like any other it runs takes input processes and generates output.
88000	101000	AI's output is useful across a wide range of fields, ranging from coding to medicine to law to the creative arts. It is owned by people and controlled by people like any other technology.
101000	111000	So you see very quickly and early on here guarding against the idea that there's something autonomous or sovereign or tyrannical about AI.
111000	116000	It's a tool and like any other tool it works in the hands of people.
116000	130000	He says, let's see a shorter description of what AI isn't killer software and robots that will spring to life and decide to murder the human race, or otherwise ruin everything like you see in the movies.
130000	137000	And even shorter description of what AI could be a way to make everything we care about better.
137000	146000	Okay, so it's not going to be a runaway killer technology, but it might be something that we use to make the world a better place.
146000	160000	Why AI can make everything we care about better. The most validated core conclusion of social science across many decades and thousands of studies is that human intelligence makes a very broad range of life outcomes better.
160000	186000	Smarter people have better outcomes in almost every domain of activity, academic achievement, job performance, occupational status, income, creativity, physical health, longevity, learning new skills, managing complex tasks, leadership, entrepreneurial success, conflict resolution, reading comprehension, financial decision making, understanding others perspectives, creative arts, parenting outcomes, and life satisfaction.
186000	203000	Further, human intelligence is the lever that we have used for millennia to create the world we live in today. Science, technology, math, physics, chemistry, medicine, energy, construction, transportation, communication, art, music, culture, philosophy, ethics, morality.
203000	221000	Without the application of intelligence on all these domains, we would all still be living in mud huts, scratching out a meager existence of subsistence farming. Instead, we have used our intelligence to raise our standard of living on the order of 10,000 times over the last 4,000 years.
221000	237000	What AI offers us is the opportunity to profoundly augment human intelligence, to make all of these outcomes of intelligence and many others from the creation of new medicines, to ways to solve climate change, to technologies to reach the stars, much, much better from here.
237000	257000	AI augmentation of human intelligence has already started. AI is already around us in the form of computer control systems of many kinds, and is now rapidly escalating with AI large language models like chat GPT, and will accelerate very quickly from here if we let it.
257000	278000	In our new era of AI, and here's I guess the vision of what it could be if it is developed to be helpful to humanity as a tool that augments our intelligence and proves our quality of life in our new era of AI, every child will have an AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful.
278000	288000	I should add though, not if it's been trained on human experience in that case, I think it will get won't have these characteristics, certainly won't have any basis on which to model them.
288000	302000	Okay, infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful. The AI tutor will be by each child's side, every step of their development, helping them maximize their potential with the machine version of infinite love.
303000	317000	I have to think about that because I have have some kids of my own. And one of them right now is with his grandma, and they're doing complicated math, you know, Russian, Soviet Jewish grandma type.
317000	335000	Of course, the child is doing math, well, beyond his ears. And I wonder, you know, it's under the pressure somehow, well, when he doesn't crack under the pressure of something other than infinitely compassionate, infinitely patient, infinitely helpful, infinite love.
335000	351000	He develops his mathematical skills and I've seen kids before in swim school, and they train with a teacher who's not infinitely patient and all of that but rather, whose strictness somehow is correlated with their development.
351000	365000	So I just wonder, you know, I have some experience of human tutors and human teachers producing excellent results in their students. And you just wonder, will infinite love and infinite compassion really produce the best outcomes.
365000	378000	It can't doesn't go without saying but it does sound good. Okay, next, every person will have an AI assistant coach mentor trainer advisor therapist, that is infinitely patient infinitely compassionate infinitely knowledgeable and infinitely helpful.
378000	386000	The AI assistant will be present through all of life's opportunities and challenges maximizing every person's outcomes.
386000	395000	Hmm. How does that sound to you? Does that sound plausible and AI assistant that can help you with everything is super compassionate knows you very well.
395000	402000	And you have any questions about anything. What should I do in my job? What should I do with my wife? What should I do with my friends? What should I do with my business?
403000	417000	And the AI is going to maximize your outcomes through all of your opportunities and challenges because of its infinite capacities. It's going to be like a little pocket Jesus there with you all the time to help you in everything that you are doing.
417000	435000	Every scientist will have an AI assistant collaborator partner that will greatly expand their scope of scientific research and achievement. Every artist, every engineer, every business person, every doctor, every caregiver will have the same in their worlds.
435000	450000	Every leader of a people. Okay, obviously this is a strong pitch for the fact that everybody on earth can benefit from AI, but let's see. Nevertheless, how it spun out every leader of people CEO government official non profit president athletic coach teacher will have the same.
450000	459000	The magnification effects of better decisions by leaders across the people they lead are enormous. So this intelligence augmentation may be the most important of all.
460000	465000	You know, this is as somebody who studies and teaches the history of political philosophy and political theory.
465000	485000	It is the question of the relationship of artificial intelligence systems to governance and to ideas about ruling that interest me and that students of mine bring up to me in discussions, more so than for example the significance of AI systems for artists and engineers, and so on.
485000	498000	So this is an interesting field here how AI systems would improve or could improve or whether they would have a detrimental effect on rule.
498000	510000	Okay, productivity growth throughout the economy will accelerate dramatically driving economic growth creation of new industries creation of new jobs and wage growth and resulting in a new era of heightened material prosperity across the planet.
510000	525000	Sounds optimistic. Obviously is optimistic questions whether it's accurate and plausible scientific breakthroughs and new technologies and medicines will dramatically expand as AI helps us further decode the laws of nature and harvest them for our benefit.
525000	538000	The creative arts will enter a golden age, as AI augmented artists musicians writers and filmmakers gain the ability to realize their visions far faster and at greater scale than ever before again.
538000	549000	I'm not sure that speed and scale are the right criterion for the status or the level of development of the creative arts to you.
550000	562000	Like, I don't know. When you think about the golden age of architecture or something like that or the golden age of music, the golden age of painting, the golden age of film.
562000	576000	Is it going to be better just because it's faster and at greater scale. Everybody can just plug in there. I don't know they had a strange dream at night they plug it into their AI system and the next day they have what a 3D printed.
576000	587000	Who knows what. So I wonder, okay, but fine. There are smaller scale creative arts that might benefit. Listen, when I was younger, I used to be a big fan of Oasis, the rock and roll band.
587000	599000	And recently I've heard AI augmented artists write songs that they have the lead singer of Oasis, Liam Gallagher, his voice on even though he didn't sing it.
599000	609000	So AI augmented music where you can hear an artist you like singing a song that he didn't write that you wrote for him or something like that. And frankly, I thought that was pretty good. I enjoyed it.
609000	616000	So there is something there that can benefit music and I assume also these other artistic disciplines too.
616000	624000	I even think he continues AI is going to improve warfare when it has to happen by reducing wartime death rates dramatically.
624000	632000	Every war is characterized by terrible decisions made under intense pressure and with sharply limited information by very limited human leaders.
632000	642000	Now military commanders and political leaders will have AI advisors that will help them make much better strategic and tactical decisions minimizing risk, error and unnecessary bloodshed.
642000	646000	Okay, but what if the AI says you have to be more brutal than you were planning to be.
646000	653000	In short, anything that people do with their natural intelligence today can be done much better with AI.
653000	661000	And we will be able to take on new by the way the assumption there obviously is that anything, you know, more intelligence means you can do things better.
661000	667000	More natural intelligence means you can do things better. And if you augment your natural intelligence also means you can do things better.
667000	676000	We will be able to take on new challenges that have been impossible to tackle without AI from curing all diseases to achieving interstellar travel.
677000	685000	Sounds like promising the moon, in my opinion, but okay, and this isn't just about intelligence, perhaps the most underestimated quality of AI is how humanizing it can be.
685000	692000	AI art gives people who otherwise lack technical skills, the freedom to create and share their artistic ideas.
692000	698000	Talking to an empathetic AI friend really does improve their ability to handle adversity.
698000	704000	You guys probably know or you may know the movie her speaking of an empathetic AI friend.
704000	717000	And AI medical chatbots are already more empathetic than their human counterparts, rather than making the world harsher and more mechanistic infinitely patient and sympathetic AI will make the world warmer and nicer.
717000	727000	Okay, can you guarantee I stop here to ask many questions you may have questions of your own but can you guarantee that the AI is going to be infinitely patient and sympathetic.
727000	735000	Can you ensure at the outset that it's going to want to make the world warmer and nicer.
735000	750000	That it won't be unintended consequences and unexpected suggestions and all the other kinds of things that could surprise somebody here if they're dealing with an intelligence system that's more intelligent than any human intelligence.
750000	767000	It's kind of like you know people in theology and philosophy of religion who say there's a kind of similarity between the intelligence of man and God's intelligence but it's not a similarity that you can really understand or exploit and it's almost even blasphemous to think about because
767000	779000	God is so much superior to man. Why should there be any part of us that coincides with or call less is with something so qualitatively superior.
779000	789000	So you can't really even understand. It's only in some strange and analogical form that you can say human intelligence and divine intelligence call us at any point.
789000	803000	Well OK fine if these artificial intelligence systems really reach whatever they're speculating in level of IQ and capacity. Why do we assume it will have any similarity to the way that we think.
803000	813000	You know maybe it will recognize you know what the world doesn't need to be warmer and nicer. That's a low IQ thought that the world should be warm and nice.
814000	823000	You know what I mean. Like how do you know when you by the time you get to whatever 220 IQ or wherever these things go if the systems continue to advance.
823000	833000	It's like when I create an amazing AI chess player is going to play chess exactly the same way as I do but a little bit better or it's going to play go exactly the same way that I do but better.
833000	841000	No it might find a completely new way of playing the game destroy you every time. So a lot of assumptions built in here about the relationship between.
841000	850000	Like well intelligence become qualitatively different as it becomes quantitatively superior the stakes here are high the opportunities are profound AI is quite possibly.
850000	859000	The most important and best thing our civilization has ever created certainly on par with electricity and microchips and probably beyond those.
859000	868000	The development and proliferation of AI far from a risk that we should fear is a moral obligation that we have to ourselves to our children into our future.
869000	873000	We should be living in a much better world with AI and now we can.
873000	888000	Okay so there's the strong first part of the paper strong case for the idea that AI will make the world a better place in all respects in the arts in the sciences in medicine.
888000	890000	In government.
890000	895000	A golden age of humanity because AI will make everything we care about better.
895000	906000	But as I'm sure you know there are some people who don't think so and who are worried and who are asking to pause the development of AI and so on so he naturally transitions to the question why the panic.
906000	914000	In contrast to this positive view the public conversation about AI is presently shot through with hysterical fear and paranoia.
914000	923000	We hear claims that AI will variously kill us all ruin our society take all our jobs cause crippling inequality and enable bad people to do awful things.
923000	929000	What explains this divergence and potential outcomes from near utopia to horrifying dystopia.
929000	942000	Historically every new technology that matters from electric lighting to automobiles to radio to the internet has sparked a moral panic a social contagion that convinces people the new technology is going to destroy the world or society or both.
942000	952000	The fine folks at pessimists archive have documented these technology driven moral panics over the decades their history makes the pattern vividly clear.
952000	956000	It turns out this present panic is not even the first for AI.
956000	960000	Now it is certainly the case that many new technologies have led to bad outcomes.
960000	965000	Often the same technologies that have been otherwise enormously beneficial to our welfare.
965000	970000	So it's not that the mere existence of a moral panic means there's nothing to be concerned about.
970000	973000	But a moral panic is by its very nature irrational.
973000	981000	It takes what may be a legitimate concern and inflates it into a level of hysteria that ironically makes it harder to confront actually serious concerns.
981000	992000	I want to say here not that I not that this is the last word but a moral panic may be irrational and may take what's legitimate and inflate it.
992000	1010000	But so too is a kind of zealous over optimism and over optimism that takes what may be a legitimate hope and inflates it into a level of not hysteria but you know euphoria or mania.
1010000	1012000	That makes it harder to confront actually serious matters.
1012000	1024000	So there's a there's a flip side to this the irrationality of moral panic but also the possibly the irrationality of over optimistic over zealous hopefulness that we shouldn't forget.
1024000	1025000	Okay.
1025000	1028000	And wow do we have a full blown moral panic about AI right now.
1028000	1036000	Let's just see where does this link to.
1036000	1041000	The AI arms race is changing everything time magazine February 17 2023.
1041000	1043000	Can we look at that later.
1043000	1053000	The moral panic is already being used as a motivating force by a variety of actors to demand policy action new AI restrictions regulations and laws.
1053000	1064000	These actors who are making extremely dramatic public statements about the dangers of AI feeding on and further inflaming moral panic all present themselves as selfless champions of the public good.
1064000	1068000	But are they and are they right or wrong.
1068000	1081000	You see always shows you just how important whatever technological era we are in so much of politics is a debate over what's good over the public good over the common good.
1081000	1088000	Is AI going to contribute to the common good the public good or is AI going to be detrimental to the common good.
1088000	1092000	Well for sure we have to look into the arguments like he's about to do.
1092000	1101000	And then we also have to have a broad understanding of what is meant by the public good what is good politically what is the good society what's the good human life.
1101000	1110000	And those questions are old questions in the history of political philosophy from Plato's Republic to Aristotle's politics all the way down to Machiavelli and each and so on.
1110000	1120000	So if you ever want to go to millerman school dot com and you'll see I have courses on the history of political philosophy but right now we continue with this the Baptists and bootleggers of AI.
1120000	1125000	Economists have observed a long standing pattern and reform movements of this kind.
1125000	1136000	And actors within movements like these fall into two categories Baptists and bootleggers drawing on the historical example of the prohibition of alcohol in the United States in the 1920s.
1136000	1148000	Baptists are the true believer social reformers who legitimately feel deeply and emotionally if not rationally that new restrictions regulations and laws are required to prevent societal disaster.
1148000	1157000	All prohibition these actors were often literally devout Christians who felt that alcohol was destroying the moral fabric of society for AI risk.
1157000	1164000	These actors are true believers that AI presents one or another existential risks strap them to a polygraph they really mean it.
1164000	1168000	So these are the AI skeptics are the ones who want to deprive you of the pleasures of alcohol.
1169000	1180000	They're going to be the prohibitionist bootleggers are the self interested opportunists who stand to financially profit by the imposition of new restrictions regulations and laws that insulate them from competitors.
1180000	1188000	For alcohol prohibition these were the literal bootleggers who made a fortune selling illicit alcohol to Americans when legitimate alcohol sales were banned.
1189000	1192000	For AI risk these are CEOs who stand to make more money.
1192000	1203000	If regulatory barriers are erected that form a cartel of government blessed AI vendors protected from new startup and open source competition the software version of too big to fail banks.
1203000	1214000	Okay, a cynic would suggest that some of the apparent Baptists are also bootleggers specifically the ones paid to attack AI by their universities think tanks activist groups and media outlets.
1214000	1224000	If you are paid a salary or receive grants to foster AI panic you're probably a bootlegger in other words you benefit from the from this from restriction of AI.
1224000	1230000	The problem with bootleggers is that they win the Baptists are naive ideologues the bootleggers are cynical operators.
1230000	1239000	And so the result of reform movements like these is often that bootleggers get what they want regulatory capture insulation from competition the formation of a cartel.
1239000	1245000	And the Baptists are left wondering where their drive for social improvement went so wrong.
1246000	1252000	We've just lived through a stunning example of this banking reform after the 2008 global financial crisis.
1252000	1260000	The Baptists told us that we needed new laws and regulations to break up the too big to fail banks to prevent such a crisis from ever happening again.
1260000	1270000	So Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which was marketed as satisfying the Baptist school but in reality was co-opted by the bootleggers, the big banks.
1270000	1275000	The result is that the same banks that were too big to fail in 2008 are much, much larger now.
1275000	1284000	So in practice, even when the Baptists are genuine and even when the Baptists are right, they are used as cover by manipulative and venal bootleggers that benefit themselves.
1284000	1288000	And this is what is happening in the drive for AI regulation right now.
1288000	1293000	However, it isn't sufficient to simply identify the actors and impugn their motives like he's just done in this section.
1293000	1298000	We should consider the arguments of both the Baptists and the bootleggers on their merits.
1298000	1302000	So now he's going to turn to AI risk. Number one, will AI kill us all?
1302000	1304000	Hope not.
1304000	1313000	We're reading this article by Mark and Andreessen called Why AI Will Save the World.
1313000	1317000	This was published not too long ago, I think just earlier this month.
1317000	1321000	And I saw it come up very briefly on my YouTube feed today.
1321000	1325000	A clip of somebody else discussing it and I thought, you know, I haven't read it. It looks pretty intriguing. Let's go over it.
1325000	1328000	So thanks for being here. Like, share, subscribe and all the rest of it.
1328000	1335000	Feel free to be active in the chat if you have thoughts on these topics and we're going to continue on once I find our spot here.
1335000	1337000	Here we go. Will AI kill us all?
1338000	1344000	The first and original AI do more risk is that AI will decide to literally kill humanity.
1344000	1351000	The fear that technology of our own creation will rise up and destroy us is deeply coded into our culture.
1351000	1354000	The Greeks expressed this fear in the Prometheus myth.
1354000	1360000	Prometheus brought the destructive power of fire and more generally technology, technique, to man,
1360000	1364000	for which Prometheus was condemned to perpetual torture by the gods.
1364000	1370000	Later, Mary Shelley gave us moderns, our own version of this myth in her novel Frankenstein or the modern Prometheus,
1370000	1376000	in which we developed the technology for eternal life, which then rises up and seeks to destroy us.
1376000	1386000	And of course, no AI panic newspaper story is complete without a still image of a gleaming red-eyed killer robot from James Cameron's Terminator films.
1386000	1394000	The presumed evolutionary purpose of this mythology is to motivate us to seriously consider potential risks of new technologies.
1394000	1399000	Fire, after all, can indeed be used to burn down entire cities.
1399000	1407000	But just as fire was also the foundation of modern civilization, as used to keep us warm and safe in cold and hostile world,
1407000	1412000	this mythology ignores the far greater upside of most or all new technologies,
1412000	1416000	and in practice inflames destructive emotion rather than reasoned analysis.
1416000	1421000	Just because pre-modern man, freaked out like this, doesn't mean we have to.
1421000	1425000	We can apply rationality instead.
1425000	1430000	My view is that the AI will decide, excuse me, my view, he writes,
1430000	1437000	is that the idea that AI will decide to literally kill humanity is a profound category error.
1437000	1446000	AI is not a living being that has been primed by billions of years of evolution to participate in the battle for the survival of the fittest as animals are and as we are.
1446000	1453000	It is math, code, computers, built by people owned by people used by people controlled by people.
1453000	1463000	The idea that it will at some point develop a mind of its own and decide that it has motivations that lead it to try to kill us is a superstitious hand wave.
1463000	1468000	I think largely from what I've heard anyway, this is somehow the crux of the debate.
1468000	1475000	Will a superintelligence develop some sense of itself and of its own motivations?
1475000	1479000	Will it, you know, become unleashed?
1479000	1483000	Or will it always be a tool in the hands of the people who are using it?
1483000	1487000	And even as a tool, you know, it may have become a powerful tool of destruction.
1487000	1491000	But anyway, in short, AI doesn't want, it doesn't have goals.
1491000	1495000	It doesn't want to kill you because it's not alive and AI is a machine.
1495000	1500000	It's not going to come alive anymore than your toaster will.
1500000	1511000	We guys think about that seems slightly disingenuous because on one hand he's saying that AI is a technology that's completely unprecedented that can help improve every aspect of life.
1511000	1514000	That's going to augment human intelligence in every domain.
1514000	1518000	Nobody thinks that a toaster will do those things.
1518000	1535000	Now, obviously, there are true believers in killer AI, Baptists, who are gaining a suddenly stratospheric amount of media coverage for their terrifying warnings, some of whom claim to have been studying the topic for decades and say that they are now scared out of their minds by what they have learned.
1535000	1538000	Some of these true believers are even actual innovators of the technology.
1538000	1549000	These actors are arguing for a variety of bizarre and extreme restrictions on AI, ranging from a ban on AI development, all the way up to military airstrikes on data centers and nuclear war.
1549000	1550000	Well, that's kind of crazy.
1550000	1552000	I didn't hear about that.
1552000	1553000	What is this?
1553000	1555000	Pausing AI developments isn't enough.
1555000	1558000	We need to shut it all down.
1558000	1559000	Huh.
1559000	1564000	Yadkowski is a decision theorist from the US, leads research at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute.
1565000	1570000	Did he call for nuclear for military strikes on data centers?
1570000	1573000	That's kind of got to look at that later.
1573000	1574000	Let's go back here.
1574000	1590000	They argue that because people like me cannot rule out future catastrophic consequences of AI catastrophic consequences of AI that we must assume a precautionary stance that may require large amounts of physical violence and death in order to prevent potential existential risk.
1590000	1594000	My response, Andreessen writes, is that their position is non-scientific.
1594000	1596000	What is the testable hypothesis?
1596000	1598000	What would falsify the hypothesis?
1598000	1600000	How do we know when we're getting into a danger zone?
1600000	1604000	These questions go mainly unanswered apart from you can't prove it won't happen.
1604000	1617000	In fact, these Baptist position is so non-scientific and so extreme, a conspiracy theory about math and code, and is already calling for physical violence that I will do something I would normally not do in question their motives as well.
1617000	1620000	Okay, I'm going to continue in a minute, but this I don't like.
1620000	1624000	This I don't like.
1624000	1626000	You can't.
1626000	1644000	How could you put it, you can't deflate the concerns by presenting AI as merely math and code, which makes a sound kind of banal, and therefore makes a conspiracy theory about a seem kind of ridiculous.
1644000	1659000	And at the same time, say that this math and code will improve every aspect of human life in unprecedented ways that are truly infinitely loving and infinitely compassionate.
1659000	1669000	So how can math and code be infinitely patient, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful, helpful, helpful, a machine version of infinite love.
1669000	1679000	So when you're talking about the positive side, you can really exploit an anthropomorphized version of math and code.
1679000	1684000	But when it comes to the concerns, you said, come on, don't be a conspiracy theorist.
1684000	1685000	It's just math.
1685000	1687000	Math can't hurt you.
1687000	1688000	You know what I'm saying?
1688000	1690000	I don't like that.
1690000	1696000	I don't know whether he understands the sort of duplicity here.
1696000	1698000	It should be fine if he does or doesn't.
1698000	1699000	It doesn't matter.
1699000	1700000	Still an interesting article.
1700000	1703000	We're going through it, but you can't have it both ways.
1703000	1718000	If it's just math, and it can be infinitely loving, then it's not ridiculous to wonder whether it can also have other less desirable emotional characteristics.
1718000	1719000	Okay.
1719000	1720000	Where were we?
1720000	1724000	Sorry about that one second.
1724000	1727000	I think we were.
1727000	1729000	We're still up here, right?
1729000	1731000	Okay, wait.
1731000	1732000	Yeah, here we go.
1732000	1733000	Okay.
1733000	1735000	So what's going on, he says, what's, what's going on?
1735000	1737000	Specifically, I think three things are going on.
1737000	1750000	First, recall that John von Neumann responded to Robert Oppenheimer's famous hand wringing about his role creating nuclear weapons, which helped end World War Two and prevent World War Three with quote,
1751000	1755000	Which is a nice line.
1755000	1761000	What is the most dramatic way one can claim credit for the importance of one's work without sounding overly boastful?
1761000	1766000	This explains the mismatch between the words and actions of the Baptist who are actually building and funding AI.
1766000	1769000	Watch their actions, not their words.
1769000	1771000	Truman was harsher after meeting with Oppenheimer.
1771000	1773000	Don't let that cry baby in here again.
1774000	1782000	Second, some of the Baptists, in other words, some of the people who are warning about the dangers of AI are actually bootleggers, meaning those who are going to profit from its restriction.
1782000	1787000	There's a whole profession of AI safety expert, AI ethicist, AI risk researcher.
1787000	1793000	They're paid to be doomers and their statements should be processed appropriately.
1793000	1806000	Third, California is justifiably famous for our many thousands of cults, from Est, incidentally, interestingly influenced by Heidegger, to the People's Temple, from Heaven's Gate to the Manson family.
1806000	1819000	Many, although not all of these cults are harmless and maybe even serve a purpose for alienated people who find homes in them, but some are very dangerous indeed and cults have a notoriously hard time straddling the line that ultimately leads to violence and death.
1819000	1830000	And the reality, which is obvious to everyone in the Bay Area, but probably not outside of it, is that AI risk has developed into a cult, which has suddenly emerged into the daylight of global press attention and the public conversation.
1830000	1845000	The cult has pulled in not just fringe characters, but also some actual industry experts and not a small number of wealthy donors, including until recently Sam Bankman Freed, and it's developed a full panoply of cult behaviors and beliefs.
1845000	1859000	This cult is why there are a set of AI risk doomers who sound so extreme. It's not that they actually have secret knowledge that make their extremism logical, it's that they've whipped themselves into a frenzy and really are extremely extreme.
1859000	1876000	It turns out that this type of cult isn't new. There's a longstanding Western tradition of millenarianism, which generates apocalypse cults. The AI risk cult has all the hallmarks of a millenarian apocalypse cult from Wikipedia with additions by me, quote.
1876000	1889000	Millenarianism is the belief by a group or movement AI risk doomers in a coming fundamental transformation of society, the arrival of AI, after which all things will be changed AI utopia dystopia or end of the world.
1889000	1904000	Only dramatic events, AI bands, airstrikes on data centers, nuclear strikes on unregulated AI are seen as able to change the world, prevent AI, and the change is anticipated to be brought about or survived by a group of the devout and dedicated.
1904000	1920000	In most millenarian societies, excuse me scenarios, the disaster or battle to come AI apocalypse or its prevention will be followed by a new purified world AI bands in which the believers will be rewarded or at least acknowledged to have been correct all along.
1921000	1933000	This apocalypse cult pattern is so obvious that I'm surprised more people don't see it. Don't get me wrong, cults are fun to hear about their written material is often creative and fascinating, and their members are engaging at dinner parties and on TV.
1933000	1939000	But their extreme beliefs should not determine the future laws, the future of laws in society, obviously not.
1940000	1961000	Okay, so to the first possible criticism of AI, the fear that it's going to kill us all. Mark Andreessen writes that no, that is not founded in anything other than this fear of new technologies, which may have an evolutionary purpose and which has precedence back in the myth of Prometheus and the story of
1962000	1974000	But AI can't want to kill people because AI doesn't want anything doesn't have goals isn't alive, and is not much more than a toaster in terms of its intentions.
1974000	1981000	And I already made my comments on that. So let's go to the next one. Will AI ruin our society.
1981000	1996000	Okay, a quick pause. This is an article by Mark Andreessen, why AI will save the world published earlier this month that we're going through pretty interesting so far I hope you like it you should comment for sure in the chat or comment on the video if you're watching later.
1996000	2010000	Like, share, subscribe. We definitely do live streams on politics and philosophy and more and more I think the arguments over the significance the political and social significance of these new technologies should be a part of our conversation because it
2010000	2019000	implicates us in questions of sovereignty and the good society, the meaning of a human life, and all all the rest of it.
2019000	2023000	So it's a nice topic to include in our conversations.
2023000	2042000	Okay, will AI ruin our society. The second widely mooted AI risk is that AI will ruin our society by generating outputs that will be so harmful to use the nomenclature of this kind of doomer as to cause profound damage to humanity,
2042000	2045000	even if we're not literally killed.
2046000	2062000	Short version if the murder robots don't get us the hate speech and misinformation will. Okay, so I guess here is like you're going to have all kinds of fake chatbots and all kinds of propaganda farms, pushing out by the, you know, infinite stream of misinformation technologies.
2063000	2070000	This is a relatively recent doomer concern that branched off from and somewhat took over the AI risk movement that I described above.
2070000	2084000	In fact, the terminology of AI risk recently changed from AI safety, the term used by people who are worried that AI would literally kill us to AI alignment, the term used by people who are worried about societal harms.
2084000	2099000	The original AI safety people are frustrated by this shift, although they don't know how to put it back in the box. They now advocate that the actual AI risk topic be renamed AI not kill everyone ism, which has not yet been widely adopted but is at least clear.
2099000	2110000	The tip off to the nature of the AI societal risk claim is its own term AI alignment alignment with what human values, whose human values are that's where things get tricky.
2110000	2121000	Okay, I'm interested to see where he takes us because remember what he said above. I pointed out he was invoking some human values of his own infinite compassion, infinite patience, infinite love.
2122000	2128000	As it happens, I have had a front row seat to an analogous situation, the social media trust and safety wars.
2128000	2139000	As is now obvious social media services have been under massive pressure from governments and activists to ban restrict sensor and otherwise suppress a wide range of content for many years.
2139000	2151000	And the same concerns of quote unquote eight speech and its mathematical counterpart algorithmic bias and misinformation are being directly transferred from the social media context to the new frontier of AI alignment.
2152000	2158000	My big learnings he writes from the social media wars are on the one hand there is no absolutist free speech position.
2158000	2162000	First, every country including the US makes at least some content illegal.
2162000	2172000	Second, there are certain kinds of content like child pornography and incitements to real world violence that are nearly universally agreed to be off limits legal or not by virtually every society.
2173000	2179000	So any technological platform that facilitates or generates content speech is going to have some restrictions.
2180000	2184000	On the other hand the slippery slope is not a fallacy it's an inevitability.
2184000	2194000	Once a framework for restricting even egregiously terrible content is in place, for example for hate speech a specific hurtful word or for misinformation obviously false claims like the Pope is dead.
2195000	2210000	A shockingly broad range of government agencies and activist pressure groups and and non governmental entities will kick into gear and demand ever greater levels of censorship and suppression of whatever speech they view as threatening to society and their own personal preferences.
2211000	2220000	Just want to remind you on this topic of censorship we did a stream a couple of weeks ago Alexander Dugan on the metaphysics of censorship could be interesting to think about in relationship to AI alignment.
2221000	2225000	They will do this up to and including in ways that are nakedly felony crimes.
2226000	2233000	The cycle and practice can run apparently forever with the enthusiastic support of authoritarian hall monitors installed throughout our elite power structures.
2233000	2240000	This has been cascading for a decade in social media and with only certain exceptions continues to get more fervent all the time.
2241000	2255000	And so this is the dynamic that is formed around AI alignment now its proponents claim the wisdom to engineer AI generated speech and thought that are good for society and to ban AI generated speech and thoughts.
2256000	2262000	Sorry that are bad for society and to ban AI generated yeah it's been generated.
2263000	2278000	So basically you permit the good stuff you ban the bad stuff its opponents claim that the thought police are breathtakingly arrogant and presumptuous and often outright criminal at least in the US and in factors seeking to be kind to become a new kind of fused government corporate academic
2278000	2283000	authoritarian speech dictatorship ripped straight from the pages of Orwell's 1984.
2284000	2292000	Because I'm sure you have heard about this concern in fact Jordan Peterson maybe a couple of days ago or sometime last week posted on his Twitter.
2293000	2304000	I think it was the UN maybe or some institution like that that said they were now going to be having you know AI automated misinformation censorship something like that.
2304000	2314000	So that's the concern OK suddenly you're going to have ideologically supercharged AI systems that are designed to police speech and label everything they don't like hate speech.
2315000	2332000	So like exactly what happens now but augmented by so AI augmented ideological censorship as the proponents of both trust and safety and AI alignment are clustered into the very narrow slice of the global population that characterizes the American Coastal elites,
2332000	2335000	which includes many of the people who work in and right about the tech industry.
2336000	2344000	Many of my readers will find yourselves primed to argue that dramatic restrictions on AI output are required to avoid destroying society.
2345000	2347000	I will not attempt to talk you out of this now.
2348000	2356000	He writes I will simply state that this is the nature of the demand and that most people in the world neither agree with your ideology nor want to see you win.
2357000	2358000	We have here.
2361000	2365000	America has a free what's what's he referring to it's behind the paywall look at it another day.
2366000	2380000	Okay so most people in the world do not agree with the ideology of the American Coastal elites and don't want to see them win and therefore don't want to see an AI aligned with their ideology, especially with their sensorious limitations on free speech.
2380000	2396000	If you don't agree with the prevailing niche morality that is being imposed on both social media and AI via ever intensifying speech codes, you should also realize that the fight over what AI is allowed to say or generate will be even more important by a lot than the fight over social media censorship.
2397000	2400000	AI is highly likely to be the control layer for everything in the world.
2401000	2402000	How is it allowed?
2402000	2407000	How it is allowed to operate is going to matter perhaps more than anything else has ever mattered.
2410000	2417000	I don't know how you feel about it when you see statements like that seem a little bit on the exaggerated side but okay I guess you have to consider it.
2418000	2427000	You should be aware of how a small and isolated coterie of partisan social engineers are trying to determine that right now under cover of the age old claim that they're protecting you.
2428000	2431000	In short, don't let the thought police suppress AI.
2432000	2433000	Okay, so you had another argument here.
2434000	2439000	AI is going to ruin our society because it's going to be allowed to be a racist homophobic and fascist.
2440000	2441000	You know what I mean, right?
2441000	2453000	It's going to be allowed to say things that don't pass the test of political correctness or whatever and that it should be made to answer to the dogmas of the day in order to be safe.
2454000	2456000	And he says, no, don't let the thought police suppress AI.
2457000	2458000	Okay, AI risk number three.
2458000	2460000	Will AI take all our jobs?
2462000	2466000	Well, if you don't have a job, you're safe.
2467000	2479000	The fear of job loss due variously to mechanization, automation and computerization or AI has been a recurring panic for hundreds of years since the original onset of machinery, such as the mechanical loom.
2480000	2488000	Even though every new major technology has led to more jobs at higher wages throughout history, each wave of this panic is accompanied by claims that this time it is different.
2488000	2489000	This is the time it will finally happen.
2490000	2493000	This is the technology that will finally deliver the hammer blow to human labor.
2494000	2495000	And yet it never happens.
2496000	2500000	I hear someone interrupt the article just to point out that there's a flip side of this argument, right?
2500000	2506000	So he says every time there's a panic, the panic says this time it's different, but it's always the same.
2507000	2512000	But we should point out that the flip side is he's also saying this time it's different on the optimistic side of things.
2512000	2514000	Remember what he put here, right?
2514000	2521000	He said, how you're going to operate AI may matter more than anything else has ever mattered.
2522000	2523000	Same sort of idea.
2523000	2533000	This is the technology that's really going to be so different from all the technologies that have come before, none of which could be infinitely loving, infinitely compassionate, infinitely patient and so on.
2534000	2537000	So just keep in mind, you want to make sure you don't lose sight of that.
2537000	2541000	He's not allowed to overstate the benefits and understate the harms.
2541000	2542000	So you're just going to keep an eye on it.
2543000	2555000	Okay, so we've been through two such technology driven unemployment panic cycles in our recent past, the outsourcing panic of the 2000s and the automation panic of the 2010s.
2555000	2563000	Notwithstanding many talking heads, pundits and even tech industry executives pounding the table throughout both decades that mass unemployment was near.
2563000	2572000	By late 2019, right before the onset of COVID, the world had more jobs at higher wages than ever in history.
2572000	2575000	Nevertheless, this mistaken idea will not die.
2575000	2577000	And sure enough, it's back.
2577000	2584000	This time we finally have the technology that's going to take all the jobs and render human workers superfluous, real AI.
2584000	2591000	Surely this time history won't repeat and AI will cause mass unemployment and not rapid economic job and wage growth, right?
2591000	2593000	No, that's not going to happen.
2593000	2606000	And in fact, AI, if allowed to develop and proliferate throughout the economy may cause the most dramatic and sustained economic boom of all time with correspondingly record job and wage growth, the exact opposite of the fear.
2606000	2607000	And here's why.
2607000	2608000	Okay, so good.
2608000	2612000	We have the claim it's going to destroy job growth and we have the counter claim.
2612000	2613000	No, it's not.
2613000	2614000	It's going to lead to a boom.
2614000	2616000	Well, that's the claim.
2616000	2617000	What's the argument?
2617000	2624000	The core mistake the automation kills jobs doomers keep making is called the lump of labor fallacy.
2624000	2633000	This fallacy is the incorrect notion that there's a fixed amount of labor to be done in the economy at any given time and either machines do it or people do it.
2633000	2636000	And if machines do it, there will be no work for people to do.
2636000	2643000	The lump of labor fallacy flows naturally from naive intuition, but naive intuition here is wrong.
2643000	2651000	When technology is applied to production, we get productivity growth and increase in output generated by a reduction in inputs.
2651000	2654000	The result is lower prices for goods and services.
2654000	2662000	As prices for goods and services fall, we pay less for them, meaning that we now have extra spending power with which to buy other things.
2662000	2672000	This increases demand in the economy, which drives the creation of new production, including new products and new industries, which then creates new jobs for the people who are replaced by machines and prior jobs.
2673000	2680000	The result is a larger economy with higher material prosperity, more industries, more products and more jobs.
2680000	2682000	But the good news doesn't stop there.
2682000	2684000	We also get higher wages.
2684000	2693000	This is because at the level of the individual worker, the marketplace sets compensation as a function of the marginal productivity of the worker.
2693000	2698000	A worker in a technology infused business will be more productive than a worker in a traditional business.
2698000	2704000	The employer will either pay that worker more money as he is now more productive, or another employer will purely out of self interest.
2704000	2711000	The result is that technology introduced into an industry generally not only increases the number of jobs in the industry, but also increases wages.
2711000	2718000	You guys see that technology is going to make you marginally more productive and therefore is going to increase your wages if wages are related to marginal productivity.
2718000	2723000	To summarize, technology empowers people to be more productive.
2723000	2727000	This causes the prices for existing goods and services to fall and for wages to rise.
2727000	2733000	This in turn causes economic growth and job growth while motivating the creation of new jobs and new industries.
2733000	2742000	If a market economy is allowed to function normally and if technology is allowed to be introduced freely, this is a perpetual upward cycle that never ends.
2742000	2747000	For, as Milton Friedman observed, human wants and needs are endless.
2747000	2751000	Incidentally also something that Aristotle observed in the politics.
2751000	2755000	We always want more than we have and Plato in the Republic.
2755000	2763000	A technology infused market economy is the way we get closer to delivering everything everyone could conceivably want, but never all the way there.
2763000	2769000	And that is why technology doesn't destroy jobs and never will.
2769000	2771000	Okay, continuing.
2771000	2778000	These are such mind blowing ideas for people who have not been exposed to them that it may take you some time to wrap your head around them, but I swear I'm not making them up.
2778000	2782000	In fact, you can read about them in standard economic textbooks.
2782000	2797000	I recommend the chapter The Curse of Machinery in Henry Haslett's Economics in One Lesson and Frederick Bastiat's satirical candle makers petition to blot out the sun due to its unfair competition with the lighting industry here modernized for our times.
2797000	2799000	But this time is different to your thinking.
2799000	2803000	This time with AI we have the technology that can replace all human labor.
2803000	2811000	By using the principles I described above, he writes, think of what it would mean for literally all existing human labor to be replaced by machines.
2811000	2818000	It would mean a take off rate of economic productivity growth that would be absolutely stratospheric far beyond any historical precedent.
2818000	2822000	Prices of existing goods and services would drop across the board to virtually zero.
2822000	2824000	Consumer welfare would skyrocket.
2824000	2826000	Consumer spending power would skyrocket.
2826000	2828000	New demand in the economy would explode.
2828000	2838000	Entrepreneurs would create dizzying arrays of new industries, products and services and employ as many people and AI as they could as fast as possible to meet all the new demand.
2838000	2842000	Suppose AI once again replaces that labor, the cycle would repeat, etc.
2842000	2848000	It would be a straight spiral up to material utopia that neither Adam Smith nor Karl Marx ever dreamed of.
2848000	2850000	We should be so lucky.
2850000	2854000	Okay, so let's just review where we are at in this article.
2854000	2856000	Oops, sorry.
2856000	2862000	So, first we had the claim that AI is going to make everything we care about better.
2862000	2864000	Everything.
2864000	2874000	Because you're going to have augmented intelligence and intelligence is such a lead indicator of where you're going to be successful that augmented intelligence is going to make everything better.
2874000	2879000	Children, parents, leaders, scientists, artists, you name it.
2879000	2887000	But most people are arguing that AI is going to kill us all, take our jobs and do all kinds of other crazy things.
2887000	2901000	And he had some analysis of why that is in part because when you ask for the regulation of AI, you may also benefit from that regulation like the bootleggers who made a fortune selling illicit alcohol to Americans on legitimate alcohol sales were banned.
2901000	2910000	But besides the economic possible upside of arguing for a regulation of AI, he also wanted to examine their arguments on their merits.
2910000	2913000	Will AI kill us all? We just discussed a moment ago.
2913000	2919000	It won't because it doesn't want to kill anybody doesn't want to do anything. It's just a tool in the hands of people.
2919000	2925000	It has no personality, no intention, no agency and no malice as it were.
2925000	2934000	Then we have the idea that AI will ruin our society because it's going to be freely allowed to say all kinds of things that mess up our social conversation.
2934000	2938000	Therefore, it should be made to be politically correct in effect.
2938000	2942000	And he said, no, do not let the thought police suppress AI.
2942000	2947000	The third risk, it's going to take all our jobs. You said far from it, it's going to lead to a boom.
2947000	2955000	More jobs, more higher paying jobs, a golden age of economic prosperity.
2955000	2963000	So we're at AI risk number four now. Will AI lead to crippling inequality?
2963000	2969000	Speaking of Karl Marx, the concern about AI taking jobs, segues?
2969000	2972000	How do you say that word? I think I always say segues.
2972000	2977000	Okay, the concern about AI taking jobs, segues directly into the next claim.
2977000	2984000	AI risk, the next claimed AI risk, which is, okay, Mark, suppose AI does take all the jobs, either for bad or for good.
2984000	2989000	Won't that result in massive and crippling wealth inequality?
2989000	2993000	As the owners of AI reap all the economic rewards and regular people get nothing.
2993000	2999000	By the way, once upon a time, I can't vouch for it because I don't remember it well enough, but I read a book called.
2999000	3004000	What's that guy's name? Georgiania, right? Georgiania.
3004000	3011000	The book was called Prometheism, I think. Prometheism, something like that.
3011000	3019000	And it argues sort of like this, that as technology develops, as it gets to the, and it should develop, as the Promethean spirit develops and it should develop,
3019000	3033000	it's going to produce massive social inequality between the basically subhuman, like humanity will branch into a technologically superhuman overlords and subhuman slaves.
3033000	3037000	But okay, speaking of Karl Marx, yeah, okay, the wealth inequality.
3037000	3046000	As it happens, this was a central claim of Marxism that the owners of the means of production, the bourgeoisie, would inevitably steal all societal wealth from the people who do the actual work, the proletariat.
3046000	3054000	This is another fallacy that simply will not die, no matter how often it's disproved by reality, but let's drive a stake through its heart anyway.
3054000	3061000	The flaw in this theory is that as the owner of a piece of technology, it's not in your interest to keep it to yourself, in fact, the opposite.
3061000	3066000	It's in your own interest to sell it to as many customers as possible.
3066000	3070000	The largest market in the world for any product is the entire world, all eight billion of us.
3071000	3084000	And so in reality, every new technology, even ones that start by selling to the rarefied air of high-paying big companies or wealthy customers, rapidly proliferates until it's in the hands of the largest possible mass market, ultimately everyone on the planet.
3084000	3091000	The classic example of this was Elon Musk's so-called secret plan, which he naturally published openly for Tesla in 2006.
3091000	3093000	Step one, build expensive sports car.
3093000	3095000	Step two, use that money to build an affordable car.
3095000	3098000	Step three, use that money to build an even more affordable car.
3098000	3103000	Which is exactly what he's done becoming the richest man in the world as a result.
3103000	3105000	The last point is key.
3105000	3109000	Would Elon be even richer if he only sold cars to rich people today?
3109000	3110000	No.
3110000	3113000	Would he be even richer than that if he only made cars for himself?
3113000	3114000	Of course not.
3114000	3119000	No, he maximizes his own profit by selling through the largest possible market, the world.
3120000	3128000	In short, everyone gets the thing, as we saw in the past with not just cars, but also electricity, radio, computers, the internet, mobile phones, and search engines.
3128000	3134000	The makers of such technologies are highly motivated to drive down their prices until everyone on the planet can afford them.
3134000	3137000	This is precisely what is already happening in AI.
3137000	3144000	It's why you can use state-of-the-art generative AI, not just at low cost, but even for free today, in the form of Microsoft being in Google Bard.
3144000	3146000	And it is what will continue to happen.
3146000	3151000	Not because such vendors are foolish or generous, but precisely because they are greedy.
3151000	3155000	They want to maximize the size of their market, which maximizes their profits.
3158000	3159000	I'm not going to lie.
3159000	3161000	I can relate to that, millermanschool.com.
3161000	3169000	If the whole world was my customer, you know, if everybody in the world was taking the Plato course or the Heidegger course or the Dugan course, wouldn't necessarily be so bad.
3169000	3172000	What happens is the opposite of technology driving centralization of wealth.
3172000	3180000	Individual customers of the technology, ultimately including everyone on the planet, are empowered instead and capture most of the generated value.
3180000	3187000	As with prior technologies, the companies that build AI, assuming they have to function in a free market, will compete furiously to make this happen.
3187000	3190000	Marx was wrong then, and he's wrong now.
3190000	3193000	This is not to say that inequality is not an issue in our society.
3193000	3194000	It is.
3194000	3196000	It's just not being driven by technology.
3196000	3198000	It's being driven by the reverse.
3198000	3210000	By the sectors of the economy that are the most resistant to new technology that have the most government intervention to prevent the adoption of new technology like AI, specifically housing education and healthcare.
3210000	3222000	The actual risk of AI and inequality is not that AI will cause more inequality, but rather that we will not allow AI to be used to reduce inequality.
3222000	3227000	Okay, so not only will it not lead to crippling inequality.
3227000	3233000	It's somehow our best hope for producing more genuine equality.
3233000	3237000	Okay, or for reducing inequality.
3237000	3239000	AI risk number five.
3239000	3242000	Let me just see how many more do we have to go through.
3242000	3244000	So one more on the numbered list.
3244000	3245000	Let's have a look.
3245000	3248000	Will AI lead to bad people doing bad things?
3248000	3253000	So far, I've explained why four of the five most often proposed risks of AI are not actually real.
3253000	3255000	AI will not come to life and kill us.
3255000	3257000	AI will not ruin our society.
3257000	3262000	AI will not cause mass unemployment, and AI will not cause a ruinous increase in inequality.
3262000	3267000	But now let's address the fifth, the one I actually agree with.
3267000	3270000	AI will make it easier for bad people to do bad things.
3270000	3273000	In some sense, this is a tautology.
3273000	3274000	Technology is a tool.
3274000	3281000	Tools starting with fire and rocks can be used to do good things, cook food and build houses and bad things, burn people and bludgeon people.
3281000	3284000	Any technology can be used for good or bad, fair enough.
3284000	3290000	And AI will make it easier for criminals, terrorists and hostile governments to do bad things.
3290000	3291000	No question.
3291000	3293000	This causes some people to propose.
3293000	3296000	Well, in that case, let's not take the risk.
3296000	3299000	Let's ban AI now before this can happen.
3299000	3304000	Unfortunately, AI is not some esoteric physical matter that is hard to come by like plutonium.
3304000	3305000	It's the opposite.
3305000	3309000	It's the easiest material in the world to come by math and code.
3309000	3312000	The AI cat is obviously already out of the bag.
3312000	3319000	You can learn how to build AI from thousands of free online courses, books, papers and videos.
3319000	3323000	And there are outstanding open source implementations proliferating by the day.
3323000	3324000	AI is like air.
3324000	3325000	It will be everywhere.
3325000	3334000	The level of totalitarian oppression that would be required to arrest that would be so draconian, a world government monitoring and controlling all computers.
3334000	3341000	Jack booted thugs and black helicopters seizing rogue GPUs that we would not have a society left to protect.
3341000	3347000	So instead, there are two very straightforward ways to address the risk of bad people doing bad things with AI.
3347000	3350000	And these are precisely what we should focus on.
3350000	3356000	First, we have the laws on the books to criminalize most of the bad things that anyone is going to do with AI.
3356000	3357000	Hack into the Pentagon.
3357000	3358000	That's a crime.
3358000	3359000	Steal money from a bank.
3359000	3360000	That's a crime.
3360000	3361000	Create a bio weapon.
3361000	3362000	That's a crime.
3362000	3363000	Commit a terrorist act.
3363000	3364000	That's a crime.
3364000	3369000	We can simply focus on preventing those crimes when we can and prosecuting them when we cannot.
3369000	3370000	We don't even need new laws.
3370000	3374000	I'm not aware of a single actual bad use for AI that's been proposed.
3374000	3376000	That's not already illegal.
3376000	3382000	And if a new bad use is identified, we ban that use.
3382000	3384000	But you'll notice what I slipped in there.
3384000	3388000	I said we should focus first on preventing AI assisted crimes before they happen.
3388000	3391000	Wouldn't such prevention mean banning AI?
3391000	3395000	There's another way to prevent such actions, and that's by using AI as a defensive tool.
3395000	3399000	The same capabilities that make AI dangerous in the hands of bad guys with bad goals,
3399000	3402000	make it powerful in the hands of good guys with good goals,
3402000	3406000	specifically the good guys whose job it is to prevent bad things from happening.
3406000	3410000	For example, if you're worried about AI generating fake people and fake videos,
3410000	3417000	the answer is to build new systems where people can verify themselves and real content via cryptographic signatures.
3417000	3421000	Digital creation and alteration of both real and fake content was already here before AI.
3421000	3425000	The answer is not to ban word processors in Photoshop or AI,
3425000	3430000	but to use technology to build a system that actually solves the problem.
3430000	3435000	And so second, let's mount major efforts to use AI for good, legitimate defensive purposes.
3435000	3439000	Let's put AI to work in cyber defense and biological defense and hunting terrorists
3439000	3444000	and everything else that we want to do to keep ourselves, our communities and our nation safe.
3444000	3448000	There are already many smart people in and out of government doing exactly this, of course,
3448000	3455000	but if we apply all of the effort and brainpower that's currently fixated on the futile prospect of banning AI
3455000	3459000	to using AI to protect against bad people doing bad things,
3459000	3464000	I think there's no question a world infused with AI will be much safer than the world we live in today.
3464000	3468000	Okay, we're getting close to the end here. Let's see what we have next.
3468000	3472000	The actual risk of not pursuing AI with maximum force and speed.
3472000	3476000	There is one final and real AI risk that's probably the scariest of all.
3476000	3481000	AI isn't just being developed in the relatively free societies of the West.
3481000	3486000	It's also being developed by the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China.
3486000	3491000	China has a vastly different version, excuse me, vision for AI than we do.
3491000	3495000	They view it as a mechanism for authoritarian population control full stop.
3495000	3498000	They're not even being secretive about this. They're very clear about it,
3498000	3501000	and they are already pursuing their agenda.
3501000	3505000	And they do not intend to limit their AI strategy to China.
3505000	3508000	They intend to proliferate it across the world.
3508000	3513000	Everywhere they're powering 5G networks, everywhere they're loaning belt and road money,
3513000	3517000	everywhere they're providing friendly consumer apps like TikTok
3517000	3521000	that serve as front ends to their centralized command and control AI.
3521000	3526000	The single greatest risk of AI is that China wins global AI dominance,
3526000	3530000	and we, the United States and the West, do not.
3530000	3533000	AI, he writes, propose a simple strategy for what to do about this.
3533000	3538000	In fact, the same strategy President Ronald Reagan used to win the first Cold War
3538000	3542000	with the Soviet Union. We win, they lose.
3542000	3546000	Rather than allowing ungrounded panics around killer AI, harmful AI,
3546000	3551000	job destroying AI, and inequality generating AI to put us on our back feet,
3551000	3556000	we in the United States and the West should lean into AI as hard as we possibly can.
3556000	3560000	We should seek to win the race to global AI technological superiority
3560000	3563000	and ensure that China does not.
3563000	3568000	In the process, we should drive AI into our economy and society as fast and hard as we possibly can
3568000	3572000	in order to maximize its gains for economic productivity and human potential.
3572000	3576000	This is the best way both to offset the real AI risks
3576000	3582000	and to ensure that our way of life is not displaced by the much darker Chinese version.
3583000	3585000	What is to be done?
3585000	3588000	He asks, I propose a simple plan.
3588000	3592000	Big AI companies should be allowed to build AI as fast and aggressively as they can,
3592000	3595000	but not allowed to achieve regulatory capture,
3595000	3598000	not allowed to establish a government protected cartel
3598000	3602000	that is insulated from market competition due to incorrect claims of AI risk.
3602000	3605000	This will maximize the technological and societal payoff
3605000	3610000	from the amazing capabilities of these companies, which are jewels of modern capitalism.
3610000	3615000	Startup AI companies should be allowed to build AI as fast and aggressively as they can.
3615000	3618000	They should neither confront government-granted protection of big companies
3618000	3620000	nor should they receive government assistance.
3620000	3622000	They should simply be allowed to compete.
3622000	3625000	If and as startups don't succeed,
3625000	3630000	their presence in the market will also continuously motivate big companies to be their best.
3630000	3633000	Our economies and societies win either way.
3633000	3638000	Open source AI should be allowed to freely proliferate
3638000	3641000	and compete with both big AI companies and startups.
3641000	3645000	There should be no regulatory barriers to open source whatsoever.
3645000	3647000	Even when open source does not beat companies,
3647000	3650000	its widespread availability is a boon to students all over the world
3650000	3653000	who want to learn how to build and use AI
3653000	3655000	to become part of the technological future
3655000	3658000	and will ensure that AI is available to everyone who can benefit from it
3658000	3661000	no matter who they are or how much money they have.
3661000	3664000	To offset the risk of bad people doing bad things with AI,
3664000	3668000	governments working in partnership with the private sector should vigorously engage
3668000	3674000	in each area of potential risk to use AI to maximize society's defensive capabilities.
3674000	3677000	This shouldn't be limited to AI-enabled risks,
3677000	3680000	but also more general problems such as malnutrition, disease, and climate.
3680000	3683000	AI can be an incredibly powerful tool for solving problems,
3683000	3685000	and we should embrace it as such.
3685000	3687000	To prevent the risk of China achieving global AI dominance,
3687000	3690000	we should use the full power of our private sector,
3690000	3693000	our scientific establishment, and our governments
3693000	3696000	in concert to drive American and Western AI to absolute global dominance,
3696000	3699000	including ultimately inside China itself.
3699000	3703000	We win, they lose, and that is how we use AI to save the world.
3703000	3705000	It's time to build.
3705000	3707000	And then what do we have here?
3707000	3709000	Just two paragraphs to go.
3709000	3710000	Legends and heroes.
3710000	3711000	I close.
3711000	3713000	Mark Andreessen writes with two simple statements.
3713000	3716000	The development of AI started in the 1940s,
3716000	3718000	simultaneous with the invention of the computer.
3718000	3721000	The first scientific paper on neural networks,
3721000	3723000	the architecture of the AI we have today,
3723000	3725000	was published in 1943.
3725000	3729000	Entire generations of AI scientists over the last 80 years were born,
3729000	3732000	went to school, worked, and in many cases passed away
3732000	3734000	without seeing the payoff that we are receiving now.
3734000	3736000	They are legends, everyone.
3736000	3739000	Today, growing legions of engineers, many of whom are young
3739000	3742000	and may have had grandparents or even great-grandparents
3742000	3745000	involved in the creation of the ideas behind AI,
3745000	3748000	looking to make AI a reality against a wall of fear,
3748000	3751000	mongering, and demerism that is attempting to paint them
3751000	3753000	as reckless villains.
3753000	3755000	I do not believe they are reckless or villains.
3755000	3757000	They are heroes, everyone.
3757000	3760000	My firm and I are thrilled to back as many of them as we can,
3760000	3764000	and we will stand alongside them in their work 100%.
3764000	3766000	Okay, so there you go.
3766000	3768000	That was an interesting article.
3768000	3770000	I hope that you learned something from it,
3770000	3772000	and maybe you would not have read it otherwise,
3772000	3774000	so I'm glad we had a chance to go over it.
3774000	3776000	Let's save the world a strong argument here
3776000	3783000	in favor of AI maximalism going all-in on AI, fast and hard,
3783000	3786000	and specifically overcoming some of the more common
3786000	3790000	or responding to some of the more common objections to AI,
3790000	3793000	that it will kill us all,
3793000	3798000	that it's going to have detrimental effects on our society,
3798000	3800000	that it's going to take all our jobs,
3800000	3803000	that it's going to lead to crippling inequality,
3803000	3806000	and that people will do bad things with it,
3806000	3811000	which is the risk that he said actually is the most likely.
3811000	3814000	But you can use AI to stop the bad people
3814000	3816000	who want to do bad things with it
3816000	3819000	if you just use AI for detection purposes
3819000	3822000	and you enforce the laws that are already in place.
3822000	3823000	So there you go.
3823000	3824000	I hope that you enjoyed that.
3824000	3827000	As I said, we should find more occasion to discuss
3827000	3830000	the significance of new AI technologies
3830000	3833000	and the rest of it for the question of the good society,
3833000	3837000	of political sovereignty, of progressivism,
3837000	3840000	and the relationship of technology, freedom, tyranny,
3840000	3841000	all of these kinds of things.
3841000	3843000	I've been discussing those topics more and more
3843000	3845000	with my students in private tutoring
3845000	3847000	who asked me to walk them through
3847000	3850000	what the tradition of political philosophy has had to say
3850000	3852000	so that they who are working in fields
3852000	3855000	of technological entrepreneurship and development
3855000	3857000	can think more clearly about the underlying
3857000	3862000	political theory dimension of the new technologies.
3862000	3863000	And it's great.
3863000	3864000	I'm glad that that's happening.
