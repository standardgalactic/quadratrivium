Checking Underfitted/The Function That Changed Everything.txt
1. The journey of neural networks and deep learning began in 1958 with Frank Rosenblatt's creation of the perceptron, a foundational model for artificial neural networks.

2. For decades, neural networks could only solve linear problems due to the limitations imposed by linear activation functions. Nonlinear activation functions were necessary to tackle more complex tasks.

3. The sigmoid and tanh functions were widely used but were insufficient for training deep networks with many layers, leading to the "vanishing gradient" problem where gradients became too small to effectively update weights during backpropagation.

4. In the late 2000s, Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues introduced a simple activation function called the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which significantly improved the ability to train deep neural networks.

5. The ReLU function addresses the vanishing gradient problem by always outputting zero for negative inputs and the value of the input for positive inputs, thus maintaining non-vanishing gradients throughout the network.

6. Despite not being differentiable at the point where the input is zero, practical implementations of ReLU handle this issue by assigning a specific value (commonly zero) to that point, allowing the function to be used without causing problems.

7. ReLU's advantages include its simplicity, computational efficiency, and effectiveness in preventing saturation, making it a cornerstone of modern deep learning techniques.

8. The story of ReLU underscores the importance of unconventional solutions in advancing technology and suggests that there may still be many simple yet effective solutions waiting to be discovered in other areas of research.
