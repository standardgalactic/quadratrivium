It's training a computer to learn like a human.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
A neural network is a type of deep learning, falling under the category of AI.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
It's a system of hardware and or software designed to mimic how neurons in the human brain work.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
Stick around to learn how it works and why it's useful, but understand there are some limitations.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Click the link above or in the description below to read up on neural networking challenges and the age of high data demands.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
A neural network involves a large number of processors operating in tiers.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
The first tier receives the raw input information and each following tier receives the output from the tier that preceded it.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
Every processing node among all tiers has its own small sphere of knowledge that it applies to the input information.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
The last tier provides the final output.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
That's how it works.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
But how does it learn in order to provide an output?

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Typically, a neural network is fed huge amounts of data on the topic it will be used for.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
It's trained by providing input and telling the network what the output should be.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Rules are also put in place to help the network learn.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
For example, a facial recognition system may be taught to recognize a mustache on a face.

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
During training, the network will be fed pictures of people with and without mustaches and telling it which photos do in fact have a mustache.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
It might also be instructed, mustaches are below the nose and above the mouth.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Rules like this can make the training faster and the end model more powerful.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Neural networks are utilized by a wide variety of industries.

01:33.000 --> 01:41.000
Some notable applications of neural networking include speech-to-text transcription, handwriting recognition, weather prediction,

01:41.000 --> 01:50.000
facial recognition, chatbots, stock market prediction, delivery route planning and optimization, and so much more.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
What are some other applications of neural networking?
