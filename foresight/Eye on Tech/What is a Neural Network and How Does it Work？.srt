00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
It's training a computer to learn like a human.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A neural network is a type of deep learning, falling under the category of AI.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's a system of hardware and or software designed to mimic how neurons in the human brain work.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Stick around to learn how it works and why it's useful, but understand there are some limitations.

Click the link above or in the description below to read up on neural networking challenges and the age of high data demands.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A neural network involves a large number of processors operating in tiers.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The first tier receives the raw input information and each following tier receives the output from the tier that preceded it.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Every processing node among all tiers has its own small sphere of knowledge that it applies to the input information.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The last tier provides the final output.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's how it works.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But how does it learn in order to provide an output?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Typically, a neural network is fed huge amounts of data on the topic it will be used for.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's trained by providing input and telling the network what the output should be.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Rules are also put in place to help the network learn.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For example, a facial recognition system may be taught to recognize a mustache on a face.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
During training, the network will be fed pictures of people with and without mustaches and telling it which photos do in fact have a mustache.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It might also be instructed, mustaches are below the nose and above the mouth.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Rules like this can make the training faster and the end model more powerful.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Neural networks are utilized by a wide variety of industries.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Some notable applications of neural networking include speech-to-text transcription, handwriting recognition, weather prediction,

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
facial recognition, chatbots, stock market prediction, delivery route planning and optimization, and so much more.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What are some other applications of neural networking?
