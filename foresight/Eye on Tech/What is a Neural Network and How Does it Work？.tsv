0	3000	It's training a computer to learn like a human.
7000	12000	A neural network is a type of deep learning, falling under the category of AI.
12000	17000	It's a system of hardware and or software designed to mimic how neurons in the human brain work.
17000	23000	Stick around to learn how it works and why it's useful, but understand there are some limitations.
23000	29000	Click the link above or in the description below to read up on neural networking challenges and the age of high data demands.
29000	33000	A neural network involves a large number of processors operating in tiers.
33000	39000	The first tier receives the raw input information and each following tier receives the output from the tier that preceded it.
39000	46000	Every processing node among all tiers has its own small sphere of knowledge that it applies to the input information.
46000	49000	The last tier provides the final output.
49000	51000	That's how it works.
51000	54000	But how does it learn in order to provide an output?
54000	59000	Typically, a neural network is fed huge amounts of data on the topic it will be used for.
59000	64000	It's trained by providing input and telling the network what the output should be.
64000	68000	Rules are also put in place to help the network learn.
68000	72000	For example, a facial recognition system may be taught to recognize a mustache on a face.
72000	81000	During training, the network will be fed pictures of people with and without mustaches and telling it which photos do in fact have a mustache.
81000	85000	It might also be instructed, mustaches are below the nose and above the mouth.
85000	89000	Rules like this can make the training faster and the end model more powerful.
89000	93000	Neural networks are utilized by a wide variety of industries.
93000	101000	Some notable applications of neural networking include speech-to-text transcription, handwriting recognition, weather prediction,
101000	110000	facial recognition, chatbots, stock market prediction, delivery route planning and optimization, and so much more.
110000	113000	What are some other applications of neural networking?
