00:30.000 --> 00:50.880
Ilya Prigogin was born in Moscow in 1917 and his professor at the Université Libre de

00:50.880 --> 00:56.740
Bruxelles and the Institute of Statistical Mechanics of Austin, Texas.

00:56.740 --> 01:02.260
He directs over 100 researchers in a wide diversity of disciplines from biology to statistical

01:02.260 --> 01:03.260
mechanics.

01:03.260 --> 01:08.420
He is the founder of the so-called Brussels School and a pioneer researcher in the modern

01:08.420 --> 01:12.180
thermodynamics of irreversible processes.

01:12.180 --> 01:16.460
Thanks to his work we have a new conception of the role of chance in physics and biology

01:16.460 --> 01:22.020
and he has coined inescapable essential concepts as we have seen in the debates on determinism

01:22.020 --> 01:28.740
and indeterminism, order through fluctuations, dissipative structures, bifurcation theory

01:28.740 --> 01:31.340
and so on.

01:31.340 --> 01:36.140
His impact on philosophical thought has been evident since the publication of his texts,

01:36.140 --> 01:39.860
La Nouvelle Alliance and Only an Illusion.

01:39.860 --> 01:43.340
In 1977 he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

01:43.340 --> 01:45.420
He is indispensable here today.

01:52.020 --> 02:14.020
Professor Prigogin, thank you very much.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.300
It is a pleasure to be here.

02:16.300 --> 02:23.860
I am sorry to arrive so late but it was just impossible for me to be here earlier.

02:23.860 --> 02:29.300
I want to say that I am very happy to be here and one of the reasons I am very happy to

02:29.300 --> 02:35.220
be here is to be in the Dali Museum.

02:35.220 --> 02:43.340
Since my youth I have been always a great admirer of Dali's work and I believe that some of the

02:43.340 --> 02:51.900
teams which seem to me essential in the work of Dali, the relation between space and time

02:51.900 --> 03:00.340
on one side the pluralism of our vision on the other are also the most important or between

03:00.340 --> 03:05.940
the most important scientific subjects of our time.

03:05.940 --> 03:13.460
One of the very famous writings of Dali is La Conquête de l'Irrationnel.

03:13.460 --> 03:20.580
The question is therefore what is rational and what is not and once we are asking even

03:20.580 --> 03:26.780
this question we are immediately in the middle of the problem of time.

03:26.780 --> 03:33.620
It seemed that the problem of time had been solved once for all by classical science.

03:33.620 --> 03:42.140
As everybody knows classical science presents us a vision of the world which is both deterministic

03:42.140 --> 03:45.820
and time-reversible.

03:45.820 --> 03:53.180
Deterministic once you know the initial conditions you can predict what the future will be like

03:53.180 --> 03:59.820
you could retroject the past if you want and time-reversible which means precisely that

03:59.820 --> 04:06.980
it makes no difference if you consider the future or the past.

04:06.980 --> 04:14.780
More closely to us this I would say statement has been put in a very strong form by Einstein

04:14.780 --> 04:25.260
himself who has said as everybody knows that time as irreversibility is an illusion.

04:25.260 --> 04:33.740
I was always very impressed by this statement which expresses a deep belief in the value

04:33.740 --> 04:36.900
of symbolic thinking.

04:36.900 --> 04:43.580
Everybody knows that time is for everybody of us and essentially mentioned.

04:43.580 --> 04:52.940
Everybody feels time going feels become older and still Einstein was saying that irreversibility

04:52.940 --> 04:57.900
is the main component of existential experience is an illusion.

04:57.900 --> 05:05.740
It is very remarkable that at the beginning of the century there was an agreement between

05:05.740 --> 05:16.020
some of the greatest thinkers, philosophers about the fact on the fact that indeed irreversibility

05:16.020 --> 05:19.940
could not be the subject of science.

05:19.940 --> 05:26.380
I already mentioned Einstein's view which was expressing the fact that our personal

05:26.380 --> 05:34.940
experience of time had to be transcended, had to be purified to become the time of science.

05:34.940 --> 05:40.700
Bergson in a sense reached the same conclusion from an opposite point of view.

05:40.700 --> 05:47.900
He was thinking or estimating that the scientific time was a poorer time.

05:47.900 --> 05:56.220
It was a time reduced to space and to understand existential time you had to go to the concept

05:56.220 --> 06:01.620
of duration which Bergson has been discussing.

06:01.620 --> 06:12.500
Heidegger again came to the conclusion that time was outside the province of science and

06:12.500 --> 06:21.620
in fact Heidegger's analysis was based on one of the most profound analysis of time

06:21.620 --> 06:30.260
which was ever written and that is the analysis of Aristotle written 2,300 years ago.

06:30.260 --> 06:38.700
Aristotle came to a very subtle conclusion, Aristotle came to the conclusion that time

06:38.700 --> 06:44.620
is motion in the perspective of the earlier and the later.

06:44.620 --> 06:47.300
That is a rather complex statement.

06:47.300 --> 06:57.860
In other words, the watch time, the motion of the arrow is not time and indeed it's true,

06:57.860 --> 06:59.380
it's periodic motion.

06:59.380 --> 07:04.020
Therefore it's four before five, four before five, depends on the way in which you think

07:04.020 --> 07:05.020
you look at it.

07:05.260 --> 07:14.700
It is we who have the concept of time because we have the concept of the earlier and the later.

07:14.700 --> 07:20.820
Therefore the question could be answered immediately.

07:20.820 --> 07:29.860
Who gives us then this difference, this feeling for the difference between the earlier and the later?

07:29.860 --> 07:33.540
And already Aristotle discusses the two possibilities.

07:33.540 --> 07:43.540
Either it is the word as a whole some anima mundi which gives us a feeling of the earlier

07:43.540 --> 07:51.860
and the later, or on the contrary it would be the soul, it would be us, the soul who

07:51.860 --> 07:59.260
counts in which it reduces time into a timeless universe.

07:59.260 --> 08:06.700
In other words, the question was very clearly asked, is time uniting men to nature or is

08:06.700 --> 08:11.380
time opposing men to nature?

08:11.380 --> 08:20.940
And what I find so fascinating is that I think in this second part of the century we begin

08:20.940 --> 08:30.220
to be able to give an answer to the questions which have been put so clearly by Aristotle

08:30.220 --> 08:34.660
two thousand three hundred years ago.

08:34.660 --> 08:42.300
Everybody knows that this century has started with two outstanding important new concepts,

08:42.300 --> 08:48.860
conceptual breakthroughs in physics, quantum theory and relativity.

08:48.860 --> 08:56.820
And in some way relativity and quantum theory continue the tradition of classical physics.

08:56.820 --> 09:03.980
In some way I want not to go into details here, even quantum mechanics is a deterministic

09:03.980 --> 09:08.260
theory from the point of view of the wave function.

09:08.260 --> 09:15.380
It is in fact in the second part of the century that the situation has changed and I would

09:15.380 --> 09:21.100
say changed from all directions at the same time.

09:21.100 --> 09:28.980
Who would have thought a few decades ago that all particles with the proper mass would probably

09:28.980 --> 09:29.980
be unstable?

09:29.980 --> 09:37.740
Who would have been imagining that you could speak about a cosmological evolution?

09:37.740 --> 09:43.540
And who would have predicted all these new structures which arise in far from equilibrium

09:43.540 --> 09:44.540
conditions?

09:44.540 --> 09:54.820
Everywhere we see, we see I would say the constructive role of time.

09:54.820 --> 10:01.540
Everywhere we see diversification in stability.

10:01.540 --> 10:08.540
This of course has to change our concept of a law of nature.

10:08.540 --> 10:15.900
Let us not forget that the concept, the western concept of a law of nature has been formulated

10:15.900 --> 10:24.540
in the 17th century, the century of absolute monarchy and the century also of an almighty

10:24.540 --> 10:26.540
God.

10:26.540 --> 10:33.740
And I think we can just not separate the classical idea of a law of nature from its social and

10:33.740 --> 10:36.420
religious connotations.

10:36.420 --> 10:40.980
For God, of course, there could be no difference between past and future.

10:40.980 --> 10:41.980
He knows everything.

10:41.980 --> 10:50.980
It is in the scientist was the representative of God on earth and he also, through science,

10:50.980 --> 11:00.140
would be susceptible to make predictions or to unveil the future as he could unveil

11:00.140 --> 11:01.780
the past.

11:01.780 --> 11:10.100
I think the main content of what I would like to tell you this afternoon is that what we

11:10.100 --> 11:15.780
see emerging now is a different concept of a law of nature.

11:15.780 --> 11:24.180
It is a law of nature in which we as human beings have only a window on reality, a window

11:24.180 --> 11:33.260
of reality which does not, in general, except for very simplified situation, permits extrapolations

11:33.260 --> 11:39.620
to infinite past or infinite future.

11:39.620 --> 11:49.660
I just mentioned that in classical science was essentially related to periodic phenomena

11:49.660 --> 11:56.260
motion of the earth, around the sun, of the moon, around the earth and corresponded, you

11:56.260 --> 11:59.900
could say, to a negation of time.

11:59.900 --> 12:03.700
In the 19th century appeared thermodynamics.

12:03.700 --> 12:08.420
It was the outgrowth of the industrial age.

12:08.420 --> 12:13.380
Everybody knows what are the two laws of thermodynamics.

12:13.380 --> 12:19.500
So the idea of the second law is that there exists a function, the entropy, which is quite

12:19.500 --> 12:21.420
unique properties.

12:21.420 --> 12:28.700
It is the sum of the change of entropy is due to the change of matter and energy with

12:28.700 --> 12:34.620
the outside world, that the entropy flows, and then you have irreversible processes

12:34.620 --> 12:39.380
inside the system which create entropy.

12:39.380 --> 12:44.540
Entropy is a fall like a liquid whose mass would not be conserved.

12:44.540 --> 12:47.740
It increases time going on.

12:48.740 --> 12:56.620
But the second law of thermodynamics was a very unexpected outgrowth of the industrial

12:56.620 --> 12:57.900
age.

12:57.900 --> 13:04.500
It was not formulated by the great mathematician or physicist of the 19th century.

13:04.500 --> 13:12.500
It was formulated by very modest people, physical chemists, engineers, practitioners.

13:12.500 --> 13:21.300
And therefore, it was very natural that immediately, next one, people try to, I would say, to minimize

13:21.300 --> 13:28.420
the second law, to minimize its impact, to consider the situation in which this direction

13:28.420 --> 13:37.620
of time, as it appears in the second law, would be of no importance, and that is equilibrium.

13:37.620 --> 13:48.380
The classical study of the second law was first limited to the end result, to the result

13:48.380 --> 13:54.940
where there was no more any evolution, where all irreversible processes would have stopped,

13:54.940 --> 14:02.260
where there would be no more any privileged direction of time.

14:02.260 --> 14:05.220
That is equilibrium thermodynamics.

14:05.220 --> 14:11.380
And that was really, ah, see the entropy is a function of time, finally the entropy

14:11.380 --> 14:17.460
from isolated system is maximum, and that was really what was studied for a long time.

14:17.460 --> 14:23.060
It is only in the 20th century that people became interested in what happens here.

14:23.060 --> 14:29.260
And the first step was to study the behavior of small deviations, small deviations.

14:29.260 --> 14:36.180
And of course, when you have small deviations in respect to the equilibrium situation, you

14:36.180 --> 14:40.180
can linearize in respect to the deviations.

14:40.180 --> 14:45.180
Everybody knows that when you have linear equations, you have at most one solution.

14:45.180 --> 14:52.380
Therefore, the real interest started only once one became interested in what happens

14:52.380 --> 14:53.880
far from equilibrium.

14:54.380 --> 15:01.480
When the deviation from equilibrium allows, that is the word of non-equilibrium, of strong

15:01.480 --> 15:10.600
non-equilibrium, and far from equilibrium and non-linearity are very connected concepts.

15:10.600 --> 15:18.600
Today, the importance of the far from equilibrium phenomena is well known.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.200
Let me therefore be very brief.

15:21.200 --> 15:29.920
There have been many contributions to this field made by Spanish physicists and chemists.

15:29.920 --> 15:38.120
A very classical example, which I just want to mention for the people from other fields

15:38.120 --> 15:44.560
is the so-called Benarin stability, next one.

15:44.560 --> 15:51.040
An instability which arises when you heat a liquid from below, and at some point you

15:51.040 --> 15:54.360
have the formation of patterns.

15:54.360 --> 16:01.840
You see, when you heat a liquid from below, at some point you have the formation of patterns.

16:01.840 --> 16:09.800
Now the formation of patterns corresponds to supramolecular correlations, correlations

16:09.800 --> 16:13.600
which involve billions of molecules.

16:13.600 --> 16:19.680
So in a sense, you can say that the heat, the energy which you give to the system is

16:19.680 --> 16:25.920
transformed into organization, into space-time pattern.

16:25.920 --> 16:33.600
This is in fact very unexpected, because from the classical point of view, each molecule

16:33.600 --> 16:37.000
could see only the next ones.

16:37.000 --> 16:44.600
Somebody was emphasizing the short range of molecular interactions, but in Benarin stability,

16:44.600 --> 16:52.640
like here, or in chemical-ossiating reactions, in biochemical reactions, which I know very

16:52.640 --> 17:00.800
often, very much studied, you see collective behavior, coherence, appearing as a result

17:00.800 --> 17:04.680
of the far from equilibrium situation.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.240
This is most unexpected.

17:07.240 --> 17:16.520
And today much effort is made in this direction, and I must say that I am still extremely astonished

17:16.520 --> 17:25.440
by the variety of behavior, by the variety of space-time patterns which may appear.

17:25.440 --> 17:34.640
In a sense, once you go to the far from equilibrium condition, you break euclidean invariance,

17:34.640 --> 17:42.200
no more two points play the same role, no more two instance play the same role.

17:42.200 --> 17:47.520
Let me simply emphasize one aspect, next one.

17:47.520 --> 17:51.360
And that is the problem of attractors.

17:51.360 --> 18:00.160
If I take the sun, let's say the earth, and I take a comet, and I take a comet coming

18:00.160 --> 18:02.400
close to the earth.

18:02.400 --> 18:08.120
Of course, the position, the trajectory of the earth will be changed, and once the comet

18:08.120 --> 18:14.800
will go away, the earth will keep the new trajectory.

18:14.800 --> 18:21.400
Therefore, the stability of classical dynamical systems is very limited.

18:21.400 --> 18:27.480
On the contrary, if I take a pendulum, and if I take into account the friction, the pendulum

18:27.480 --> 18:34.440
stops at the point, and that is the point attractor, which is really the simplest example

18:34.440 --> 18:40.520
of strong stability, you see, which people know since many, many years or centuries,

18:40.520 --> 18:42.520
I would say, in this case.

18:42.520 --> 18:50.560
Now one of the discoveries of non-equilibrium physics was the appearance of other type of

18:50.560 --> 18:51.560
attractors.

18:51.560 --> 18:56.120
One of the type of attractors, that was the point attractor.

18:57.120 --> 19:06.120
But another type of attractor is an attractor which is no more a point, but is a trajectory.

19:06.120 --> 19:11.720
Wherever you start, you come here, and that is a limit cycle, and that is the basis of

19:11.720 --> 19:15.600
chemical periodic reactions, biochemical regulation.

19:15.600 --> 19:21.760
And in the last years, there is much more interest in even another type of attractor.

19:21.760 --> 19:29.240
Very briefly, speaking, an attractor which combines ideas of stability and instability,

19:29.240 --> 19:34.960
in which part is that nearby trajectories go away, and still they cannot go away forever,

19:34.960 --> 19:36.480
they come back in some way.

19:36.480 --> 19:44.920
Next one, attractors which, in a sense, I could try to imagine as many, many points

19:44.920 --> 19:50.560
forming a volume or something like that, when it speaks about fractal attractors, but it's

19:50.560 --> 19:53.400
of no importance here, you see?

19:53.400 --> 20:00.240
And therefore the system is all the time jumping from one point to another here, and the general

20:00.240 --> 20:09.000
aspect is an aspect which is not very different from fully developed turbulence, let's say.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Next one.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.920
Now, for example, here's an image of such kind of attractor, you see?

20:14.920 --> 20:20.440
In respect to this point, you have instability, the system is going away, but then it comes

20:20.440 --> 20:25.920
back again, and of course, by going away and coming back, the system is mixed all the

20:25.920 --> 20:26.920
time.

20:26.920 --> 20:35.200
And what I found most remarkable is that in the last two, three years, most interesting

20:35.200 --> 20:42.000
application of this type of attractors have been presented to very different fields, be

20:42.000 --> 20:48.400
it meteorology, or be it brain waves, electrical activity of brain waves, and so on and so

20:48.400 --> 20:49.400
on.

20:49.400 --> 20:54.520
For example, I have taken just an example which has been studied by my colleague Nicholas,

20:54.520 --> 21:00.080
and people interested can find the paper in Nature six months ago or so.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.080
Next one.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.080
You see?

21:02.080 --> 21:10.040
Consider, for example, the temperature, that is the temperature of a million years as recorded

21:10.040 --> 21:14.160
from the depths of the ocean, and you see it is widely fluctuated.

21:14.160 --> 21:19.320
Now, what would be the vision of a classical physicist?

21:19.320 --> 21:24.960
The classical physicist would have said temperature is fluctuating because the temperature is

21:24.960 --> 21:32.720
a result of 100 variables, each of them obeying the simplification, but as many of them, well,

21:32.720 --> 21:35.720
it gives the appearance of high regularity.

21:35.720 --> 21:44.120
But we have no methods due to Ruel, Tachens, Procaccia, and many other people which permit

21:44.120 --> 21:51.480
to analyze the type of attractor, which is below, I would say, this type of time variation.

21:51.480 --> 21:58.920
And the result is that this comes, this time series can be understood as being generated

21:58.920 --> 22:06.960
by deterministic system of only four variables, four variables, therefore, this complicated

22:06.960 --> 22:14.400
variation is not due to a kind of law of large numbers in which there are 100 variables.

22:14.400 --> 22:20.320
It is intrinsically complex, intrinsically unpredictable.

22:20.320 --> 22:26.800
This changes really, I would say, our way of understanding nature around us.

22:26.800 --> 22:32.120
And I just can mention, I have no time to go into this, that also very recent results

22:32.120 --> 22:39.720
have shown that the electrical brain waves in full, in deep sleep, correspond also to

22:39.720 --> 22:44.680
a kind of endogenous, high dimensional attractor.

22:44.680 --> 22:50.520
However, when we are awake, when we look on something, on a painting, then of course

22:50.520 --> 22:56.720
you cannot hope to describe things in terms of a deterministic unstable system, because

22:56.720 --> 23:00.560
then there is an input coming all the time from the outside world.

23:00.560 --> 23:06.760
What is very interesting is that this instability is very complex, which means that we begin

23:06.760 --> 23:14.240
to have the idea that there may be a dynamical evolution in biology leading to very high

23:14.240 --> 23:17.480
dimensional attractors.

23:17.480 --> 23:23.400
Because if you think, for example, let me explain why I think it disturbs, if you think

23:23.400 --> 23:28.320
about an insect, it makes music, but the music is very, very simple.

23:28.320 --> 23:34.760
Of the type of a limit cycle, it's certainly not of an attractor of high dimensionality.

23:34.760 --> 23:40.680
In other words, it may well be that the dynamical structure of the electrical activity has been

23:40.680 --> 23:46.640
evolving during biological evolution, and that the brain, which is high in stability,

23:46.640 --> 23:55.400
is precisely the origin of, I would say, creativity, and so on, coming from this background instability,

23:55.400 --> 24:01.560
which can then be amplified by external, I would say, small changes.

24:01.560 --> 24:07.240
Exactly like here, very small changes in the position of the earth, and so on, can bring

24:07.240 --> 24:09.040
in a new glaciation.

24:09.040 --> 24:15.720
But there is another aspect, and here I come to one of the main themes of Salvador Dali,

24:15.760 --> 24:19.120
the relation between time and space.

24:19.120 --> 24:25.720
Essentially, and I would like to illustrate this very briefly on two examples.

24:25.720 --> 24:31.040
Essentially, how have you to understand a biomolecule, BDNA or whatsoever?

24:31.040 --> 24:42.040
Obviously, a biomolecule is a system which has an order which is with a broken time symmetry.

24:42.040 --> 24:47.600
The broken time symmetry is obvious because you have to read the code in one direction.

24:47.600 --> 24:52.240
They are starting and stopping points, which means that you have to read it.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.640
Exactly you have to read a book or something like that.

24:55.640 --> 24:57.760
Therefore, it's a broken symmetry.

24:57.760 --> 25:04.040
The question is, however such a broken symmetry could have arisen in a natural object, and

25:04.040 --> 25:10.880
that is exactly what I mean by saying we have to understand the inscription of time in space.

25:10.880 --> 25:18.440
The exactly like or in a more complicated situation, for example, is the situation which

25:18.440 --> 25:23.840
I have explained, mentioned a few minutes ago, when I was speaking about the Benarin

25:23.840 --> 25:24.840
stability.

25:24.840 --> 25:30.120
There, the patterns are really the expression of a broken time symmetry.

25:30.120 --> 25:36.680
Now, we would like to understand DNA, let's say, as an expression of a broken time symmetry

25:36.680 --> 25:40.400
and understand how this broken time symmetry has ever arisen.

25:40.920 --> 25:48.480
Now, I cannot give an answer, but I would like to show some very recent result obtained

25:48.480 --> 25:54.960
by a few people from our group, Subaraos and Nicholas and so on, which have essentially

25:54.960 --> 26:02.880
made the following experiment, which is now beginning to be repeated in a real situation

26:02.880 --> 26:06.600
in the United States, in which may have the next one.

26:06.600 --> 26:14.040
We consider a chaotic reaction, and every time one of the variables goes beyond some

26:14.040 --> 26:22.000
threshold, we suppose that it is put in on a polymer, on a polymer chain, and we look

26:22.000 --> 26:23.800
on the structure of the polymer chain.

26:23.800 --> 26:30.480
Now, this structure can be analyzed, and one can show that it is quite remarkable.

26:30.480 --> 26:38.600
It corresponds to a Markov chain, which is oriented, contains an incompressible information

26:38.600 --> 26:43.760
once you know part of the chain you cannot predict what the other part will do, and therefore

26:43.760 --> 26:48.440
it has already many features of biomolecules.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.480
And let me now briefly ask another question.

26:51.480 --> 26:56.480
How do we have to consider cosmology from the point of view of thermodynamics?

26:56.480 --> 27:02.080
Now, you know that the history of cosmology is one of the most dramatic histories of

27:02.080 --> 27:03.080
dissension.

27:03.080 --> 27:11.200
You know that Einstein applied general relativity, came to the idea of the universe as a geometric

27:11.200 --> 27:17.880
object, and you know also that his first model was a static model, and that the first idea

27:17.880 --> 27:24.600
was that his model could not be valid because of Hubble's law, and instability of Einstein's

27:24.600 --> 27:29.360
equation, which showed that you have to go to the metric type of equation of an expanding

27:29.360 --> 27:30.360
universe.

27:30.360 --> 27:40.800
So the first, I would say, drawback of Einstein's static geometrical ideas was to go to a geometrical

27:40.800 --> 27:46.160
changing to a universe which is changing from the geometrical point of view.

27:46.160 --> 27:53.280
Now the next dramatic step was, of course, the discovery of the black body radiation.

27:53.280 --> 27:58.480
Of the black body radiation, which shows that the evolution was not only a geometrical

27:58.480 --> 28:01.560
evolution, but was a thermal evolution.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.680
I regret that I was not here this morning.

28:03.680 --> 28:08.800
I'm sure that Professor Schatzman has spoken about this much better than I can do.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.800
But let me simply remind you what probably has been said.

28:11.800 --> 28:19.400
Therefore, the next step was the idea of an evolving universe with an entropy content.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.040
Next, please.

28:21.040 --> 28:27.760
And then you come, therefore, to the traditional idea of the, I would say, orthodox theory

28:27.760 --> 28:33.960
in which the temperature when I go into the past is increasing all the time, and in which

28:33.960 --> 28:41.760
essentially the entropy of the universe which is here below is a constant, and this going

28:41.760 --> 28:46.080
down comes from the adiabatic expansion of the universe.

28:46.080 --> 28:52.640
Now many people, and I'm not an exception, believe that this cannot be a satisfactory

28:52.640 --> 28:53.640
theory.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.640
Why?

28:54.640 --> 29:00.560
Because it is very difficult to imagine that the universe has started with this strange

29:00.560 --> 29:07.800
high entropy structure which is reflected by this strange, I would say, structure of

29:07.800 --> 29:13.080
the physical universe in which there are photons which are end products.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.080
They cannot do anything.

29:14.080 --> 29:21.400
They cannot be transformed into anything, and variants which are essentially unstable.

29:21.400 --> 29:29.680
The universe is essentially a strange two-component system, one being like the base product and

29:29.680 --> 29:36.680
the other like the carrier of irreversibility, because the protons or whatsoever are either

29:36.680 --> 29:42.360
in metastable state, but they are certainly not decaying, but they are certainly not equilibrium

29:42.640 --> 29:43.640
objects.

29:43.640 --> 29:49.840
Therefore, the view which I would like to advocate, let me give you a very simple example,

29:49.840 --> 29:58.120
next one, would be a view, let's say first I take a very simple example from a physical

29:58.120 --> 30:00.000
chemist point of view.

30:00.000 --> 30:06.280
Suppose I have two components, and I heat one and I cool the other, and because of the

30:06.280 --> 30:13.880
difference of temperature, I have also one component, the black one, predominantly here,

30:13.880 --> 30:17.720
and one component, the white one, predominantly there.

30:17.720 --> 30:24.960
Now suppose I stop the heating, then of course I would have the heat which is already there,

30:24.960 --> 30:31.040
the photons, let's say, and I would have first too many black hairs and too many white hairs.

30:31.040 --> 30:36.360
Therefore I would have one component which is already the base component, and the others

30:36.360 --> 30:41.480
would be slowly going to equilibrium, and that is essentially the view of the physical

30:41.480 --> 30:47.040
universe, in which we have two components, one which is already a base product, in which

30:47.040 --> 30:52.600
there is no arrow of time, except of the change, the geometrical change of the universe, and

30:52.600 --> 30:57.600
the other in which there is still an arrow of time, and the question is then, can we

30:57.600 --> 31:01.960
give a simple interpretation of this strange situation?

31:01.960 --> 31:09.360
Well, in a paper which will soon appear, I've tried to do so by reconsidering the formulation

31:09.360 --> 31:12.200
of the second law of thermodynamics.

31:12.200 --> 31:16.120
In the discussion I can answer questions, I have all the reprint here for people who

31:16.120 --> 31:23.480
are interested, but let me try to schematically express what's going on.

31:23.480 --> 31:32.960
The idea is, well, I think that is too complex, you see, let me give you simply the idea.

31:32.960 --> 31:42.320
The idea is that in Einstein's equation we have two types of realities which are coexisting,

31:42.320 --> 31:50.440
spacetime and matter, and Einstein's equation express a relation between the spacetime and

31:50.440 --> 31:51.440
matter.

31:51.440 --> 31:57.040
Now, while they express a relation between the two, they don't say that the entropy

31:57.040 --> 32:01.200
of matter is equivalent to the entropy of spacetime.

32:01.200 --> 32:05.800
Spacetime can be considered as a much more coherent structure than matter.

32:05.800 --> 32:12.680
You can imagine matter as defects in spacetime structure, if you want, a kind of defect of

32:12.680 --> 32:19.040
all kind of types you can imagine, and therefore you can imagine that in the early stage of

32:19.040 --> 32:27.360
the universe there may have been a transfer of gravitational energy into matter leading

32:27.360 --> 32:29.960
to a burst of entropy.

32:29.960 --> 32:36.040
Now this burst of entropy would then create a large number of waste products, exactly

32:36.040 --> 32:41.800
like my heating in my example two minutes ago, and create organized matter with the breaking

32:41.800 --> 32:45.840
of symmetries, a little like in the Benard instability.

32:45.840 --> 32:51.960
And then in our present stage of the universe, this part which has been created in this burst

32:51.960 --> 32:56.840
of entropy is then slowly decaying to equilibrium.

32:56.840 --> 33:01.760
One has to be careful in the formulations, one has to go to well-defined type of coordinate

33:01.760 --> 33:04.720
systems, next one.

33:04.720 --> 33:12.480
And the result is essentially the following, that now the temperature starts with zero

33:12.480 --> 33:15.520
and the entropy starts with zero.

33:15.520 --> 33:21.800
And here you have a kind of phase change corresponding to what I have just said, and one can show

33:21.800 --> 33:27.280
that this phase change is only possible if it leads to the right ratio of variance to

33:27.280 --> 33:28.880
photons.

33:28.880 --> 33:33.840
In other words, and it appears also at the right time, it is essentially a plank time

33:33.840 --> 33:35.880
or something like that.

33:35.880 --> 33:42.040
And the entropy is, you see, what is the reason of the temperature here?

33:42.040 --> 33:48.360
This is the state of the self-heating, and this is the state of the adiabatic expansion.

33:48.360 --> 33:55.280
The self-heating corresponds to a transformation of the initial geometry of the universe which

33:55.280 --> 34:01.960
was non-nucleogen into the euclidean local structure which we have present.

34:01.960 --> 34:06.960
And this you can study in conformal coordinates for the specialists.

34:07.440 --> 34:12.320
That is really the origin here of this increase of the self-heating.

34:12.320 --> 34:17.800
You can imagine the self-heating as being the transformation of gravitation into heavy

34:17.800 --> 34:25.360
particles which then decay into photons and variants of the type we know today.

34:25.360 --> 34:33.360
The entropy now starts at zero and increases to its constant value corresponding to the

34:33.360 --> 34:36.080
adiabatic evolution we know today.

34:36.080 --> 34:46.160
Now this type of vision seems to indicate that the two famous theories which have been

34:46.160 --> 34:52.920
so much discussed in the past, creation of the universe or steady state universe, are

34:52.920 --> 34:56.680
in fact not so different than what we are thinking.

34:56.680 --> 35:01.720
Because essentially it shows that the space-time structure as we can conceive it today, let's

35:01.720 --> 35:08.400
say, the Minkowski vacuum, is unstable in respect to formation, simultaneous formation

35:08.400 --> 35:10.480
of curvature and matter.

35:10.480 --> 35:17.520
In other words, that irreversible processes may proceed in the vacuum, or better to say

35:17.520 --> 35:23.160
in philosophical terms which I hope Salvador Dali would not have disapproved, time precedes

35:23.160 --> 35:24.960
existence.

35:24.960 --> 35:32.200
Time precedes existence in the sense that every time the conditions would be the right

35:32.200 --> 35:35.080
ones, a new universe could start.

35:35.080 --> 35:40.960
But as the times get involved, maybe perhaps 100 billion years, I really don't know what

35:40.960 --> 35:41.960
it means.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.960
Is 100 billion years very long?

35:43.960 --> 35:44.960
Is this very short?

35:44.960 --> 35:45.960
I really don't know.

35:45.960 --> 35:51.040
You know that there are some civilizations like the Christian civilization which speak

35:51.040 --> 35:53.480
always about very short times.

35:53.480 --> 35:57.280
And you have other civilizations like the Indian civilizations, the Mayas, which speak

35:57.280 --> 35:59.960
about billions of years, I mean.

35:59.960 --> 36:06.960
And finally, I really don't know what is the meaning of time in this connection.

36:06.960 --> 36:13.800
But anyway, whenever you begin to have an explanation of a phenomena, and the two most

36:13.800 --> 36:19.840
striking phenomena in our experience are probably life and the universe, and the classical

36:19.840 --> 36:26.880
perspective, both life and the universe appear nearly as transgressions, as something which

36:26.880 --> 36:31.200
is there, but there was no reason that it would be there.

36:31.200 --> 36:37.240
And then she said life was permitted, not in contradiction with the laws of nature,

36:37.240 --> 36:42.240
but not really expressing the natural laws of nature, how it could be if the laws of

36:42.240 --> 36:47.360
nature would be the motion of the moon around the earth, life has nothing to do with that.

36:47.360 --> 36:53.000
And in the same sense, the existence of the universe appeared to be a unique event in

36:53.000 --> 36:56.880
the perspective of an eternal kind of equilibrium.

36:56.880 --> 37:03.560
Once you go away from this type of concepts, you can conceive on situations which describe

37:03.560 --> 37:09.040
an eternal universe which at the same moment is not static.

37:09.040 --> 37:15.760
It is more similar to a relaxation of theater, which starts, increases the case, and another

37:15.760 --> 37:21.560
part starts somewhere far, increases again, and decays.

37:21.560 --> 37:29.440
So essentially, I think that is the first, at this end, I would say, the first part and

37:29.440 --> 37:37.840
the largest part of my lecture, which is just trying to give you another view on the role

37:37.840 --> 37:39.480
of irreversibility.

37:39.480 --> 37:46.040
It is obvious today, and I hope it will become obvious to all people, that irreversibility

37:46.040 --> 37:53.720
plays a more and more important, constructive role, beat on the level of biomolecules, beat

37:53.720 --> 37:59.680
on the level of meteorology, beat on the level, probably, of cosmology.

37:59.680 --> 38:04.440
In other models, I have no time now to enumerate all models of cosmology, but I can invoke

38:04.440 --> 38:11.040
other type of phase transitions, gauge symmetry breaking, and so on, which don't give a simple

38:11.040 --> 38:15.520
interpretation of the zero temperature, zero entropy, starting condition.

38:15.520 --> 38:19.760
But therefore, we have now to ask then the following question.

38:19.760 --> 38:31.440
If then, if then the world is very much dependent on the idea of irreversibility, how then to

38:31.440 --> 38:36.640
introduce this idea of irreversibility on the basic level?

38:36.640 --> 38:40.600
In other words, what is the reason for the existence of irreversibility?

38:40.600 --> 38:46.840
We all believe that Newton has discovered, really, some of the basic roots of science,

38:46.840 --> 38:50.120
where irreversibility is playing a role.

38:50.120 --> 38:55.880
And the recent outcome shows that the answer is very clear.

38:55.880 --> 39:00.560
Irreversibility is an aspect of instability.

39:00.560 --> 39:07.280
Instability appears at the point where the idea of a trajectory and the quantum mechanics,

39:07.280 --> 39:13.760
I would say, an idea of the wave function becomes irrelevant because of instability,

39:13.760 --> 39:21.840
because of the fact that two initial conditions, as close as you want, give rise to divergent

39:21.840 --> 39:22.840
trajectories.

39:22.840 --> 39:28.720
I can illustrate this on an example which has already been discussed by Poicaré himself.

39:28.720 --> 39:35.280
It is just the example which is illustrated here, the dice or whatever, domino or whatever

39:35.280 --> 39:36.280
you want.

39:36.280 --> 39:42.800
When you throw a dice or a piece of money and you look, you find that half of the time

39:42.800 --> 39:48.320
it falls on one side, half of the time it falls on the other, what is the law of nature?

39:48.320 --> 39:53.040
Half and half, half and half, you could say no, of course not.

39:53.040 --> 39:58.200
I know it's a deterministic system, being a deterministic system, it's one or zero.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.680
It's not one half, one half.

40:00.680 --> 40:06.240
And that is really the stumbling block which many people have not understood because it

40:06.240 --> 40:13.400
would be true to say yes, it is a deterministic system if we could realize the conditions

40:13.400 --> 40:18.680
for the deterministic system with any finite precision, but that is not the case.

40:18.680 --> 40:25.840
For a really unstable dynamical system, whatever the uncertainty on the initial condition, it

40:25.840 --> 40:28.160
will still be one half, one half.

40:28.160 --> 40:32.400
I can increase uncertainty, it will still remain one half, one half.

40:32.400 --> 40:39.640
It's only on the limit, on this limit I can never reach, in which it becomes one or zero.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.520
Let me illustrate this on very trivial examples.

40:42.520 --> 40:47.640
If you take, you look on the length of a circle, you could say, well, since Pythagore or other,

40:47.640 --> 40:48.960
I know how to do it.

40:48.960 --> 40:53.640
I put a polygon and I count the length of the polygon and that's a very good matter,

40:53.640 --> 40:54.640
why?

40:54.640 --> 41:02.520
Because already for a finite number of sides, you see, I have already a good approximation

41:02.520 --> 41:08.560
for the length of the circle, but if I take, ask a question, what is the curvature?

41:08.560 --> 41:13.880
Obviously, whatever the number of the sides of my polygon, the curvature is zero, but

41:13.880 --> 41:16.840
the curvature of my circle is not zero.

41:16.840 --> 41:21.280
Therefore, the polygon will never be a model for my circle.

41:21.280 --> 41:26.640
Or in other words, if I could only construct polygons, I could never use the circle as

41:26.640 --> 41:32.600
an image from the point of view of the curvature of the polygon.

41:32.600 --> 41:38.040
In other words, the statement which I try to make is the following.

41:38.040 --> 41:47.520
If the formulation of laws of nature require an infinite precision or an idealization which

41:47.520 --> 41:56.960
can never be reached in reality, then it is no more an appropriate way of treating such

41:56.960 --> 41:59.120
kind of situations.

41:59.120 --> 42:06.400
And that I would like to illustrate on the example of classical dynamical systems very

42:06.400 --> 42:07.400
briefly.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.400
Next one.

42:08.400 --> 42:15.160
First of all, what is a classical dynamical system?

42:15.160 --> 42:19.200
A classical dynamical system is something very, very simple.

42:19.200 --> 42:25.320
It is a phase space and contains a trajectory going from one to the other, and it contains

42:25.320 --> 42:27.920
a conserved measure.

42:27.920 --> 42:32.960
What means a conserved measure is that if I take here my points inside the circle or

42:32.960 --> 42:40.560
whatever this is, time going on, this can become a longer line or can be even broken

42:40.560 --> 42:44.240
into pieces, but the volume remains constant.

42:44.240 --> 42:49.440
In other words, the classical world is a museum.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.680
Everything is conserved.

42:50.680 --> 42:59.080
If I take a piece of paper, you see, by analogy, I could throw it in pieces, but the pieces

42:59.080 --> 43:06.400
I could put them into a corner, you see, but they would lie around, and I could ask somebody

43:06.400 --> 43:09.120
to bring them together and you could start again.

43:09.120 --> 43:16.480
In other words, it's like a wind, like an uragan, which breaks things, but keeps them

43:16.480 --> 43:20.840
at least fragments as fragments intact.

43:20.840 --> 43:28.520
Now this is, of course, very far from the idea of processes or reversibility, which we see

43:28.520 --> 43:31.800
now to appear in our basic description.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.880
Next one.

43:33.880 --> 43:41.680
Now an idealized system, which I like to use for illustration, is the so-called Baker

43:41.680 --> 43:53.360
transformation in which I take a square and I flatten it and I put the right part above.

43:53.360 --> 44:02.680
And this is an example of unstable dynamical systems, and unstable dynamism is one direction

44:02.680 --> 44:09.480
here being the direction of contraction, and one direction being the direction of dilatation.

44:09.480 --> 44:17.000
In that it's very important, is that for such systems, whatever my initial finite precision

44:17.000 --> 44:23.920
will be, after some time I will no more know where the point will go.

44:23.920 --> 44:28.200
Next one.

44:28.200 --> 44:35.200
You see, that can be very nicely illustrated by writing the coordinates, the coordinates

44:35.200 --> 44:43.000
of the point in the, in my square in terms of a binary expansion.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.960
I write simply x equal Sn over 2 exponent n, let's say.

44:48.960 --> 44:56.040
In other words, Sn, I just write the digits in the decimal, in the dual system.

44:56.040 --> 45:03.800
And then one can show that this shifting, this scratching and putting above of the Baker

45:03.800 --> 45:08.440
corresponds to what's called a Bernouy shift, not shift, of course, the shift, in which

45:08.440 --> 45:10.640
the digits are changing.

45:10.640 --> 45:17.120
Now what this means is that the main digits, where of course the digits are 1 over 2, 1

45:17.120 --> 45:21.120
over 4, 1 over 8, that were the main digits.

45:21.120 --> 45:27.680
The digits 1 over 2 exponent 2,000, of course, doesn't play metrol in the beginning, and

45:27.680 --> 45:32.120
whatever my finite precision, it is something which I don't know.

45:32.120 --> 45:35.600
But the position is not the same.

45:35.600 --> 45:42.920
After one change, instead of being 2,000, it becomes 1,999, and it shifts to more and

45:42.920 --> 45:48.560
more closer and closer, and its importance becomes larger and larger.

45:48.560 --> 45:55.520
As a result, whatever the finite precision, which you know in such kind of system, at

45:55.520 --> 45:59.280
some points, you will not know what it will do.

45:59.280 --> 46:07.080
And the question is not to stay, to simply stop at the question of undecidability, like

46:07.080 --> 46:15.720
mathematicians like to call it, but to develop a coherent dynamical scheme which corresponds

46:15.720 --> 46:22.480
to the realistic situations in which indeed we never know more than a window.

46:22.480 --> 46:29.560
We know a number of the CISN, we never know an infinite number of them.

46:29.560 --> 46:36.960
And then what you can show is that this corresponds to the idea that as you can never know all

46:36.960 --> 46:41.000
of them, you never know what the trajectory is.

46:41.000 --> 46:48.320
What you know is only bundles of trajectories, collections of trajectories having some temporal

46:48.320 --> 46:50.400
window in common.

46:50.400 --> 47:00.320
And these bundles of trajectories satisfying the same observed part of the behavior correspond

47:00.320 --> 47:06.800
to a semi-group, no more a dynamical group, which goes in both directions, but a semi-group

47:06.800 --> 47:10.480
because information is flowing out and disappearing.

47:10.480 --> 47:15.680
If you would take the Baker transformation and try to verify the classical statements

47:15.680 --> 47:20.040
of mechanics on the conservation of phase space and so on, you can never do it.

47:20.040 --> 47:24.440
There is no computer on which you can do it because every computer has a finite precision

47:24.440 --> 47:25.640
whatever it is.

47:25.640 --> 47:30.360
And after some time, you will see that the entropy is increasing instead of remaining

47:30.360 --> 47:33.200
constant as classical mechanics months.

47:33.200 --> 47:38.040
Have you then to say that classical mechanics is correct?

47:38.040 --> 47:45.720
Yes, it is correct for the type and what I mean correct experimentally verifiable for

47:45.720 --> 47:50.560
the type of systems for which it has been invented, which are essentially periodic systems.

47:50.560 --> 47:56.360
But it is no more applicable, I would not say incorrect, for situations for which it

47:56.360 --> 47:57.360
was not made.

47:57.360 --> 48:04.480
And the situations for which it was not made are the situations of high dynamical instability.

48:04.480 --> 48:05.920
Next one.

48:05.920 --> 48:12.880
And very recently, one of my co-workers working with Professor Zebehele, who is a world expert

48:12.880 --> 48:18.560
in celestial dynamics, and the problem of three bodies, has discovered a most remarkable

48:18.560 --> 48:24.800
example of such a situation in astrophysics.

48:24.800 --> 48:29.640
No more the poor Baker transformation, which is after all a very poor example.

48:29.640 --> 48:37.040
You imagine you see no appeal to no pretension to any realistic situation, but a very simple

48:37.040 --> 48:47.280
example in which essentially you have the doublet, which is here, sun, Jupiter, and you

48:47.280 --> 48:52.840
imagine that a comet is coming closer on a parabolic motion.

48:52.840 --> 48:57.880
I take a very simple example, there are many others, and I take the restricted three body

48:57.880 --> 49:02.800
problem, I suppose all the three bodies are in a plane.

49:02.800 --> 49:10.800
Now what is so interesting in such a situation is that the parabolic motion is at the border

49:10.800 --> 49:19.920
between elliptic motion, capture, and hyperbolic motion, in which the comet would be ejected.

49:19.920 --> 49:26.680
In a sense, you can even find these situations in simpler examples, like the elastic pendulum.

49:26.680 --> 49:31.960
You can take a pendulum, but I consider an elastic pendulum, you see, a spring together

49:31.960 --> 49:33.480
with a pendulum.

49:33.480 --> 49:42.400
Then in the neighborhood of the difference between vibration and rotation, very small

49:42.400 --> 49:47.680
differences can bring the pendulum from one region to another, and that has been called

49:47.680 --> 49:49.880
the stochastic layer.

49:49.880 --> 49:55.240
Here you have the periodic motions, and here you have the rotational motions of the pendulum.

49:55.240 --> 50:04.760
Now this problem can be solved rigorously, that's a problem which can be solved rigorously

50:04.760 --> 50:09.960
by methods which I have no time to explain, I have a preprint here, if somebody is interested.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.600
And that comes out as a following.

50:11.600 --> 50:21.640
I can try to calculate the rotation time of the comet, I mean suppose it is captured,

50:21.640 --> 50:24.640
and I calculate how many times it will go around.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.000
I can calculate this.

50:26.000 --> 50:33.280
It depends on the phase of Jupiter in respect to the Sun at the point of closest approach.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.280
Next slide.

50:34.280 --> 50:39.680
And the type of figures which you obtain when you calculate this are the following.

50:39.680 --> 50:46.400
Here the calculation is made changing the accuracy over 10 digits, and calculating for

50:46.400 --> 50:54.560
various initial conditions the revolution number, you see, versus accuracy, versus accuracy.

50:54.560 --> 51:06.560
You see that you obtain 757, 38, 236, 44 revolutions, 12, 157, 7, 8, 143, 17, and you can make this

51:06.560 --> 51:08.280
for various initial conditions.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.240
Now what this means is a following.

51:10.240 --> 51:17.520
An improvement of the precision of the initial in which you calculate is of no importance.

51:17.520 --> 51:23.280
There is not the slightest indication that the series will ever converge.

51:23.280 --> 51:31.880
Therefore, you can just not predict the revolution time and the revolution number of the comet.

51:31.880 --> 51:39.000
In other words, instability and stochasticity, which is the basis of irreversibility, is

51:39.000 --> 51:41.440
now a celestial dynamical problem.

51:41.440 --> 51:46.600
You see it in the sky, you don't need to go to quantum mechanics, you see it in the sky.

51:46.600 --> 51:52.160
But you can calculate this problem from the point of view, and the reason for this is

51:52.160 --> 51:53.160
very simple.

51:53.160 --> 51:58.200
Because the motion is very slow, and therefore you can never calculate the exact phase.

51:58.200 --> 52:03.600
You have to calculate the sign of phi t, let's say, for times which are very, very long,

52:03.600 --> 52:07.480
and that's just impossible to do, whatever the final accuracy will be.

52:07.480 --> 52:14.600
Now if you calculate on the contrary the stochastic behavior, the statistical behavior, there

52:14.600 --> 52:16.480
is no problem.

52:16.480 --> 52:18.560
Next one, there is no problem.

52:18.560 --> 52:25.200
You can calculate, you can calculate, well it's not very clear to see, the dimension

52:25.200 --> 52:33.320
of the comet cloud, and even some fine structures, and you can see how it moves, you see, in

52:33.320 --> 52:34.920
the restricted problem.

52:34.920 --> 52:41.920
And Professor Zebehi and Petrovsky have also calculated in this way, I cannot answer any

52:41.920 --> 52:47.560
questions about that because I'm not an expert, the odd cloud of a comet.

52:47.560 --> 52:50.560
And they found a very good agreement with experiment.

52:50.560 --> 52:54.000
This will come out in physical review, I think, next month.

52:54.000 --> 52:58.320
So you will find the details about this calculation.

52:58.320 --> 53:04.160
What I find really fantastic, I would really say, is that therefore by going from two-body

53:04.160 --> 53:13.920
to three-body, in very simple cases, you see already the conceptual change which is proceeding.

53:13.920 --> 53:21.680
Instead of finding a simple generalization, you find really a completely new type of behavior.

53:21.680 --> 53:29.200
Therefore we see now that in a sense we go to what I believe are really new formulations

53:29.200 --> 53:36.720
of dynamics, dynamics in which you can never deal with single events, the dynamics in which

53:36.720 --> 53:47.400
you have to deal with collective events like the chance events which are represented here.

53:47.400 --> 53:53.280
Of course, this leads to various consequences also in quantum mechanics and general relativity

53:53.280 --> 54:00.840
which I have no time to discuss now, to which I can come back in the discussion.

54:00.840 --> 54:04.480
Let me conclude.

54:04.480 --> 54:14.560
Essentially I believe that this incorporation of time and instability in physics has far-reaching

54:14.560 --> 54:15.560
consequences.

54:15.560 --> 54:21.800
Indeed, it was as I explained already at the beginning, the problem of time which was essentially

54:21.800 --> 54:25.920
the basis of the famous two cultures.

54:25.920 --> 54:31.560
When I was a young man, I had the privilege to know rather well Schrodinger, and of course

54:31.560 --> 54:39.640
I was reading all that Schrodinger was writing and was going to see him, and I was also reading

54:39.640 --> 54:44.600
of course his last book which was called My World View.

54:44.600 --> 54:49.920
Some of you may have read it, it was published in 1953, that was his last book.

54:49.920 --> 54:56.360
And here he was dealing with the problem of human existence, essentially with the ontological

54:56.360 --> 54:57.360
problem.

54:57.360 --> 55:06.120
How have you to understand the fact that we are a subject embedded in the collective world?

55:06.120 --> 55:10.560
This is of course the whole problem of vision, it is against the problem of one of the central

55:10.560 --> 55:13.840
problems of art.

55:13.840 --> 55:20.960
And as a start of his book, Schrodinger made a very strange for me as a young man statement.

55:20.960 --> 55:26.680
He said, I shall discuss this problem without speaking about quantum mechanics, uncertainty

55:26.680 --> 55:30.400
principle, dynamics or whatsoever.

55:30.400 --> 55:37.400
Because he said, I am not feeling that this will bring any light into this problem.

55:37.400 --> 55:43.320
And in fact he was discussing this problem in his book in purely philosophical terms,

55:43.320 --> 55:52.400
very much inspired some decades before by the Vedas, so before Capra and all the kind

55:52.400 --> 55:57.440
of books which appeared today have become very popular.

55:57.440 --> 56:05.880
Now I found very strange that here is a problem which interests everybody, our human existence.

56:05.880 --> 56:10.160
And science is some of the main characteristics of western civilization.

56:10.160 --> 56:16.040
This is really true, that science has nothing to say about that, is this possible?

56:16.040 --> 56:21.240
And I believe that we come at least a little close, I would not say that we have now solved

56:21.240 --> 56:24.880
the problem, please don't misunderstand what I am saying.

56:24.880 --> 56:31.440
I am saying simply that we can at least say that our vision of the world inside us and

56:31.440 --> 56:34.720
the world outside begin to converge.

56:34.720 --> 56:42.200
I want simply to say that we can now begin to see the conditions on individualization.

56:42.200 --> 56:48.040
I spoke about the Benin, the Benin has inside it because of the great heat of temperature

56:48.040 --> 56:53.280
and inside space which is different from the outside space.

56:53.280 --> 56:59.240
In other words, the very idea of what is a natural system different from the outside

56:59.240 --> 57:06.400
world is inherent in the bifurcations which occur in the system.

57:06.400 --> 57:11.240
Moreover we know that the system can evolve even if we have a very poor idea and come

57:11.240 --> 57:17.440
to the complexity which I mentioned about the electrical waves of the brain.

57:17.440 --> 57:24.760
So at least the ontological problem becomes no more a foreigner in this perspective.

57:24.760 --> 57:30.400
It is no more that we deal with contradictory words, that we deal with problems which have

57:30.400 --> 57:37.960
to be looked at by in many ways, which have to be seen by through many, many declarations

57:37.960 --> 57:45.920
like to say that I am tired, my English becomes poor, you see, therefore it is becoming no

57:45.920 --> 57:50.080
more such a conflictual problem.

57:50.080 --> 57:58.840
Thus I may conclude by reminding that Freud has written that science has to be seen as

57:58.840 --> 58:02.800
an aggression against human being.

58:02.800 --> 58:08.280
Indeed Copernicus has shown us that we are not at the center, geographical center of

58:08.280 --> 58:11.760
astronomical center of the universe.

58:11.760 --> 58:17.680
Darwin has shown us that we are an animal like others, Freud himself has shown us that

58:17.680 --> 58:26.280
our conscious activity of which we are so proud is only a very small part of the general

58:26.280 --> 58:30.080
neural or subconscious activity.

58:30.080 --> 58:33.400
I would like to invert this position.

58:33.400 --> 58:41.440
I would like to say that if really the world contains essential components, irreversibility

58:41.440 --> 58:51.120
and instability, then the creative activity of man as manifest in art, in music is really

58:51.120 --> 58:58.200
the proof that man is no more an exception to the laws of nature, but represents this

58:58.280 --> 59:02.960
laws on a unique way.

59:02.960 --> 59:03.960
Thank you very much.

59:28.200 --> 59:47.600
Let me first congratulate you for this brilliant description of the universe from the Benard

59:47.600 --> 59:51.760
cells to the Big Bang.

59:51.760 --> 01:00:00.360
I would like just to make one remark about the symmetry breaking which you mentioned

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:06.920
which in fact is somewhere behind the stage concerning this increase of entropy.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:15.960
To mention that there has been a number of attempts for describing universe with domains

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:26.120
of symmetry breaking with opposite sign and that there is even presently an analysis of

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:33.360
the space-time distribution of the quasars which leads to a model of the universe which

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:38.880
is spherically closed and has two domains, one of matter and one on antimatter and we

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:46.200
sit in the matter side but not naturally in the center somewhere with respect to the interface.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:53.720
So I believe that this problem of the high entropy per bar in the universe which I expressed

01:00:53.720 --> 01:01:01.040
this morning in other terms, I didn't use the word entropy, may present in during the

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:08.960
coming years new aspects especially with the new results concerning the space-time distribution

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:16.560
of quasars which will come out from the results given by the space, by observation from space

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.800
with the space telescope where there is a large program of observations of quasars.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:30.080
So whereas I think that this model where you start with zero temperature and have the burst

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:37.840
of entropy is quite appealing. Now this may have taken place at different places with different

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:43.520
sign if not with different sign but with different sign as far as baron and anti-barons are

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:54.200
concerned leading to a very complex universe. I would I shall if the discussion leaves time

01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:00.520
later on to come to a completely different question. Yes, well I have really nothing to

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.840
answer I mean I agree with you that the questions first of all are not at all solved. However,

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:13.760
I found very stimulating the question as a possibility of having insight general relativity

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:21.400
view in which there is an intrinsic phase transition leading from an open universe to a

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:27.800
locally Lorentz type universe. If the universe would have started as a flat space universe this

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:33.440
phase transition would not have been taking place therefore it is not at all a trivial thing. I

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:39.160
would like to add the following thing in general relativity the idea is that the basic reality

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:46.320
is the geometrical element. However if you believe in the importance of unstable dynamical systems

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:53.640
this cannot be so because then the general I would say transformation would mix stability in

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:58.120
stability therefore I expect also a change in the formulation of general relativity.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:08.720
You showed a curve of the temperature as a function of time which looked Gaussian like.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:16.440
Not necessarily Gaussian. No well I mean just it had a maximum somewhere. If I understood you

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:25.640
correctly this is a model of how the temperature changes the temperature of the universe changes

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:35.920
in time. Now, can you tell me what is the time corresponding to the maximum in this model?

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:42.000
Very early very early you see it's difficult to know exactly the time it may be a multiple of

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:53.400
Planck's time. It would be very close 10 to 6 times Planck's time. Now what I plot there you see

01:03:53.400 --> 01:04:00.480
the new formulation of the second law which I have given includes the effect of gravitational field

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:07.800
and it appears that it's possible to formulate the second law using a new definition of internal

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:15.720
energy which is the old definition multiplied by a factor depending on the gravitational state

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:21.400
of the universe. I could write it down I don't know if it's the right moment and therefore it

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:27.600
there is but at the moment at the present this factor tends from the start of the universe this

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:35.280
factor tends rapidly to 1. Then we recover the usual formulation of the second law. In other words

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:41.280
the interest of the formulation which I try to give is that the formulation of the second law

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:52.720
depends itself on the cosmological state of the universe. Precisely my question now is really how

01:04:52.760 --> 01:05:01.040
much do we know of the thermodynamics in presence of extremely strong classical still classical

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:07.360
gravitational fields? That is a very good question the classical answer which I don't which I don't

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:16.760
agree is that there is no influence why because you can formulate the second law in local Galilean

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:24.080
coordinates and then you write it in a covariant way and then there is answer. I object against

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:30.280
this procedure because the second law of thermodynamics is not a local law it is the

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:35.960
selection of a semi-group out of two possible semi-groups using asymptotic conditions therefore

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:43.120
you cannot formulate it in the local Galilean coordinates therefore I have formulated it

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:51.400
with my co-workers in a way in which the system is going to Lorentzian frame for a long time

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:57.600
asymptotically then I noted the second law is valid therefore it is essentially a kind of

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:04.480
internal extrapolation formula for strong gravitational fields. Thank you just another

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:12.280
comment this time I like your example about the circumference which is which has a finite

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:18.600
curvature in which you approach with the polygon but but you should have sent that there are a

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:24.400
finite number of points where the curvature of the polygon is infinite. That is true that is

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:45.680
completely true. I agree. Okay well I enjoyed your talk as usual very lively experience for us my

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:54.040
comment is related to the ones we've already heard it seems to me the new the particularly new

01:06:54.040 --> 01:07:02.920
element in what you have told us but you haven't given us the details is how to include gravitational

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:11.840
entropy in some formulation of cosmology I think that's very interesting and of course my co-countryman

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:20.080
Penrose as you know has spent a lot of time trying to see whether it is the vial tensor or

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:30.560
how one should include the gravitational entropy in in cosmological models and perhaps you might

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.560
want later on to say a word about the relation between your way of looking at it and this

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:45.200
Ritchie tensor way of doing it or vial tensor I'm not quite sure which combination he used or he tried

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:51.640
to use because I think he did not in fact succeed so far. I did want to make one other point about

01:07:51.640 --> 01:08:01.640
the hot big bang now we have seen from your curves what we might call the cold big bang now in the

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:09.440
hot big bang you can of course also increase have an increase of entropy with lapse of time you

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:16.280
showed us a curve where the entropy is independent of time for the normal let us say the hot big

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:22.360
bang but I think perhaps one ought to observe that only holds as you probably will agree for one

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:29.760
phase if you have a two-phase system then in the expansion of the universe from a hot initial

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:39.680
state the two phases say matter and radiation will get out of equilibrium they will both expand

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:45.440
adiabatically and their temperature will become different because they have different adiabatic

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:54.920
laws and as a result of this difference there will be heat transfer between these two phases and so

01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:01.320
the entropy will in fact increase but that is only possible in a two-phase situation and then with

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:12.080
very coarse approximations you can of course track down the increase of entropy with time and even

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:20.680
possibly going from one cycle to the next and you can then verify that the entropy actually increases

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.840
even in an oscillating universe during the contracting phase it still goes up and then it

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:34.720
goes up in the next cycle again there are such very simple model universes but of course I

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:42.200
imagine that on your view they would not be allowed because the assumption there is that you are

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:50.480
starting with a hot initial big bang which is a sort of standard model I mean I have not much

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:56.520
to answer there is no relation with Penrose model it is a completely different approach Penrose

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:04.240
viewer but however the common element I would say is the interest in the problem and I admire

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:10.240
greatly the work of Penrose but the technicalities are completely different now the second question is

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:16.960
of course trivial I mean I have when I wrote the entropy the constant I meant I would say the large

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:23.480
scale entropy they are all the time a reversible process going on in this room biology all this is

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:29.280
irreversibility therefore I was thinking about the overall picture and my emphasis is of course on

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:37.920
the possibility to give a universe to give a model of a universe which starts with a zero entropy

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:47.440
and binds it up in itself to the type of entropy which we observe today so a self-creating or self I

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:54.600
would say a catalyzed effect and that is really the important element I could speak of us cause

01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:02.000
hours about various aspects of this which I had no time to do here and the main point is of course

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.320
that the fact if you start with a hot big bang it is a very unpleasant situation that you have to

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.800
understand why matter what's ever created with this special entropy with this special temperature

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:20.480
what's this due to quantum fluctuation what's due to quantum tunneling or whatsoever there are many

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:26.960
views as you know about this therefore I thought interesting that the relatively simple thermodynamic

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:35.280
view could be developed at the including however a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:42.640
in which now the second law refers to a very defined state gravitational state of the universe

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:49.920
I think this by the way may be a rather rather interesting example of a law of nature which

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:56.160
itself depends on time because the gravitational state is changing this time therefore the law

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:04.400
of nature is no more reflecting something eternal but something relative to once one specific

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:11.440
situation it in a sense it has some ideological elements in common with the old attempts by

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.640
dirac and so on when you spoke about the variation of constants but here it's not the variation of

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:24.240
elementary particle of elementary constants but it is a variation of the law itself more in the

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:30.320
spirit of what has been anticipated many years ago by great american philosopher fears

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:43.440
any more questions while we are waiting for the next question i will try again to get the

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:52.320
discussion to get to the bottom of things by framing the issue as follows one of the subjects

01:12:52.320 --> 01:13:07.440
of this meeting has been the simple question is chance a product of ignorance or is there

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:16.800
an opening through which nature may enjoy randomness in professor pregon genes well known view

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:24.320
there are instabilities that can decide the future of the system do these instabilities

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:31.760
these before cation resemble a window a one of opening through which chance can slip onto the

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:39.120
scene or must we continue seeking for knowledge at these points more finely tuned knowledge such

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:47.440
as what we look for in quantum mechanics but i would like to say that obviously instability

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:53.600
the reversibility are the result of well-defined dynamical structures essentially people have

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:59.840
proposed i would say two types of classification of dynamical systems in two types very roughly

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:06.560
speaking one would be essentially periodic type and there of course there is no chance and there

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:12.320
is no reason to introduce instability reversibility and so on on the other hand if the information

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:20.880
which you need increases all the time and if therefore no finite information whatever it is

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:27.840
can predict the long time behavior of the system then a new situation appears and that is this new

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:33.840
situation which is related then to instability and reversibility to the formulation of semi-forms

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.800
okay professor garrido

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:50.960
professor pregon gene about 10 or 12 years ago you came to ciches and you were and you and your

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:59.920
group were defending at that time that time irreversibility was a consequence a consequence

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:12.080
if i remember well of the magic no never well and then i

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:25.920
i said i as far as i remember you had uh three plus one plus one plus one minus one

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:32.080
that is a classical metric but i haven't never said that this is related to reversibility

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.440
mass pregunters

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.560
so paniker

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.760
uh i would like to ask the professor pregon gene

01:15:51.760 --> 01:16:00.640
yes yes is the translation working i would like to ask professor pregon gene a question

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:12.400
i'm from a different field so i apologize for not using scientific terminology with due rigor

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:21.520
i would like to underline the problems jorge wagonsburg has raised which i believe more over

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:25.760
of brought us together here i would put the question like this

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:33.120
would you admit that these points of instability represent a total absence of any type of natural

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:49.440
law this seems to me to be a sort of almost buddhist almost eastern ontological nihilism

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
which might perhaps form the core of the concept of creativity

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:05.680
well i believe the problem of creativity is much clearer formulated in in the recent

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:13.680
terms in which my lecture was given than in classical physics after all a piece of music

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:19.760
starts from silence and goes to silence in other words the starting of a piece of music

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:25.600
is a kind of bifurcation if you want to use rather loose language therefore the starting

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:34.880
of novelties the novelties are really related to the type of systems which present bifurcations

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:42.800
and the bifurcations even on the macroscopic scale are themselves the expression of some basic

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:53.200
dynamical instability therefore finally the outcome of all this is that the scheme of the world as we

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:59.920
see today is very different from the time of the formulation of kepler's law it is very natural

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:07.200
after all three centuries have gone the kepler's law newton's law the classical epistemology

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:15.360
was basically related on periodic phenomena and that's very natural because since neolithic time

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:22.080
and perhaps even since paleolithic time men was very sensitive to periodic variations in climate

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:29.680
to periodic recurrences and so on and so on and therefore the temptation it was to put this

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:38.880
as a basis of a scientific epistemology and in a sense this is still a very valid important field

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:46.080
that nature is just not patterned according or not only patterned according to this type of

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:52.960
recurrent phenomena you see some years ago if you would have asked a physicist what is the

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:59.200
relation between physics and biology you would have said obviously one day physics will give

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:06.480
an interpretation of biology and that's true physics is giving more many many important contributions

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:13.120
however if you think about the spirit of biology the spirit of biology was always an evolutionary

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:19.920
spirit darwin is 19th century the spirit of classical physics was an intemporal view and in

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:26.880
a sense you could say physics today becomes more closer to biology becoming more closer to biology

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:33.440
becomes also more close to human enterprises and finally to artistic activity and that was

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:46.400
something which i wanted to emphasize in my lecture i do not want to seem too insistent

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:52.160
professor prigogine but there was something in your reply to george wagensberg's question that

01:19:52.160 --> 01:20:02.880
surprised me considerably and stimulated my curiosity you explicitly avoided uttering the

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:17.600
word chance on the other hand you mentioned something i found very subtle you clarified that at the

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:23.440
moment that a description let's say finite does not allow us to know or predict the position or

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:31.680
what will happen at that moment we have something new i find this very attractive but i would also

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:43.360
like to ask you whether you intend to use the word chance or not one of the most remarkable outcome

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:51.200
of modern dynamical theory is that some of the unstable dynamical systems are as random as bernouy

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:59.600
bernouy games of chance the isomorphic to bernouy systems you remember perhaps on

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:06.800
one of my slides it was even written bernouy shift therefore and there is a bernouy measure involved

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:14.320
therefore your i can answer very openly your question yes chance becomes a fundamental

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:21.360
element of dynamics the question that is chance i would say from the definition to the point of

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:28.640
view i don't know i i have no definition and most are not very inclined to verbal discussions

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:35.280
however what i would like to say is a mathematical theory of chance as was presented by people

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:42.560
who played games you see is now used in the dynamical in the dynamical theories

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:47.760
when you have a strange attractor you cannot predict what will happen you can predict some

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:55.040
correlations you can predict some global behavior but not that will behave that will happen in the

01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:03.680
in an individual realization therefore we in many fields deal with a new approach to science

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:09.920
and to our dialogue of men with nature it's a classical ambition that's to have a kind of

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:17.760
transparent nature in which we could decide in every single event that will come out and we see

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:23.680
this was of course no more the situation in quantum mechanics but we see that science more and more

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:32.800
deals with mass phenomena this repetitive phenomena in which we can deal with something we can say

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:40.080
something which is neither pure randomness neither simple deterministic systems i believe that i'm

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:46.400
concerned that we're only at the beginning of the game i fact if i could use the word game here in a

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:54.400
different sense it is so easy to understand what a bernoulli scheme means and it's so easy to understand

01:22:54.400 --> 01:23:01.360
what a simple periodic motion means but the real world is in between somewhere and it's between

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:07.120
something and there are elements of randomness in DNA but it's not pure randomness it's not why it

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:14.160
knows and many of the recent attempts would be precisely to give them more quantitative meaning

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:20.720
to the word randomness but it means exactly for example in paris not a long time ago there was

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:28.160
a meeting of economists and the economists have been looking that is for example i take an oversimplified

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:34.880
view what are the rules of the stock market now you know in neoclassical economy the idea is that you

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:42.400
have a i would say a well informed universe and that therefore stock market could only be a pure

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:48.080
white noise because if there would be no white noise somebody would have already used the deviation

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:55.200
from the white noise to become wealthy now today with the new methods of analyzing things you can

01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:03.600
really see what is the dynamical content of some time series in in economy and the remarkable

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:09.760
outcome is that there is a lot of structure and that the idea of white noise is not true the idea

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:16.240
of periodic behavior obviously is not and we have to begin now to have the vocabulary necessary

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:23.200
to characterize the intermediate situation it is i think as i said at the beginning of my lecture

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:32.480
we are in a new at this period of dialogue with nature and this new period involves that we are

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:38.160
also at the beginning of something at the beginning of something you see at the beginning of something

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:45.600
and for me it is such a remarkable coincidence that at the very moment where there is this transition

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:52.000
in the demography of the world where the world is going to a new dimension in the population

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:00.160
with new requirements on energy and so on and so on science is following in some sense science

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:07.920
begins to to be able to approach this highly non-linear interactive processes there is a big

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:14.240
project in x2 called global change such a project involves also non-linear mathematics

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:20.960
involves also amplifications relations between various data and i think it's so remarkable

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:26.960
that all these things happen nearly at the same time and i think that is really what gives the

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:33.440
a kind of cultural unity to our so diversified and so fragmented period

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:40.640
professor lancer reaches to say something only if nobody else wants to speak because i've had one

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:47.760
say well i the reason is that i want to speak again is that i am very interested in this

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:56.080
question of not being able to predict which uh professor prigudine suggested because now the

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:04.160
fact is if you have your strange attractor realized in nature the system will in fact execute a

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:11.360
definite motion now when one says one cannot predict it is the statement meant to be that we

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:18.320
will never be able to say that this motion which we've just observed uh can be explained

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:25.520
that is a complete misunderstanding and misstatement of what i've said no i was a question no it was

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:32.000
not as it was a question obviously no and i'm also not interested in the question if nature knows

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.320
what it does or not i'm not speaking about what nature knows or doesn't know what nature

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:45.120
is ontologically doing i'm only speaking about our intellectual models of the universe in which

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:53.280
we are living the question is simply are we able knowing the this type of equation knowing the

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:58.880
baker transformation knowing a finite information to know where the point will be in the baker

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:05.280
transformation after an arbitrary time which in fact can be even estimated and the answer is no

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:12.000
in the present day of mathematics the system will of course execute a specific motion and

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:19.200
it obviously and it is it would be disappointing for scientists if they were unable if they had

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:25.360
to admit that they would never be able to it is the same story you can ask i think that's a

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:31.360
misunderstanding of what science means i mean in quantum mechanics you're also not able to predict

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:36.960
where is the position of an electron with respect to the nucleus it you can only predict this on

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:48.880
collective on collective on repetitive experiments is this a you can say a kind of failure of of

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:56.320
the human intellect i don't think so because it is simply we have to adapt our intellect

01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.680
to the conditions of the world the world could have been a very nice collection of periodic

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.960
motion then this question would not arise but probably we would not be around here to discuss

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:15.360
these questions i am not sure if professor tom yeah alphando professor pre-gauging on

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:22.160
very simple question do you say any logical connection between the sensitive dependence

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:28.800
on of initial data which you have described and time irreversibility or reversibility

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:39.040
one has to make a distinction between the sensitive dependence on initial condition

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:46.240
in time symmetry broken systems and in time symmetry unbroken system the baker belongs to one

01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:52.720
category the meteorological system which i mentioned belongs to the other in the first case

01:28:52.720 --> 01:29:00.720
the fact to consider instead of because of the sensitive sensitivity to initial condition a

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:09.040
collection of trajectories lead to the formulation of a semi-group theory and therefore to a breaking

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:14.640
of time symmetry in the second case like the meteorological case or the cases which i mentioned

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:20.800
in my lecture this is not so because in this case you start already this equation is broken time

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:28.720
symmetry so so am i right if i say that there is no logical connection at all between sensitive

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:35.680
initial sensitive dependence on initial condition and time reversibility or irreversibility no you

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:42.000
are not right i'm not right no then explain why because as i just have mentioned i can only repeat

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:49.360
what i just said in the case in which you start with a time symmetrical system the sensitive

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:56.960
initial conditions of the type of the k flow the consideration of this type of system can be transformed

01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:04.960
into the behavior of a symmetry broken semi-group and the way in which this is done can you can

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:09.600
read my paper so i can give you some reprints if you are interested no of course if you start with

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:16.720
a system which is not defined by an homeomorphism by a map then it's obviously you have obviously

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:22.400
i don't need you have a symmetry on the beginning not i have no symmetry in the beginning i can

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:28.160
start with continuous system of this map that makes no difference anyway i would just i with

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:35.520
a final observation what you said earlier you should very carefully distinguish between what

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:43.280
belongs to mathematical theory and what becomes what belongs to real systems mathematics has nothing

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:47.600
to to say to reality that's your point of view it's not mine

01:30:50.560 --> 01:31:00.960
rolf if dynamical systems simulate so nicely randomness do you think that this could

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:09.680
lead towards a new understanding of the stochastic character of the quantum measurement process

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:18.720
i hope so but i think so but in a sense but here i have to be rather vague because it would

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:25.280
be take too much time you see the main problem of quantum mechanics for me i don't know i mean

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:30.080
i can take very many point of views and i would like to say that i'm working on this problem

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:36.240
that i hope to come to some result very soon so i'm a little making a little extrapolation

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:43.120
i believe that indeed the wave function corresponds to a potentiality the outcome of the measure to

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:49.520
an actuality and i believe that the transition from potentiality to actuality is precisely due

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:56.400
to irreversibility the difficulty was that before irreversibility was very difficult to define in

01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:01.760
terms of quantum mechanics now i can define irreversibility in quantum mechanics through an

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:08.080
appropriate formalism super operators entropies and super operator not in the hillbatt space and so on

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:13.520
and therefore i can now show and i think i can even explain it to you without any mathematics

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:20.720
the reason is the following that once i have irreversibility as the result of instability

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:27.200
i can no more deal with single wave functions i have to deal with collections of wave functions

01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:33.440
and these collections of wave function exactly a collection of trajectories no more satisfy

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:40.000
the initial Schrodinger equation that they no more conserve pure states because there are

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:47.040
no collections of wave functions which i observe over a window of time and for this reason the

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:55.120
measurement becomes simply a veil in which we express the collective character of the

01:32:56.080 --> 01:33:02.720
of the object which you observe it is of course a rather strong statement because what i'm saying

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:09.840
is that in classical mechanics the basic object is no more a single trajectory it is no more

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:16.800
a Gibson symbol because a Gibson symbol can be reduced to a single trajectory to a pure case

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:25.840
it is now a time-oriented non-local semi-group objects which is no more admitting a solution

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:31.760
the single trajectory because whatever the duration of the observation it will never be

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:38.880
observed of the complete i would say phase space in which it is embedded in a sense my the point

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:44.400
of view which i am advocating from this rather technical point of view is the following the

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:51.520
classical view of unstable systems was to compare them to the dynamics of systems which i can

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:58.800
really observe over infinite times my point of view is simply to say let's now include the

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:06.480
finiteness of our observation and show that whatever the finiteness of observation independently

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:12.800
of the approximation beat long short million of years 20 minutes that's of no importance

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:19.920
there is a common formalism corresponding to all this type of situations i'm perhaps a little vague

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.120
last question professor schatzman

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:40.800
this is not a real really question and probably will not answer what i'm going to to say

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:51.040
uh we live i can say in a very unstable world full of bifurcations and this reminds me a cartoon

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:58.880
i have seen in the new yorker something like 25 years ago where you see a giant computer

01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:05.600
in front of which there are two scientists and one says to the other what does he say

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:15.840
and the other one says he says we should make peace now more precisely there has been in nature

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:24.720
a couple of papers which were inspired by this non-linear dynamics about the way

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:33.840
in which arms race can finally lead to war and there has been discussions in the same journal

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:40.080
whether the assumptions which which were made by the first authors were correct or were not

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:50.400
correct now i'm coming to my question nowadays where we have not only on one side this fantastic

01:35:50.400 --> 01:36:00.160
storage of weapons with something like 50 000 megatons of nuclear power that we have these new

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:08.720
strategic defense initiative and you know certainly quite well probably even better than i

01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:17.360
what the american scientists have written on it would you think that there is a possible aim

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:24.880
of dealing from the point of view of the dynamical system about the danger of the arms race

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:35.040
and possible to tell we are reaching the point where the human humanity and civilization is in

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:44.720
danger but let me not go into a strategy proper but let me say that i believe the problem which

01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:53.520
you rightly bring out is closely related to the view which is being developed i mean at the moment

01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:01.120
you see too and let's say it is it is connected in some way in the vein which i see the connection

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:09.840
is the following the classical view of the world that's that reality and rationality was the same

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:18.800
only one rational reality or one reality which is rational today we see a pluralistic world

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.320
we see a world of you mentioned of instabilities of many possible realization

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:31.280
and therefore the question we have to begin to think in a non-linear way we have to understand

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:38.880
that the world is more rich than one of the realization which in which we can live now

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:45.120
you know to give first a simpler example take the problem of psychoanalysis the classical

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.680
view was that you have to go to the psychoanalyst and he will tell you why you behave in this way

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:57.120
or another i think more and more family therapies becoming familiar today in other words you have

01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:04.560
to go together and the therapist will try to find but as a relation in this unstable dynamical system

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:10.800
which is a family and which brings into some complication for a member of the family and then

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:16.400
he will say perhaps there's a reshuffling necessary you see and then perhaps something better can

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:23.840
arise and i would say that we need this family therapy on the level of nations in other words

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:33.680
what i like to say is that values are often often related to homeostatic reactions to a given

01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:41.600
i would say realization of a bifurcation and it is not my chance i think that most of the most

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:51.120
difficult problem in our time are no more conflicts about territory or about even economic resources

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:58.640
but much more about ideologies and ideologies are value systems around a given bifurcation

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:06.240
a given realization a given branch if we begin now to think in a non-linear way we may conceive

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:14.000
whichever we may conceive about situations in which we perhaps have to to probe these ideologies

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:21.520
of which many in this case come from the 19th century and are a little obsolete you see therefore

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:29.840
i would say my answer to this is not only let's carefully look on the disarmament problem but let's

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:35.600
look carefully on the tolerance problem on the tolerance problem is really the problem of our

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:42.080
time the tolerance problem is to understand that there are many realizations of the of the cultural

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:48.960
world and that we have to live in this multiple world if there is any value in science it is

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:56.880
finally that we hope if i'm a scientist i hope that science will give to the world finally a

01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:04.960
more multiple way of realization after a less linear way a less constrained way of realization

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:12.560
i i feel this i think i'm it is a very common feeling between european scientists you see as european

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:19.040
i believe we are all living at the intersection of value system as european we are all

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:27.360
proud that the the science project has started in europe and very close from here partly and also

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:33.360
that the idea of democracy was started in europe and there were there were two rationalities

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:39.920
you see the scientific rationality and the and the social and humanistic rationality

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:45.760
and what is really i think the problem is to bring them closer together but to bring and i think

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:52.000
all that i try to tell you is for me if it has any value at all it has the value of bringing

01:40:52.000 --> 01:41:00.320
together to closer these rationalities in a sense we can apply it also to human situations

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:07.920
and see really in this way having really in this way a more tolerant and more multiple view on human

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:27.920
civilization thank you very much professor prigozine in 15 minutes we will begin the debate

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:47.920
so
