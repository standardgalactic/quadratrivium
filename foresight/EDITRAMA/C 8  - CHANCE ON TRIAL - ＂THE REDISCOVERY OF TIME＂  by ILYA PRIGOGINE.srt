1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,880
Ilya Prigogin was born in Moscow in 1917 and his professor at the Université Libre de

2
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,740
Bruxelles and the Institute of Statistical Mechanics of Austin, Texas.

3
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:02,260
He directs over 100 researchers in a wide diversity of disciplines from biology to statistical

4
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,260
mechanics.

5
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,420
He is the founder of the so-called Brussels School and a pioneer researcher in the modern

6
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,180
thermodynamics of irreversible processes.

7
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,460
Thanks to his work we have a new conception of the role of chance in physics and biology

8
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,020
and he has coined inescapable essential concepts as we have seen in the debates on determinism

9
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,740
and indeterminism, order through fluctuations, dissipative structures, bifurcation theory

10
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,340
and so on.

11
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,140
His impact on philosophical thought has been evident since the publication of his texts,

12
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,860
La Nouvelle Alliance and Only an Illusion.

13
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,340
In 1977 he won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

14
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,420
He is indispensable here today.

15
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:14,020
Professor Prigogin, thank you very much.

16
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,300
It is a pleasure to be here.

17
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:23,860
I am sorry to arrive so late but it was just impossible for me to be here earlier.

18
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,300
I want to say that I am very happy to be here and one of the reasons I am very happy to

19
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,220
be here is to be in the Dali Museum.

20
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:43,340
Since my youth I have been always a great admirer of Dali's work and I believe that some of the

21
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:51,900
teams which seem to me essential in the work of Dali, the relation between space and time

22
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:00,340
on one side the pluralism of our vision on the other are also the most important or between

23
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,940
the most important scientific subjects of our time.

24
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:13,460
One of the very famous writings of Dali is La Conquête de l'Irrationnel.

25
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:20,580
The question is therefore what is rational and what is not and once we are asking even

26
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,780
this question we are immediately in the middle of the problem of time.

27
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:33,620
It seemed that the problem of time had been solved once for all by classical science.

28
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:42,140
As everybody knows classical science presents us a vision of the world which is both deterministic

29
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,820
and time-reversible.

30
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:53,180
Deterministic once you know the initial conditions you can predict what the future will be like

31
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,820
you could retroject the past if you want and time-reversible which means precisely that

32
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,980
it makes no difference if you consider the future or the past.

33
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:14,780
More closely to us this I would say statement has been put in a very strong form by Einstein

34
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:25,260
himself who has said as everybody knows that time as irreversibility is an illusion.

35
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:33,740
I was always very impressed by this statement which expresses a deep belief in the value

36
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,900
of symbolic thinking.

37
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,580
Everybody knows that time is for everybody of us and essentially mentioned.

38
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:52,940
Everybody feels time going feels become older and still Einstein was saying that irreversibility

39
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,900
is the main component of existential experience is an illusion.

40
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:05,740
It is very remarkable that at the beginning of the century there was an agreement between

41
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:16,020
some of the greatest thinkers, philosophers about the fact on the fact that indeed irreversibility

42
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,940
could not be the subject of science.

43
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:26,380
I already mentioned Einstein's view which was expressing the fact that our personal

44
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:34,940
experience of time had to be transcended, had to be purified to become the time of science.

45
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,700
Bergson in a sense reached the same conclusion from an opposite point of view.

46
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,900
He was thinking or estimating that the scientific time was a poorer time.

47
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:56,220
It was a time reduced to space and to understand existential time you had to go to the concept

48
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,620
of duration which Bergson has been discussing.

49
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:12,500
Heidegger again came to the conclusion that time was outside the province of science and

50
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:21,620
in fact Heidegger's analysis was based on one of the most profound analysis of time

51
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:30,260
which was ever written and that is the analysis of Aristotle written 2,300 years ago.

52
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:38,700
Aristotle came to a very subtle conclusion, Aristotle came to the conclusion that time

53
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,620
is motion in the perspective of the earlier and the later.

54
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,300
That is a rather complex statement.

55
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:57,860
In other words, the watch time, the motion of the arrow is not time and indeed it's true,

56
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,380
it's periodic motion.

57
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,020
Therefore it's four before five, four before five, depends on the way in which you think

58
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,020
you look at it.

59
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:14,700
It is we who have the concept of time because we have the concept of the earlier and the later.

60
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,820
Therefore the question could be answered immediately.

61
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:29,860
Who gives us then this difference, this feeling for the difference between the earlier and the later?

62
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,540
And already Aristotle discusses the two possibilities.

63
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:43,540
Either it is the word as a whole some anima mundi which gives us a feeling of the earlier

64
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:51,860
and the later, or on the contrary it would be the soul, it would be us, the soul who

65
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:59,260
counts in which it reduces time into a timeless universe.

66
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:06,700
In other words, the question was very clearly asked, is time uniting men to nature or is

67
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,380
time opposing men to nature?

68
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:20,940
And what I find so fascinating is that I think in this second part of the century we begin

69
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:30,220
to be able to give an answer to the questions which have been put so clearly by Aristotle

70
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,660
two thousand three hundred years ago.

71
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:42,300
Everybody knows that this century has started with two outstanding important new concepts,

72
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,860
conceptual breakthroughs in physics, quantum theory and relativity.

73
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:56,820
And in some way relativity and quantum theory continue the tradition of classical physics.

74
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,980
In some way I want not to go into details here, even quantum mechanics is a deterministic

75
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,260
theory from the point of view of the wave function.

76
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:15,380
It is in fact in the second part of the century that the situation has changed and I would

77
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:21,100
say changed from all directions at the same time.

78
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:28,980
Who would have thought a few decades ago that all particles with the proper mass would probably

79
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
be unstable?

80
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:37,740
Who would have been imagining that you could speak about a cosmological evolution?

81
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,540
And who would have predicted all these new structures which arise in far from equilibrium

82
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,540
conditions?

83
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:54,820
Everywhere we see, we see I would say the constructive role of time.

84
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:01,540
Everywhere we see diversification in stability.

85
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:08,540
This of course has to change our concept of a law of nature.

86
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:15,900
Let us not forget that the concept, the western concept of a law of nature has been formulated

87
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:24,540
in the 17th century, the century of absolute monarchy and the century also of an almighty

88
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,540
God.

89
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:33,740
And I think we can just not separate the classical idea of a law of nature from its social and

90
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,420
religious connotations.

91
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,980
For God, of course, there could be no difference between past and future.

92
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,980
He knows everything.

93
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:50,980
It is in the scientist was the representative of God on earth and he also, through science,

94
00:10:50,980 --> 00:11:00,140
would be susceptible to make predictions or to unveil the future as he could unveil

95
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,780
the past.

96
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:10,100
I think the main content of what I would like to tell you this afternoon is that what we

97
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,780
see emerging now is a different concept of a law of nature.

98
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:24,180
It is a law of nature in which we as human beings have only a window on reality, a window

99
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:33,260
of reality which does not, in general, except for very simplified situation, permits extrapolations

100
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:39,620
to infinite past or infinite future.

101
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:49,660
I just mentioned that in classical science was essentially related to periodic phenomena

102
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:56,260
motion of the earth, around the sun, of the moon, around the earth and corresponded, you

103
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,900
could say, to a negation of time.

104
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,700
In the 19th century appeared thermodynamics.

105
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,420
It was the outgrowth of the industrial age.

106
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,380
Everybody knows what are the two laws of thermodynamics.

107
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:19,500
So the idea of the second law is that there exists a function, the entropy, which is quite

108
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,420
unique properties.

109
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:28,700
It is the sum of the change of entropy is due to the change of matter and energy with

110
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,620
the outside world, that the entropy flows, and then you have irreversible processes

111
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,380
inside the system which create entropy.

112
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,540
Entropy is a fall like a liquid whose mass would not be conserved.

113
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,740
It increases time going on.

114
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:56,620
But the second law of thermodynamics was a very unexpected outgrowth of the industrial

115
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,900
age.

116
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:04,500
It was not formulated by the great mathematician or physicist of the 19th century.

117
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:12,500
It was formulated by very modest people, physical chemists, engineers, practitioners.

118
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:21,300
And therefore, it was very natural that immediately, next one, people try to, I would say, to minimize

119
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:28,420
the second law, to minimize its impact, to consider the situation in which this direction

120
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:37,620
of time, as it appears in the second law, would be of no importance, and that is equilibrium.

121
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:48,380
The classical study of the second law was first limited to the end result, to the result

122
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:54,940
where there was no more any evolution, where all irreversible processes would have stopped,

123
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:02,260
where there would be no more any privileged direction of time.

124
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,220
That is equilibrium thermodynamics.

125
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,380
And that was really, ah, see the entropy is a function of time, finally the entropy

126
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,460
from isolated system is maximum, and that was really what was studied for a long time.

127
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:23,060
It is only in the 20th century that people became interested in what happens here.

128
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,260
And the first step was to study the behavior of small deviations, small deviations.

129
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:36,180
And of course, when you have small deviations in respect to the equilibrium situation, you

130
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,180
can linearize in respect to the deviations.

131
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Everybody knows that when you have linear equations, you have at most one solution.

132
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:52,380
Therefore, the real interest started only once one became interested in what happens

133
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,880
far from equilibrium.

134
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:01,480
When the deviation from equilibrium allows, that is the word of non-equilibrium, of strong

135
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:10,600
non-equilibrium, and far from equilibrium and non-linearity are very connected concepts.

136
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:18,600
Today, the importance of the far from equilibrium phenomena is well known.

137
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,200
Let me therefore be very brief.

138
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:29,920
There have been many contributions to this field made by Spanish physicists and chemists.

139
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:38,120
A very classical example, which I just want to mention for the people from other fields

140
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,560
is the so-called Benarin stability, next one.

141
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,040
An instability which arises when you heat a liquid from below, and at some point you

142
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,360
have the formation of patterns.

143
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:01,840
You see, when you heat a liquid from below, at some point you have the formation of patterns.

144
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:09,800
Now the formation of patterns corresponds to supramolecular correlations, correlations

145
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,600
which involve billions of molecules.

146
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,680
So in a sense, you can say that the heat, the energy which you give to the system is

147
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,920
transformed into organization, into space-time pattern.

148
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,600
This is in fact very unexpected, because from the classical point of view, each molecule

149
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,000
could see only the next ones.

150
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,600
Somebody was emphasizing the short range of molecular interactions, but in Benarin stability,

151
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:52,640
like here, or in chemical-ossiating reactions, in biochemical reactions, which I know very

152
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:00,800
often, very much studied, you see collective behavior, coherence, appearing as a result

153
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,680
of the far from equilibrium situation.

154
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,240
This is most unexpected.

155
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:16,520
And today much effort is made in this direction, and I must say that I am still extremely astonished

156
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:25,440
by the variety of behavior, by the variety of space-time patterns which may appear.

157
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:34,640
In a sense, once you go to the far from equilibrium condition, you break euclidean invariance,

158
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,200
no more two points play the same role, no more two instance play the same role.

159
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,520
Let me simply emphasize one aspect, next one.

160
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,360
And that is the problem of attractors.

161
00:17:51,360 --> 00:18:00,160
If I take the sun, let's say the earth, and I take a comet, and I take a comet coming

162
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,400
close to the earth.

163
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,120
Of course, the position, the trajectory of the earth will be changed, and once the comet

164
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,800
will go away, the earth will keep the new trajectory.

165
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,400
Therefore, the stability of classical dynamical systems is very limited.

166
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,480
On the contrary, if I take a pendulum, and if I take into account the friction, the pendulum

167
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:34,440
stops at the point, and that is the point attractor, which is really the simplest example

168
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,520
of strong stability, you see, which people know since many, many years or centuries,

169
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
I would say, in this case.

170
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:50,560
Now one of the discoveries of non-equilibrium physics was the appearance of other type of

171
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,560
attractors.

172
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,120
One of the type of attractors, that was the point attractor.

173
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:06,120
But another type of attractor is an attractor which is no more a point, but is a trajectory.

174
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,720
Wherever you start, you come here, and that is a limit cycle, and that is the basis of

175
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,600
chemical periodic reactions, biochemical regulation.

176
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,760
And in the last years, there is much more interest in even another type of attractor.

177
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:29,240
Very briefly, speaking, an attractor which combines ideas of stability and instability,

178
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,960
in which part is that nearby trajectories go away, and still they cannot go away forever,

179
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,480
they come back in some way.

180
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:44,920
Next one, attractors which, in a sense, I could try to imagine as many, many points

181
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,560
forming a volume or something like that, when it speaks about fractal attractors, but it's

182
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,400
of no importance here, you see?

183
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:00,240
And therefore the system is all the time jumping from one point to another here, and the general

184
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:09,000
aspect is an aspect which is not very different from fully developed turbulence, let's say.

185
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Next one.

186
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,920
Now, for example, here's an image of such kind of attractor, you see?

187
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,440
In respect to this point, you have instability, the system is going away, but then it comes

188
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,920
back again, and of course, by going away and coming back, the system is mixed all the

189
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
time.

190
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:35,200
And what I found most remarkable is that in the last two, three years, most interesting

191
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,000
application of this type of attractors have been presented to very different fields, be

192
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,400
it meteorology, or be it brain waves, electrical activity of brain waves, and so on and so

193
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
on.

194
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,520
For example, I have taken just an example which has been studied by my colleague Nicholas,

195
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:00,080
and people interested can find the paper in Nature six months ago or so.

196
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Next one.

197
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
You see?

198
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:10,040
Consider, for example, the temperature, that is the temperature of a million years as recorded

199
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,160
from the depths of the ocean, and you see it is widely fluctuated.

200
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,320
Now, what would be the vision of a classical physicist?

201
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,960
The classical physicist would have said temperature is fluctuating because the temperature is

202
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,720
a result of 100 variables, each of them obeying the simplification, but as many of them, well,

203
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,720
it gives the appearance of high regularity.

204
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:44,120
But we have no methods due to Ruel, Tachens, Procaccia, and many other people which permit

205
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:51,480
to analyze the type of attractor, which is below, I would say, this type of time variation.

206
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,920
And the result is that this comes, this time series can be understood as being generated

207
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:06,960
by deterministic system of only four variables, four variables, therefore, this complicated

208
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:14,400
variation is not due to a kind of law of large numbers in which there are 100 variables.

209
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,320
It is intrinsically complex, intrinsically unpredictable.

210
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,800
This changes really, I would say, our way of understanding nature around us.

211
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,120
And I just can mention, I have no time to go into this, that also very recent results

212
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:39,720
have shown that the electrical brain waves in full, in deep sleep, correspond also to

213
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,680
a kind of endogenous, high dimensional attractor.

214
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:50,520
However, when we are awake, when we look on something, on a painting, then of course

215
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:56,720
you cannot hope to describe things in terms of a deterministic unstable system, because

216
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,560
then there is an input coming all the time from the outside world.

217
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,760
What is very interesting is that this instability is very complex, which means that we begin

218
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:14,240
to have the idea that there may be a dynamical evolution in biology leading to very high

219
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,480
dimensional attractors.

220
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,400
Because if you think, for example, let me explain why I think it disturbs, if you think

221
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,320
about an insect, it makes music, but the music is very, very simple.

222
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,760
Of the type of a limit cycle, it's certainly not of an attractor of high dimensionality.

223
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,680
In other words, it may well be that the dynamical structure of the electrical activity has been

224
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,640
evolving during biological evolution, and that the brain, which is high in stability,

225
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:55,400
is precisely the origin of, I would say, creativity, and so on, coming from this background instability,

226
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,560
which can then be amplified by external, I would say, small changes.

227
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,240
Exactly like here, very small changes in the position of the earth, and so on, can bring

228
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,040
in a new glaciation.

229
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:15,720
But there is another aspect, and here I come to one of the main themes of Salvador Dali,

230
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,120
the relation between time and space.

231
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,720
Essentially, and I would like to illustrate this very briefly on two examples.

232
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,040
Essentially, how have you to understand a biomolecule, BDNA or whatsoever?

233
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:42,040
Obviously, a biomolecule is a system which has an order which is with a broken time symmetry.

234
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:47,600
The broken time symmetry is obvious because you have to read the code in one direction.

235
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,240
They are starting and stopping points, which means that you have to read it.

236
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,640
Exactly you have to read a book or something like that.

237
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,760
Therefore, it's a broken symmetry.

238
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,040
The question is, however such a broken symmetry could have arisen in a natural object, and

239
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,880
that is exactly what I mean by saying we have to understand the inscription of time in space.

240
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:18,440
The exactly like or in a more complicated situation, for example, is the situation which

241
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,840
I have explained, mentioned a few minutes ago, when I was speaking about the Benarin

242
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
stability.

243
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,120
There, the patterns are really the expression of a broken time symmetry.

244
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:36,680
Now, we would like to understand DNA, let's say, as an expression of a broken time symmetry

245
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,400
and understand how this broken time symmetry has ever arisen.

246
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:48,480
Now, I cannot give an answer, but I would like to show some very recent result obtained

247
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,960
by a few people from our group, Subaraos and Nicholas and so on, which have essentially

248
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:02,880
made the following experiment, which is now beginning to be repeated in a real situation

249
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,600
in the United States, in which may have the next one.

250
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:14,040
We consider a chaotic reaction, and every time one of the variables goes beyond some

251
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:22,000
threshold, we suppose that it is put in on a polymer, on a polymer chain, and we look

252
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,800
on the structure of the polymer chain.

253
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:30,480
Now, this structure can be analyzed, and one can show that it is quite remarkable.

254
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:38,600
It corresponds to a Markov chain, which is oriented, contains an incompressible information

255
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,760
once you know part of the chain you cannot predict what the other part will do, and therefore

256
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,440
it has already many features of biomolecules.

257
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,480
And let me now briefly ask another question.

258
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,480
How do we have to consider cosmology from the point of view of thermodynamics?

259
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,080
Now, you know that the history of cosmology is one of the most dramatic histories of

260
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
dissension.

261
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:11,200
You know that Einstein applied general relativity, came to the idea of the universe as a geometric

262
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,880
object, and you know also that his first model was a static model, and that the first idea

263
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:24,600
was that his model could not be valid because of Hubble's law, and instability of Einstein's

264
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,360
equation, which showed that you have to go to the metric type of equation of an expanding

265
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,360
universe.

266
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:40,800
So the first, I would say, drawback of Einstein's static geometrical ideas was to go to a geometrical

267
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:46,160
changing to a universe which is changing from the geometrical point of view.

268
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:53,280
Now the next dramatic step was, of course, the discovery of the black body radiation.

269
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,480
Of the black body radiation, which shows that the evolution was not only a geometrical

270
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,560
evolution, but was a thermal evolution.

271
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,680
I regret that I was not here this morning.

272
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,800
I'm sure that Professor Schatzman has spoken about this much better than I can do.

273
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
But let me simply remind you what probably has been said.

274
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:19,400
Therefore, the next step was the idea of an evolving universe with an entropy content.

275
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,040
Next, please.

276
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:27,760
And then you come, therefore, to the traditional idea of the, I would say, orthodox theory

277
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,960
in which the temperature when I go into the past is increasing all the time, and in which

278
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,760
essentially the entropy of the universe which is here below is a constant, and this going

279
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,080
down comes from the adiabatic expansion of the universe.

280
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,640
Now many people, and I'm not an exception, believe that this cannot be a satisfactory

281
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,640
theory.

282
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
Why?

283
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,560
Because it is very difficult to imagine that the universe has started with this strange

284
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:07,800
high entropy structure which is reflected by this strange, I would say, structure of

285
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,080
the physical universe in which there are photons which are end products.

286
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
They cannot do anything.

287
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:21,400
They cannot be transformed into anything, and variants which are essentially unstable.

288
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:29,680
The universe is essentially a strange two-component system, one being like the base product and

289
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:36,680
the other like the carrier of irreversibility, because the protons or whatsoever are either

290
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:42,360
in metastable state, but they are certainly not decaying, but they are certainly not equilibrium

291
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
objects.

292
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,840
Therefore, the view which I would like to advocate, let me give you a very simple example,

293
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:58,120
next one, would be a view, let's say first I take a very simple example from a physical

294
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,000
chemist point of view.

295
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,280
Suppose I have two components, and I heat one and I cool the other, and because of the

296
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:13,880
difference of temperature, I have also one component, the black one, predominantly here,

297
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,720
and one component, the white one, predominantly there.

298
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:24,960
Now suppose I stop the heating, then of course I would have the heat which is already there,

299
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,040
the photons, let's say, and I would have first too many black hairs and too many white hairs.

300
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,360
Therefore I would have one component which is already the base component, and the others

301
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,480
would be slowly going to equilibrium, and that is essentially the view of the physical

302
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,040
universe, in which we have two components, one which is already a base product, in which

303
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,600
there is no arrow of time, except of the change, the geometrical change of the universe, and

304
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,600
the other in which there is still an arrow of time, and the question is then, can we

305
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,960
give a simple interpretation of this strange situation?

306
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:09,360
Well, in a paper which will soon appear, I've tried to do so by reconsidering the formulation

307
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,200
of the second law of thermodynamics.

308
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,120
In the discussion I can answer questions, I have all the reprint here for people who

309
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:23,480
are interested, but let me try to schematically express what's going on.

310
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:32,960
The idea is, well, I think that is too complex, you see, let me give you simply the idea.

311
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:42,320
The idea is that in Einstein's equation we have two types of realities which are coexisting,

312
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:50,440
spacetime and matter, and Einstein's equation express a relation between the spacetime and

313
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,440
matter.

314
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,040
Now, while they express a relation between the two, they don't say that the entropy

315
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,200
of matter is equivalent to the entropy of spacetime.

316
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,800
Spacetime can be considered as a much more coherent structure than matter.

317
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:12,680
You can imagine matter as defects in spacetime structure, if you want, a kind of defect of

318
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:19,040
all kind of types you can imagine, and therefore you can imagine that in the early stage of

319
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:27,360
the universe there may have been a transfer of gravitational energy into matter leading

320
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,960
to a burst of entropy.

321
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:36,040
Now this burst of entropy would then create a large number of waste products, exactly

322
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,800
like my heating in my example two minutes ago, and create organized matter with the breaking

323
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,840
of symmetries, a little like in the Benard instability.

324
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,960
And then in our present stage of the universe, this part which has been created in this burst

325
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,840
of entropy is then slowly decaying to equilibrium.

326
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,760
One has to be careful in the formulations, one has to go to well-defined type of coordinate

327
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,720
systems, next one.

328
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:12,480
And the result is essentially the following, that now the temperature starts with zero

329
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,520
and the entropy starts with zero.

330
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,800
And here you have a kind of phase change corresponding to what I have just said, and one can show

331
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:27,280
that this phase change is only possible if it leads to the right ratio of variance to

332
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,880
photons.

333
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,840
In other words, and it appears also at the right time, it is essentially a plank time

334
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,880
or something like that.

335
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,040
And the entropy is, you see, what is the reason of the temperature here?

336
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:48,360
This is the state of the self-heating, and this is the state of the adiabatic expansion.

337
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:55,280
The self-heating corresponds to a transformation of the initial geometry of the universe which

338
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:01,960
was non-nucleogen into the euclidean local structure which we have present.

339
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,960
And this you can study in conformal coordinates for the specialists.

340
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,320
That is really the origin here of this increase of the self-heating.

341
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,800
You can imagine the self-heating as being the transformation of gravitation into heavy

342
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:25,360
particles which then decay into photons and variants of the type we know today.

343
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:33,360
The entropy now starts at zero and increases to its constant value corresponding to the

344
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,080
adiabatic evolution we know today.

345
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:46,160
Now this type of vision seems to indicate that the two famous theories which have been

346
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:52,920
so much discussed in the past, creation of the universe or steady state universe, are

347
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,680
in fact not so different than what we are thinking.

348
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,720
Because essentially it shows that the space-time structure as we can conceive it today, let's

349
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:08,400
say, the Minkowski vacuum, is unstable in respect to formation, simultaneous formation

350
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,480
of curvature and matter.

351
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,520
In other words, that irreversible processes may proceed in the vacuum, or better to say

352
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,160
in philosophical terms which I hope Salvador Dali would not have disapproved, time precedes

353
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,960
existence.

354
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:32,200
Time precedes existence in the sense that every time the conditions would be the right

355
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,080
ones, a new universe could start.

356
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,960
But as the times get involved, maybe perhaps 100 billion years, I really don't know what

357
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
it means.

358
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Is 100 billion years very long?

359
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Is this very short?

360
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
I really don't know.

361
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,040
You know that there are some civilizations like the Christian civilization which speak

362
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,480
always about very short times.

363
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,280
And you have other civilizations like the Indian civilizations, the Mayas, which speak

364
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,960
about billions of years, I mean.

365
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,960
And finally, I really don't know what is the meaning of time in this connection.

366
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,800
But anyway, whenever you begin to have an explanation of a phenomena, and the two most

367
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,840
striking phenomena in our experience are probably life and the universe, and the classical

368
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:26,880
perspective, both life and the universe appear nearly as transgressions, as something which

369
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,200
is there, but there was no reason that it would be there.

370
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,240
And then she said life was permitted, not in contradiction with the laws of nature,

371
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,240
but not really expressing the natural laws of nature, how it could be if the laws of

372
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,360
nature would be the motion of the moon around the earth, life has nothing to do with that.

373
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:53,000
And in the same sense, the existence of the universe appeared to be a unique event in

374
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,880
the perspective of an eternal kind of equilibrium.

375
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,560
Once you go away from this type of concepts, you can conceive on situations which describe

376
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:09,040
an eternal universe which at the same moment is not static.

377
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,760
It is more similar to a relaxation of theater, which starts, increases the case, and another

378
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,560
part starts somewhere far, increases again, and decays.

379
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:29,440
So essentially, I think that is the first, at this end, I would say, the first part and

380
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:37,840
the largest part of my lecture, which is just trying to give you another view on the role

381
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,480
of irreversibility.

382
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:46,040
It is obvious today, and I hope it will become obvious to all people, that irreversibility

383
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:53,720
plays a more and more important, constructive role, beat on the level of biomolecules, beat

384
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,680
on the level of meteorology, beat on the level, probably, of cosmology.

385
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,440
In other models, I have no time now to enumerate all models of cosmology, but I can invoke

386
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:11,040
other type of phase transitions, gauge symmetry breaking, and so on, which don't give a simple

387
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,520
interpretation of the zero temperature, zero entropy, starting condition.

388
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,760
But therefore, we have now to ask then the following question.

389
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:31,440
If then, if then the world is very much dependent on the idea of irreversibility, how then to

390
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,640
introduce this idea of irreversibility on the basic level?

391
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,600
In other words, what is the reason for the existence of irreversibility?

392
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:46,840
We all believe that Newton has discovered, really, some of the basic roots of science,

393
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,120
where irreversibility is playing a role.

394
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,880
And the recent outcome shows that the answer is very clear.

395
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,560
Irreversibility is an aspect of instability.

396
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:07,280
Instability appears at the point where the idea of a trajectory and the quantum mechanics,

397
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,760
I would say, an idea of the wave function becomes irrelevant because of instability,

398
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:21,840
because of the fact that two initial conditions, as close as you want, give rise to divergent

399
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
trajectories.

400
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:28,720
I can illustrate this on an example which has already been discussed by Poicaré himself.

401
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,280
It is just the example which is illustrated here, the dice or whatever, domino or whatever

402
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
you want.

403
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:42,800
When you throw a dice or a piece of money and you look, you find that half of the time

404
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,320
it falls on one side, half of the time it falls on the other, what is the law of nature?

405
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,040
Half and half, half and half, you could say no, of course not.

406
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,200
I know it's a deterministic system, being a deterministic system, it's one or zero.

407
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,680
It's not one half, one half.

408
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:06,240
And that is really the stumbling block which many people have not understood because it

409
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:13,400
would be true to say yes, it is a deterministic system if we could realize the conditions

410
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,680
for the deterministic system with any finite precision, but that is not the case.

411
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:25,840
For a really unstable dynamical system, whatever the uncertainty on the initial condition, it

412
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,160
will still be one half, one half.

413
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,400
I can increase uncertainty, it will still remain one half, one half.

414
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,640
It's only on the limit, on this limit I can never reach, in which it becomes one or zero.

415
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,520
Let me illustrate this on very trivial examples.

416
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:47,640
If you take, you look on the length of a circle, you could say, well, since Pythagore or other,

417
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,960
I know how to do it.

418
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,640
I put a polygon and I count the length of the polygon and that's a very good matter,

419
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
why?

420
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:02,520
Because already for a finite number of sides, you see, I have already a good approximation

421
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,560
for the length of the circle, but if I take, ask a question, what is the curvature?

422
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,880
Obviously, whatever the number of the sides of my polygon, the curvature is zero, but

423
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,840
the curvature of my circle is not zero.

424
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,280
Therefore, the polygon will never be a model for my circle.

425
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,640
Or in other words, if I could only construct polygons, I could never use the circle as

426
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,600
an image from the point of view of the curvature of the polygon.

427
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:38,040
In other words, the statement which I try to make is the following.

428
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:47,520
If the formulation of laws of nature require an infinite precision or an idealization which

429
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:56,960
can never be reached in reality, then it is no more an appropriate way of treating such

430
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,120
kind of situations.

431
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:06,400
And that I would like to illustrate on the example of classical dynamical systems very

432
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
briefly.

433
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Next one.

434
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,160
First of all, what is a classical dynamical system?

435
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,200
A classical dynamical system is something very, very simple.

436
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,320
It is a phase space and contains a trajectory going from one to the other, and it contains

437
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,920
a conserved measure.

438
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,960
What means a conserved measure is that if I take here my points inside the circle or

439
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,560
whatever this is, time going on, this can become a longer line or can be even broken

440
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,240
into pieces, but the volume remains constant.

441
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,440
In other words, the classical world is a museum.

442
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,680
Everything is conserved.

443
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:59,080
If I take a piece of paper, you see, by analogy, I could throw it in pieces, but the pieces

444
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:06,400
I could put them into a corner, you see, but they would lie around, and I could ask somebody

445
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,120
to bring them together and you could start again.

446
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:16,480
In other words, it's like a wind, like an uragan, which breaks things, but keeps them

447
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,840
at least fragments as fragments intact.

448
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:28,520
Now this is, of course, very far from the idea of processes or reversibility, which we see

449
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,800
now to appear in our basic description.

450
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,880
Next one.

451
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:41,680
Now an idealized system, which I like to use for illustration, is the so-called Baker

452
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:53,360
transformation in which I take a square and I flatten it and I put the right part above.

453
00:43:53,360 --> 00:44:02,680
And this is an example of unstable dynamical systems, and unstable dynamism is one direction

454
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:09,480
here being the direction of contraction, and one direction being the direction of dilatation.

455
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:17,000
In that it's very important, is that for such systems, whatever my initial finite precision

456
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,920
will be, after some time I will no more know where the point will go.

457
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,200
Next one.

458
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:35,200
You see, that can be very nicely illustrated by writing the coordinates, the coordinates

459
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:43,000
of the point in the, in my square in terms of a binary expansion.

460
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,960
I write simply x equal Sn over 2 exponent n, let's say.

461
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:56,040
In other words, Sn, I just write the digits in the decimal, in the dual system.

462
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:03,800
And then one can show that this shifting, this scratching and putting above of the Baker

463
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,440
corresponds to what's called a Bernouy shift, not shift, of course, the shift, in which

464
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,640
the digits are changing.

465
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:17,120
Now what this means is that the main digits, where of course the digits are 1 over 2, 1

466
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,120
over 4, 1 over 8, that were the main digits.

467
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:27,680
The digits 1 over 2 exponent 2,000, of course, doesn't play metrol in the beginning, and

468
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,120
whatever my finite precision, it is something which I don't know.

469
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,600
But the position is not the same.

470
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:42,920
After one change, instead of being 2,000, it becomes 1,999, and it shifts to more and

471
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,560
more closer and closer, and its importance becomes larger and larger.

472
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:55,520
As a result, whatever the finite precision, which you know in such kind of system, at

473
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,280
some points, you will not know what it will do.

474
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:07,080
And the question is not to stay, to simply stop at the question of undecidability, like

475
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:15,720
mathematicians like to call it, but to develop a coherent dynamical scheme which corresponds

476
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:22,480
to the realistic situations in which indeed we never know more than a window.

477
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:29,560
We know a number of the CISN, we never know an infinite number of them.

478
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:36,960
And then what you can show is that this corresponds to the idea that as you can never know all

479
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,000
of them, you never know what the trajectory is.

480
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:48,320
What you know is only bundles of trajectories, collections of trajectories having some temporal

481
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,400
window in common.

482
00:46:50,400 --> 00:47:00,320
And these bundles of trajectories satisfying the same observed part of the behavior correspond

483
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:06,800
to a semi-group, no more a dynamical group, which goes in both directions, but a semi-group

484
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,480
because information is flowing out and disappearing.

485
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,680
If you would take the Baker transformation and try to verify the classical statements

486
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,040
of mechanics on the conservation of phase space and so on, you can never do it.

487
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,440
There is no computer on which you can do it because every computer has a finite precision

488
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,640
whatever it is.

489
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,360
And after some time, you will see that the entropy is increasing instead of remaining

490
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,200
constant as classical mechanics months.

491
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,040
Have you then to say that classical mechanics is correct?

492
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:45,720
Yes, it is correct for the type and what I mean correct experimentally verifiable for

493
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,560
the type of systems for which it has been invented, which are essentially periodic systems.

494
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,360
But it is no more applicable, I would not say incorrect, for situations for which it

495
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,360
was not made.

496
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:04,480
And the situations for which it was not made are the situations of high dynamical instability.

497
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,920
Next one.

498
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:12,880
And very recently, one of my co-workers working with Professor Zebehele, who is a world expert

499
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,560
in celestial dynamics, and the problem of three bodies, has discovered a most remarkable

500
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:24,800
example of such a situation in astrophysics.

501
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,640
No more the poor Baker transformation, which is after all a very poor example.

502
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:37,040
You imagine you see no appeal to no pretension to any realistic situation, but a very simple

503
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:47,280
example in which essentially you have the doublet, which is here, sun, Jupiter, and you

504
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,840
imagine that a comet is coming closer on a parabolic motion.

505
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,880
I take a very simple example, there are many others, and I take the restricted three body

506
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,800
problem, I suppose all the three bodies are in a plane.

507
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:10,800
Now what is so interesting in such a situation is that the parabolic motion is at the border

508
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:19,920
between elliptic motion, capture, and hyperbolic motion, in which the comet would be ejected.

509
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,680
In a sense, you can even find these situations in simpler examples, like the elastic pendulum.

510
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:31,960
You can take a pendulum, but I consider an elastic pendulum, you see, a spring together

511
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,480
with a pendulum.

512
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:42,400
Then in the neighborhood of the difference between vibration and rotation, very small

513
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,680
differences can bring the pendulum from one region to another, and that has been called

514
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,880
the stochastic layer.

515
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:55,240
Here you have the periodic motions, and here you have the rotational motions of the pendulum.

516
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:04,760
Now this problem can be solved rigorously, that's a problem which can be solved rigorously

517
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,960
by methods which I have no time to explain, I have a preprint here, if somebody is interested.

518
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,600
And that comes out as a following.

519
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:21,640
I can try to calculate the rotation time of the comet, I mean suppose it is captured,

520
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,640
and I calculate how many times it will go around.

521
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,000
I can calculate this.

522
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:33,280
It depends on the phase of Jupiter in respect to the Sun at the point of closest approach.

523
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,280
Next slide.

524
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,680
And the type of figures which you obtain when you calculate this are the following.

525
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:46,400
Here the calculation is made changing the accuracy over 10 digits, and calculating for

526
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:54,560
various initial conditions the revolution number, you see, versus accuracy, versus accuracy.

527
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:06,560
You see that you obtain 757, 38, 236, 44 revolutions, 12, 157, 7, 8, 143, 17, and you can make this

528
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,280
for various initial conditions.

529
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,240
Now what this means is a following.

530
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:17,520
An improvement of the precision of the initial in which you calculate is of no importance.

531
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:23,280
There is not the slightest indication that the series will ever converge.

532
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:31,880
Therefore, you can just not predict the revolution time and the revolution number of the comet.

533
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:39,000
In other words, instability and stochasticity, which is the basis of irreversibility, is

534
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,440
now a celestial dynamical problem.

535
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,600
You see it in the sky, you don't need to go to quantum mechanics, you see it in the sky.

536
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:52,160
But you can calculate this problem from the point of view, and the reason for this is

537
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,160
very simple.

538
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:58,200
Because the motion is very slow, and therefore you can never calculate the exact phase.

539
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,600
You have to calculate the sign of phi t, let's say, for times which are very, very long,

540
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,480
and that's just impossible to do, whatever the final accuracy will be.

541
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:14,600
Now if you calculate on the contrary the stochastic behavior, the statistical behavior, there

542
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,480
is no problem.

543
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,560
Next one, there is no problem.

544
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:25,200
You can calculate, you can calculate, well it's not very clear to see, the dimension

545
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:33,320
of the comet cloud, and even some fine structures, and you can see how it moves, you see, in

546
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,920
the restricted problem.

547
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:41,920
And Professor Zebehi and Petrovsky have also calculated in this way, I cannot answer any

548
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,560
questions about that because I'm not an expert, the odd cloud of a comet.

549
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,560
And they found a very good agreement with experiment.

550
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,000
This will come out in physical review, I think, next month.

551
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,320
So you will find the details about this calculation.

552
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:04,160
What I find really fantastic, I would really say, is that therefore by going from two-body

553
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:13,920
to three-body, in very simple cases, you see already the conceptual change which is proceeding.

554
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:21,680
Instead of finding a simple generalization, you find really a completely new type of behavior.

555
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:29,200
Therefore we see now that in a sense we go to what I believe are really new formulations

556
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:36,720
of dynamics, dynamics in which you can never deal with single events, the dynamics in which

557
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:47,400
you have to deal with collective events like the chance events which are represented here.

558
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:53,280
Of course, this leads to various consequences also in quantum mechanics and general relativity

559
00:53:53,280 --> 00:54:00,840
which I have no time to discuss now, to which I can come back in the discussion.

560
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,480
Let me conclude.

561
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:14,560
Essentially I believe that this incorporation of time and instability in physics has far-reaching

562
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,560
consequences.

563
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:21,800
Indeed, it was as I explained already at the beginning, the problem of time which was essentially

564
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,920
the basis of the famous two cultures.

565
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,560
When I was a young man, I had the privilege to know rather well Schrodinger, and of course

566
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:39,640
I was reading all that Schrodinger was writing and was going to see him, and I was also reading

567
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:44,600
of course his last book which was called My World View.

568
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,920
Some of you may have read it, it was published in 1953, that was his last book.

569
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,360
And here he was dealing with the problem of human existence, essentially with the ontological

570
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,360
problem.

571
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:06,120
How have you to understand the fact that we are a subject embedded in the collective world?

572
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,560
This is of course the whole problem of vision, it is against the problem of one of the central

573
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,840
problems of art.

574
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:20,960
And as a start of his book, Schrodinger made a very strange for me as a young man statement.

575
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:26,680
He said, I shall discuss this problem without speaking about quantum mechanics, uncertainty

576
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,400
principle, dynamics or whatsoever.

577
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Because he said, I am not feeling that this will bring any light into this problem.

578
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,320
And in fact he was discussing this problem in his book in purely philosophical terms,

579
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:52,400
very much inspired some decades before by the Vedas, so before Capra and all the kind

580
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,440
of books which appeared today have become very popular.

581
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:05,880
Now I found very strange that here is a problem which interests everybody, our human existence.

582
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,160
And science is some of the main characteristics of western civilization.

583
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:16,040
This is really true, that science has nothing to say about that, is this possible?

584
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:21,240
And I believe that we come at least a little close, I would not say that we have now solved

585
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,880
the problem, please don't misunderstand what I am saying.

586
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:31,440
I am saying simply that we can at least say that our vision of the world inside us and

587
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,720
the world outside begin to converge.

588
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:42,200
I want simply to say that we can now begin to see the conditions on individualization.

589
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:48,040
I spoke about the Benin, the Benin has inside it because of the great heat of temperature

590
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:53,280
and inside space which is different from the outside space.

591
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,240
In other words, the very idea of what is a natural system different from the outside

592
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:06,400
world is inherent in the bifurcations which occur in the system.

593
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,240
Moreover we know that the system can evolve even if we have a very poor idea and come

594
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:17,440
to the complexity which I mentioned about the electrical waves of the brain.

595
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:24,760
So at least the ontological problem becomes no more a foreigner in this perspective.

596
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:30,400
It is no more that we deal with contradictory words, that we deal with problems which have

597
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:37,960
to be looked at by in many ways, which have to be seen by through many, many declarations

598
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:45,920
like to say that I am tired, my English becomes poor, you see, therefore it is becoming no

599
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,080
more such a conflictual problem.

600
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:58,840
Thus I may conclude by reminding that Freud has written that science has to be seen as

601
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,800
an aggression against human being.

602
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:08,280
Indeed Copernicus has shown us that we are not at the center, geographical center of

603
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,760
astronomical center of the universe.

604
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:17,680
Darwin has shown us that we are an animal like others, Freud himself has shown us that

605
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:26,280
our conscious activity of which we are so proud is only a very small part of the general

606
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,080
neural or subconscious activity.

607
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,400
I would like to invert this position.

608
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:41,440
I would like to say that if really the world contains essential components, irreversibility

609
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:51,120
and instability, then the creative activity of man as manifest in art, in music is really

610
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:58,200
the proof that man is no more an exception to the laws of nature, but represents this

611
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,960
laws on a unique way.

612
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,960
Thank you very much.

613
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:47,600
Let me first congratulate you for this brilliant description of the universe from the Benard

614
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,760
cells to the Big Bang.

615
00:59:51,760 --> 01:00:00,360
I would like just to make one remark about the symmetry breaking which you mentioned

616
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:06,920
which in fact is somewhere behind the stage concerning this increase of entropy.

617
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:15,960
To mention that there has been a number of attempts for describing universe with domains

618
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:26,120
of symmetry breaking with opposite sign and that there is even presently an analysis of

619
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:33,360
the space-time distribution of the quasars which leads to a model of the universe which

620
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:38,880
is spherically closed and has two domains, one of matter and one on antimatter and we

621
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:46,200
sit in the matter side but not naturally in the center somewhere with respect to the interface.

622
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:53,720
So I believe that this problem of the high entropy per bar in the universe which I expressed

623
01:00:53,720 --> 01:01:01,040
this morning in other terms, I didn't use the word entropy, may present in during the

624
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:08,960
coming years new aspects especially with the new results concerning the space-time distribution

625
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:16,560
of quasars which will come out from the results given by the space, by observation from space

626
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:21,800
with the space telescope where there is a large program of observations of quasars.

627
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:30,080
So whereas I think that this model where you start with zero temperature and have the burst

628
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:37,840
of entropy is quite appealing. Now this may have taken place at different places with different

629
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:43,520
sign if not with different sign but with different sign as far as baron and anti-barons are

630
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:54,200
concerned leading to a very complex universe. I would I shall if the discussion leaves time

631
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:00,520
later on to come to a completely different question. Yes, well I have really nothing to

632
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,840
answer I mean I agree with you that the questions first of all are not at all solved. However,

633
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:13,760
I found very stimulating the question as a possibility of having insight general relativity

634
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:21,400
view in which there is an intrinsic phase transition leading from an open universe to a

635
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:27,800
locally Lorentz type universe. If the universe would have started as a flat space universe this

636
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,440
phase transition would not have been taking place therefore it is not at all a trivial thing. I

637
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:39,160
would like to add the following thing in general relativity the idea is that the basic reality

638
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:46,320
is the geometrical element. However if you believe in the importance of unstable dynamical systems

639
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:53,640
this cannot be so because then the general I would say transformation would mix stability in

640
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,120
stability therefore I expect also a change in the formulation of general relativity.

641
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:08,720
You showed a curve of the temperature as a function of time which looked Gaussian like.

642
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:16,440
Not necessarily Gaussian. No well I mean just it had a maximum somewhere. If I understood you

643
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:25,640
correctly this is a model of how the temperature changes the temperature of the universe changes

644
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:35,920
in time. Now, can you tell me what is the time corresponding to the maximum in this model?

645
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:42,000
Very early very early you see it's difficult to know exactly the time it may be a multiple of

646
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:53,400
Planck's time. It would be very close 10 to 6 times Planck's time. Now what I plot there you see

647
01:03:53,400 --> 01:04:00,480
the new formulation of the second law which I have given includes the effect of gravitational field

648
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:07,800
and it appears that it's possible to formulate the second law using a new definition of internal

649
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:15,720
energy which is the old definition multiplied by a factor depending on the gravitational state

650
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:21,400
of the universe. I could write it down I don't know if it's the right moment and therefore it

651
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:27,600
there is but at the moment at the present this factor tends from the start of the universe this

652
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:35,280
factor tends rapidly to 1. Then we recover the usual formulation of the second law. In other words

653
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:41,280
the interest of the formulation which I try to give is that the formulation of the second law

654
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:52,720
depends itself on the cosmological state of the universe. Precisely my question now is really how

655
01:04:52,760 --> 01:05:01,040
much do we know of the thermodynamics in presence of extremely strong classical still classical

656
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:07,360
gravitational fields? That is a very good question the classical answer which I don't which I don't

657
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:16,760
agree is that there is no influence why because you can formulate the second law in local Galilean

658
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:24,080
coordinates and then you write it in a covariant way and then there is answer. I object against

659
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:30,280
this procedure because the second law of thermodynamics is not a local law it is the

660
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:35,960
selection of a semi-group out of two possible semi-groups using asymptotic conditions therefore

661
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:43,120
you cannot formulate it in the local Galilean coordinates therefore I have formulated it

662
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:51,400
with my co-workers in a way in which the system is going to Lorentzian frame for a long time

663
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:57,600
asymptotically then I noted the second law is valid therefore it is essentially a kind of

664
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:04,480
internal extrapolation formula for strong gravitational fields. Thank you just another

665
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:12,280
comment this time I like your example about the circumference which is which has a finite

666
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:18,600
curvature in which you approach with the polygon but but you should have sent that there are a

667
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:24,400
finite number of points where the curvature of the polygon is infinite. That is true that is

668
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:45,680
completely true. I agree. Okay well I enjoyed your talk as usual very lively experience for us my

669
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:54,040
comment is related to the ones we've already heard it seems to me the new the particularly new

670
01:06:54,040 --> 01:07:02,920
element in what you have told us but you haven't given us the details is how to include gravitational

671
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:11,840
entropy in some formulation of cosmology I think that's very interesting and of course my co-countryman

672
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:20,080
Penrose as you know has spent a lot of time trying to see whether it is the vial tensor or

673
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:30,560
how one should include the gravitational entropy in in cosmological models and perhaps you might

674
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:36,560
want later on to say a word about the relation between your way of looking at it and this

675
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:45,200
Ritchie tensor way of doing it or vial tensor I'm not quite sure which combination he used or he tried

676
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:51,640
to use because I think he did not in fact succeed so far. I did want to make one other point about

677
01:07:51,640 --> 01:08:01,640
the hot big bang now we have seen from your curves what we might call the cold big bang now in the

678
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:09,440
hot big bang you can of course also increase have an increase of entropy with lapse of time you

679
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:16,280
showed us a curve where the entropy is independent of time for the normal let us say the hot big

680
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:22,360
bang but I think perhaps one ought to observe that only holds as you probably will agree for one

681
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:29,760
phase if you have a two-phase system then in the expansion of the universe from a hot initial

682
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:39,680
state the two phases say matter and radiation will get out of equilibrium they will both expand

683
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:45,440
adiabatically and their temperature will become different because they have different adiabatic

684
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:54,920
laws and as a result of this difference there will be heat transfer between these two phases and so

685
01:08:54,920 --> 01:09:01,320
the entropy will in fact increase but that is only possible in a two-phase situation and then with

686
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:12,080
very coarse approximations you can of course track down the increase of entropy with time and even

687
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:20,680
possibly going from one cycle to the next and you can then verify that the entropy actually increases

688
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,840
even in an oscillating universe during the contracting phase it still goes up and then it

689
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:34,720
goes up in the next cycle again there are such very simple model universes but of course I

690
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:42,200
imagine that on your view they would not be allowed because the assumption there is that you are

691
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:50,480
starting with a hot initial big bang which is a sort of standard model I mean I have not much

692
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:56,520
to answer there is no relation with Penrose model it is a completely different approach Penrose

693
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:04,240
viewer but however the common element I would say is the interest in the problem and I admire

694
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:10,240
greatly the work of Penrose but the technicalities are completely different now the second question is

695
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:16,960
of course trivial I mean I have when I wrote the entropy the constant I meant I would say the large

696
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:23,480
scale entropy they are all the time a reversible process going on in this room biology all this is

697
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:29,280
irreversibility therefore I was thinking about the overall picture and my emphasis is of course on

698
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:37,920
the possibility to give a universe to give a model of a universe which starts with a zero entropy

699
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:47,440
and binds it up in itself to the type of entropy which we observe today so a self-creating or self I

700
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:54,600
would say a catalyzed effect and that is really the important element I could speak of us cause

701
01:10:54,600 --> 01:11:02,000
hours about various aspects of this which I had no time to do here and the main point is of course

702
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,320
that the fact if you start with a hot big bang it is a very unpleasant situation that you have to

703
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:14,800
understand why matter what's ever created with this special entropy with this special temperature

704
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:20,480
what's this due to quantum fluctuation what's due to quantum tunneling or whatsoever there are many

705
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:26,960
views as you know about this therefore I thought interesting that the relatively simple thermodynamic

706
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:35,280
view could be developed at the including however a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics

707
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:42,640
in which now the second law refers to a very defined state gravitational state of the universe

708
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:49,920
I think this by the way may be a rather rather interesting example of a law of nature which

709
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:56,160
itself depends on time because the gravitational state is changing this time therefore the law

710
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:04,400
of nature is no more reflecting something eternal but something relative to once one specific

711
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:11,440
situation it in a sense it has some ideological elements in common with the old attempts by

712
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,640
dirac and so on when you spoke about the variation of constants but here it's not the variation of

713
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:24,240
elementary particle of elementary constants but it is a variation of the law itself more in the

714
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:30,320
spirit of what has been anticipated many years ago by great american philosopher fears

715
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:43,440
any more questions while we are waiting for the next question i will try again to get the

716
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:52,320
discussion to get to the bottom of things by framing the issue as follows one of the subjects

717
01:12:52,320 --> 01:13:07,440
of this meeting has been the simple question is chance a product of ignorance or is there

718
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:16,800
an opening through which nature may enjoy randomness in professor pregon genes well known view

719
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:24,320
there are instabilities that can decide the future of the system do these instabilities

720
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:31,760
these before cation resemble a window a one of opening through which chance can slip onto the

721
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:39,120
scene or must we continue seeking for knowledge at these points more finely tuned knowledge such

722
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:47,440
as what we look for in quantum mechanics but i would like to say that obviously instability

723
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:53,600
the reversibility are the result of well-defined dynamical structures essentially people have

724
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:59,840
proposed i would say two types of classification of dynamical systems in two types very roughly

725
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:06,560
speaking one would be essentially periodic type and there of course there is no chance and there

726
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:12,320
is no reason to introduce instability reversibility and so on on the other hand if the information

727
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:20,880
which you need increases all the time and if therefore no finite information whatever it is

728
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:27,840
can predict the long time behavior of the system then a new situation appears and that is this new

729
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:33,840
situation which is related then to instability and reversibility to the formulation of semi-forms

730
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,800
okay professor garrido

731
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:50,960
professor pregon gene about 10 or 12 years ago you came to ciches and you were and you and your

732
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:59,920
group were defending at that time that time irreversibility was a consequence a consequence

733
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:12,080
if i remember well of the magic no never well and then i

734
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:25,920
i said i as far as i remember you had uh three plus one plus one plus one minus one

735
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:32,080
that is a classical metric but i haven't never said that this is related to reversibility

736
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,440
mass pregunters

737
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,560
so paniker

738
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,760
uh i would like to ask the professor pregon gene

739
01:15:51,760 --> 01:16:00,640
yes yes is the translation working i would like to ask professor pregon gene a question

740
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:12,400
i'm from a different field so i apologize for not using scientific terminology with due rigor

741
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,520
i would like to underline the problems jorge wagonsburg has raised which i believe more over

742
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,760
of brought us together here i would put the question like this

743
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:33,120
would you admit that these points of instability represent a total absence of any type of natural

744
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:49,440
law this seems to me to be a sort of almost buddhist almost eastern ontological nihilism

745
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
which might perhaps form the core of the concept of creativity

746
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:05,680
well i believe the problem of creativity is much clearer formulated in in the recent

747
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:13,680
terms in which my lecture was given than in classical physics after all a piece of music

748
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:19,760
starts from silence and goes to silence in other words the starting of a piece of music

749
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:25,600
is a kind of bifurcation if you want to use rather loose language therefore the starting

750
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:34,880
of novelties the novelties are really related to the type of systems which present bifurcations

751
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:42,800
and the bifurcations even on the macroscopic scale are themselves the expression of some basic

752
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:53,200
dynamical instability therefore finally the outcome of all this is that the scheme of the world as we

753
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:59,920
see today is very different from the time of the formulation of kepler's law it is very natural

754
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:07,200
after all three centuries have gone the kepler's law newton's law the classical epistemology

755
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:15,360
was basically related on periodic phenomena and that's very natural because since neolithic time

756
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:22,080
and perhaps even since paleolithic time men was very sensitive to periodic variations in climate

757
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:29,680
to periodic recurrences and so on and so on and therefore the temptation it was to put this

758
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:38,880
as a basis of a scientific epistemology and in a sense this is still a very valid important field

759
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:46,080
that nature is just not patterned according or not only patterned according to this type of

760
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:52,960
recurrent phenomena you see some years ago if you would have asked a physicist what is the

761
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:59,200
relation between physics and biology you would have said obviously one day physics will give

762
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:06,480
an interpretation of biology and that's true physics is giving more many many important contributions

763
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:13,120
however if you think about the spirit of biology the spirit of biology was always an evolutionary

764
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:19,920
spirit darwin is 19th century the spirit of classical physics was an intemporal view and in

765
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:26,880
a sense you could say physics today becomes more closer to biology becoming more closer to biology

766
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:33,440
becomes also more close to human enterprises and finally to artistic activity and that was

767
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:46,400
something which i wanted to emphasize in my lecture i do not want to seem too insistent

768
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:52,160
professor prigogine but there was something in your reply to george wagensberg's question that

769
01:19:52,160 --> 01:20:02,880
surprised me considerably and stimulated my curiosity you explicitly avoided uttering the

770
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:17,600
word chance on the other hand you mentioned something i found very subtle you clarified that at the

771
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:23,440
moment that a description let's say finite does not allow us to know or predict the position or

772
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:31,680
what will happen at that moment we have something new i find this very attractive but i would also

773
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:43,360
like to ask you whether you intend to use the word chance or not one of the most remarkable outcome

774
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:51,200
of modern dynamical theory is that some of the unstable dynamical systems are as random as bernouy

775
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:59,600
bernouy games of chance the isomorphic to bernouy systems you remember perhaps on

776
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:06,800
one of my slides it was even written bernouy shift therefore and there is a bernouy measure involved

777
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:14,320
therefore your i can answer very openly your question yes chance becomes a fundamental

778
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:21,360
element of dynamics the question that is chance i would say from the definition to the point of

779
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:28,640
view i don't know i i have no definition and most are not very inclined to verbal discussions

780
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:35,280
however what i would like to say is a mathematical theory of chance as was presented by people

781
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:42,560
who played games you see is now used in the dynamical in the dynamical theories

782
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,760
when you have a strange attractor you cannot predict what will happen you can predict some

783
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:55,040
correlations you can predict some global behavior but not that will behave that will happen in the

784
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:03,680
in an individual realization therefore we in many fields deal with a new approach to science

785
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:09,920
and to our dialogue of men with nature it's a classical ambition that's to have a kind of

786
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:17,760
transparent nature in which we could decide in every single event that will come out and we see

787
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:23,680
this was of course no more the situation in quantum mechanics but we see that science more and more

788
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:32,800
deals with mass phenomena this repetitive phenomena in which we can deal with something we can say

789
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:40,080
something which is neither pure randomness neither simple deterministic systems i believe that i'm

790
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:46,400
concerned that we're only at the beginning of the game i fact if i could use the word game here in a

791
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:54,400
different sense it is so easy to understand what a bernoulli scheme means and it's so easy to understand

792
01:22:54,400 --> 01:23:01,360
what a simple periodic motion means but the real world is in between somewhere and it's between

793
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:07,120
something and there are elements of randomness in DNA but it's not pure randomness it's not why it

794
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:14,160
knows and many of the recent attempts would be precisely to give them more quantitative meaning

795
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:20,720
to the word randomness but it means exactly for example in paris not a long time ago there was

796
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:28,160
a meeting of economists and the economists have been looking that is for example i take an oversimplified

797
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:34,880
view what are the rules of the stock market now you know in neoclassical economy the idea is that you

798
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:42,400
have a i would say a well informed universe and that therefore stock market could only be a pure

799
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:48,080
white noise because if there would be no white noise somebody would have already used the deviation

800
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:55,200
from the white noise to become wealthy now today with the new methods of analyzing things you can

801
01:23:55,200 --> 01:24:03,600
really see what is the dynamical content of some time series in in economy and the remarkable

802
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:09,760
outcome is that there is a lot of structure and that the idea of white noise is not true the idea

803
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:16,240
of periodic behavior obviously is not and we have to begin now to have the vocabulary necessary

804
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:23,200
to characterize the intermediate situation it is i think as i said at the beginning of my lecture

805
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:32,480
we are in a new at this period of dialogue with nature and this new period involves that we are

806
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:38,160
also at the beginning of something at the beginning of something you see at the beginning of something

807
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:45,600
and for me it is such a remarkable coincidence that at the very moment where there is this transition

808
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:52,000
in the demography of the world where the world is going to a new dimension in the population

809
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:00,160
with new requirements on energy and so on and so on science is following in some sense science

810
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:07,920
begins to to be able to approach this highly non-linear interactive processes there is a big

811
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:14,240
project in x2 called global change such a project involves also non-linear mathematics

812
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:20,960
involves also amplifications relations between various data and i think it's so remarkable

813
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:26,960
that all these things happen nearly at the same time and i think that is really what gives the

814
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:33,440
a kind of cultural unity to our so diversified and so fragmented period

815
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:40,640
professor lancer reaches to say something only if nobody else wants to speak because i've had one

816
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:47,760
say well i the reason is that i want to speak again is that i am very interested in this

817
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:56,080
question of not being able to predict which uh professor prigudine suggested because now the

818
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:04,160
fact is if you have your strange attractor realized in nature the system will in fact execute a

819
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:11,360
definite motion now when one says one cannot predict it is the statement meant to be that we

820
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:18,320
will never be able to say that this motion which we've just observed uh can be explained

821
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:25,520
that is a complete misunderstanding and misstatement of what i've said no i was a question no it was

822
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:32,000
not as it was a question obviously no and i'm also not interested in the question if nature knows

823
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:38,320
what it does or not i'm not speaking about what nature knows or doesn't know what nature

824
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:45,120
is ontologically doing i'm only speaking about our intellectual models of the universe in which

825
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:53,280
we are living the question is simply are we able knowing the this type of equation knowing the

826
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:58,880
baker transformation knowing a finite information to know where the point will be in the baker

827
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:05,280
transformation after an arbitrary time which in fact can be even estimated and the answer is no

828
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:12,000
in the present day of mathematics the system will of course execute a specific motion and

829
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:19,200
it obviously and it is it would be disappointing for scientists if they were unable if they had

830
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:25,360
to admit that they would never be able to it is the same story you can ask i think that's a

831
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:31,360
misunderstanding of what science means i mean in quantum mechanics you're also not able to predict

832
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:36,960
where is the position of an electron with respect to the nucleus it you can only predict this on

833
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:48,880
collective on collective on repetitive experiments is this a you can say a kind of failure of of

834
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:56,320
the human intellect i don't think so because it is simply we have to adapt our intellect

835
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:01,680
to the conditions of the world the world could have been a very nice collection of periodic

836
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:06,960
motion then this question would not arise but probably we would not be around here to discuss

837
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:15,360
these questions i am not sure if professor tom yeah alphando professor pre-gauging on

838
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:22,160
very simple question do you say any logical connection between the sensitive dependence

839
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:28,800
on of initial data which you have described and time irreversibility or reversibility

840
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:39,040
one has to make a distinction between the sensitive dependence on initial condition

841
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:46,240
in time symmetry broken systems and in time symmetry unbroken system the baker belongs to one

842
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:52,720
category the meteorological system which i mentioned belongs to the other in the first case

843
01:28:52,720 --> 01:29:00,720
the fact to consider instead of because of the sensitive sensitivity to initial condition a

844
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:09,040
collection of trajectories lead to the formulation of a semi-group theory and therefore to a breaking

845
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:14,640
of time symmetry in the second case like the meteorological case or the cases which i mentioned

846
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:20,800
in my lecture this is not so because in this case you start already this equation is broken time

847
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:28,720
symmetry so so am i right if i say that there is no logical connection at all between sensitive

848
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:35,680
initial sensitive dependence on initial condition and time reversibility or irreversibility no you

849
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:42,000
are not right i'm not right no then explain why because as i just have mentioned i can only repeat

850
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:49,360
what i just said in the case in which you start with a time symmetrical system the sensitive

851
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:56,960
initial conditions of the type of the k flow the consideration of this type of system can be transformed

852
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:04,960
into the behavior of a symmetry broken semi-group and the way in which this is done can you can

853
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:09,600
read my paper so i can give you some reprints if you are interested no of course if you start with

854
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:16,720
a system which is not defined by an homeomorphism by a map then it's obviously you have obviously

855
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:22,400
i don't need you have a symmetry on the beginning not i have no symmetry in the beginning i can

856
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:28,160
start with continuous system of this map that makes no difference anyway i would just i with

857
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:35,520
a final observation what you said earlier you should very carefully distinguish between what

858
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:43,280
belongs to mathematical theory and what becomes what belongs to real systems mathematics has nothing

859
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:47,600
to to say to reality that's your point of view it's not mine

860
01:30:50,560 --> 01:31:00,960
rolf if dynamical systems simulate so nicely randomness do you think that this could

861
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:09,680
lead towards a new understanding of the stochastic character of the quantum measurement process

862
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:18,720
i hope so but i think so but in a sense but here i have to be rather vague because it would

863
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:25,280
be take too much time you see the main problem of quantum mechanics for me i don't know i mean

864
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:30,080
i can take very many point of views and i would like to say that i'm working on this problem

865
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:36,240
that i hope to come to some result very soon so i'm a little making a little extrapolation

866
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:43,120
i believe that indeed the wave function corresponds to a potentiality the outcome of the measure to

867
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:49,520
an actuality and i believe that the transition from potentiality to actuality is precisely due

868
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:56,400
to irreversibility the difficulty was that before irreversibility was very difficult to define in

869
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:01,760
terms of quantum mechanics now i can define irreversibility in quantum mechanics through an

870
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:08,080
appropriate formalism super operators entropies and super operator not in the hillbatt space and so on

871
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:13,520
and therefore i can now show and i think i can even explain it to you without any mathematics

872
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:20,720
the reason is the following that once i have irreversibility as the result of instability

873
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:27,200
i can no more deal with single wave functions i have to deal with collections of wave functions

874
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:33,440
and these collections of wave function exactly a collection of trajectories no more satisfy

875
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:40,000
the initial Schrodinger equation that they no more conserve pure states because there are

876
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:47,040
no collections of wave functions which i observe over a window of time and for this reason the

877
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:55,120
measurement becomes simply a veil in which we express the collective character of the

878
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:02,720
of the object which you observe it is of course a rather strong statement because what i'm saying

879
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:09,840
is that in classical mechanics the basic object is no more a single trajectory it is no more

880
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:16,800
a Gibson symbol because a Gibson symbol can be reduced to a single trajectory to a pure case

881
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:25,840
it is now a time-oriented non-local semi-group objects which is no more admitting a solution

882
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:31,760
the single trajectory because whatever the duration of the observation it will never be

883
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:38,880
observed of the complete i would say phase space in which it is embedded in a sense my the point

884
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:44,400
of view which i am advocating from this rather technical point of view is the following the

885
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:51,520
classical view of unstable systems was to compare them to the dynamics of systems which i can

886
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:58,800
really observe over infinite times my point of view is simply to say let's now include the

887
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:06,480
finiteness of our observation and show that whatever the finiteness of observation independently

888
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:12,800
of the approximation beat long short million of years 20 minutes that's of no importance

889
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:19,920
there is a common formalism corresponding to all this type of situations i'm perhaps a little vague

890
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,120
last question professor schatzman

891
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:40,800
this is not a real really question and probably will not answer what i'm going to to say

892
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:51,040
uh we live i can say in a very unstable world full of bifurcations and this reminds me a cartoon

893
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:58,880
i have seen in the new yorker something like 25 years ago where you see a giant computer

894
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:05,600
in front of which there are two scientists and one says to the other what does he say

895
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:15,840
and the other one says he says we should make peace now more precisely there has been in nature

896
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:24,720
a couple of papers which were inspired by this non-linear dynamics about the way

897
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:33,840
in which arms race can finally lead to war and there has been discussions in the same journal

898
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:40,080
whether the assumptions which which were made by the first authors were correct or were not

899
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:50,400
correct now i'm coming to my question nowadays where we have not only on one side this fantastic

900
01:35:50,400 --> 01:36:00,160
storage of weapons with something like 50 000 megatons of nuclear power that we have these new

901
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:08,720
strategic defense initiative and you know certainly quite well probably even better than i

902
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:17,360
what the american scientists have written on it would you think that there is a possible aim

903
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:24,880
of dealing from the point of view of the dynamical system about the danger of the arms race

904
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:35,040
and possible to tell we are reaching the point where the human humanity and civilization is in

905
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:44,720
danger but let me not go into a strategy proper but let me say that i believe the problem which

906
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:53,520
you rightly bring out is closely related to the view which is being developed i mean at the moment

907
01:36:54,240 --> 01:37:01,120
you see too and let's say it is it is connected in some way in the vein which i see the connection

908
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:09,840
is the following the classical view of the world that's that reality and rationality was the same

909
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:18,800
only one rational reality or one reality which is rational today we see a pluralistic world

910
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:24,320
we see a world of you mentioned of instabilities of many possible realization

911
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:31,280
and therefore the question we have to begin to think in a non-linear way we have to understand

912
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:38,880
that the world is more rich than one of the realization which in which we can live now

913
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:45,120
you know to give first a simpler example take the problem of psychoanalysis the classical

914
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:49,680
view was that you have to go to the psychoanalyst and he will tell you why you behave in this way

915
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:57,120
or another i think more and more family therapies becoming familiar today in other words you have

916
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:04,560
to go together and the therapist will try to find but as a relation in this unstable dynamical system

917
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:10,800
which is a family and which brings into some complication for a member of the family and then

918
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:16,400
he will say perhaps there's a reshuffling necessary you see and then perhaps something better can

919
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:23,840
arise and i would say that we need this family therapy on the level of nations in other words

920
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:33,680
what i like to say is that values are often often related to homeostatic reactions to a given

921
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:41,600
i would say realization of a bifurcation and it is not my chance i think that most of the most

922
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:51,120
difficult problem in our time are no more conflicts about territory or about even economic resources

923
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:58,640
but much more about ideologies and ideologies are value systems around a given bifurcation

924
01:38:58,640 --> 01:39:06,240
a given realization a given branch if we begin now to think in a non-linear way we may conceive

925
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:14,000
whichever we may conceive about situations in which we perhaps have to to probe these ideologies

926
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:21,520
of which many in this case come from the 19th century and are a little obsolete you see therefore

927
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:29,840
i would say my answer to this is not only let's carefully look on the disarmament problem but let's

928
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:35,600
look carefully on the tolerance problem on the tolerance problem is really the problem of our

929
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:42,080
time the tolerance problem is to understand that there are many realizations of the of the cultural

930
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:48,960
world and that we have to live in this multiple world if there is any value in science it is

931
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:56,880
finally that we hope if i'm a scientist i hope that science will give to the world finally a

932
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:04,960
more multiple way of realization after a less linear way a less constrained way of realization

933
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:12,560
i i feel this i think i'm it is a very common feeling between european scientists you see as european

934
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:19,040
i believe we are all living at the intersection of value system as european we are all

935
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:27,360
proud that the the science project has started in europe and very close from here partly and also

936
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:33,360
that the idea of democracy was started in europe and there were there were two rationalities

937
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:39,920
you see the scientific rationality and the and the social and humanistic rationality

938
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:45,760
and what is really i think the problem is to bring them closer together but to bring and i think

939
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:52,000
all that i try to tell you is for me if it has any value at all it has the value of bringing

940
01:40:52,000 --> 01:41:00,320
together to closer these rationalities in a sense we can apply it also to human situations

941
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:07,920
and see really in this way having really in this way a more tolerant and more multiple view on human

942
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:27,920
civilization thank you very much professor prigozine in 15 minutes we will begin the debate

943
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:47,920
