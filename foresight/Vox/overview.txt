 The video discusses the impact of AI-generated images through text prompts on human artists, illustrators, and creators. It explains that these AI models like OpenAI's DALL-E and Midjourney navigate a latent space where each point corresponds to a possible image, which is generated through a process called diffusion that starts with noise and iteratively arranges pixels into recognizable images. The technology has the ability to mimic an artist's style by using their name as a prompt without directly copying their images.

James Gurney, an American illustrator, shares his thoughts on the ethical considerations of using artists' styles in AI models, suggesting transparency about the software used and the artist's consent to be included in the data set. However, there are concerns about copyright infringement and the potential for AI to perpetuate biases present in the data sets it learns from, which are often a reflection of internet content, including cultural misrepresentation and stereotypes.

The video also highlights that these tools remove barriers between human imagination and creation, potentially transforming how humans create, communicate, and interact with culture. The long-term consequences of this technology are still unknown but are expected to be significant and multifaceted.

To get a broader perspective on the implications for professionals in image making, the video suggests watching a bonus video featuring insights from various creative individuals who have experimented with these AI tools. Viewers are encouraged to share their thoughts in the comments.

Checking Vox/The trick that made animation realistic.txt
 The passage discusses the innovation and evolution of animation, particularly focusing on the contributions of Max and Dave Fleischer, as well as the influence of Cab Calloway on early cartoons. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Innovation in Animation**: Early animated shorts lacked realistic motion, which led to the development of techniques to improve animation accuracy and fluidity. Max Fleischer, known for his inventive work in animation, played a pivotal role in this transformation.

2. **Rotoscoping**: The Fleischers invented the rotoscope, a device that allowed animators to trace over live-action footage to create more realistic movements in their cartoons. This involved filming real-life movements and then tracing these onto animation paper. Dave Fleischer's dancing, filmed on the roof of their home, was used to animate Coco the Clown, showcasing smooth and lifelike movements.

3. **Technological Advancements**: The Fleischers also developed multi-plane animation, which allowed for more depth and complexity in scenes by separating background elements and moving them independently from the foreground characters. This technique saved animators time and created visually stunning effects.

4. **Cab Calloway's Influence**: Cab Calloway inspired a series of Betty Boop cartoons where he was depicted as a dancing walrus. His reaction to seeing his dance moves animated was one of uproarious laughter, highlighting the artistic and humorous potential of animation.

5. **Cultural Impact**: While some aspects of early Fleischer animations are outdated by today's standards (such as stereotypes), the creative spirit behind their work has endured. The Fleischers' innovations paved the way for later animation techniques, including motion capture.

6. **Patents and Artistry**: The Fleischers held patents for both rotoscoping and multi-plane animation, but their true genius lay in combining these technologies with artistic skill and improvisation to create timeless works of art.

7. **Legacy**: The Fleischer Studios were based outside of Hollywood, in New York and Miami, where they produced iconic animations like "Betty Boop" and "Gulliver's Travels." Their contributions significantly impacted the field of animation, influencing not only animated cartoons but also later forms of animation in video games and film.

8. **Modern Relevance**: Rotoscoping remains a versatile tool in modern animation, used for both artistic purposes and practical effects to capture realistic movements. Motion capture is its logical extension, allowing actors to bring their performances into the digital realm.

In essence, the passage celebrates the Fleischers' pioneering spirit and technical advancements that have left a lasting impact on the world of animation. Their work not only changed the face of animation but also demonstrated that artistry combined with innovation can lead to extraordinary creative achievements.
