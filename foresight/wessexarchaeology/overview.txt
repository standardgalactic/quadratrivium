 Sophie Clark is hosting an episode of "What's in the Box?" at Wessex Archaeology's head office, where she interviews Phil Harding, a fieldwork archaeologist. They are discussing a remarkable piece of worked flint found in Wiltshire, which is believed to be the largest ever discovered in the south of England. This flint artifact is associated with late Neolithic sites, such as Stonehenge and Silbury Hill, dating back around 2500 BC.

Phil Harding suggests that the flint, which he refers to as a "beast," is likely for symbolic purposes rather than as a tool for making flint tools. He explains that the object, which has a dark blue patina due to exposure over time, was probably never used as a core for creating additional tools. Instead, it may have been moved from East Anglia to Wiltshire as a ceremonial or ritual object, possibly given from one individual to another before ending up in its current location.

The flint's quality can be determined by the sound it makes when tapped, which is a characteristic of high-quality flint in the region known as "ringers" because of their bell-like ring. The patina on the flint indicates that it was originally black and came from a chalky environment, which would have been its appearance when new.

Sophie thanks Phil for bringing this extraordinary piece of flintwork to their attention, and they invite viewers to learn more about flint cores through links provided in the video description.
