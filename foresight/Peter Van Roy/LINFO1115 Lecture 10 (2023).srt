00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we're going to talk about PageRank and a lot you're going to see a lot of stuff on

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,500
PageRank.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:24,000
This was a key invention that led to the founding of Google in the early 90s and I'm going to

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
give you some mathematical foundations.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm also going to talk about extensions like what's called Topic Specific PageRank

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
or SIPRANKs for finding similar pages, TrustRank and I will explain how web spamming works,

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
how that search engine optimized companies can try to increase the rank so there's a

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
huge gap between search engines and these guys.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let me first start.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let me give several definitions of PageRank.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm going to start with Fluid.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So there's going to be in this course both intuition and mathematics.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
A lot of intuition, a lot of mathematics too.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I'll give multiple ways of Fluid algorithm, random walk and matrix representation all for

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
the same algorithm.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then I'll give you some intuition on matrices and eigenvectors, eigenvalues, which maybe

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
you see hopefully you get good intuition here.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So in a PageRank there's only one value for each web page.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So it's a big directed graph on the web pages and each page has a value that is computed

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and the intuition is a page that is important, is pointed to by important pages and an important

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
page points to important pages.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So that's recursive.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That means there's a recursive iterative algorithm.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
First intuition is that it's kind of like a liquid, fluid.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Each web page or node is a container and the links are hives and you start by putting

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
a little bit of fluid in each of the web pages and then the fluid will circulate according

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
to some rules.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So if you have one liter, then one of our n liters is put in every page and then you

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
repeat.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So there's a link from P to P prime.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So each page P has links going out and if there's n links going out, maybe there's only

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
three links going out, each page, each link will get one third of the fluid.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The fluid is divided between that of links and then the next step, you look at the links

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
coming in and for each incoming link you take the fluid.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So you see the fluid circulates like that and eventually it converges.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So here's an example of web pages.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So there's eight pages here.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There's each page has one eighth.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So now the fluid circulates.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How does it work?

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well look at page A.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So page A has D going in, E going in, H going in, F going in, and G going in.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And so what happens is after one iteration, A has one eighth of a liter which leaves and

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
all the n links, the fluid comes in.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So D has one eighth of a liter but has two outgoing links.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So it's divided by two.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So you have one 16 coming from D.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
E has also two outgoing links.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So there's one 16 coming from E.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
H has no outgoing links.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So everything goes there.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So this is one eighth.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's H.

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
F has no outgoing links.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And G neither.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So there's both one eighth there.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's F and G.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So the total is three eighths, four eighths.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is one half.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's after one iteration.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's the same for all of them.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And you keep going until it converges.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And you can prove it converges, which we will do in a little bit.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And after you keep doing that, you get these numbers.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So A has four thirteenths, B has two thirteenths, D has one thirteenth, and so on.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So this is the result of the page rank.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's just this fixed point.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
A is the most important page here.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And D, H, E, F, and G are less important.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's the basic idea.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Of course there's a problem.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's not going to work if you do like that.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So this basic algorithm is nice, but it doesn't always work.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So we have to fix it.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So let's say we change the graph.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
F points to G and G points to F.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They don't point to A, they point to each other.

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So what happens now?

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The thing keeps circulating.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But look, all the fluid that comes in here never goes out.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You see that?

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It just will accumulate here.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
All the fluid will eventually, this part will empty, zero.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Everything will eventually come here.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
F and G will each get half.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
F and G has to get zero.

88
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's not good enough.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So you think, well, this is a stupid algorithm.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's very bad.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, the insight from the smart guys who made Google is,

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we can actually fix this problem.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So you see the problem now.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We can still use the fluid intuition to fix it.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Look at the Earth.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Water flows down, right?

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
First, everything goes into the ocean.

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But why does not everything stay in the ocean?

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Still, there's water on the mountains.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Because there's water also going up.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is called up by evaporation.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So it's kind of circulating.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So you have lakes in the mountains.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And that's what they do now for the pay track algorithm.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You can, the update rule.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So it's not just what fluid goes in.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
There's also fluid going out.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So you take the fluid, OK?

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So you make a scale at the end of the day.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You reduce the fluid in each page by some factor s,

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
like 0.9 or something.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And you add a little bit of fluid, 1 minus s over n, everywhere.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So even the pages very low, very low,

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
pay track will get some.

115
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So it's like a random jump, OK?

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So basically the pay track evaporates from each node.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And it rains uniformly on all nodes.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So that means we have now a cycle between all nodes.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And this fixes the problem, OK?

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So you have the basic update rule extended with scaling.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So this is the evaporation.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can show it with converges, which we will show in a while.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's matrix computation, which we'll show later.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And the real scaling factor is some number very close to 1, 0.8, 0.9.

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So that means most of the time the fluid stays on the page,

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
like a small percentage of the time it jumps when it evaporates, OK?

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And this definition, the fluid definition, is equivalent.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can say it's also kind of, you can formulate it as a random walk definition.

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This is maybe more intuitive for humans.

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's say you have somebody who is browsing the web randomly.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm looking at a web page, and then I click on the web page.

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So I jump from one page to the other.

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And I keep clicking, and I'm surfing for K steps.

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And then I get bored, and I don't get another page.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So it's like I'm walking randomly on the network, OK?

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And you walk K steps.

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And then you jump to some random page, you walk K steps.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Then you walk, jump, and you walk K steps.

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So this is the walking is exactly the page after K iterations.

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And the jump is the rain with the jumping to random page with probability 1 minus s, OK?

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So it turns out they're equivalent, which we'll see in a minute.

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
OK?

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So this is the basic algorithm.

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It was modified a lot, OK?

145
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So I won't say so much here, because we're going to go into the other slides.

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Search companies will cheat.

147
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
They don't call it cheating.

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
They call it search engine optimization, please, SEO.

149
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And if I want to be very high at the Google ranking, I pay SEO companies the money.

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And they will do some magic, and all of a sudden I get very high scores.

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And it works using something called link farms, which we'll explain.

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
OK?

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And also something we mentioned before is advertising.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So it's the links.

155
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You also have pay links.

156
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And Google makes huge money with that.

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
OK?

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So that's an extension.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
OK?

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So let me now go to the more in-detailed discussion of PageRank.

161
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So these slides are actually by a colleague of mine called Sarunas Gerzioskas,

162
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
who is, I think, from Lithuania, but he's now in Sweden, KTH.

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So he was very nice to get to these slides, which I modified a little.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So this goes into a lot of detail.

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
OK?

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
On different kind of things for PageRank.

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So first I want to give you intuition.

168
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We will go a little bit into the math, matrix representation for random walks,

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
the notion of eigenvalues.

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Then I will show the PageRank algorithm, how it works exactly, formally.

171
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And then we go beyond PageRank.

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
How can you search in a more focused way, topic specific,

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
or how you can find similar pages, using variation,

174
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
that say I'm looking for movies that are like this movie.

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
OK?

176
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So, for example, I like a lot the movie Doom,

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and I want to find movies that are like this movie.

178
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So with SimRank lets me do that.

179
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So it's similar.

180
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And the final thing is that I want to talk, I want to explain how the cheaters work.

181
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is called web spamming.

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So very quickly after Google invented the PageRank,

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the companies invented the ways to cheat.

184
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
OK?

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And this is called link farming.

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So I'll show you exactly how it works.

187
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And we'll figure out how can you increase the PageRank artificially.

188
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then I'll show you some algorithm called TrustRank to go bypass the cheaters.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
OK?

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So the first part of the talk is more general talk about random walks and matrices.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So this gives you kind of intuition on the mathematics.

192
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So I'm going to give you mathematics, but also intuition.

193
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So the first thing I want to talk about is random walks.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So here's a graph with vertices, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and edges connected to them.

195
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I want to do a random walk.

196
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That means I start somewhere.

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I've got node 1.

198
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I move to a neighboring node with some probability.

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
1 over d of v.

200
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So d is the degree of the vertex.

201
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's how many links there are.

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So the node 1 has a degree of 2.

203
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So there's one half probability of going on each of those links.

204
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And then I keep making walk steps.

205
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And the sequence of this technically is something called a Markov chain.

206
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm not going to give you so much theory, but it's basically a sequence where each step is chosen according to some probability.

207
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And there's no memory.

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I mean, it doesn't remember where it comes from.

209
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You just each step, it's there.

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It makes another jump, but it actually has no memory where it came from.

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So that's called Markov chain.

212
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay?

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So let's say we start at node 1.

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So here I make a table.

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So node 1 here.

216
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So in the beginning at time 0, I have one probability of being at node 1 and 0 for being everywhere else.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And then I do one step, but a two-step, three-step.

218
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And each step, I will walk randomly according to the links.

219
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay?

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So after one step, see how it works out, I will be either at node 2 or 3 with probability 50%.

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay?

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And then I keep going.

223
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So the 2 can go either to 1 or 4, and the 3 can go to 1, 4, or 5.

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So the 2, the 0.5, will be split between 1 and 4.

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And the node 3, the 50%, will be split between 1, 4, and 5.

226
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So 16% or 17% for each of them.

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So that gives me this.

228
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That means there's 42% chance of being at node 1.

229
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So where does this number come from?

230
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Well, it means I have a 25% chance coming from node 2 and a 17% chance of coming from node 3.

231
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And 25 plus 17 is 42.

232
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's very quick to pick up.

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Also being in node 4, I have a 42%.

234
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And node 5 is only one way to get there.

235
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's from 3 because I'm not getting 4.

236
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So there's a 1 over 6, so 17%, rounded into 2 decimals.

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And the sum of all these is normally going to be 1.

238
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Might be slightly different because of round off error, but it's supposed to be 1.

239
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay?

240
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So I keep going.

241
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can see now the numbers change.

242
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
After 3 steps, I will be in these places with these probabilities.

243
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And I keep going and I can keep going.

244
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
4, 5, 6.

245
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You see, eventually, it's like they're kind of converging, okay?

246
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
To some value.

247
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay?

248
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And it will converge.

249
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So the initial node, I started with node 1, but of course you can start with more nodes.

250
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
So here's a longer table.

251
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So you start from 0 up to the top and you keep going.

252
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And it kind of looks like it's converging, right?

253
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
17, 17, 25, 25, 17.

254
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How would you think?

255
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It seems to be, it smells like it's converging over.

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And it does actually converge.

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And you can prove for any connected, non-by-part, bi-directional graph at any starting point,

258
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
the random one converges.

259
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And now I want you to have intuition on this.

260
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The graph has to be connected, of course.

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If it's not connected, if it looks like this.

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So let's say the graph looks like this.

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There's two pieces.

264
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well, if I start here, I will never get there, okay?

265
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
For example.

266
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Or if I have a bi-part type graph.

267
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
See, depending on if I start here or if I start here, I will converge differently.

268
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So it's not really converging for any random starting point.

269
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
See, here I say any starting point, okay?

270
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So if the graph is not connected, then the convergence would be different depending on the starting point, right?

271
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So it has to be connected.

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So you have to understand, intuition is important.

273
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It has to be connected.

274
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It has to be non-by-part type.

275
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Because if it's bi-part type, then you can divide the graph into two pieces.

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If I start here, then I will go here and it will be oscillating forever.

277
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
All the probability will be here and this will be zero.

278
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And then it will all be here and all this will be zero.

279
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So it's oscillating and not converging.

280
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So that's why it has to be non-by-part type.

281
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
See that?

282
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So you have to understand this intuition, huh?

283
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So it's not just random words there, okay?

284
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So make sure you understand.

285
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Okay?

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And the unique is only one result.

287
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Unique stationary means that once you converge it never changes anymore, okay?

288
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So this is a kind of iteration, which we call power iteration.

289
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay?

290
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So this is the final value.

291
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
17, 17, 25, 25, 17.

292
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What are those numbers mean, actually?

293
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Actually, we can figure it out what they have to mean.

294
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
We can actually give a formula for this.

295
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The random walk.

296
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So pi is the final set of probabilities.

297
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And it's stationary, so it's staying the same.

298
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
D of V is the degree and M is the number of edges, okay, in the graph.

299
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So in this graph, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, edges.

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So 2M is 12.

301
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So 3 is the degree 3.

302
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
1, 2, 3.

303
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And 3 divided by 12 is 1, 4, 25%.

304
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's the coincidence, huh?

305
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So 2 has two outcome edges.

306
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
2 divided by 12 is 1, 6, which is 0.17.

307
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Amazing, huh?

308
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Isn't it?

309
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So we can prove that this has to be the right value.

310
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's actually very easy to prove, okay?

311
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
We can prove that this value is a fixed point.

312
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That means if you do one more iteration on this value, you get the same value.

313
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We start with pi, and we will do one iteration giving pi prime.

314
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay?

315
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And so how do you do that?

316
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Well, the new value is all the in-going links, okay?

317
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So for node V, we take all the links going from U to V.

318
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And from each one of those, we have the probability on U divided by the degree.

319
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
1 over D, okay?

320
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This one is du over 2m, and the du's cancel, so we get the sum of 1 over 2m, the links

321
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
coming from U to V.

322
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But how many links are there going from U to V?

323
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Well, it's exactly the degree of V.

324
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
How many links are going to this node?

325
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
1, 2, 3, okay?

326
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That means it's the degree of V divided by 2m.

327
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Pi prime is equal to pi.

328
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So you could show that it's the degree divided by 2m, right?

329
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We need that.

330
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Now, there's another thing.

331
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
If the graph is deregular.

332
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So deregular means that all the nodes have the same degree, D, everywhere.

333
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If it's like that, of course, then the probability is going to be the same everywhere, right?

334
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So uniform means it's the same.

335
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So if I have three links on every node, it's going to be the same, uniform.

336
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Okay, that's intuitive, right?

337
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So you have to get the intuition, okay?

338
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So this is just some numbers showing how it works.

339
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So the stationary distribution is proportional to the degree of V.

340
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The degree is how many links, okay?

341
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So what does that mean?

342
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
There's intuition.

343
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Well, it's pretty clear.

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The more neighbors you have, the more chance that people are going to come visit you.

345
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So the probability is higher.

346
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
See, that's kind of the intuition, okay?

347
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So you can see how the matrix, the random walk is going to work.

348
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Now, let's look at a more numerical form of representation, a matrix representation.

349
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We're going to do the same thing now with matrices.

350
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So here's my graph.

351
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So I'm going to keep using the same example.

352
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And that matrix called A is the adjacency matrix for this graph.

353
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What does it mean?

354
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Well, if you look at the rows, there's five rows and five columns.

355
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So if there's a link from one to two, that means there's a one in element one, two.

356
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So the first row, second column.

357
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So let me show you.

358
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So this link, one, two, means that there's from row one, there's a link to two here.

359
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
There's also a link from one to three.

360
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So row one, column three, there's a link here.

361
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And each row corresponds to one node, the origin, and the column corresponds to the destination, okay?

362
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So how many ones are there in that graph?

363
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
In this matrix, how many ones?

364
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You have one, two, three, four, five, six, six edges, huh?

365
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So how many ones are going to be in there?

366
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Two times.

367
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Because, of course, they go both directions.

368
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That's one to two, two to one.

369
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So you have twelve.

370
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
They're out.

371
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
See, it's very two to go.

372
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
So that's the first matrix called adjacency matrix.

373
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But now we want another matrix because we're going with probabilities.

374
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
We have a probability.

375
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So we want that to be in the matrix too.

376
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So first I want to do my special matrix called the diagonal matrix D.

377
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And each value on the diagonal is one over one over the degree.

378
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So for the first element, it's one over two, then one over two.

379
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Note three has three legs, so it's one over three.

380
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Note four has three legs, so it's one over three.

381
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And note five has two legs, so it's one over two.

382
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So why am I introducing this matrix?

383
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Because it lets me define another matrix, which is called the transition matrix.

384
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So this one is actually D times A.

385
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So what does it mean?

386
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Instead of ones, I now have probabilities.

387
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So if I have a row one, if I have a node one, it is one half probability I go to two,

388
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and one half probability I go to three.

389
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
See that?

390
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So in each row, all the elements tell me the probability they go to the other one.

391
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Question?

392
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yes.

393
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
In PageRank, we have a directed graph, correct?

394
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yes, we will get to that.

395
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So yes, I'm talking now, I'm directing graph, but we will get to directed graph,

396
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and you'll see what happens when we get there.

397
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's very interesting stuff, but you have to understand first this piece, this one, huh?

398
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

399
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
No problem, no problem.

400
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We get there, and you will see all the neat intuition that comes when the graph becomes directed.

401
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So here, I'm just giving you intuitions, okay?

402
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Because eventually, we're going to be talking to PageRank, and then I want you to understand that stuff, okay?

403
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So if you're in row two, you can go to row one, with probability half and a four with probability half.

404
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
If you're in two, you go to one or four.

405
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
See how it works, huh?

406
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So all the ones in a row are turned into probabilities.

407
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So the sum of the probabilities for each row is equal to one, huh?

408
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And this matrix is actually D times A.

409
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So there's two matrices that are really important here.

410
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The adjacency, which gives you the graph, and the transition matrix, which gives you the probabilities, okay?

411
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So formally, A is n by n adjacency matrix of the graph.

412
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:54,000
A, i, j is one if there's a link between nodes i and j, and otherwise it's zero, okay?

413
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Actually, you can say it gives me all the paths that you can do in one half, huh?

414
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Because you're making one connection, okay?

415
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The adjacency matrix.

416
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Now let's go do a little bit more intuition, and I'll show you and you'll see how neat the matrix representation is.

417
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Let's say I want to count two hop paths.

418
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I want to go one, two.

419
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
How many are there?

420
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
From a node, I want to go two hops instead of one.

421
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You know it's so neat.

422
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's just A squared when you do matrix multiplication.

423
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The A times A, the matrix multiplication, gives me the number of two hop paths, okay?

424
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And A cubed, what does A cubed mean less?

425
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Well, the number of three hop paths, okay?

426
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So how does that work?

427
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Well, I'll give you some intuition.

428
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Okay, a small technical thing.

429
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's actually giving you walks.

430
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Sorry, I have to be technical about graphs.

431
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
A path is when you don't repeat any vertices, so it's like the marking on the street.

432
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Whereas a walk is like a person walking back and forth, so you can actually repeat vertices, okay?

433
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So actually, we're counting walks, okay, to be very technical.

434
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We're counting walks, okay?

435
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So how does it work?

436
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Actually, you have to make a diagram and a fingerprint and understand why the matrix multiplication gives you that.

437
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Okay?

438
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So let's say I want to do A times A.

439
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Okay, A times A.

440
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And here I have a row, row I, and here I have a column.

441
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Okay?

442
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Okay?

443
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So, and here I have 1's and 0's up.

444
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
For example, some way, and this will give me element i, j, a, l.

445
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So how does it work?

446
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So these are, the one means you have one hoppa from i to 1 to center hoppa.

447
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So how does the multiplication work?

448
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
1 times 0 plus 0 times 1 plus 1 times 0 plus 1 times 1.

449
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Well, how does it, what does it mean in terms of hops?

450
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Here I'm going from i to 1.

451
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And here I'm going from 1 to j.

452
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You see that?

453
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So I go from i to 1 and then from 1 to j.

454
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Then I go from i to 2 and from 2 to j.

455
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
From i to n and to j.

456
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So each one of these combinations is going from i to j, but the node in the middle is different.

457
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You see that?

458
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And it's only going to be 1 if there's both 1's.

459
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
That means if I have a path from i to 2 and 2 to j, it's going to multiply 1 times 1.

460
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So it's only 1 if the number, if there's actually a path there or a walkup.

461
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So if you sum them all, it gives me all the possible walks from i to j with 2 hops.

462
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And if here, and it keeps going like that, if you put the matrix here which gives you n hops,

463
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
then you hear you will add one more and you get n plus 1.

464
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Do you see how it works?

465
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So the matrix multiplication gives you the total number of walks.

466
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Okay?

467
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So what if you take the vector now, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 and you multiply by a?

468
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Well, it's like you start, okay?

469
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You're starting from 1, or 0, or 0, or 0, or 0.

470
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So the number of walks, the one where you start from is 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.

471
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's given by that.

472
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:01,000
So basically it tells you how many walks of length 1 that start from node 1, ending in node i.

473
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Okay?

474
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And you could do multiplication for that.

475
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
See how matrix multiplication is really neat, huh?

476
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So v a squared, it gives you 2, 0, 0, 2, 1.

477
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So now we have 2 walks going from node 1 ending up in node 1, or 2 walks from node 1 ending up in node 4.

478
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Okay?

479
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
See what's neat, huh?

480
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And 3 gives you how many walks of length?

481
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
3.

482
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And it's all the same, I'm always talking about this one, huh?

483
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And you see how the matrix really corresponds very nicely to graphs and doing things on graphs, okay?

484
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Okay?

485
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So far we did the adjacency matrix.

486
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
What about the random walk matrix, the transition matrix?

487
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
That's this one.

488
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And with the probabilities, okay?

489
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
So this gives you the probability of ending up somewhere.

490
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Okay?

491
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
If you start in node 1, the probability of ending in here is one-half.

492
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The probability of ending in node 4 is zero.

493
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And you could do squares.

494
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So for example, if you keep going,

495
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
if you take this vector here and multiply again by m,

496
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
the number you get here is actually the probability that you end up in those nodes when you start with node 1.

497
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It's neat, huh?

498
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Question? No? It's okay?

499
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So you can see how matrices and graphs are very close.

500
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So this is going to help us understand page rank, yeah?

501
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Okay?

502
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So we have a random walk on a graph G.

503
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Now we start doing random walks on that page rank.

504
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
We start at node v0, and after t steps, we end up in node vt.

505
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
We move to a neighbor with probability one over the degree.

506
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Each time we go to a node, if there's multiple paths, we divide evenly, yeah?

507
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And the chain of random nodes, it's what's called a Markov chain.

508
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So a Markov chain is a sequence where whenever you make one step,

509
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
you make kind of random choice, some probabilities,

510
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
but you forget everything you did before.

511
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It only depends where you are now, so there's no memory, okay?

512
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So the initial state would be here, so you have probability one being node 1, okay?

513
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Now you can do multiple steps.

514
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So after t steps, the probabilities is given by this vector, pt, p0 times m power t.

515
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So this is matrix exponential, matrix multiplications, huh?

516
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
See how it works, huh?

517
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:24,000
If you're a stickler for doing the m on the left, you have to do transpose, of course.

518
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That means you have row mixes here, but that's a detail, okay?

519
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So here we have pt is p0 times m to the t, and we start again with our matrix,

520
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and we start with the 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, and we do one step.

521
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So we have probabilities a half and a half for getting there, okay?

522
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And then keep it doing again, and we keep going.

523
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And eventually, I mean, it's going to converge.

524
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Remember, I showed you the table, but we're doing the same thing here, huh?

525
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So when pt plus 1 is equal to pt, we have reached a stationary distribution.

526
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
So let me call this vector pi, okay?

527
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's not 3.4, and I have not chosen this notation,

528
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
but this is what Sylvonez has chosen.

529
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
So pi times m is equal to pi.

530
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Stationary, when we start with these probabilities, we make a step,

531
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
we end up with the same probabilities, okay?

532
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
See that?

533
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You remember the notion of eigenvectors, have you seen that?

534
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Well, this is an eigenvector, either young.

535
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Remember, every matrices have special vectors called eigenvectors

536
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
that give some property in the matrix.

537
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So v is an eigenvector of m, and lambda is the eigenvalue

538
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
if v times m is equal to lambda, which is a scalar number times v.

539
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's just scaling the v.

540
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So this one is clearly an eigenvector, right?

541
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Interesting, huh?

542
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So pt is connected to eigenvectors.

543
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Pi is an eigenvector of m with eigenvalue lambda equal to 1, okay?

544
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Okay, so that's the first part.

545
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Let me go on now.

546
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Let me go on now by giving you some more intuition

547
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
on eigenvectors and eigenvalues in terms of graphs.

548
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So eigenvectors and eigenvalues are very useful things,

549
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
but with graphs they have some really neat properties.

550
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So remember this, okay?

551
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
This is what we just saw.

552
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,000
We have pi as an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.

553
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But we can actually say more things, okay?

554
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
There's something called the spectrum of a matrix.

555
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm not sure if you saw that.

556
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Have you seen that?

557
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Have you seen that spectrum?

558
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Yes? Good.

559
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
That means this will be very easy, right?

560
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
No?

561
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So assume now, now I'm going to give you some intuition.

562
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Assume you have a D regular graph.

563
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So that's a graph where all the nodes have a degree of D.

564
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So there are all three things coming out, for example.

565
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Okay?

566
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And now we have a, which is the adjacency matrix for this.

567
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So a times x, okay?

568
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So this is just a matrix multiplication of a times vector x

569
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
equal vector y, okay?

570
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And an eigenvector, this is refresher.

571
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:20,000
An eigenvector is a vector x such that this is equal to some number times that, okay?

572
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So what happens with degree D?

573
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Now we're going to connect the eigenvalues, eigenvectors with graphs, okay?

574
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Graphs, which are these visual topological things, like on the web.

575
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
And matrices, which is just a bunch of numbers.

576
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
How does it connect?

577
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Suppose all the nodes have degree D and G is connected.

578
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So it's a D regular graph, huh?

579
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Okay.

580
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
What are some eigenvalues?

581
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Well, let's try.

582
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Let's say we try to vector y, y, y, y only once, this graph, okay?

583
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Then a times x will be D, D into all the D's.

584
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Because each node has three outgoing things, but also three incoming things.

585
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So the number of ways of going into a node is D.

586
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So that means D is an eigenvalue.

587
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So if you have a graph with only degree D, well D is an eigenvalue.

588
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So eigenvalue is somehow connected with the degree of the graph.

589
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
It's funny, huh?

590
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Interesting, huh?

591
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Okay.

592
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So the vector of all the nodes has an eigenvalue of D, okay?

593
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
This is actually what's called the principal eigenvector.

594
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But let's look at some other graphs.

595
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So the D regular graph is a very simple uniform graph.

596
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Let's look at some other ones.

597
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Very interesting, okay?

598
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
In general.

599
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Now, there's a concept called spectrograph of a graph.

600
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So if we have now a matrix A, a JCC represents a graph.

601
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
V times A is equal to lambda times V.

602
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Well, if it's a column vector, you can say A V is lambda V.

603
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Here we have row vectors.

604
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So if A is a real symmetric matrix, so for non-directed graphs it's symmetric,

605
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
real numbers, then it has n eigenvectors and n eigenvalues.

606
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And all the eigenvalues are real numbers.

607
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And you could order them.

608
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Lambda 1 and lambda 2 up to lambda n.

609
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
That's something you can show.

610
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

611
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So they're orthogonal to each other.

612
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And if G is a D regular graph, then lambda 1 is equal to D.

613
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Somehow, degree of the graph is connected to the eigenvalue.

614
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Okay?

615
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
For a random walk matrix, which is not the degree of D,

616
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
which is a random walk matrix, you have normalized.

617
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
This is the one where you have probabilities.

618
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
The principal eigenvalue is 1.

619
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Here you have probabilities.

620
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's not that JCC, yeah?

621
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It's the probabilities that eigenvalue is 1.

622
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Okay?

623
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
This I will skip.

624
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
There is another concept called graph laplation,

625
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
but I would not use it.

626
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
But Saruna wants to tell you about it,

627
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
but I'm not going to tell you about it.

628
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And the set of all the eigenvalues is called the spectra of the graph.

629
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Okay?

630
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And this could be for the A, JCC,

631
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
or the transition probability matrix M,

632
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
or the L matrix, which I'm not talking about.

633
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And there's a very interesting number called

634
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
the difference between lambda 1 and lambda 2.

635
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So lambda 1 is the principal eigenvalue,

636
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
but lambda 2 is also interesting.

637
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And there's a number where lambda 1 minus lambda 2,

638
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
which has a name, which is called the eigengap,

639
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
or the spectral gap.

640
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Okay?

641
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And for N, it's 1 minus lambda 2,

642
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
because lambda 1 is equal to 1.

643
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Okay?

644
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Fine.

645
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
What if the graph is disconnected?

646
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Okay, now we're going to show some examples

647
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
to make more pure intuition,

648
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
and that will all help for later

649
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
when we start thinking of the paint track.

650
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Okay?

651
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
What happens if the graph is disconnected?

652
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Well, lambda 1 is equal to lambda 2.

653
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That's weird enough.

654
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
If the graph is disconnected,

655
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,000
you could actually say something about these two highest eigenvalues.

656
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Okay?

657
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
So let's see how it works.

658
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So now I'm going to give you some intuition.

659
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So let's say we have a graph that's not connected.

660
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Two components.

661
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Each one is deregular, just for simplicity.

662
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
So each one has the same number of names.

663
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So we can have two little triangles.

664
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
So what are some eigenvalues for this?

665
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Well, for example,

666
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
if you put 1's on the A,

667
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and 0's on the B,

668
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
then you get a vector, right?

669
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.

670
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Or you can put 1's on the B,

671
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
and 0's on the A, right?

672
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So if you put 1's on the A,

673
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
and 0's on the B,

674
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and you multiply by A,

675
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
A times x prime here,

676
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
you add up all the degrees.

677
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So you get d, d, d, d with 0's.

678
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That means d is an eigenvalue.

679
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But you also have another vector,

680
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
orthogonal, 0's and 1's on the B,

681
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
and it also gives d, d, d, d, d, d.

682
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So you have two separate eigenvalues

683
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
that are the same.

684
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Okay?

685
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Notice if the degree would be different for me,

686
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
we would have different values.

687
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
We would have d1 and d2.

688
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
We would have d for both.

689
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So they're the same.

690
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And you can kind of do approximation now.

691
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So we saw that if you have this,

692
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
the eigenvalues are the same.

693
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
You have two eigenvalues that are the same.

694
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Now assume that it's almost,

695
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
almost disconnected.

696
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
We only have a small number of links here.

697
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Well, it turns out,

698
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
lambda 1 and lambda 2 will be very close to each other.

699
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It will be approximately 0.

700
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So you can see that the connectedness

701
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
are somehow related to the eigenvalues.

702
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Okay?

703
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Okay.

704
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
For every connected,

705
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
normal bipartite, undirected graph,

706
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
the distribution converges to a limit.

707
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Okay?

708
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
A unique stationary distribution, pi,

709
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and it's regular, it's uniform.

710
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Okay?

711
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Why connected?

712
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I mentioned already, yeah?

713
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
The graph has to be connected.

714
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
What happens if it's not connected?

715
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
What happens if it's not connected?

716
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You see, I explained it already.

717
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
In case that you don't have one,

718
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
you need stationary distribution then.

719
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
You can have one or another one.

720
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Okay?

721
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
What if it's bipartite?

722
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Then you will have all the probabilities on one side,

723
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
so you can divide the graph into two sides.

724
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
All the probabilities on one side are not 0.

725
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
The other side is 0s,

726
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and if you do one step, it all shifts to the other side,

727
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and you have oscillation.

728
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
There's no convergence.

729
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And what about directed graphs?

730
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And now we've got to start going to directed graphs.

731
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
So now your body needs to be tuition.

732
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
What about directed graphs?

733
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Okay?

734
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So here's a directed graph.

735
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It turns out the directed graph

736
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
has to be strongly connected.

737
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Remember, we said what it means, huh?

738
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That means there is a directed path

739
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
and it knows another.

740
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
What happens if it's not strongly connected?

741
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh, you have to have intuition there.

742
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
So an example of that in the beginning.

743
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
If it's not strongly connected,

744
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
then they say walks will leak.

745
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It means that if it's not strongly connected,

746
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
what happens?

747
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Okay?

748
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
There's one thing.

749
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Here's another one.

750
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Notice this graph here.

751
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So this one on the left is strongly connected.

752
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So we're good.

753
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
The right one is also strongly connected.

754
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
No, this one is not strongly connected.

755
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But this one has another problem.

756
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
It's not...

757
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You have actually two cycles going like this.

758
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Okay?

759
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And this is a property called periodicity.

760
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Huh?

761
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
A, the graph has to be A periodic.

762
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So this is kind of generalizing by part-time.

763
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Done.

764
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Visits to some of should never be a multiple of some number.

765
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So here, visits will be multiple of three steps.

766
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Always.

767
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Well, if you do that, the whole thing's going to oscillate.

768
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Done.

769
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Okay?

770
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So if you do that, the whole thing will oscillate.

771
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And so it's not going to be convergent.

772
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
So it has to be A periodic.

773
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
If you don't, you're not allowed to have that.

774
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Okay?

775
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
So the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all the cycles is one.

776
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So you can see some intuition here about the graph.

777
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Okay.

778
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:11,000
So all of that was kind of preliminary stuff to get your neurons moving.

779
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And now that we can start talking about page rank.

780
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Okay?

781
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So now I'm going to talk about mobile page rank.

782
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So first, I'll give you a little history of what search.

783
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So this all started a long time ago in prehistory.

784
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Another millennium.

785
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
1989, okay, which is a long time ago.

786
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It's really super long ago.

787
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It's like, before the prince was born or something.

788
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
So here you have the first generation of search.

789
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So you have people who are making web pages.

790
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And people want to search them.

791
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
The first generation was manual curation.

792
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So Yahoo!, which started back in those days.

793
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:12,000
There was little gnomes or monks sat in an office looking at all the web pages and kind of making directories.

794
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And I went science.

795
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I click on science.

796
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
It's trun.

797
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Okay?

798
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Yeah, but that's kind of not scalable.

799
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Okay?

800
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So then now we have second generation.

801
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And there was a very nice one called Alfa Vista, which you have probably never used, which I used.

802
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
And this was classical information retrieval.

803
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So basically they look at the text in the pages.

804
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
If there's lots of words on astronomy, then it's based on, then it's astronomy.

805
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Okay?

806
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And then the indices.

807
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But this didn't work very well.

808
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And it was, and it was spammed.

809
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
People did something called term spam.

810
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It was very easy to cheat from this.

811
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And then the third generation came.

812
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And it basically took over.

813
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
This was Google Page Drive.

814
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Okay?

815
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So this is the short history of web search.

816
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Okay?

817
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:17,000
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to explain Google Page Drive.

818
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And we're going to use all our intuition on graphs and matrices and all that stuff

819
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
to really see how to design it and not to make it work.

820
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Okay?

821
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
But as noticed, it's three o'clock, so we're going to make a break first.

822
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Okay?

823
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Design Page Drive.

824
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And we're going to use some of the intuition we saw before the break.

825
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Okay?

826
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
So we have a bunch of pages.

827
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And here we're talking about votes.

828
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So it's like the fluid that you have above.

829
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And you distribute the votes to outgoing links.

830
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Okay?

831
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So if a page J has some quotes, rj, and n outlink, each link gets rj over n.

832
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Okay?

833
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So that's here.

834
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And so pages will vote.

835
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
So the idea is that the more votes you get, the more important you are.

836
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
It's like in an election.

837
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
And if your page is important, then you have more votes, rj is more.

838
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So a vote from an important page is more.

839
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So that's like what we saw before.

840
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Okay?

841
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And the importance of a page is the sum of the votes, the inlinks.

842
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So the other pages then vote for it.

843
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Okay?

844
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So this is something we saw, kind of.

845
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Okay?

846
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
This is actually very similar to random one.

847
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So we can actually say that a Google Page Drive is the principal driving vector of the transition matrix of the web graph.

848
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Okay?

849
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So you have the web graph, which is huge, billions of links.

850
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So the matrices are very big.

851
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Okay?

852
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So we're going to compute this.

853
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:31,000
We're going to compute the eigenvector of a matrix, which is 10 billion by 10 billion on the side.

854
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
That makes how many elements inside that matrix?

855
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Well, 10 to the 20th elements in there.

856
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So that's a lot, right?

857
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So can you see any issues with that?

858
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Well, I mean, not so many computers can store 10 to the 20.

859
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Okay?

860
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That's one issue.

861
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
But there's more issues.

862
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So we're trying to make it practical now, aren't we?

863
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So one issue is the matrix is huge.

864
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
The other issue is, well, remember this diagram?

865
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
This is the structure of the web.

866
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Well, in order for there to be a unique stationary distribution, it has to be a strongly connected component.

867
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So is this thing a strongly connected component?

868
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
No.

869
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I mean, there's one inside, but it's not.

870
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So that's a problem, okay?

871
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
That's another problem.

872
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's not strongly connected.

873
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
So it's a directional graph.

874
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So here, for example, so there's two problems.

875
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
So the Google people have some very nice terminology for this.

876
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So here we have a node which only has inlinks and no outlinks.

877
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
So this one is called a dead end.

878
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
We set dead end, and we saw it already before the break.

879
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So you can say the votes leak out.

880
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Everything collects there, and there's no, they're not circulating anymore.

881
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
That's one problem.

882
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Or another issue.

883
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So here's another graph.

884
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
So this graph has a problem too.

885
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Can you see what the problem is here?

886
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So here you have three nodes.

887
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
So the Google people call this a spider trap.

888
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Something that traps spiders.

889
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I'm not sure why they call it a spider trap, but it's called a spider trap.

890
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
That's another problem.

891
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
So the votes disappear.

892
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
They all collect there.

893
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
They're no longer circulating.

894
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And of course it's not strongly connected.

895
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
So again, these are all problems we have to fix.

896
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Okay?

897
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
So how do we fix it?

898
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Well, we have to fix the graph.

899
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
We have to make it strongly connected and empiric.

900
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Those were the two positions.

901
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Strongly connected and empiric.

902
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
The solution of Google.

903
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Okay?

904
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
This is very similar to the evaporation idea.

905
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:30,000
If you make very, very small leaks from every node to every other node.

906
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
So this is the evaporation.

907
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:39,000
It means there's a small probability of jumping from any node to any other node.

908
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
But the main graph is still the same.

909
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So here's your main graph.

910
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Then you have another graph with very tiny, tiny probabilities.

911
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
But between every node and every node is very tiny.

912
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And you basically sum them together.

913
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Okay?

914
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So it's got very nice innovation and it turns into that.

915
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Okay?

916
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
So the idea is that you have a random walk.

917
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And when you're at a node, you will either follow the link or you will jump.

918
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So it's basically the evaporation idea.

919
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Some probability here, if you call it beta, you follow the real link.

920
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
And with one minus beta, you just jump to some random page.

921
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Okay?

922
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And usually it's very close to one.

923
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Now, that means close to the time, you keep following links.

924
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But at one step to five or ten links, you jump.

925
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So it's like you walk for five steps and you jump.

926
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So if you're in a spider trap going in a circle,

927
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
after five to ten steps, you will jump out from the spider trap.

928
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Okay?

929
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So if you go to a dead end, once you're in the dead end, there's no way of getting out.

930
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So you will immediately jump out.

931
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:11,000
So dead end is a little bit special because there's no link going out.

932
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
So the only way to get out is to teleport.

933
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Okay?

934
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So if you're a dead end, you're always going to teleport.

935
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
So here's my graph.

936
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So here's my transition matrix for this graph.

937
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
But this graph has maybe problems.

938
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
We don't know. Maybe you have spider traps dead ends.

939
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So we have another graph with very small values.

940
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Okay?

941
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Here they're not so small because you only have five nodes.

942
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,000
But if I have ten billion nodes, the value of each one of these numbers will be less than one over ten billion.

943
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Okay?

944
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
So this is what we call the teleportation matrix.

945
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:00,000
So you will combine these two matrices to get a new transition matrix.

946
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Okay?

947
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Combine them so you make the sum of them.

948
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
So this one is the matrix as you will do with the probability beta.

949
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So this is the step.

950
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And the teleportation, you will do with one minus beta.

951
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Okay? And then you combine them.

952
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Notice you combine them.

953
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So this one is beta times this one.

954
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Plus one minus beta times this.

955
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Except here you have one.

956
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And not one minus beta.

957
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Well that's because it's a dead end.

958
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
You can't get out here.

959
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Here there's nothing here.

960
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
So that means for the dead ends, you have to have an immediate teleport.

961
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Okay?

962
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
There you have to have an immediate teleport.

963
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
So you have one minus beta if these are not all zeros.

964
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
But if it's zero you have to get out from node one.

965
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Okay?

966
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So that gives me this matrix here.

967
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Notice this one, second row.

968
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Here it's zeros.

969
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
That means you don't get out.

970
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Here there you're stuck.

971
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
But you have to give it probabilities that add to one.

972
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Okay?

973
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So that means you have to multiply this teleportation matrix by one.

974
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
So that gives you one fourth probability to go into any other node.

975
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Okay?

976
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Okay, fine.

977
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Is it fixed?

978
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Well if beta is zero it doesn't work.

979
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
But we assume beta is never going to be zero.

980
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
But there's still other problems to make it really work.

981
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Okay?

982
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So you have this huge matrix.

983
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:02,000
How does the matrix, the paycheck matrix look if you have ten billion pages?

984
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Pretty big, huh?

985
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Dense matrix.

986
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
All the elements are basically non-zero.

987
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Most of them are non-zero.

988
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
N squared, non-zero elements.

989
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
That's a lot.

990
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It's not N.

991
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
It's not the number of nodes times the degree.

992
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
It's N squared.

993
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So okay, the Google people were scratching their head and saying,

994
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,000
how do we implement this ten billion by ten billion matrix?

995
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Can you even store it in memory?

996
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
How much memory would you need for that matrix?

997
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
What about the, can you store it in memory?

998
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
What do you think?

999
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Is there a system in today that could store a matrix like that?

1000
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
No one.

1001
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I mean ten billion by ten billion, that's ten to the twentieth elements.

1002
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Even Google today doesn't have like that kind of storage, okay?

1003
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So the fix is you have to be smart as usual.

1004
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Question?

1005
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:16,000
If the universe doesn't contain enough atoms to store the geometry?

1006
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I might, sure.

1007
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Probably if you had a computer the size of the earth you could store it though.

1008
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Because sometimes we say there's ten to the seventy-six particles in the universe.

1009
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So yeah, you're fine. If you have the universe you can store it though.

1010
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I don't have the universe in my pocket.

1011
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
So I can't store it.

1012
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
So the idea is to be a little bit smart.

1013
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
The idea is not to add the teleportation to every single number,

1014
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:55,000
but to kind of keep it separate, okay?

1015
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
So here you have, this is the computation you're doing.

1016
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
You have some vector.

1017
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
You multiply by a paint rank.

1018
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And you're basically looking for eigenvalue convergence of this thing, huh?

1019
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But you don't want to store this matrix. It's to big.

1020
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
So what you do is you keep this one, the original one,

1021
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,000
which does not have all, which has lots of zeros, does not have the teleportation.

1022
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
And the teleportation is added only after that.

1023
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So this is like a tax, okay?

1024
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It's basically because it's always the same for every node.

1025
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It doesn't depend on the node.

1026
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
That means you could add it in separately, okay?

1027
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
So this is like one minus theta over n.

1028
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And so in that way you don't actually have to store ten to the twenty elements.

1029
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
The matrix is sparse, okay?

1030
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,000
This matrix, the number of elements, is basically similar to the number of edges, okay?

1031
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So it's much, much less, okay?

1032
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
M is what's called a sparse matrix.

1033
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So most of the entries in the M are zeros.

1034
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
You can implement it much more efficiently, okay?

1035
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Okay?

1036
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Of course you have to handle the dead ends, okay?

1037
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Be careful with the dead ends because you have to jump out.

1038
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
For the dead ends, it's not one minus theta.

1039
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
You have to be careful because you need to jump out one over n for the dead ends, huh?

1040
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Okay?

1041
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And then you get something nice.

1042
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
So you get this nice figure.

1043
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Each of the nodes here is proportional to the page rank.

1044
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So B and C are very important.

1045
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And E is not important.

1046
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
So what?

1047
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Okay.

1048
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Okay, so that's the basic page rank.

1049
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:58,000
But once people invent page rank, there's actually lots of extras that people want to do.

1050
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
So there's still kind of problems and we'll talk about some of them.

1051
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:10,000
The first thing is that page rank measures the popularity in general of the page.

1052
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
How popular is the page?

1053
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
But maybe I'm only interested in stamp collecting

1054
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and I want to know what is the best page for stamp collecting

1055
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
and I'm not interested in, in general, popularity.

1056
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Maybe there's not so many people doing stamp collecting

1057
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and there's many more people interested in Kalashnikov machine guns than stamps.

1058
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So there would be no stamp pages who had much less popularity.

1059
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So you want maybe a page rank that knows about topics.

1060
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Okay, so we'll explain that a little bit.

1061
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And another thing is you can take this, you can also have used page rank to find similarities.

1062
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
That's important if I, for example, if I'm looking for pictures,

1063
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I'm looking for pictures of trees, for example, and I have this very nice palm tree

1064
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
and I want similar pictures, you can use a similar algorithm than this

1065
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
to find similarity, similar pages.

1066
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
That's nice, okay, that's one thing.

1067
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That's, that's making it very specific.

1068
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Another problem is spam, okay, it's possible to spam or to cheat on the page rank

1069
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
and this is called web spanning and you can do things like live farms

1070
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
and there's a way around that.

1071
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
You have to somehow know what are trusted pages.

1072
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
So there's an algorithm called trust rank.

1073
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:51,000
And finally, the Hudson authorities, we, there's two kinds of importance.

1074
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
There's the pages that are important, but also the pages that lead to important pages.

1075
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
So page rank only has one measure.

1076
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Okay, so that we saw last time.

1077
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,000
But I'm going to talk about these two, topic specific and web spamming.

1078
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So beyond page rank, first it's topic specific.

1079
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:21,000
So I have some graph here with the heavy notes and the heavy links and the light links.

1080
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
But I'm interested in some kind of topic.

1081
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:30,000
So I want only to look at the good pages in a particular topic.

1082
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
So how do I do that?

1083
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I have to give more influence to pages that are close to some topic.

1084
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
And the way to fix that is you change how you teleport.

1085
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Instead of teleporting to any random page, you teleport to pages that are kind of rubbed,

1086
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
okay, that have something to do with sports or spam collecting.

1087
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:03,000
But once you know that you have the teleport set, you change the teleport set,

1088
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
you can still use the regular page rank.

1089
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So that works really well for the topic specific element.

1090
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Okay, how do we get this teleport set?

1091
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Well, there's different ways.

1092
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
You can use classic techniques from older search engines.

1093
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:33,000
You can look at the contents of the pages for that, okay?

1094
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,000
You could also look at who is making the query, okay?

1095
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
You could look at browsing history, okay?

1096
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Find type Manchester, what do I mean?

1097
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Do I mean football team or do I mean the city Manchester?

1098
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Well, it depends on my browsing history, maybe, okay?

1099
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
So there's many ways to do that kind of stuff, okay?

1100
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
And that's how topics specific works.

1101
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Another way you can extend the page rank is measuring similarity or proximity.

1102
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
So here's an example.

1103
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Let's say we have this graph here.

1104
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Look at these two notes, one and four.

1105
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
How close are they?

1106
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Some sets, or seven and one.

1107
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
How close is it?

1108
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Because the shortest path is the same.

1109
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
One, two.

1110
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
But maybe four is closer because there's more paths.

1111
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Maybe four is closer to one than seven.

1112
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Because seven is only one path, okay?

1113
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Multiple two-out paths.

1114
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Only one path from one to seven, okay?

1115
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
So that's one way of extending it.

1116
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
So this is called sim rank.

1117
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
So here's another example.

1118
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I have four pictures and I want to show how similar are these pictures.

1119
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
So picture one has a house and a tree.

1120
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Picture two has a house and a mountain.

1121
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Picture three has a house and a tree.

1122
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And four has a tree and a mountain.

1123
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
So which pictures are similar to picture one?

1124
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
How similar is picture one to four, okay?

1125
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Or maybe there's ones that are closer.

1126
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
One to three might be closer because they're both having a house and a tree.

1127
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
So we can use something like patron to figure that out, okay?

1128
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
So this is kind of like topic-specific.

1129
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Again, we want to bias the telechord sets.

1130
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And recapitulate the page rank.

1131
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So it's a kind of variation on the page rank.

1132
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
So the idea is that the telechord set is the node itself.

1133
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
So the node is closest to itself, okay?

1134
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Usually the telechord set is all relevant nodes.

1135
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
But here the node is the one closest to itself, okay?

1136
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
So that's one way that you modify the page rank.

1137
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
You make random walks from a fixed node, okay?

1138
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And then you can do things like, here's an example with authors,

1139
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
conferences, and tags.

1140
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
So articles, authors, people writing articles on this.

1141
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
So this you do it for all nodes.

1142
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
This is actually used in the website called pinterest.

1143
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
You may be using it for recognition.

1144
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
They use something like this, okay?

1145
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:51,000
So this is also known as page rank with restarts.

1146
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
So here's the example with the pictures.

1147
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
So what is the most related picture to picture one?

1148
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Okay?

1149
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
You have your telechord set which is picture one.

1150
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
And you do your random walks with the restart.

1151
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And the result of this is going to be picture three, okay?

1152
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,000
So if you look here, here you have your graph with seven nodes.

1153
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Here you have your transition matrix, okay?

1154
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And now you do the convergence of this, okay?

1155
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And you can see, notice you have two groups.

1156
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
You have the pics, the four, the four pics on the top

1157
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,000
and the three attributes on the bottom, okay?

1158
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:44,000
So you compute the page rank matrix.

1159
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
And you can see that here you can do the restart, okay?

1160
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
On pic one.

1161
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
So from pic one, you go one, two, three, four,

1162
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
attack the telechords.

1163
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:06,000
And here you have the three things on the bottom, okay?

1164
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And the result is that pic one and pic three are going to be the closest

1165
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
when you converge this, okay?

1166
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
That's one way of extending page rank.

1167
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And in this other example, when I note one,

1168
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
you can see that one and four are pretty close, 0.24,

1169
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
but no seven is farther away, 0.07, okay?

1170
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:37,000
So basically doing the page rank with the restart, okay?

1171
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
So that gives us three kind of variations of page rank.

1172
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It's a normal page rank, which teleports randomly.

1173
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
We have the topic-specific page rank,

1174
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
which teleports to pages that are relevant,

1175
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and we have the same rank, which always teleports to the same node

1176
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
for finding similar notes.

1177
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,000
So these are three different ways of using page rank, okay?

1178
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So now the final thing I want to say is web spamming.

1179
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
How do you, you can cheat on page rank, okay?

1180
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
What is web spamming?

1181
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:27,000
So web spamming is a deliberate action to boost a web page in ranking.

1182
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And there's lots of these web, there's lots of spam pages, okay,

1183
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,000
which are created only to appear your rank results that should not be there.

1184
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
So this thing, like I mentioned before, has a very dignified name

1185
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
called search engine optimization, but it's basically cheating.

1186
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So Google has spent a lot of effort combating this.

1187
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
So let me talk a little bit about cheating.

1188
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
How do you cheat on the web?

1189
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
In the early search engines, how did they work?

1190
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So they crawl the web, they look at all the pages, they index the pages,

1191
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
and they respond to queries with your pages containing words.

1192
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
That's the old names that go for page rank, yeah.

1193
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
That's very easy to cheat there.

1194
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
How do you measure the importance?

1195
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Well, in the early search engines, you look how many times the words are there,

1196
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
or what is the header, if the header words, okay?

1197
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
So of course it's very easy to cheat, you do that.

1198
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
So as people began to use search engines, there were companies

1199
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
that tried to exploit it to cheat.

1200
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
So here's an example.

1201
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:53,000
So I'm selling shirts, and I want lots of people to come to my website.

1202
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
So I want to pretend that my website is about movies.

1203
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
So how do I do that?

1204
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Well, I use a technique.

1205
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
For the early search engines, it was pretty easy, okay?

1206
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
How do I make my page appear to be about movies?

1207
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
It's very easy.

1208
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I add the word movies a thousand times to my page,

1209
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
but I make it so it's white so nobody sees it,

1210
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
and search engines will see it, yeah.

1211
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And can you also spam on the importance of your page?

1212
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Yeah, this is before page rank, yeah.

1213
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
So this doesn't work anymore now, giving it for history.

1214
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But there's also a way to spam page rank,

1215
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
which I explained in a few minutes.

1216
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
It's just called link farms, okay?

1217
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
In other ways, you run the query movie,

1218
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
you see what is the page that came first.

1219
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
So that's the important page, and you take the text of that page,

1220
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
you just copy it into your cheat.

1221
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:02,000
This is called term spam, okay?

1222
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
So Google made a solution to that.

1223
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Instead of using the words in the page,

1224
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
use the words in the link to the page,

1225
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
which is called the anchor text and the surrounding text,

1226
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
so what people say about the new.

1227
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And of course, use page rank to measure the importance.

1228
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So with page rank, the short seller doesn't work.

1229
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
His technique doesn't work anymore.

1230
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
It doesn't matter if the short seller puts the word movies in his pages,

1231
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
because no movie pages are going to link to this page, okay?

1232
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So he's not going to be ranked high for movies, or even for shirts.

1233
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
But you can cheat on this.

1234
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:57,000
And this is called link farms, okay?

1235
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Okay, so let's say the short seller, he creates 1,000 pages.

1236
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Each of those pages links to the movie page, okay?

1237
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Yeah.

1238
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But those pages are no in-links.

1239
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
That doesn't really work, God.

1240
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Even if he makes a million pages pointing to the shirt page,

1241
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
real important movie pages like IMDB,

1242
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
there's no way you can beat them, okay?

1243
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:39,000
But, but there is a way to beat page rank.

1244
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
We span farming, kind of coordinated with that.

1245
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
This has been used, and it's sometimes called Google bombing.

1246
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
A few years ago, now it works too.

1247
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
But if when George Bush was president,

1248
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
you type miserable failure in Google,

1249
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
it's a choice to the biography of George Bush.

1250
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
It's nice, isn't it?

1251
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Miserable failure links to Bush,

1252
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
and it still does, it's called Google bombing.

1253
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
So how does that work?

1254
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
It's possible to do that, to cheat.

1255
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
This is called spam farming.

1256
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It's possible to create a structure in the graph

1257
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
that concentrates the page rank of a particular page.

1258
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Okay? How does that work?

1259
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
So, I'll show you the technique.

1260
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So, basically it works like this.

1261
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
There's three, there's three kinds of pages.

1262
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So let's say I'm a spammer.

1263
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I want to cheat, okay?

1264
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I want to increase the page rank of some page.

1265
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
So I look at the web,

1266
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
and there's three kinds of pages for my interview.

1267
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
There's inaccessible pages.

1268
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
That's pages owned by other people.

1269
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Most of them are inaccessible.

1270
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Then there's accessible pages.

1271
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
These are pages owned by other people,

1272
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,000
but I can add something to the blogs, for example,

1273
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
or comments, reviews.

1274
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I can post there.

1275
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I can put something there, even though I'm not the owner.

1276
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
It's called accessible pages.

1277
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And finally, there's a small number of pages

1278
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
that are owned by me, spammer.

1279
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
These are called owned pages.

1280
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
So I have these three kinds of pages.

1281
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
So how can I use this?

1282
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
So that's the structure.

1283
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
So here's the web.

1284
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
This is the whole web.

1285
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And here is the page,

1286
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
and I want to increase the page rank of this one.

1287
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
So how do I do it?

1288
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I want to maximize the page rank of the team.

1289
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
The web has two kinds of pages.

1290
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
So the green ones,

1291
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
those are the ones that I can add something to,

1292
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
even though I'm not the owner,

1293
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,000
like their blogs, or I can put a comment, or something.

1294
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Then the others are inaccessible.

1295
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
I have no control over them.

1296
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Most of them are inaccessible.

1297
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
You might have a few pages where you can add,

1298
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
but most of them are owned by other people.

1299
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
So I can't do anything to her.

1300
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Fine.

1301
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
So what do I do?

1302
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Well, the first thing I do

1303
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
is I post on as many places as I can,

1304
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
links to team.

1305
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I link to team from as many accessible pages as possible.

1306
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
That's the first step.

1307
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
It's not enough, but it's the first step.

1308
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
That will already increase a little bit

1309
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
the page rank of the team.

1310
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
But that's not enough.

1311
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
What I really have to do then,

1312
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
is I do another step

1313
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
where I construct what's called a link farm

1314
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,000
to multiply the page rank of team.

1315
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
So these red pages are my pages.

1316
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
So I buy a bunch of machines,

1317
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
or I rent machines,

1318
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
and I can write anything I want on them.

1319
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,000
This is my link farm, the obvious red pages.

1320
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
And the link farm pages

1321
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
will all point to team,

1322
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
and team points back to them.

1323
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
So it seems kind of weird,

1324
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
all these pages are going to point to team,

1325
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
and on team I make the link back.

1326
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And that's called the link farm.

1327
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And these red pages are owned by me.

1328
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
So how does this work?

1329
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,000
So this will actually improve my page rank.

1330
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Notice there can be many here,

1331
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
not billions, but not billions.

1332
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
But there could be millions.

1333
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
So how can this work?

1334
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
So let's make some computations.

1335
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Let's compute the page rank now.

1336
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
So let's say there's N pages

1337
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
that are getting accessible.

1338
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
N is huge numbers.

1339
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
And there's N pages that are owned by me.

1340
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Which is also being numbered

1341
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
much smaller than N.

1342
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Let's say that little x in green

1343
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
is the page rank that comes from the accessible pages.

1344
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
It's not so big, but there's some numbers.

1345
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
And Y is the page rank of page T.

1346
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Now we can compute according to page rank

1347
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
what it's going to be.

1348
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
So first of all, what is the rank

1349
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
with one of these pages?

1350
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
What is the rank?

1351
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Several sources of rank.

1352
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
One rank, one source comes from the outlet of T.

1353
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:47,000
But another one comes from the teleportation.

1354
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
So it's like this.

1355
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So each form page has this rank.

1356
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
So Y is the rank of T.

1357
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
So it's beta Y over M

1358
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
plus 1 minus beta over N.

1359
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
See that?

1360
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So it's the page rank coming from T

1361
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
and the teleportation rank.

1362
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Okay?

1363
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Okay, let's go on.

1364
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
So what is the rank of page T?

1365
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Well, it's the page rank coming from the green pages

1366
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
plus all the page rank.

1367
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
These only have one update.

1368
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
And they're all going to T.

1369
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
So it's M times beta

1370
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and this is the page rank coming from the red pages.

1371
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Beta Y over M plus 1 minus beta over N.

1372
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
You also have teleportation to page T.

1373
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
So this is a very small one.

1374
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Okay?

1375
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
So here we have a nice formula.

1376
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
So let's simplify this

1377
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
and see what we can learn from it.

1378
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Okay?

1379
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
So we can simplify this a little bit.

1380
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:04,000
So this Y is equal to X plus beta squared Y

1381
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
plus this beta times 1 minus beta

1382
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
times M over N

1383
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
plus this very small number.

1384
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Okay?

1385
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,000
This number we should remove is too small.

1386
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
And then we simplify.

1387
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,000
We have Y on both sides here.

1388
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
So it's 1 minus beta squared.

1389
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So Y is equal to X divided by 1 minus beta squared

1390
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
plus this number

1391
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:42,000
divided by 1 minus beta squared.

1392
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
So it's some constant times M over N.

1393
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So what does that mean?

1394
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Okay?

1395
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
So the value of the constant is beta over 1 plus beta.

1396
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Okay?

1397
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:03,000
What can we learn from this?

1398
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
What can we learn from this?

1399
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
How can we increase now the page rank of Y?

1400
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Notice there is this M factor here.

1401
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
By making M large,

1402
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
we can make Y as large as we want.

1403
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
So independent of everybody else.

1404
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
If we put a million pages here,

1405
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
we make it large.

1406
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
If we put 10 billion, it's much bigger.

1407
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
You add a number proportional to M.

1408
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
So that means the more pages you put in the farm,

1409
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
the higher the page rank it gets.

1410
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Okay?

1411
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And that's how these big farms work.

1412
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
So how can that work?

1413
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
What is really the idea here?

1414
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
How is this working?

1415
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Well, it's because these farm pages,

1416
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
they all get teleportation is going to them.

1417
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And the more you have them,

1418
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
the bigger fraction of teleportations will go there.

1419
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So the teleportation here,

1420
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:13,000
1 minus beta over N times M.

1421
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,000
So it depends on the fraction of M over N.

1422
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
The bigger that M is,

1423
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
the more the teleportation will go there,

1424
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
and the more you can increase the page rank.

1425
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And it doesn't matter what anybody else does.

1426
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
They do whatever they want.

1427
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
If I'm rich enough, I just have to create a lot of pages,

1428
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
and the teleportation will go there,

1429
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
and I can increase that.

1430
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
So the search engine optimizers,

1431
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
this is what they do.

1432
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Okay?

1433
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:51,000
The random teleportation from all the web to the farm nodes

1434
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:57,000
gets concentrated and pushed into page T.

1435
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Okay?

1436
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And this is how the big farms work.

1437
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Okay?

1438
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Actually, you might say,

1439
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:13,000
yeah, M is still going to be very small compared to M.

1440
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
This is true.

1441
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:20,000
But you don't have to have M be large compared to M.

1442
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
It just has to be larger than your competitors.

1443
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
So if you're a shirt seller,

1444
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
as long as you get higher up than other shirt sellers,

1445
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
you're good.

1446
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
You're not competing with really popular pages,

1447
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
like Amazon or someone.

1448
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
You're only competing with other shirt sellers.

1449
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
So M doesn't even have to be that large.

1450
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:48,000
But of course, the shirt sellers will all be paying these companies

1451
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:54,000
the search engine optimizers for increasing their rank.

1452
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And the one who pays the most will increase the rank the most.

1453
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Okay?

1454
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
So this was a big problem for people in the early days.

1455
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
They have now fixed sort of that problem.

1456
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
So a lot of the problem, you see how it works up.

1457
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
So a lot of the problem of this has been fixed now.

1458
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:22,000
This was a big problem in the first decade of the 2000s.

1459
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Really big problem.

1460
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
But so Google spent a lot of effort to try to fix this.

1461
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So the algorithm they use now is a secret.

1462
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Nobody knows what it is.

1463
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Okay?

1464
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,000
And does it fix the problem?

1465
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I don't know.

1466
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
What do you think?

1467
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Is there still doing people doing search engine optimization?

1468
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Yes.

1469
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
They still do it?

1470
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Yeah.

1471
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
That means Google is not that successful, right?

1472
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
But here's an idea how to fix it.

1473
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
This is called trust rank.

1474
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And it's based on concept of what's called spam mass.

1475
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So we want to combat this.

1476
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
So this is called linked spam.

1477
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Okay?

1478
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
How do you combat this?

1479
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Well, one way is that you know where the spam farms are.

1480
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
You blacklist them.

1481
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
But of course they're not going to announce themselves publicly.

1482
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Okay?

1483
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
So that doesn't always work.

1484
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:29,000
But the other way would be teleporting only to trusted pages.

1485
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
This one here you're teleporting to all these pages.

1486
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Even the farm pages.

1487
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
But maybe they're not trusted.

1488
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:44,000
So somehow you have to find out what are trusted pages.

1489
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
And you teleport mostly to them.

1490
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Okay?

1491
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:56,000
And the idea is it's very rare for a good page, a non-cheating page,

1492
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
to point to a spam page.

1493
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,000
These spam pages tend to be hidden inside linked farms.

1494
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Okay?

1495
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
So you change your teleport set, again, to be not everybody,

1496
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
but trusted pages.

1497
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
So it's a variation of topic to specific patron.

1498
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Okay?

1499
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
So you do a trust computation.

1500
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
You start from trusted pages and you compute trust.

1501
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
And you split trust across the outline of the names.

1502
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
And the degree of trust, so you have some pages trusted at.

1503
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
What a New York Times trusted page.

1504
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
The degree of trust decreases with the distance.

1505
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,000
So there's some way of distributing trust.

1506
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Okay?

1507
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
So this is not that easy.

1508
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Because you can't actually inspect all the pages manually.

1509
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
You want to have a lot of pages that are trusted.

1510
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
The more the better.

1511
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
But you have to make sure they're trusted.

1512
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
So how do you do that?

1513
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Well, one way is just page rank itself.

1514
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Usually the top pages produced by page rank are okay.

1515
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Because the linked farms, they can't actually push the page up so high.

1516
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Or you have certain domains where you know that it's trusted.

1517
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
The dot edu domain is universities, for example.

1518
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Or government pages, Hart-Milston, for example.

1519
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Okay?

1520
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:41,000
And all pages below the threshold are marked as spam.

1521
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:46,000
But that's still not really good enough.

1522
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:52,000
So the way that it's done in the trust rank model

1523
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
is you have this concept called spam mass.

1524
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
So you start with this green trusted set of pages.

1525
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And you want to say, and this is the page you're looking at.

1526
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
And then you're looking at the page rank of this page.

1527
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,000
And you want to say, how much of this page rank is coming from spam?

1528
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
How much is coming from trusted pages?

1529
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Okay?

1530
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
So there's some kind of estimate.

1531
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
We don't really know.

1532
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,000
RP is the page rank of page P.

1533
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:32,000
RP plus is the page rank of P when you teleport into trusted pages only.

1534
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,000
And then RP minus is the difference between the two.

1535
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
And this is called the spam mass.

1536
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:46,000
How much of the page rank comes from spam pages?

1537
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Okay?

1538
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:55,000
So a fraction of the page rank is coming from spam pages.

1539
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
So pages with high spam mass are spam.

1540
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
You throw them out.

1541
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Okay?

1542
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
So even pages that are not in the trusted set,

1543
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
you can keep them if they have low spam mass.

1544
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Okay?

1545
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,000
So this kind of idea, you have to do this

1546
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
to not be killed by big farms.

1547
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Okay?

1548
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
So this is one approach.

1549
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
The question, what does Google do today?

1550
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
It's not really known except for some people working at Google.

1551
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
It's kind of a secret.

1552
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
And that helps them, of course,

1553
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,000
because it's hard to cheat if you don't know the algorithm.

1554
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Okay?

1555
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
So let me now just summarize the page rank.

1556
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Page rank is one of many powerful techniques.

1557
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
It's a kind of random block.

1558
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
So we looked how that works.

1559
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
We represented it with matrices.

1560
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:58,000
So it's the constant eigenvalue eigenvectors can help us,

1561
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,000
okay, for understanding it.

1562
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I showed a little bit of the history.

1563
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
That is the problems.

1564
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
The matrices are very big.

1565
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
So how do you handle huge matrices?

1566
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
How do you handle topics specific?

1567
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:20,000
So there's a narrowing to topics specific, teleports specific topics.

1568
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
You can also use it for finding similar nodes.

1569
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
And you can spam it.

1570
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,000
So I showed you how linked farms work.

1571
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
They can increase the page rank.

1572
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
But you can combat that using algorithms such as trust rank

1573
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
to estimate spam mass.

1574
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And so the linked farms won't kill you.

1575
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Okay.

1576
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
So let me end there.

1577
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:52,000
So that gives you some idea of all of the stuff going on around the page rank.

1578
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
So, of course, the page rank is very important.

1579
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
It was a key invention.

1580
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
It's what made Google rich at base.

1581
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,000
And the step after that was the advertising.

1582
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It was targeted advertising with the generalized second price.

1583
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:15,000
So that and page rank is what Google made their empire out of.

1584
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Okay.
