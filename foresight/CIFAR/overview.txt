Checking CIFAR/The Brains Behind AI： Rich Sutton.txt
 Professor Richard Sutton, affiliated with the University of Alberta, AIME, and DeepMind, focuses his research on understanding the nature of intelligence, particularly through the lens of artificial intelligence (AI). His work in reinforcement learning—a field he has significantly contributed to—emphasizes the importance of interaction with the environment and the development of models to improve decision-making and achieve goals. While his research is driven by a quest to comprehend the mechanisms underlying human and animal minds, as well as our own, he emphasizes that AI is not solely about applications but is fundamentally about addressing profound questions regarding consciousness, cognition, and the role of intelligence in the universe. Reinforcement learning, which he explores, has indeed found diverse applications, including in gameplay (like AlphaGo), process control (such as optimizing energy usage in data centers), autonomous driving, search algorithms, and more, all areas where automated decision-making can benefit from sensitivity to experience and environmental data.
