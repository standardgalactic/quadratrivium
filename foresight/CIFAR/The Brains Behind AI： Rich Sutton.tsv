0	6560	My name is Richard Sutton, I'm a professor at the University of Alberta and I also part
6560	8640	of AIME and I work at DeepMind.
8640	14960	My research is really trying to understand the mind by building artificial intelligence.
14960	21160	I work in the area of reinforcement learning where we really recognize that intelligence
21160	26480	is interacting with the world and trying to build a model of the world to behave better
26480	30520	and to achieve goals.
30520	34640	In my work I'm not really focused on applications, but reinforcement learning has been used for
34640	39800	lots of applications, both in gameplay like AlphaGo, you may have all heard about, but
39800	50080	also for process control and saving energy in data centers and autonomous driving, search
50080	54720	algorithms, really any case where you have decisions that have to be made in an automated
54720	58000	way and should be sensitive to experience and data.
58000	64880	The most fascinating thing are the beings that have minds, you know people and animals
64880	69320	and I've always felt that way and can't we understand it.
69320	76400	Of course also we are minds, we are kind of looking at ourselves and say I'd like to
76400	81160	understand that better, I'd like to understand what I am and so intelligence, artificial
81160	87000	intelligence even though it has a word artificial and it is really about answering that fundamental
87000	91160	question of what I am, how I work and what is my role in the universe.
