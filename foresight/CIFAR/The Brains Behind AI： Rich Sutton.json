{"text": " My name is Richard Sutton, I'm a professor at the University of Alberta and I also part of AIME and I work at DeepMind. My research is really trying to understand the mind by building artificial intelligence. I work in the area of reinforcement learning where we really recognize that intelligence is interacting with the world and trying to build a model of the world to behave better and to achieve goals. In my work I'm not really focused on applications, but reinforcement learning has been used for lots of applications, both in gameplay like AlphaGo, you may have all heard about, but also for process control and saving energy in data centers and autonomous driving, search algorithms, really any case where you have decisions that have to be made in an automated way and should be sensitive to experience and data. The most fascinating thing are the beings that have minds, you know people and animals and I've always felt that way and can't we understand it. Of course also we are minds, we are kind of looking at ourselves and say I'd like to understand that better, I'd like to understand what I am and so intelligence, artificial intelligence even though it has a word artificial and it is really about answering that fundamental question of what I am, how I work and what is my role in the universe.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0,
