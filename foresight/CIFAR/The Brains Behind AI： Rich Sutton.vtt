My name is Richard Sutton, I'm a professor at the University of Alberta and I also part

00:06.560 --> 00:08.640
of AIME and I work at DeepMind.

00:08.640 --> 00:14.960
My research is really trying to understand the mind by building artificial intelligence.

00:14.960 --> 00:21.160
I work in the area of reinforcement learning where we really recognize that intelligence

00:21.160 --> 00:26.480
is interacting with the world and trying to build a model of the world to behave better

00:26.480 --> 00:30.520
and to achieve goals.

00:30.520 --> 00:34.640
In my work I'm not really focused on applications, but reinforcement learning has been used for

00:34.640 --> 00:39.800
lots of applications, both in gameplay like AlphaGo, you may have all heard about, but

00:39.800 --> 00:50.080
also for process control and saving energy in data centers and autonomous driving, search

00:50.080 --> 00:54.720
algorithms, really any case where you have decisions that have to be made in an automated

00:54.720 --> 00:58.000
way and should be sensitive to experience and data.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.880
The most fascinating thing are the beings that have minds, you know people and animals

01:04.880 --> 01:09.320
and I've always felt that way and can't we understand it.

01:09.320 --> 01:16.400
Of course also we are minds, we are kind of looking at ourselves and say I'd like to

01:16.400 --> 01:21.160
understand that better, I'd like to understand what I am and so intelligence, artificial

01:21.160 --> 01:27.000
intelligence even though it has a word artificial and it is really about answering that fundamental

01:27.000 --> 01:31.160
question of what I am, how I work and what is my role in the universe.
