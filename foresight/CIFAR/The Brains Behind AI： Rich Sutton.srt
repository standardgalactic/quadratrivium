00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
My name is Richard Sutton, I'm a professor at the University of Alberta and I also part

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,640
of AIME and I work at DeepMind.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,960
My research is really trying to understand the mind by building artificial intelligence.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,160
I work in the area of reinforcement learning where we really recognize that intelligence

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,480
is interacting with the world and trying to build a model of the world to behave better

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,520
and to achieve goals.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,640
In my work I'm not really focused on applications, but reinforcement learning has been used for

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,800
lots of applications, both in gameplay like AlphaGo, you may have all heard about, but

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:50,080
also for process control and saving energy in data centers and autonomous driving, search

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,720
algorithms, really any case where you have decisions that have to be made in an automated

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,000
way and should be sensitive to experience and data.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,880
The most fascinating thing are the beings that have minds, you know people and animals

13
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,320
and I've always felt that way and can't we understand it.

14
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,400
Of course also we are minds, we are kind of looking at ourselves and say I'd like to

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,160
understand that better, I'd like to understand what I am and so intelligence, artificial

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:27,000
intelligence even though it has a word artificial and it is really about answering that fundamental

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,160
question of what I am, how I work and what is my role in the universe.
