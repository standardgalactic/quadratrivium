00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello everyone. Thanks for turning out.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,120
Those of you who are not in physics coming here in the rain,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,360
is my pleasure to introduce Professor David Deutsch,

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,040
who is going to speak to us today.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,700
Many of you will know David's name.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,480
It's not controversial to say that he is one of the key individuals

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,100
who really kicked off the field that has become

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,580
the field of quantum information and quantum information technology,

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,740
which as you know Oxford now has a very large leading role in the UK and in the world.

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,080

So, David, ond, ond...

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Thank you.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:41,280
Right. Well, the ideas I'm going to talk about today are part of Constructor Theory,

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,280
which I've been working on with Chiarra Marleto,

28
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:53,280
and among other things, Constructor Theory uses a new mode of explanation,

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:01,280
of physical reality, through which we hope to eliminate a lot more than just probability,

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,280
a whole load of explanatory dead weight and blind alleys from physics

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,280
and from other sciences and even beyond science.

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
What's a mode of explanation?

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Well, at present, the prevailing mode, which is mistakenly thought to be the most fundamental,

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
is like this.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,280
There are particles and there are fields in spacetime,

36
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,280
and they obey laws of motion and initial conditions,

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:45,280
and once you know those, you can predict the whole of the rest of their behaviour.

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,280
But there are other modes of explanation in common use, in physics and elsewhere,

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,280
and here are some of them.

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,280
No? Yes. Good.

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Just for illustration, I'm mainly going to talk about the probabilistic mode

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,280
that I've put in red there,

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:20,280
but as I said, Constructor Theory seeks to unify and to underlie all those modes and others

44
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,280
with a single mode of explanation, the Constructor Theoretic mode,

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:36,280
which is explanation via the dichotomy between transformations that it's possible to bring about accurately

46
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,280
and ones that it's not possible to bring about accurately,

47
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,280
and those are possible and impossible tasks.

48
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Now, the basic principle of Constructor Theory is that just that all the laws of physics

49
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,280
are expressible in that way.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Since every task is supposed to be either definitively possible or impossible to perform,

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:16,280
there can't be such a thing as a task being possible with a given probability, not 0 or 1,

52
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,280
and at the fundamental level, such things might arise as approximations,

53
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,280
but that's not a description of reality.

54
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Therefore, there's no place for probability, according to Constructor Theory,

55
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:37,280
there's no place for probability or random processes at the foundations of physics.

56
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,280
However, I'm not going to make the case against probability from Constructor Theory today.

57
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,280
It's more like the other way around.

58
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,280
This is a motivation for Constructor Theory because independently of Constructor Theory,

59
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,280
the world just is not probabilistic, it's an illusion,

60
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:05,280
and the probabilistic mode of explanation has about the same status as the Flat Earth Theory.

61
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Namely, you might find it useful to use the predictions of the Flat Earth Theory

62
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
when you're planning out your garden,

63
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,280
but when you're thinking about what the world is like,

64
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,280
and even more when you're thinking about what the laws of nature are,

65
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:37,280
it would be hopeless the theory of the Flat Earth would just be an impediment to understanding what's out there.

66
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,280
So, same is true of probability, and so let me explain.

67
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Well, probability and the associated concepts such as a stochastic process

68
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,280
that produces a random sequence of outcomes,

69
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:06,280
these weren't originally invented for any purpose in physics or any fundamental purpose.

70
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:14,280
But basic mathematical theory of probability, namely certain numbers attached to certain elements of a set

71
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,280
which then obey axioms like they all add up to one and stuff,

72
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:30,280
was invented in the 16th century by people who only wanted to win at games of chance.

73
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:39,280
This is one of them, Cardano, and that started off game theory,

74
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:50,280
and game theorists use the idea of a random sequence as a mathematical model of physical acts

75
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:57,280
that are integral to games of chance, such as shuffling a pack of cards or throwing dice,

76
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:05,280
and probability, via the central concept of equally likely,

77
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,280
was a mathematical model for the intuitive idea of fair shuffling of cards,

78
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,280
a fair dice and a fair throw of the dice.

79
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:26,280
So, when I say that, which is also essential to games of chance,

80
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:34,280
when I say that this was merely a mathematical model, perhaps I should say more clearly what I mean,

81
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,280
I mean that they didn't assume that anything in the physical world,

82
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:48,280
shuffling cards and so on, was literally what we would today call a stochastic process,

83
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,280
that it literally had properties such as probability.

84
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:59,280
That's because, first of all, the properties that they actually needed from shuffling cards

85
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,280
were far weaker than full literal randomness.

86
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:13,280
They were basically that the outcomes of shuffling should be fair and equitable among the players

87
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,280
and unpredictable to them.

88
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:26,280
So, that meant that the outcomes were not related in any simple way to any sequence or algorithm

89
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,280
that they could call to mind or execute during playing the game.

90
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:39,280
So, most pseudo random sequences would have done just as well if they'd had computers then.

91
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:45,280
And secondly, more importantly, I don't think it would even have occurred to them

92
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:51,280
to connect their probability in their model with some real physical quantity

93
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,280
because classical physics, which was in its infancy at the time of Cardano,

94
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,280
but bit later when it was perfected, was deterministic

95
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,280
and therefore inconsistent with stochastic processes happening in nature.

96
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:15,280
So, why did those game theorists blithly use mathematical axioms,

97
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,280
a probability theory that were both far too strong and already ruled out

98
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,280
by what was known about fundamental physics?

99
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Well, simple. By being too strong, that's harmless,

100
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:36,280
that meant that they certainly satisfied the conditions that were necessary for analysing games.

101
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,280
And the real properties that they really wanted, such as fairness and so on,

102
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,280
couldn't be expressed precisely mathematically.

103
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,280
By the way, they can be expressed precisely in constructive theory,

104
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,280
but that's another story.

105
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Consequently, it didn't matter also that their model relied on impossible physics

106
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:07,280
because the conclusions about game playing, if there had been that impossible physics,

107
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:14,280
led to the same conclusions about strategy and tactics as for the real physics.

108
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
So, it didn't matter for them.

109
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:31,280
There's another reason why they might have been blasé about the connection between their theory and physics.

110
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,280
Certainly this was a move made later in game theory and in probability theory up to the present day.

111
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:45,280
They might have regarded the probabilities not as attributes of the dice and the cards or the dealer,

112
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,280
but as attributes of the player receiving the cards.

113
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:57,280
That's the subjective interpretation of probability, and I'll come back to it in a moment,

114
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:07,280
but note already that whatever role the subjective state of mind of the player may play in this story,

115
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:16,280
fairness must depend on physical properties of the cards and dice and how they're treated during the game,

116
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:26,280
and therefore game theory must, in principle, be rooted in some sort of model of those objects and processes.

117
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:34,280
Anyway, from that theory, game theorists derived maxims for playing games of chance,

118
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,280
such as in poker, never draw to an inside straight,

119
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:52,280
and the important thing is that this was a narrow, parochial application of a mathematical trick, the theory of probability.

120
00:11:52,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Indeed, the reason that game theory was possible at all was that its conclusions don't depend on the detailed physics of any game playing processes.

121
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,280
It didn't matter what the orbits of the planets are, it didn't matter what matter is made of,

122
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,280
or let alone anything deeper about the laws of physics.

123
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:21,280
The theory was directed specifically at modeling a particular human social behavior,

124
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:27,280
which even other animals don't do, let alone the physical world at large.

125
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:34,280
So it should be very surprising that this little mathematical trick, the theory of probability,

126
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:42,280
has found further applications in a very diverse fields in science and beyond,

127
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,280
and even that it seems to be fundamental to some of those fields.

128
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:54,280
So here are some of them, roughly in the historical order of their invention.

129
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:01,280
So we'd be surprised if, say, the seven of diamonds appeared in a law of physics.

130
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:08,280
But probability, which has the same provenance as the seven of diamonds,

131
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:14,280
seems to be central to physics in particular, and it seems to work.

132
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:23,280
So why would anyone want to expunge it from physics and from every other fundamental theory?

133
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:29,280
Well, of course, we don't need a reason. Physics likes to do without things.

134
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:40,280
As we discover more and more about the world, we sometimes find out that things that we thought existed don't exist,

135
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:50,280
such as celestial spheres and the force of gravity and trajectories of particles and so on.

136
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:57,280
They were all thought to exist, and then discovering that they don't exist was a great advance in understanding.

137
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:05,280
But before we can decide that something doesn't exist, we must explain what the world without that thing is like,

138
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:12,280
and also, preferably, why thinking in terms of that thing seemed to work

139
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:18,280
and why it was a useful fiction and why it may still be a useful fiction.

140
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,280
So compare these two statements.

141
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:34,280
The first statement specifies a factual, observable property of the world.

142
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:42,280
It specifies what will happen when poker is played and specified hands arise.

143
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,280
But the second one is not about physical facts.

144
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,280
It is consistent with any sequence of cards arising in a poker game.

145
00:14:52,280 --> 00:15:03,280
In fact, it's consistent with any physical events, such as someone repeatedly drawing to an inside straight and repeatedly winning.

146
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Not inconsistent. Yes, it's true that it was risky.

147
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:19,280
The second statement is true, all right, but it doesn't apparently refer to any physical events that actually happened in that case.

148
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:30,280
One sometimes hears a sort of desperate denial of this along the following lines.

149
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,280
The statement, it was too risky, is about the physical world.

150
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,280
It refers to all the other players who drew to an inside straight and lost,

151
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,280
and it refers to the fact that there are more of them. They outnumber the winners.

152
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Well, first of all, it doesn't.

153
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:54,280
There have only been finitely many poker games in the world.

154
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Ignore for the moment the fact that there are parallel universes,

155
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,280
and in those particular player, both wins and loses in different universes,

156
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:11,280
and quantum theory does in fact solve some of these problems, but not by counting the number of players.

157
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,280
So, for the moment, in a given universe or in classical physics,

158
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:26,280
the proportion of players who drew to an inside straight and lost doesn't exactly equal the probability of losing.

159
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Just as repeated tosses of a fair coin, however fair it is,

160
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,280
don't result in equal numbers of heads and tails in general.

161
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:45,280
And anyway, since when do gamblers care about whether other gamblers lose or win?

162
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,280
If probability refers to other players losing money,

163
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:58,280
it doesn't refer to any physical fact about the game as it actually was in the case that I cited.

164
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,280
And the same holds for all probability statements.

165
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,280
So, that's meant to be, in the second column, that's meant to be all probability statements.

166
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
That's the dot, dot, dot.

167
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:27,280
The blatant fact that is generally overlooked is that no statement from the second column can ever imply any statement from the first column.

168
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:34,280
In other words, assertions about probabilities do not refer to the physical world.

169
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,280
They don't assert anything about the physical world.

170
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Frequencies, like the fraction of winners over losers historically, are things that happen in real life,

171
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,280
and therefore they don't, in general, equal probabilities.

172
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,280
And it's no good saying that they equal them approximately, because they don't.

173
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,280
They only probably equal them approximately, and that's a statement from the second column.

174
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Similarly, you can't say that probability statements are about what will happen in the long run.

175
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:14,280
No, they aren't. All you can deduce from them are statements about what will probably happen in the long run.

176
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:26,280
But frequencies in an infinite sequence of measurements, of experiments, do equal the probabilities exactly,

177
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:37,280
and this inspires yet another desperate denial to the fact that the finite sequences are approximations to infinite ones.

178
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:49,280
But nothing about a finite subsequence of an infinite sequence can possibly follow from a statement about relative frequencies in the infinite sequence,

179
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:58,280
unless the subsequence is a typical one, and a statement that is a typical one belongs firmly in the second column.

180
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,280
Or you may take that subjective route that I mentioned.

181
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,280
You could imagine that probability statements are not assertions about the world at all.

182
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:16,280
They are assertions about our minds, probability being a measure of ignorance, or of a degree of rational belief.

183
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Those are two different subjective theories called credence, but that's no good for present purposes because then you still need something to connect statements about our minds to statements about physical reality.

184
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:52,280
So, to this end, the philosopher David Lewis proposed his principle principle, which just asserts as an axiom that rational agents have the same credences as the physical probabilities.

185
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:03,280
But note that that gives no explanation about why those physical, purportedly physical numbers should inform decisions in that way.

186
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:13,280
You may as well propose an axiom that rational people avoid black cats or ladders. That's not physics.

187
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:29,280
So, the upshot is that Cardano and the game theorists never did succeed, after all, in their purpose of finding ways of winning at games of chance, or of minimizing their losses.

188
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,280
They only found ways of probably winning.

189
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:57,280
And later, people added these purported philosophical principles that say a rational person would do this or that, but actually a rational gambler knows that having probably won, no matter how often one does it, won't pay the rent.

190
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Physically, physically, it is most unlike actual winning.

191
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:24,280
So, in case there still appear to be any clothes on this emperor, because of the mass of cultural interpretation that's been loaded onto it, just replace all the probabilistic terms in the second column by magical terms.

192
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:41,280
Why? What physical reason is there to allow statements in the second column to inform decisions by fiat and not statements in the third, which we could equally well connect to reality by some fiat?

193
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:56,280
That's the magical column. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

194
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:20,280
So, what I have called these desperate denials of the firewall between the first column and the other two are more commonly known as interpretations of the probability calculus, subjective interpretation, frequency interpretation, ensemble interpretations, and all in many variants,

195
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:36,280
regarded as attempts to connect the second column with the first, they are all, like the examples I've given, either circular or meaningless, or conflict with the probability calculus, or just don't do what they say they do.

196
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:48,280
This discussion that I've just given about the defects in the theory of probability draws on the work of David Papineau, who's a philosopher of probability.

197
00:22:49,280 --> 00:23:12,280
He has called this situation at the heart of his field a scandal. Probability concepts and language and the whole theory simply form a closed system of statements and ideas that just refer to each other and can never yield a statement about the physical world.

198
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Now, if we go back to the applications of probability, we can see that there is a common feature running through all of them. They are all in a certain sense and slightly different senses.

199
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:42,280
They're all normative. That is to say, they are about, at root, how one should act if one were to believe that certain potential events have particular probabilities.

200
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Now, how one should act is rather a strange thing for a scientific theory to talk about. You know, you can't get an ought from an is.

201
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:04,280
In fact, the firewall between factual statements and moral statements exists for a very similar reason to the one separating factual statements from probability ones.

202
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:23,280
So, another way of papering over the divide or ignoring it is by different kind of fiat. One simply puts a normative statement about probabilities into the physical theory.

203
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:32,280
That's called a stochastic physical theory. There are many ways of expressing that fiat. Here's one.

204
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:55,280
So, it contains a lot of hidden stuff. It pretends only to contain that first row, but actually there are some purportedly factual statements about numbers that purportedly have something to do with physics.

205
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:03,280
And then there has to be a principle to give them some normative psychological meaning, the second row.

206
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:12,280
And then the third row, actually, you need another axiom from decision theory to say how one should actually behave rather than how one should think.

207
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:38,280
And this is weird, but luckily it so happens that the only stochastic theory that has ever been proposed in the history of science as a fundamental description of the world is quantum theory in its mid-20th century state vector collapse form.

208
00:25:39,280 --> 00:26:00,280
And in that form, its probabilistic part is called the Born Rule, which says that if and only if an observable is measured, then the probabilities of the various outcomes are the moduli squared of those coefficients and the bottom line there.

209
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:13,280
By the way, does anyone here actually believe that the state vector collapse occurs in physical reality? Show of hands? Okay, no, good.

210
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Oh, so one person, so you have my sympathy, and I hope you'll see in what follows that help is at hand, closer than you think.

211
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:51,280
So because, well, help is at hand because ordinary unitary non-collapse quantum theory provides in large part the way out of that whole probability scandal.

212
00:26:52,280 --> 00:27:10,280
It's called the decision theoretic approach, sometimes called the decision theoretic approach to the Born Rule or to probability, but those are both misnomers because neither the Born Rule nor probability nor collapse, of course, ever appear in the decision theoretic argument.

213
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:39,280
In its simplest form, it goes like this. We imagine an array of gaming machines, one-armed bandits in a casino, so there's a whole array of them, and you play by inserting one casino token, and then when you pull the handle, the machine prepares a quantum system inside itself.

214
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:54,280
In a state psi, and then measures an observable x of that system, it then displays the result, as shown in red on the middle panel, and that will therefore always be an eigenvalue of x.

215
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:08,280
And then the machine delivers a payoff of that number of casino tokens, which need not be a whole number, we're allowing fractional tokens if x has non-integer eigenvalues.

216
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Different machines in this casino are identical except for the state psi, which is constant for each machine, but different for different machines.

217
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:31,280
But the psi is not a secret, it's written on the front of the machine, just like this, conveniently expressed as a superposition of eigenstates of the observable x.

218
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Now, four machines whose psi is a single eigenvalue of x, with eigenvalue little x, then playing on that machine is not a game of chance, it's just a matter of putting in one token and receiving back little x tokens.

219
00:28:51,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Let's call that a classical machine, because it could be implemented without quantum systems, without quantum technology.

220
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:20,280
So, other things being equal, a rational player would be willing to play on any classical machine that has little x greater than one, and unwilling to play when it has little x less than one.

221
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:32,280
What about cases when psi is not an eigenstate of x? What then is the dividing line between being worth playing and not being worth playing?

222
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Well, let's call the dividing line for a machine operating with state psi, let's call that dividing line v of psi, and this is perhaps a little bit of a wordy definition, but it's just the maximum amount of money that the player would be willing to pay for the privilege of playing that machine.

223
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:10,280
So, for a classical machine, psi is an eigenstate of x, and v of psi is just the eigenvalue.

224
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Well, some other facts about v of psi, more general psi, are obvious too. We don't need probability or the Born Rule or anything. For example, if the state is a superposition of eigenstates of x, all of whose eigenvalues are greater than one, then elementary rationality says that it's worth playing, because whatever the outcome, the machine will give you more than the one token that you put in.

225
00:30:40,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Similarly, for a superposition with all eigenvalues less than one, it's not worth playing. That is, it's not worth playing in the token-winning sense of the game theorists. You might well play for fun, but then you're being paid partly in fun, so let's ignore that complication.

226
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:13,280
But now, what if the hard case, what if psi is a superposition of two eigenstates, let's say one with eigenvalue below one and one with eigenvalue above one?

227
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:36,280
Well, in collapse quantum theory, with the Born Rule and everything, that tells us that for general states psi, the probabilities of the respective outcomes are those coefficient squared, and then the principle principle tells us to adjust our credences to match those numbers, though it doesn't say why.

228
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:47,280
And probabilistic game theory tells us that a rational player should value playing such a machine the same as if it were guaranteed to produce that expectation value.

229
00:31:48,280 --> 00:32:08,280
Again, it doesn't say why. In general, axioms of stochastic theories are not explanatory, which alone should disqualify them from being part of any scientific theory in fundamental science, but I digress.

230
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Now, what about without collapse? Well, let's take a simple case of an equal amplitude superposition with eigenvalues x1 and x2, each with amplitude one over root two, so we're aiming to prove without collapse or anything that v of that equal amplitude state, sorry.

231
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,280
We'll be the average of x1 and x2. So that's what we want to prove.

232
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:58,280
So here's the proof, a quick and dirty version of the proof. The devil is in the detail, which I'm not going to talk about. The details are extensive, but they lead to the same conclusion.

233
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:10,280
So first of all, we need to note two implications of elementary rationality, not probabilistic in any way, namely equations one and two.

234
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:19,280
I'm stating them for a slightly more general case, but it doesn't matter that the theta is going to be pi by four in the end.

235
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:30,280
So equation two says that v of psi does not depend on the objective exchange value of casino tokens, so long as they're additive.

236
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:44,280
If the casino suddenly declares that it's going to redeem tokens in pounds instead of dollars, the relative order in which a rational player values playing on different machines will not change.

237
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:53,280
So that's one implication of rationality, and the other is expressed in equation one.

238
00:33:53,280 --> 00:34:12,280
If two machines use superpositions where each eigenvalue in the expansion of one of them differs by constant k from that in the other, then the rational player's valuation of the two machines also differs by that same constant k.

239
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:29,280
And that's just because. In that case, all the first machine does is physically is the same as what the second one does plus additionally paying out k tokens.

240
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:51,280
Now we make those substitutions there on the slide, and it follows with a bit of algebra that for the equal amplitude state, v of psi is indeed the expectation value of x in that state, and we can prove the same for a general state and that's QED.

241
00:34:51,280 --> 00:35:14,280
But look what we've done here in a deeper sense. We've proved the same conclusion about what rational players do as we would have from classical collapse quantum theory, but without assuming that collapse happens.

242
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:36,280
We've proved it without the born rule, without those axioms and all that stuff. So we've done this on the right hand side, whereas with collapse quantum theory we have to go through all that process on the left hand side to get to the same conclusion.

243
00:35:36,280 --> 00:36:05,280
So on the right hand side, the only assumptions are elementary rationality and unitary quantum theory without collapse. From the perspective of this talk, that means that we have dispensed with probability, both in nature, in the quantum world and in our minds if we have any credences about the quantum world.

244
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:30,280
Because in nature, as described by quantum theory, there are no stochastic processes and no credences in the sense of beliefs with numerical measures that obey the probability calculus, no credences affect the decisions of any rational person making decisions about quantum systems.

245
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:53,280
That is even better than that. Those decisions now on the right hand side are not only derived, but unlike in the collapse case, they are explained because we don't have to introduce all those unexplained postulates.

246
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:05,280
That also explains why collapse theory, despite its false assumptions, was and is successful in a particular domain of application.

247
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:24,280
So now, let's look again at that list of fundamental applications of probability. We can strike out quantum theory from the list and we can put a tentative mark there about credences too since we now know that they're not needed in this particular application.

248
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:40,280
We've also eliminated probability from the theory of games of chance that use quantum processes where the chance element is generated by quantum indeterminacy.

249
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:56,280
So what about games of chance in general? Well recall what I said at the beginning, probability is a very large sledgehammer with which to crack the egg of modelling things like fair dice.

250
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:13,280
Now we see that the same job could be done by quantum theory as by the impossible physics that they assumed. Since a pseudo random sequence would have served the same purpose, so would a quantum generated sequence.

251
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:33,280
For the same reason, we can strike out the use of probabilities in general decision theory which is just game theory writ large and in actuarial science. I just put that in because it was historically a very early application of probability.

252
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:51,280
It measures, it prepares the system in a state sign and then it measures an observable x on that system. The result is the pale.

253
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:26,280
Just as in game theory, the theory of evolution doesn't depend in any way on true randomness in the mutations. All that matters is that the theory can explain how biological adaptations to an environment can evolve if the mutations aren't systematic, if they don't depend systematically on the environment.

254
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Only the selection is supposed to be systematic, that's the essence of the theory of evolution and probability randomness is just a feature of the model convenience so we can strike that out too from the theory of evolution, strike out the theory of evolution.

255
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:57,280
By the way, Chiara has just published a paper about the constructor theory of biology which among other things describes evolution without evoking randomness in any way.

256
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Of course, by all these strike outs, I don't mean that the mathematical formalism of quantum theory isn't sometimes useful. I'm saying that the quantities called probabilities in that formalism do not refer to any stochastic random processes in nature nor to anything in rational minds such as degrees of belief or credence,

257
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:42,280
nothing in physics or in minds thinking about physics. In information theory, probability was again originally used as a model for an even simpler thing, namely this could be any message of n bits.

258
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Our communication system needs to be able to cope with any message of n bits and we don't know which it's going to be and this was translated in the model to all two to the n strings are equally likely.

259
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:17,280
This has caused all sorts of confusion such as people saying that a state contains maximum information when it has maximum entropy, which is nonsense and so on, but that's another story. Anyway, we can strike it out.

260
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:46,280
I'll just say in passing that constructor theoretic information theory is also something that Chiara and I have recently developed and it does fulfil all the hopes that we have for constructor theory in general including not being subject to the kind of confusion about information that I just mentioned and it unifies classical and quantum information.

261
00:41:47,280 --> 00:42:11,280
That was published a while ago. So what's left? Quantum statistical mechanics at least doesn't need probabilities since it has entanglement and decoherence and therefore it can avail itself of what I've just described about quantum theory, the decision theoretic approach.

262
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:28,280
I should say why the universe is in such a state as to make the laws of thermodynamics hold, for example that it's uniform, that it's initially ordered and so on, is a substantive question, but it's not a probabilistic question.

263
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:40,280
So we can strike that out too. So I'll leave striking out classical statistical mechanics as an exercise for the audience.

264
00:42:41,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Now, experimental error, that's an interesting case. I think it was historically the earliest application of probability after games of chance and it has some interesting misconceptions in it in addition to probability which one of them is as follows.

265
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:19,280
So it's connected with probabilities. Error processes in experiments are traditionally categorised as random and systematic, but both of those are misleading terms.

266
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:40,280
For simplicity, just imagine a measurement of a constant of nature such as the speed of light. And suppose that we are asked to give an estimate of the best error attainable with a given instrument like Fiso's wheel.

267
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:54,280
Processes that were random with known probabilities would not be sources of error at all in such a case since they could be reduced without limit just by repeating the experiment.

268
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:12,280
So the important errors are the ones that affect experiments through processes whose governing laws are unknown. That is, the laws may be known, but how they affect the experiment is unknown.

269
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:23,280
And those cause systematic errors, so ironically a systematic error is one that obeys known system.

270
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:42,280
So what does it mean to estimate an error caused by the unknown? Traditional to go into probability and subjective probability, but as I've said that's all nonsense, so what can it mean?

271
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:59,280
Well, suppose that a physical constant, let's say, call it chi, is to be measured and that the bound for a given technology is claimed to be epsilon.

272
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:20,280
So if little x is the average of measurements obtained with a particular instrument, well, the best result obtainable with a particular instrument, then the first line, x minus chi, modus of x minus chi is less than epsilon, we're saying.

273
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:39,280
And for simplicity, assume that the individual outcomes that we obtain when we do the experiment repeatedly with different copies of the apparatus and so on are x1 and x2, then we have both x1 and x2 both obey that inequality as well.

274
00:45:39,280 --> 00:46:01,280
And then just from some algebra, it follows that the average of x1 and x2, just as in the, if they were random errors, has a smaller error than either x1 or x2 separately, which is a contradiction, because epsilon was supposed to be the best error obtainable with that apparatus.

275
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:18,280
So systematic experimental errors cannot be bounded by any known bound, therefore, among other things, they can't be described by probabilities, nor can our knowledge about them.

276
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:40,280
These unknown variables in science are counterintuitive and often misunderstood because we have been accustomed by Bayesianism and other subjective philosophies to replace real ignorance by fantasy probabilities.

277
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:51,280
But we've just seen that neither physical probabilities nor probability credences can enter the analysis of errors in a fundamental way.

278
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,280
So what do we mean when we estimate the error in an experiment?

279
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:10,280
Well, that turns out to be a big question with surprising answers that there's no time to go into here except I'll just briefly mention, I hope to complete a paper on that quite soon.

280
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:27,280
But I'll just briefly mention that what an error estimate really means is it's the error such that if the experimental result turned out to differ from the true value by more than that when the true value is later discovered by some other method,

281
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,280
then if it was more than that it would make the theory of the apparatus problematic.

282
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:48,280
So that's in short what an error means, but for present purposes we can just strike out error analysis there.

283
00:47:49,280 --> 00:48:11,280
So Brownian motion, that doesn't actually purport to be a fundamental theory since although it has a stochastic law of motion, that's assumed to be an approximation to a more microscopic cause such as impacts from molecules that aren't explicitly treated by the theory of Brownian motion.

284
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:24,280
So that theory is also related to the theory of errors, but in the approximation that the so-called random errors are swamping the systematic errors.

285
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:39,280
Although we've just seen that that's something that cannot be known in a particular case, but if the unknown systematic errors are too large then it's not Brownian motion.

286
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,280
So we can strike that out.

287
00:48:50,280 --> 00:49:00,280
And with it we can also strike out the applications from high finance that are directly analogous to the theory of Brownian motion.

288
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:12,280
Finally, since none of those other applications of probability now involve stochastic processes, they do not require credences either.

289
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:26,280
It doesn't matter what scientists think, what scientists believe about whether a theory is true or false, so long as they execute rationality.

290
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:38,280
And so Bayesianism and the other subjective interpretations of probability have no remaining scientific function and for these purposes they can be dropped too.

291
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:49,280
Now I hope I have shown you that probability doesn't make sense as a description or explanation of what really happens.

292
00:49:50,280 --> 00:50:04,280
It can be a metaphor, it can be a technique for calculation or an approximation in a certain sense, but an approximation to make sense has to be an approximation to something.

293
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:28,280
So if probabilities are to inform decisions in some approximate way, there has to be an explanation rooted in a description of an actual physical world in which events and processes happen, not probably happen, and not just via some ad hoc axioms.

294
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:54,280
So I hope I've also persuaded you that it's right and proper to try to expunge every trace of probability and randomness from the laws of physics and from our conception of the world and from the methodology of science so that we may fully restore realism as well as rationality.

295
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:05,280
It's a simplification, a unification and an elimination of nonsense and it's true.

296
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:19,280
Now I bet there are hard headed instrumentalists in the audience who might be thinking, okay, so this simplification is all very nice and elegant,

297
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:34,280
but since the principal uses of the mathematics of probability are largely unaffected, what really is the benefit of eliminating it at the fundamental level either?

298
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:42,280
Well it's true, fundamental falsehoods don't always rear up and bite you.

299
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:53,280
You could believe in a flat earth as many people did for a long time and that falsehood may never have affected your life or your thinking.

300
00:51:54,280 --> 00:52:13,280
On the other hand it might have destroyed the entire human species because belief in a flat earth theory as a description of reality is incompatible with developing, say, technology to avert asteroid strikes.

301
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:29,280
Similarly a belief in probability in quantum theory may not prevent you from developing quantum computers, quantum algorithms in practice,

302
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:44,280
but because probability and the born rule entail fundamental misconceptions about the physical world, they could very well prevent you from developing the successors of quantum theory.

303
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:54,280
And in particular, constructor theory is the framework in which I suspect successors to quantum theory will be developed.

304
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:01,280
Now as I said, constructor theory is incompatible with physical probabilities.

305
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,280
So that is my case. Thank you.

306
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,280
Many of the things that David alluded to, papers and so forth, easy to find.

307
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,280
Okay, I saw one hand go up, so please.

308
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:43,280
I'm sorry, but the slot machine, I'm afraid I'm so far walking out of here with no understanding of how to modify my way of thinking about a single machine that ended up coming in.

309
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:51,280
So if someone asked me, what are the funny numbers in the square roots mean in front of the eigen states in the slot machine?

310
00:53:51,280 --> 00:54:07,280
I would say, well, what those funny numbers mean is if I pull the handle lots and lots of times, then on the limit that I do it forever, one third of the time I get this one result and the other two thirds of the time I get this other result.

311
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,280
And say, well, which result will you get next?

312
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,280
I don't know.

313
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,280
I didn't understand how to modify my way of thinking about that based on the stuff you talked about.

314
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:30,280
Well, the idea is that I'm not sure which version of quantum theory you're thinking in terms of possibly collapsed theory in which there is such a thing.

315
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,280
I don't know. I want to know how I should think about this.

316
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:44,280
The way you should think about it is not in terms of the outcomes. The outcomes are an emergent property in some complicated way.

317
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,280
What those coefficients are, they're just descriptors of the state.

318
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,280
The state that the thing is prepared in.

319
00:54:53,280 --> 00:55:05,280
So, for example, if it was a spin system, it would be prepared by rotating it in some way with magnetic fields and those coefficients would depend on the angle through which it's been rotated.

320
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,280
That's what it actually means.

321
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:16,280
Now, what that causes in our subjective experience, do you need an interpretation of quantum theory for that?

322
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:27,280
Interestingly, all we need, and the right interpretation is the many universal interpretation, but we don't really need to draw on that for these results.

323
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,280
We just have to say that the motion is unitary.

324
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,280
That's all. That the state exists physically and its motion is unitary.

325
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,280
Other question?

326
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,280
Hello.

327
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,280
I'd like to find out more about what we think about.

328
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:53,280
I can go along with the idea that it's very weird to have them in a fundamental micro-physical theory.

329
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,280
If in the future we find some kind of theory which is a deterministic, we have to wrestle with what that means.

330
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,280
Or, you know, find out how we don't have them.

331
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,280
But as a high level concept, they seem to be useful in some kind of vision philosophy of science which doesn't.

332
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,280
It's not trying to talk about the fundamental physics itself.

333
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:19,280
So I'm an observer, people would say, has a credence maybe if they don't know exactly what the micro-state of the real world is.

334
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:27,280
And they have some idea that I think it's within this region, but I've got no reason to differentiate between actual micro-states.

335
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:35,280
So having no reason, so these are two slightly different ways of doing a subjective interpretation.

336
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:48,280
The first one, where you guessed what the probabilities are in some theory and it's going to be an approximation to some microscopic state that you don't know,

337
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,280
that's a legitimate way of approximating something.

338
00:56:53,280 --> 00:57:01,280
You have guessed what the probabilities are and then you can test if theory says that there's something, you can test whether that's so.

339
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:11,280
When you say you don't know what the micro-states are, then you're trying to derive knowledge from ignorance.

340
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:18,280
And that is simply logically not valid and it's also inconsistent with the probability calculus.

341
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:28,280
It's only by sort of hand-waving ignoring that fact that one can apply Bayesian philosophy in words to things like we don't know what the state is.

342
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:31,280
If we don't know what something is, we don't know what it is.

343
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:46,280
So the standard refutation of that kind of subjective interpretation is if there are three possibilities A, B and C, you don't know anything about which state it's in,

344
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,280
then you might say, well bet on whether it's A or either B or C.

345
00:57:52,280 --> 00:58:00,280
And then if you say that because you don't know which of those two possibilities is right, that you must give them equal probabilities,

346
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,280
then the same is true for the permuted versions and that's inconsistent.

347
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,280
It's logically inconsistent so it can't be used for that.

348
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:13,280
The situation is very analogous to the flat earth theory.

349
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:26,280
When you assume that your garden is a plain surface, you're not assuming the flat earth theory, you're just assuming the mathematics of the flat earth theory applied to this process.

350
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:35,280
But there's no way in which you are assuming that the true thing is an approximation to the flat earth. It isn't.

351
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:55,280
So with your decision theoristic argument, which is used to bypass the principle and to derive the Born Rule, you invoke this function V, this evaluation function.

352
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:08,280
However, you also asserted that it had some properties that it was linear in the eigenvalues of the function.

353
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,280
Yes.

354
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,280
So have you also asserted that the rational entity would…

355
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,280
No. We're assuming a rational entity who has linear valuations.

356
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,280
So this same issue arises in classical game theory.

357
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:36,280
As I said, a person, a real game player is not the same as the idealised game player of game theory.

358
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,280
A real game player has all sorts of other motivations.

359
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:48,280
Otherwise, a real game player would never play a game of chance such as you read where the expectation value of your winnings is negative.

360
00:59:49,280 --> 01:00:01,280
So we assume this idealised game player in classical game theory and we assume exactly the same player in the decision theory approach to quantum theory.

361
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:08,280
So it's not because we want to say why people play games.

362
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,280
It's just this one particular aspect of game playing that has probability.

363
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,280
And it's that that is analogous between the two cases.

364
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,280
Okay, but you still made an assertion about how this player would behave, right?

365
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,280
So how is that any more elegant tool than the principle?

366
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,280
No. The assertion about how the player behaves is the same in both cases.

367
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,280
We're analysing how a player who believes a particular thing will behave.

368
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:47,280
We're not saying that any real player actually behaves like that. No real player does exactly.

369
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,280
We'll probably take another question.

370
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,280
I thought, yeah.

371
01:00:53,280 --> 01:01:02,280
David, you were at the foundation of what you're saying is you're eliminating the distinction between epistemological chance and ontological chance.

372
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,280
I'm saying that epistemological chance, well, yes I am.

373
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:15,280
I'm saying that neither of them exist, but ontological chance can be a good approximation in some situations.

374
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:21,280
And epistemological chance really should be dispensed with all together.

375
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,280
Okay, so if you focus on the epistemological chance there can be two kinds.

376
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,280
One where we don't know enough about the system to be able to calculate the outcome.

377
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,280
Yes.

378
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:43,280
There's another kind in which, even if we did know everything, we would not be able to compute the outcome because that problem was not computable.

379
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,280
Yes.

380
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,280
Does that not create an effective ontological chance?

381
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:56,280
Well no, that's a particular situation again in which the probability calculus may be a good approximation.

382
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:07,280
Rather like, if we think about the distribution of the digits of pi, then it's a meaningful approximation to say, well they're going to be random.

383
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:20,280
They're not really random, but the mathematics of them has enough in common with the mathematics of truly random sequences for it to be a good approximation for some purposes, but obviously not for all purposes.

384
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:27,280
So the common feature is just that no matter what we call it, they're just unpredictable whether it's ontological or epistemological.

385
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,280
Yes, unpredictability can be modelled by randomness sometimes.

386
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:41,280
Okay, I think we've probably got time for one more question, and then I expect David's happy to hang around for a few minutes afterwards, so those of you who didn't get to ask a question, then he's just coming in front.

387
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,280
What have I asked? Do I see one here?

388
01:02:45,280 --> 01:03:00,280
Yeah, I just wanted to come back to something that you seem to be wanting to expunge probability from any fundamental physics, and I think we all know that probability is very softly problematic.

389
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:18,280
But you seem to be wanting to do this by replacing it with the decision-theoretic governance in which are made with respect to some admittedly non-existent player or some game that is probably also not being played.

390
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:31,280
So I'm really struggling to see how that is any more desirable than any of the other approaches to the admittedly philosophically problematic probability.

391
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:39,280
Yes, so the main advantage is it doesn't assert anything false about reality.

392
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:45,280
Well, it's asserting that reality has something to do with this thing that we know doesn't exist.

393
01:03:45,280 --> 01:04:10,280
No, no, it's just saying that if, so it's taking an idealised game with idealised processes happening both for randomising and for the players, and it's analysing how those players would behave if they believed some rationality, if they conformed to some elements of rationality that have nothing to do with probability.

394
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,280
But that entire argument is counterfactual.

395
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:24,280
Yes, it's counterfactual, but then you need an argument to say that a real situation resembles that idealised situation in particular worse.

396
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:39,280
So if I go into a casino to play roulette, obviously I'm not satisfying the axioms of game theory because I'm playing a game which has an expectation value that's negative of winning.

397
01:04:40,280 --> 01:05:05,280
On the other hand, if I play poker and I'm good at it and then I wonder whether to draw or not or how much to bet, then I can use game theory because and only because I guess that my real situation resembles the idealised situation in the relevant ways.

398
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,280
But it's only as good as that. It's not a theory of reality.

399
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:19,280
So it's based, as you said, on a guess on the correspondence between what you might be doing in certain situations to something that is counterfactual.

400
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,280
Yes, exactly.

401
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:38,280
So inside me right now, I'm assuming that there are carbon-14 atoms decaying, that there is no-one doing that game of chance, that there's no sensible way in which you can prepare it to an idealised.

402
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:43,280
Making that game of chance, talking about if there's length of time, will take any given moment to decay.

403
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,280
I think we'll just let David reply to that.

404
01:05:46,280 --> 01:06:02,280
OK, well, you can. If you want to work out the half-life, then you simply have to imagine the situation in which these game players bet on how long it will take and what the rational thing for them to do is, and you'll find that the rational thing for them to do is to bet on an exponential decay.

405
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,280
And that's the problem.

406
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,280
So, once more, if we could do that.
