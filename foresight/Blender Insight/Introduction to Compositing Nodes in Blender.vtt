Hi and welcome to my introduction to the compositing notes in Cycle Splendor.

00:13.520 --> 00:20.040
And this is as I said just an introduction so I will go through the basic very briefly

00:20.040 --> 00:26.800
so you know what the compositing can do and then I will have new and other sessions that

00:26.800 --> 00:33.360
we go into the depth of each thing that we can manage in the compositing.

00:33.360 --> 00:38.160
But this is just an overview and we could go right into it.

00:38.160 --> 00:48.440
So you start with Shader 3D View on the Node Editor and the Node Editor Editor normally

00:48.440 --> 00:54.040
has the shader but we are going to use the compositing so we are selecting the second

00:54.040 --> 00:55.440
one here.

00:55.440 --> 00:59.880
And then you have three options, use nodes, backdrop and out render.

00:59.880 --> 01:05.760
And before I go through them we will start creating another windows as well where we

01:05.760 --> 01:09.440
select UV image editor.

01:09.440 --> 01:19.400
Okay, use nodes, normal as in shader, when you check it it gets two default nodes here

01:19.400 --> 01:25.560
and when it comes to compositing it's about the render layers and you have the composite.

01:25.560 --> 01:30.600
The render layer is the input and the composite is the output and then you can of course put

01:30.600 --> 01:34.400
a lot of nodes between them.

01:34.400 --> 01:41.880
When thinking about the compositing it's like you have done your 3D Blender object, you

01:41.880 --> 01:48.800
think you are finished and everything is fine then comes the compositing.

01:48.800 --> 01:56.640
You need to do some color adjustments, you need to perhaps add two images to merge them

01:56.640 --> 02:02.640
together, create one image of them, add some glare or whatever.

02:02.640 --> 02:08.280
In that case you should use the compositing and the compositing is also good for things

02:08.280 --> 02:13.720
like the camera tracking, doing visual effects and so on.

02:13.720 --> 02:21.840
Today we are going to add three images and then merge them together using different methods.

02:21.840 --> 02:27.240
But use nodes as we have checked here, we will add the default.

02:27.240 --> 02:33.640
Next thing we can use is backdrop if we want that and backdrop is to get the final image

02:33.640 --> 02:41.360
behind the nodes so we can see them and out render we do not need that this session and

02:41.360 --> 02:50.640
that is if you do something in 3D and you do a change on that one and want that to render

02:50.640 --> 02:56.440
again instead of going up here and select render you can just press out render and it

02:56.440 --> 03:07.680
will take in every change that you do automatically without your need to go to render.

03:07.680 --> 03:14.720
The setup will be as I said three images and I have written the links for those on the

03:14.720 --> 03:22.760
text below this video so you can just click on them and these are my own image that I

03:22.760 --> 03:31.160
did a few years ago and I have not used the compositing on that at all before this session

03:31.160 --> 03:39.640
but that one you should download and then we have pixels, pixels is a great place where

03:39.640 --> 03:46.720
you can get a lot of free images that you can use in several locations without any license

03:46.720 --> 03:53.600
problems at all so that's a good site and we will have a meadow for that one and finally

03:53.600 --> 04:02.320
I also found a good image to use as a background and all these free images are free to use

04:02.320 --> 04:08.240
and you can use them as you want to without any problems okay so download these and then

04:08.240 --> 04:15.280
we can start going back to a blender as I said this is the render layers and the render

04:15.280 --> 04:22.080
layers is connected to the freedom object that you're doing and it says render layers

04:22.080 --> 04:29.760
with an S because that you can have several layers when you do the rendering and separate

04:29.760 --> 04:36.680
those in the render part and then merge them together in the compositing but today we're

04:36.680 --> 04:44.840
just going to use the image so we can delete that one and select shift A and input and

04:44.840 --> 04:55.160
select an image and if I select that image and connect it to composite and I do a render

04:55.160 --> 05:00.440
you can see it's still black because we have not opened anything but we select opened and

05:00.440 --> 05:09.880
I select my images in here and you select your image and I start with my bulb and now

05:09.880 --> 05:17.000
you can see that I have the result here the bulbs and I have the image input here and

05:17.000 --> 05:25.840
the output here okay what I now can do is of course add another image which I will do so

05:25.840 --> 05:34.080
I will have an input an image and in this one I will put the meadow so compositing in

05:34.080 --> 05:41.040
my case meadow and then I have that one here and if I select that is that you will get

05:41.040 --> 05:48.640
the meadow here if you look at the result you can see that something is a little bit

05:48.640 --> 05:55.880
strange here because here you have this part of the flower and you'd miss it here and that

05:55.880 --> 06:04.880
is because of this image size it's much bigger than the render size and it just crops everything

06:04.880 --> 06:12.880
away that you that is outside that range so to use this image we need to adapt the scale

06:12.880 --> 06:22.640
for that image to be as the resulting image so there we can select shift A and distort

06:22.640 --> 06:30.440
and in distort you find scale so we put the scale in here and change it to render size

06:30.440 --> 06:35.680
and as soon as you change it to render size you get the complete image here then you can

06:35.680 --> 06:42.560
select if you want to stretch the image or you want to fit it in or crop the image so

06:42.560 --> 06:49.720
it's a little bit up to what type of image you're using if it's yeah how wide it is

06:49.720 --> 06:59.200
and so on so you find what you like to have in the parameters here so just put distortion

06:59.200 --> 07:06.720
and scale and you have that image okay as you could see of the result in the beginning

07:06.720 --> 07:18.120
of this session I will try to put this meadow behind the bulbs and it will show through

07:18.120 --> 07:25.000
the bulbs so we will see how we can do that so we connect the image again and now you

07:25.000 --> 07:39.880
can see the image here and what we now should do is take and try to take away the white

07:39.880 --> 07:47.560
in this and one thing that the compositing can do is key things away from an image you

07:47.560 --> 07:58.320
have a key and the key have different settings for let's say color or for difference between

07:58.320 --> 08:07.120
image or for something else you just need something to look on there you can see if

08:07.120 --> 08:13.440
you can see a pattern or color that you can take away then the key will do that so if

08:13.520 --> 08:23.760
you take the key in here and put the image into the key color or image and put that to

08:23.760 --> 08:35.320
the image here you could see that this the bulbs here will now be alpha here you will

08:35.320 --> 08:45.640
lose all the color so you could if you want to then just add that image into this as well

08:45.640 --> 08:55.600
and that you will do using shift A color and alpha over alpha over will put one picture

08:55.600 --> 09:07.320
above the other picture and if I now connect this as the picture in the bottom and I take

09:07.320 --> 09:20.080
the other one here at the top and press convert primal premultiply then we have the meadow

09:20.080 --> 09:29.080
behind the bulbs here then we of course need to do something to make it look a bit nicer I can

09:29.080 --> 09:39.480
make this be a little bit bigger like this okay you can see it's very hard edge here and it's not

09:39.480 --> 09:47.880
nice at all so what can we do we have a lot of parameters in key as you can see pre blur it's

09:47.880 --> 09:55.600
before doing the keying we blurred image then we will have also post blur that is that we

09:55.600 --> 10:07.760
will blur the image after we also have clipping depending on colors and we have dilute a road

10:07.760 --> 10:20.240
which is smoothing of the edges in that amount that we put in here and as you can see it will

10:20.240 --> 10:30.640
change when I change things here and you can see it gets smoother on on the edges by selecting post

10:30.640 --> 10:40.600
blur like this we could also get as you can see all did that white to go away a little bit since

10:40.600 --> 10:51.640
it's blurred away like this so you can play with these things and that part making that alpha was

10:51.640 --> 10:58.440
because of the key color here so we used the key color white and those were very white so if I had

10:58.440 --> 11:05.880
another color here like I don't know like this dark one then you could see that instead of all the

11:05.880 --> 11:15.920
white then the dark colors got the alpha instead got the transparency but in our case we should use

11:15.920 --> 11:23.280
the white so we take this little thing here and select the white and we are back to this image

11:23.280 --> 11:36.040
instead so it's not that hard to put in something in the bulbs using the compositor then we also had

11:36.040 --> 11:43.800
some effects it was a glowing kind of thing around this and that we can do in several steps so one

11:43.800 --> 11:54.720
of those is to add some type of filter and in our case we will use the Sunbeam and we will

11:54.720 --> 12:05.640
combine the Sunbeam with the result that we have here so I just put in the Sunbeam from the

12:05.640 --> 12:13.960
original image first of all and I can change the ray length and if I disconnect this one and put in

12:13.960 --> 12:23.040
that one you can see a little bit how it looks you will see that now you got these rays going out

12:23.040 --> 12:33.520
from each light source and the center is where I have placed the center from where it spread is in

12:34.240 --> 12:40.160
it's in these parameters so you have the width here so if you move that you will see that the

12:40.160 --> 12:45.520
shade it will change so now the center is a little bit more to the right and then you have the height

12:45.520 --> 12:54.040
here I think we could keep it on the center here it will be good and now we should connect that image

12:54.040 --> 13:03.120
with that image that we got here so then we ask her into shift A again and select color and some

13:03.360 --> 13:14.880
mix of that and if we take it like this then we have mixed it together but now it's one here so

13:14.880 --> 13:21.560
we have to take that one down so let's say that we take it to 0.5 or something like that then you

13:21.560 --> 13:29.440
can see now you see both the bulbs and this shining thing and you can see that you perhaps have to

13:29.440 --> 13:39.160
go a little bit lower than that so just try again like this and finally you think that okay this value

13:39.160 --> 13:50.680
is good and then you stop of course so something like this and then we also could change perhaps the

13:50.680 --> 13:56.680
strength of the colors the balance of the colors and so on and then you just put a color balance in

13:56.680 --> 14:01.920
so yes shift A again and color again and then you have the color balance and that normally you put

14:01.920 --> 14:11.680
in last in the compositing and here could then change the colors to get darker or get brighter but

14:11.680 --> 14:23.280
also to get gain some some brightness or yeah you see the values here you can change the gamma you

14:23.280 --> 14:28.800
can change the gain you can change the lift and so on and now you get a little bit clear picture here

14:28.800 --> 14:41.040
you can go up with the lift of colors and so on so it's a lot of changing but of course not just

14:41.040 --> 14:48.880
darkness and so you can also change if you want to have some different colors in there so now you

14:48.880 --> 14:56.880
have more jello since I changed the yellow color here could also be that they will go even lower on

14:56.880 --> 15:09.120
that one to get it out and if I want to have some extra glare before yeah for this image then I can

15:09.120 --> 15:18.280
put it in as well so just filter glare and I can decide where I want it I can say that I want it here

15:18.280 --> 15:26.320
and then change the threshold if it's one nothing will change but if it's zero you will see that

15:26.320 --> 15:38.480
it will be a quite different light on these so you can as normal change the value to something

15:38.480 --> 15:45.920
that you think it's okay and then you can decide what type of glare you would like to have so you

15:45.920 --> 15:53.440
can change it to ghost or to yeah whatever and that is just to try and see what what like what you

15:53.440 --> 16:03.760
like in this case you can see it's getting a nice type of effect it's like almost like a fog is around

16:03.760 --> 16:12.240
these bulbs and yeah you can just play with the values as you want to then as I said I also would

16:12.240 --> 16:27.240
like to have some type of we said free images so I'm to have a background where we have the ocean so

16:27.240 --> 16:38.240
how should we do that we used keying before to get the transparency or the alpha but another way

16:38.240 --> 16:45.960
to do it is use a mask so we can mask away things here as well and we will try that so if you go to

16:45.960 --> 16:55.600
this image and change the render image to the bulbs then we have the original image here and we change

16:55.600 --> 17:06.200
view to mask then we can work and create the mask over the image and then we just select new to get

17:06.200 --> 17:17.200
the name for the mask and we can just select it like I don't know sky some yeah yeah sky and now we

17:17.200 --> 17:25.280
should build it and to build the sky just press control and the mouse click and then you can just

17:25.280 --> 17:33.080
create a very easy and we can say we can have it on that or hide something like this and if you want

17:33.080 --> 17:41.240
to connect that point with the first point then you just hold on alt and see and now you have a mask

17:41.240 --> 17:52.080
to change this you can just click on the line and with control and you get a new

17:52.080 --> 18:03.480
something here I have three of these and then you can just move them around so we can get something

18:03.480 --> 18:15.280
and can put them out when you are doing a mask you can always try to put the points a little bit

18:15.280 --> 18:30.880
outside of the object that you would like the mask so I will drag them out just a little bit here

18:30.880 --> 18:40.600
and I will add another point here just hold control down and the mouse so then you get your

18:40.600 --> 18:50.120
another point where you would like to hide it something like this and here I need one point here

18:50.120 --> 18:58.640
I believe here and perhaps a few points here as well to be able to change things so I can go like this

18:58.640 --> 19:13.240
when you press point and then press V like this then you get different types of modifications that you

19:13.240 --> 19:21.480
can use so if I use like this align single I get this handle here and then I can take that handle

19:21.480 --> 19:32.680
and I can drag it up and down and move it a little bit to get a soft corner I can do I can take another

19:32.680 --> 19:41.440
type here if I want to so they are not connected in any way so that makes that in this way you can make it

19:41.440 --> 19:48.440
very very good I will not do all of these things because it will take some time but you will see now

19:48.440 --> 19:57.160
I have some type of mask here in a way that is called sky and again I'll go back to view it is still

19:57.160 --> 20:05.520
saved even you can't see it and we can put it in here if you want to so I can now shift a input

20:05.520 --> 20:17.880
an image appears somewhere and in that image I will put that ocean picture that we had so

20:17.880 --> 20:26.080
compositing and I think it will do like this and then we have this one and now I have this ocean here

20:26.080 --> 20:41.040
and I would try to put that ocean into my image of course so I then take another mix here

20:41.040 --> 20:57.440
so color mix put them together and I can do like this you can see the render result when I am working

20:57.440 --> 21:02.120
like this okay and then of course we need the other image as well

21:11.040 --> 21:21.440
and now you can see it's going above each other and we do not like that so then we can take

21:21.440 --> 21:30.080
another input and this time you can use mask and in this little face here you can select what type

21:30.080 --> 21:35.920
of mask you want because now we created one but you can have as many as you want to and then you

21:35.920 --> 21:42.640
put that mask into the factor to decide where you would like to mask the picture and where it

21:42.640 --> 21:49.120
doesn't want to so now you can see now the bulbs are masked away and if it's getting like that then

21:49.120 --> 21:57.960
it's just to invert these and you will then get the other way around of course so now you can see

21:58.360 --> 22:06.520
as I said before I didn't do it so very very carefully but you can see now how it's done here

22:07.720 --> 22:16.520
it looks like it's cut out and doesn't look so smooth and so on so how to change that well

22:17.480 --> 22:29.640
that you can do by putting in a feather in here so shift A and in the let's see in the filter

22:30.440 --> 22:38.440
you have dilate a road so select that one and put it in here and select feather and if I take

22:38.520 --> 22:48.520
that up like this you will see now that it will shrink around everything and make a very very

22:49.960 --> 22:59.720
nice round thing here but it is blurry and if I can go a little bit less then will be less

22:59.720 --> 23:06.760
blur of course and that is a little bit how good you have been with the mask now if you have done

23:06.760 --> 23:13.240
something wrong it's not that hard to change the mask again because all you have to do is go back

23:13.240 --> 23:21.320
to the view again and select mask again and as you can see I had some really bad issues here so

23:21.320 --> 23:31.560
then I just change that and as soon as I change it it will be affected of on here so it will you

23:31.560 --> 23:39.160
can always see how it will look here so then you can fine tune it as much as you want until you are

23:39.160 --> 23:51.000
satisfied with this mask so go back to view again and you can get this as I said a really good result

23:51.000 --> 23:58.680
but you have to work a little bit with your image to make it as good as you want to the distance

23:58.680 --> 24:09.080
could go both ways now we go up and it cuts nearer these bulbs you can also have a negative number

24:09.720 --> 24:18.200
and then it will go the other way around so then it will take from go out instead of go

24:18.200 --> 24:25.400
instead of going into these bulbs so that is a little bit how that works the only thing I

24:25.400 --> 24:34.040
will show you more this time is how to check the image before it reaches the end because you have

24:34.040 --> 24:42.920
something here that is output viewer and you can have as many viewers as you want to and if you

24:42.920 --> 24:54.520
connect that viewer to something like I connected to the image here or whatever then I get the back

24:54.520 --> 25:05.080
drop here to work and now when I look at my backdrop I can see everything from where I connect this

25:05.080 --> 25:13.480
viewer and now I have it on the ocean I can add another one so shift input sorry output

25:14.440 --> 25:20.920
output viewer and I connect that too let's see why not here like that

25:22.520 --> 25:30.680
and then the backdrop will be from this viewer and if I now select that viewer I will be back here

25:30.680 --> 25:38.520
so it's very easy if I want to work with a complicated node to have a lot of viewers and then

25:38.520 --> 25:47.560
select whatever view I would like to see for the moment and to change the size of the backdrop

25:47.560 --> 25:59.080
it's very easy yes press V to go back and then Alt V to zoom in and that is the basic and I will

25:59.080 --> 26:06.840
as I said go through everything that is to know about the compositing also how you do all the

26:06.840 --> 26:14.680
effects camera tracking and everything but that will take in later sessions small steps just so

26:14.680 --> 26:21.640
learn and I hope you learned something this time as well and if you think it's interesting and would

26:21.640 --> 26:28.920
like to see more then just subscribe and have a nice day bye
