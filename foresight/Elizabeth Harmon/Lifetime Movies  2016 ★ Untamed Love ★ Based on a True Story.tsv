0	18000	Come here. Stay right there. Stay right there.
31000	33000	No, no, no.
33000	35000	No, no, no.
58000	60000	I'm sorry.
60000	62000	Yeah, the lady...
62000	64000	The cage tipped over in here.
64000	66000	Hold her. It's okay. Just hold her.
66000	68000	Yeah, there. Okay.
68000	71000	But the lady inside told me that you're Mr. Bernard.
71000	73000	Bernard, yep. That's me.
73000	76000	My name is Miguel Prado. I'm supposed to be your assistant.
76000	78000	Oh, great. Great.
78000	80000	Yes, I'm from Social Services.
80000	84000	I could get my slip right here from the unemployment department.
84000	86000	Unemployment?
86000	87000	Yes.
87000	90000	Do you have any training? Any experience?
90000	93000	Sure I do. You know, they send me out on all kinds of jobs.
93000	95000	You know, I do everything.
95000	98000	Painting houses, unloading computers, that kind of stuff.
104000	107000	Hold on. I'll be right back.
109000	111000	Carol.
111000	113000	That young man just introduced himself.
113000	115000	Happy New Year, Margaret. Have a good holiday.
115000	119000	Happy New Year. That young man just introduced himself as my new aide from unemployment.
119000	123000	What happened to my full-time experience teaching assistant?
123000	126000	You're lucky to get anybody. There is no money in the budget.
126000	129000	I had to take some money out of maintenance just to pay him.
129000	131000	Figures.
131000	133000	Oh, what happened at the school board meeting?
133000	136000	Did they approve my class heading recess with the rest of the school?
136000	140000	Oh, no. Margaret, that wasn't discussed. We ran out of time.
140000	142000	Why? You were going to bring it up.
142000	144000	But there just wasn't time.
144000	146000	This is not the most pressing issue.
146000	148000	Come on, buddy. It's okay.
148000	150000	It's okay. Come on. Come on.
150000	152000	Come on, buddy. Come on.
152000	154000	Come on.
154000	156000	Hold on a minute.
156000	158000	It's all right. Come on.
158000	160000	I'll take care of you.
160000	162000	There you go.
163000	165000	Carol.
165000	168000	You promised. You said this was the time. You were going to bring it up.
168000	172000	Look, we have had a special ed class in this school for, what, five years?
172000	175000	And it's always been separate from the rest of the school.
175000	177000	It works best that way. Why change it?
177000	178000	The parents are comfortable.
178000	179000	The parents are comfortable?
179000	180000	Yeah.
180000	183000	Harold, I have six very challenged kids in my class.
183000	186000	What about what makes them feel comfortable?
186000	190000	Margaret, I don't even know if we're going to have a special ed class next year.
190000	192000	I don't know if we can afford it.
192000	196000	Now, things are going very well for your class this year, right?
196000	198000	So don't rock the boat.
200000	205000	The Rudds wish me to stress their son has second degree burns on 80% of his body.
205000	207000	I understand, Mrs. Miyako.
207000	211000	My question, however, related to Caitlyn and why she's acting out this kind of violence.
211000	215000	But, Your Honor, what Caitlyn Eldridge did is more than acting out.
215000	218000	It's psychotic and dangerous.
218000	221000	This child must be institutionalized.
222000	227000	Ms. Brown, it's up to you to suggest an alternative.
227000	233000	Social services tried, but that doesn't seem to be one with her history.
233000	235000	Can I say something?
235000	238000	Don't go ahead, Mrs. Rudd.
239000	248000	When this sick child tied Tommy to a tree and set a match to a...
248000	252000	She turned my son into some kind of a freak.
252000	256000	Now, he has to deal with that pain for the rest of his life.
256000	258000	And so do we.
261000	264000	I want you to put her away, Judge.
264000	268000	So she can't never hurt another kid like she done mine.
278000	282000	Don't look at me, Judge. I can't control her. No way.
282000	284000	But you're her father, Mr. Eldridge.
284000	287000	I don't make no difference.
287000	290000	She just turned out bad. That's all.
300000	302000	Caitlyn?
308000	310000	Caitlyn?
311000	313000	This isn't easy, is it?
313000	316000	Well, maybe you can help me.
316000	320000	Can you tell me why you did what you did?
322000	324000	Caitlyn?
327000	331000	You see? What did I tell you?
332000	338000	Good morning, Lisa Anne. Good morning, sweetheart.
338000	341000	All right, let's try it. Good morning, Maggie.
341000	345000	Good morning, Maggie. Look at my nose. Look at my nose.
345000	349000	Okay, give me some air. Like a big girl. Come on, give me air.
349000	353000	That's a good try. We'll work on it, all right? Let's go sing.
353000	355000	Come on, sweetheart. Let's go sing.
362000	364000	Where do you want me to put this stuff?
364000	367000	Oh, just put it on the plant table and the rest of stuff in the fridge.
367000	370000	I want to be the fish.
370000	374000	I want you to be a big boy now, remember? It's Bradley, the big boy.
374000	376000	I want to be the fish.
376000	379000	Jordan, you can come on and boss it down.
379000	381000	Crap. Crap.
381000	384000	All right, hang it up. Here we go. Everything's fine.
384000	386000	All right.
388000	391000	Come on, Derek, big boy. Take the thumb out of your mouth. That's it.
391000	393000	Stand up. There you go.
393000	395000	Now we're going to have our morning circle.
395000	397000	Jordan, stop. Okay, sit down. Right here.
397000	401000	I don't know. Come on, circle. Come on. Right here, next to Shanice.
401000	404000	There you go. Okay.
404000	406000	Want to chime out?
406000	408000	No. All right. Stand up there.
408000	410000	Get your body in control.
410000	413000	Okay. Good. Let's say morning song.
413000	415000	There you go.
415000	417000	Jorge.
421000	423000	Christmas is over.
423000	425000	Christmas is over.
425000	429000	That's it. I know Christmas is over, but this is so beautiful.
429000	431000	And we're going to hang it up all year round.
431000	433000	It's good to see you all.
433000	435000	Take off your jacket.
435000	437000	And get ready to sing and do the play.
437000	439000	Miguel, help him with his coat.
439000	441000	Because his mother has to drive.
441000	443000	Come on.
447000	450000	Okay. We're a pretty wild group here after vacation, huh?
450000	453000	Okay. Everybody sitting ready? Bradley, sitting ready?
453000	457000	Okay. Make room for our new guest.
457000	460000	His name. I'm not going to tell you his name.
460000	462000	Do you notice anybody who's new in the group?
462000	463000	Him.
463000	466000	Him and him has a name and his name is what?
466000	468000	Miguel.
468000	470000	And he's going to help us, okay?
470000	472000	Bradley, come here.
472000	474000	See you in just a second.
474000	476000	Sam, could you wait just a minute, please? Thanks.
476000	478000	Bradley, I want you to come sit here.
478000	480000	Come on, Bradley.
480000	484000	Come on. I mean, a child that sets other children on fire.
484000	486000	You've got to be kidding.
486000	488000	Foster care won't touch it.
488000	490000	My father's no help.
490000	493000	What about homebound? Why can't a teacher go to our house?
493000	496000	Nobody will go. Everybody's scared of this little...
496000	499000	Well, I'm scared. And I'm scared for my kids.
499000	501000	Sam, don't do this to me.
501000	503000	Where are you going?
503000	505000	No words.
509000	511000	Listen, I got to get back.
511000	513000	My kids have finally calmed down.
513000	517000	You know, it took four months, but they formed a cohesive group.
517000	519000	They finally feel safe.
519000	522000	You bring a child like this into my class and everything's going to explode.
522000	524000	It's nothing we can do.
524000	526000	The law says the girl deserves to go to school.
526000	529000	She has a right to go to school.
535000	537000	What are you going to do with that?
537000	541000	Keep it, but they don't give them as a quick mention of the garbage glass.
544000	548000	And so the evil queen asked for a magic mirror.
548000	550000	Here's the magic mirror.
552000	554000	Okay, which one is two?
554000	556000	One is two.
556000	559000	This one is two.
565000	567000	What number is this?
567000	568000	One.
568000	569000	What number is this?
569000	570000	Two.
570000	571000	What number is this?
571000	572000	Three.
572000	575000	My turn! No!
575000	577000	My turn! No!
577000	578000	Okay, got it.
578000	580000	Which one's two?
580000	582000	One is two.
582000	583000	Bradley?
583000	584000	Which one?
584000	585000	Bradley, go sit down.
585000	587000	Okay, keep going, keep going.
587000	588000	No window.
588000	589000	No window.
589000	590000	Okay, which one's two?
590000	592000	Let's go back.
592000	596000	One is two.
599000	602000	Oh, and when you're working with Derek, don't rush to give him the answer.
602000	603000	You know, be patient.
603000	605000	He'll surprise you sometimes.
605000	607000	Is it like this every day?
607000	610000	First days after vacation are pretty tough.
610000	612000	Tomorrow should be better.
612000	613000	See you in the morning.
613000	615000	I don't know if I can be here tomorrow.
615000	619000	I have to go to an appointment tomorrow, you know, and check in.
619000	620000	You'll be here.
620000	622000	You have a knack for this.
630000	632000	Finished.
632000	633000	What time is it?
633000	635000	That was our clue.
635000	638000	Oh, man, four hours to do that closing statement.
638000	640000	I'm not even charging the client.
640000	642000	I get angry they don't make me a partner.
642000	643000	Screwed up priorities, huh?
643000	645000	I like your priorities.
645000	646000	Oh.
646000	649000	This intake information sheet on the new kid, I get...
649000	650000	Ah!
650000	651000	How is it?
651000	653000	It's unbelievable.
653000	655000	You get her tomorrow?
655000	659000	I should have had a lawyer in a baseball cap plead my case.
659000	661000	You would charge her.
661000	664000	I bet you would.
664000	665000	God.
665000	668000	I mean, just read this, attacks other children.
668000	672000	She destroys properties, smears feces on the wall.
672000	678000	And then this underlining red, unteachable child.
678000	680000	No match for you.
680000	681000	It's not funny.
681000	683000	It's frightening.
683000	685000	Take a compliment, huh?
685000	687000	You'll handle her.
687000	690000	You'll connect.
691000	693000	I got it out.
693000	696000	I can't have finished my plan.
702000	704000	You know, we should have a rule.
704000	706000	The first one who finishes their homework,
706000	708000	the other one has to take some time out.
708000	711000	And we just hang together.
711000	714000	Oh, so it's my house and you're making the rules?
714000	716000	I live here most of the time.
716000	718000	This is where I hang my hats.
718000	721000	I should get some jurisdiction.
721000	724000	Good night, teacher.
738000	741000	Everything I know better you have in that file when you're off.
741000	743000	Okay, okay, I'll read it.
743000	745000	Yes.
745000	748000	Now, what do you suppose it might feel like
748000	751000	if you were new to some place and you didn't know anybody?
751000	753000	What would that feel like?
753000	755000	Or hey?
755000	757000	Really bad.
757000	758000	I've had enough.
758000	760000	Yeah, what did that feel like right here?
760000	762000	I don't know. She stinks.
762000	764000	Jordan, I don't want her sitting near me.
764000	766000	She'll spit me out.
766000	768000	She does stink like pee.
768000	769000	She needs help.
769000	771000	You're being very rude. That's dumb.
771000	774000	What do you think it feels like to tell someone that they stink?
774000	777000	It's terrible. It stinks terrible.
777000	779000	It hurt my feelings.
779000	780000	Thank you, Horey.
780000	783000	And what might be a better way that we could teach her?
783000	786000	You can learn her in private.
786000	789000	That she stinks.
789000	792000	And she wouldn't have to change her colors.
792000	794000	That's great. Good talking, too.
794000	796000	What else? What else do we do?
796000	798000	We could pluck up our nose.
798000	800000	Ready?
800000	802000	Backward. All of you.
803000	805000	Okay, Derek, that's it.
805000	807000	I don't want you to go any higher, okay?
807000	808000	All right.
808000	810000	Jordan, Jordan's slow.
810000	811000	Take it easy.
811000	812000	I'm going to the very top.
812000	813000	Nobody else can come up here.
813000	815000	She can come up here.
815000	816000	No!
816000	818000	Stop! Get out of my playroom!
818000	819000	Come on!
819000	821000	Get away from me!
821000	822000	Don't come up here.
822000	823000	Maybe you may be.
823000	825000	Caitlin, if you'd like to play, you can join us.
825000	826000	Come on!
826000	828000	I want to be the only one out here.
828000	830000	Nobody else can come up here.
831000	832000	Get down!
833000	834000	Okay.
834000	836000	Jordan, watch where he's stepping.
836000	838000	All right. Thank you very much.
841000	842000	What's up, Derek?
842000	843000	There you go.
843000	844000	Let's go back there.
844000	845000	Come on.
848000	850000	I got a cheese.
861000	862000	Wow.
863000	866000	Caitlin was deserted by her mother at the age of four
866000	869000	and then left with her father, who was on welfare.
870000	873000	Her father spent time in state prison for theft
874000	877000	and she's currently residing with her father in a trader park.
880000	881000	Wow.
881000	883000	Her options closed pretty early, didn't they?
883000	884000	I don't know.
884000	885000	I don't know.
885000	887000	I didn't give her any work yet.
887000	889000	Well, you know, it's temporary.
889000	891000	You don't have to teach her.
891000	892000	Just let her sit.
892000	894000	And just do nothing?
894000	896000	I think it would be easier on the other kids
896000	898000	not to stir this one up.
900000	901000	Carol, I'm sorry.
901000	902000	I'm sorry.
902000	903000	I'm sorry.
903000	904000	I'm sorry.
904000	905000	I'm sorry.
905000	906000	I'm sorry.
906000	907000	I'm sorry.
907000	908000	I'm sorry.
908000	909000	I'm sorry.
909000	910000	I'm sorry.
910000	911000	I'm sorry.
911000	912000	I'm sorry.
912000	913000	I'm sorry.
913000	914000	I'm sorry.
915000	918000	Carol, speaking of being kinder to my kids,
918000	920000	will you please talk to the school board
920000	922000	about recess with the rest of the school?
922000	924000	When the time is right, I will.
930000	931000	You think you will?
931000	932000	Yeah.
933000	935000	I found him hard enough.
936000	938000	I think you're pretty good at pounding.
939000	941000	Yeah, I am, aren't I?
941000	942000	Come on.
945000	947000	You have a cuddle.
953000	955000	You didn't say hello to Melissa.
956000	957000	Hello.
959000	960000	Here, everybody.
960000	961000	Discussion time.
961000	963000	Help him out with this mockery.
963000	964000	Thanks, Miguel.
964000	965000	Go ahead.
966000	967000	Go ahead.
967000	968000	Good luck, discussion.
968000	969000	Good luck, discussion.
972000	974000	Bradley, my push book.
978000	979000	Caitlin.
981000	982000	Caitlin.
982000	983000	We need to have a talk.
983000	984000	Now, listen.
984000	986000	We went over the rules in class, right?
986000	989000	And one of the rules is you have to try to talk.
989000	992000	Now, I know it's really hard, but I need you to try.
992000	995000	Shanice didn't talk when she first came here.
995000	996000	Nathan did, Derek.
996000	997000	Okay?
997000	1000000	And the next rule is that I want you to participate in discussion.
1000000	1002000	Or we all get together as a group.
1002000	1004000	And we talk about our feelings.
1004000	1005000	All right?
1005000	1007000	Come on, let's go.
1007000	1008000	Come on, sweetheart.
1010000	1011000	Come here.
1019000	1020000	Push her down the toilet.
1020000	1021000	She's crap.
1021000	1022000	Crap.
1022000	1023000	No.
1023000	1024000	No.
1024000	1025000	No.
1025000	1026000	Push her down the toilet.
1026000	1027000	She's crap.
1027000	1028000	Come on.
1028000	1029000	Come on.
1029000	1030000	No.
1030000	1031000	No.
1031000	1032000	No.
1032000	1033000	No.
1033000	1034000	No.
1034000	1035000	No.
1035000	1036000	No.
1036000	1037000	No.
1037000	1038000	No.
1038000	1039000	No.
1039000	1040000	No.
1040000	1041000	No.
1041000	1042000	No.
1042000	1043000	No.
1043000	1044000	No.
1044000	1045000	No.
1045000	1046000	No.
1046000	1047000	No.
1047000	1048000	No.
1048000	1049000	No.
1049000	1050000	No.
1050000	1051000	No.
1051000	1052000	Are you ready?
1062000	1063000	When you're ready.
1064000	1066000	You can come and join us.
1073000	1076000	Well, it was the first blind date I've been on since high school.
1076000	1077000	Ooh.
1077000	1078000	So what was he like?
1078000	1080000	Well, he wasn't exactly handsome.
1080000	1083000	It wasn't exactly handsome, I'd call it more like distinguished.
1083000	1085000	Oh, so it was a dog.
1085000	1087000	No, he wasn't a dog. He was not a dog.
1087000	1090000	What are you doing? He was...
1090000	1092000	He was a dog.
1092000	1094000	He was a dog.
1094000	1097000	He was barking, baby. Let me tell you, he was barking.
1097000	1101000	Miss Bernard, some girl's throwing stuff all over the classroom.
1101000	1104000	Come on, give me the pencil. Give it to me.
1104000	1106000	Kaelin, give me the pencil. Give me the pencil.
1106000	1109000	Give me the pencil. Kaelin, give it to me. Give it.
1109000	1111000	Kaelin, give me the pencil. Give me the pencil.
1111000	1113000	Kaelin, give me the pencil. Kaelin, give me the pencil.
1113000	1115000	Kaelin, give me the pencil.
1115000	1117000	Stop. Stop.
1117000	1119000	Grab your shoe.
1119000	1121000	Stop.
1121000	1123000	Stop.
1123000	1125000	Help me.
1125000	1127000	Help me, baby.
1127000	1129000	Help me.
1129000	1131000	Help me.
1133000	1135000	What is happening this evening?
1135000	1137000	Help me.
1137000	1139000	I'm going to die.
1139000	1141000	I'm going to die.
1141000	1143000	I'm going to die.
1147000	1149000	With a child like Kaelin Eldridge,
1149000	1151000	there is always going to be potential danger.
1151000	1153000	Look.
1153000	1155000	The bottom line is
1155000	1157000	everybody is concerned
1157000	1159000	what are we going to do about this?
1159000	1161000	Serve better coffee than seven in the morning starters.
1165000	1167000	We're better.
1167000	1169000	What about social services,
1169000	1171000	putting more pressure on the hospital
1171000	1173000	and officially force them
1173000	1175000	to make an opening for her and take her in?
1175000	1177000	I mean, like next week.
1177000	1179000	We can try. I don't know that it will do any good,
1179000	1181000	but we can try.
1181000	1183000	And until then,
1183000	1185000	I was wondering, I mean,
1185000	1187000	are we all going to celebrate when we send this little girl
1187000	1189000	to the mental hospital,
1189000	1191000	knowing that she probably will never get out again?
1191000	1193000	No, I'm confused.
1193000	1195000	Are you going to class indefinitely
1195000	1197000	after the goldfish catastrophe yesterday?
1197000	1199000	I mean...
1199000	1201000	No.
1201000	1203000	No, I don't.
1203000	1205000	Okay, so we're all agreed.
1205000	1207000	Let's get her in the hospital as soon as possible, right?
1207000	1209000	Meantime, Maggie,
1209000	1211000	you should have lunch with your class every day
1211000	1213000	as long as she's with us, all right?
1213000	1215000	Great.
1219000	1221000	Guess what?
1221000	1223000	I'm supposed to tell you
1223000	1225000	that Caitlin's early this morning
1225000	1227000	and from now on.
1227000	1229000	What are you talking about?
1229000	1231000	Well, the only bus that connects with her home,
1231000	1233000	I guess it's very far, is the high school bus.
1233000	1235000	So she'll be arriving here half an hour early every day.
1235000	1237000	You're kidding me.
1237000	1239000	And then the afternoon, the bus will leave
1239000	1241000	from the high school one hour after your class.
1241000	1243000	What are you talking about?
1243000	1245000	She has to wait here.
1245000	1247000	Here, here.
1247000	1249000	Look, I was in the office getting my mail.
1249000	1251000	Carmen says it's only temporary.
1251000	1253000	She's probably going into the hospital a lot.
1257000	1259000	Have a good day.
1265000	1267000	The Marvel's realm is a death ray.
1267000	1269000	It's not a death ray and she's not going to hurt you.
1269000	1271000	I want you to go back and do your letters, all right?
1271000	1273000	You're a good mailman and you're doing a great job.
1279000	1281000	Okay.
1283000	1285000	I bet you, uh,
1285000	1287000	don't know how many Marvel's you've got.
1287000	1289000	Okay.
1289000	1291000	How many Marvel's?
1291000	1293000	Do you have one?
1295000	1297000	Get up.
1297000	1299000	It's time to do some math. Come on.
1299000	1301000	We're going to do math.
1301000	1303000	No.
1303000	1305000	No.
1305000	1307000	Right here.
1307000	1309000	Get some blocks.
1313000	1315000	Okay.
1315000	1317000	All right.
1317000	1319000	I want you to take your hand.
1319000	1321000	Okay. And I want you to count three.
1321000	1323000	Count three.
1323000	1325000	All right. I'm going to help you.
1325000	1327000	One.
1327000	1329000	Two.
1329000	1331000	Bradley, come back.
1331000	1333000	Come back here and finish your work.
1333000	1335000	That is not acceptable.
1335000	1337000	Now, we're going to do it again.
1341000	1343000	I'll help you.
1343000	1345000	Ready?
1347000	1349000	One.
1349000	1351000	Two.
1353000	1355000	It's unacceptable.
1355000	1357000	Right now.
1357000	1359000	Miguel, don't have to resist.
1359000	1361000	Now?
1361000	1363000	Everybody, it's recess.
1363000	1365000	We don't have the other kids like we talked about.
1365000	1367000	But it's not your time.
1367000	1369000	What the hell with their time?
1369000	1371000	You take them out now.
1371000	1373000	No.
1373000	1375000	Yes.
1375000	1377000	No.
1377000	1379000	No.
1379000	1381000	We're doing math.
1381000	1383000	Yes.
1383000	1385000	Yes.
1385000	1387000	No.
1387000	1389000	It's time for you to learn.
1389000	1391000	We're going to learn.
1391000	1393000	No.
1393000	1395000	No.
1395000	1397000	No.
1397000	1399000	Yes.
1401000	1403000	You know, most of the time, Katelyn still stinks.
1403000	1405000	Like a toilet.
1405000	1407000	She'd be on that side from rabbit.
1407000	1409000	Come on, Jordan. Don't make fun, okay?
1409000	1413000	If we had a pancake, Katelyn should be on the side with the pancake.
1413000	1415000	Do you like my picture?
1415000	1417000	Yeah. Yeah. And I could treat.
1417000	1419000	You remember what Maggie said about being nice?
1419000	1421000	About being kind, huh? Hey, hey, you remember?
1421000	1423000	No.
1423000	1425000	Come on, go back and do your work.
1425000	1427000	Come on, finish what you're doing.
1427000	1429000	All right, Stacy.
1429000	1431000	Stop laughing now.
1431000	1433000	Come on, let's go back to work.
1445000	1447000	Get ready. I want you to find number four.
1447000	1449000	Good job.
1449000	1451000	You're number five.
1453000	1455000	All right, great.
1455000	1457000	Ready?
1459000	1461000	We have to go pee.
1461000	1463000	You can go to the bathroom.
1463000	1465000	And then we'll do some math, right?
1465000	1467000	Right?
1477000	1479000	Okay.
1483000	1485000	All right.
1487000	1489000	Count out three.
1495000	1497000	Good.
1497000	1499000	Show me ten.
1507000	1509000	Okay.
1509000	1511000	How about two plus two?
1513000	1515000	All right, I'm going to get you on this one.
1515000	1517000	Fifteen, take away nine.
1525000	1527000	Pretty smart, aren't you?
1531000	1533000	Let's try some more.
1533000	1535000	I mean, do you know how phenomenal that is?
1535000	1537000	Yeah, I think I do.
1537000	1539000	Because the hardest part of this job
1539000	1541000	is that you can't ever really change these kids.
1541000	1543000	I mean, no matter what.
1543000	1545000	Because their brain is actually impaired in some way.
1545000	1547000	Well, that doesn't stop you.
1547000	1549000	I mean, Lisa Ann and Derek, they're autistic.
1549000	1551000	I can't exactly set a goal for them.
1551000	1553000	So it's basically a day-to-day kind of trying
1553000	1555000	to hold them together.
1555000	1557000	But then with Caitlyn, you know,
1557000	1559000	she opened up like that.
1559000	1561000	It was a dream.
1561000	1563000	I mean, what's the matter?
1563000	1565000	I mean, I don't know if she can read yet.
1565000	1567000	And I don't know if she's ever going to open up again,
1567000	1569000	but I reached her.
1569000	1571000	Okay. This is it.
1571000	1573000	What do you think?
1573000	1575000	It's okay. Do you know what I'm saying to you?
1575000	1577000	Okay, I thought it was perfect for over the kitchen table.
1577000	1579000	You're not listening to me. Do you know what I'm trying to tell you?
1579000	1581000	Yes, I hear what you're trying to tell me.
1581000	1583000	So enough of your kids, okay? We're going to interior decorate.
1583000	1585000	But that's the point. She's not like the other kids.
1585000	1587000	She's different.
1587000	1589000	Maggie, look.
1589000	1591000	Can we just focus on that for one minute?
1595000	1597000	It's nice.
1597000	1599000	It's a light.
1599000	1601000	I'm sorry. I thought it was a porridge.
1613000	1615000	Do you feel hurt? Guy can tell you fast, please.
1615000	1617000	What I feel behind on, I've been trying to corner this guy for two days.
1617000	1619000	Can I just steal him for a minute?
1619000	1621000	Yeah. Thanks.
1621000	1623000	We need to figure this out before lunch.
1623000	1625000	I don't know. I'll try.
1625000	1627000	Carol, have you heard about Caitlin?
1627000	1629000	What about her?
1629000	1631000	An opening in the hospital. I mean, they haven't gotten her in yet.
1631000	1633000	I can't believe they're taking so long.
1633000	1635000	I'll call again today, okay?
1635000	1637000	No. Listen, something phenomenal has happened.
1637000	1639000	She is reading at a third grade level.
1639000	1641000	She's doing second grade math.
1641000	1643000	And then I had Donald test her IQ yesterday.
1643000	1645000	We are talking 168.
1645000	1647000	Huh. Read.
1647000	1649000	Yeah, ask him. He'll tell you 168.
1649000	1651000	That's genius.
1651000	1653000	I mean, to put a little girl like that in a mental hospital,
1653000	1655000	it's just, it's a tragedy.
1655000	1657000	She's going to revert back to her behavior,
1657000	1659000	and of course, I'll have to punish her.
1661000	1663000	Can we appeal the decision?
1663000	1665000	Can who appeal?
1665000	1667000	The school board.
1667000	1669000	Based on her ability.
1669000	1671000	And her behavior now.
1671000	1673000	No outbursts, no fighting, nothing destructive.
1673000	1675000	I mean, she's almost like a new child.
1675000	1677000	Oh, but that's true.
1677000	1679000	You really deserve your reputation, don't you?
1679000	1681000	Crazy kids, crazy teacher.
1681000	1683000	Yeah.
1683000	1685000	Oh, one other thing.
1685000	1687000	The recesses are going great,
1687000	1689000	and can we have assembly with the rest of the classes?
1689000	1691000	Maybe.
1691000	1693000	One thing at a time, okay?
1693000	1695000	Okay.
1695000	1697000	But you will try to find out about appealing the court decision.
1697000	1699000	You want to know what troubles me most
1699000	1701000	about that little girl's future?
1701000	1703000	According to her file,
1703000	1705000	she never cries,
1705000	1707000	and a child that never cries,
1707000	1709000	that's inhuman.
1709000	1711000	You've never seen that before, haven't you?
1711000	1713000	I've seen a lot of things in my class
1713000	1715000	that I've never seen before.
1715000	1717000	Very human.
1717000	1719000	You know what?
1719000	1721000	Melissa's going to a party tonight.
1721000	1723000	She is? Yeah, you going to go with her?
1723000	1725000	No.
1725000	1727000	She's going to go by herself?
1727000	1729000	Yeah, I'm just going to take her.
1729000	1731000	But you're going to drop her off?
1731000	1733000	Oh, you figure it out.
1733000	1735000	Oh, good. Well, you run off,
1735000	1737000	and I'll see you tomorrow, sweetie. Bye-bye.
1737000	1739000	Bye-bye.
1747000	1749000	Caitlin.
1749000	1751000	Where's we?
1751000	1753000	I've got a great idea.
1753000	1755000	Come on.
1759000	1761000	Okay.
1761000	1763000	I thought we could
1763000	1765000	comb your hair out so it looks just like mine.
1765000	1767000	Now, hmm.
1767000	1769000	How come you're being nice to me?
1769000	1771000	Because I like you.
1771000	1773000	Okay?
1773000	1775000	Now I'm going to put the other bread in.
1775000	1777000	I just
1777000	1779000	like
1779000	1781000	that.
1781000	1783000	Maybe tomorrow
1783000	1785000	we'll give it a wash, okay?
1785000	1787000	You ready?
1787000	1789000	You look
1789000	1791000	beautiful, Caitlin.
1799000	1801000	My pa,
1801000	1803000	he'll take him away
1803000	1805000	and say I stole him.
1805000	1807000	Nobody ever gave
1807000	1809000	me nothing.
1809000	1811000	I'll tell you what.
1811000	1813000	Why don't you wear them when you're in school?
1813000	1815000	And then I'll keep them
1815000	1817000	very safe for you at night.
1817000	1819000	Okay?
1819000	1821000	Okay.
1831000	1833000	It's too big to carry around.
1835000	1837000	For
1837000	1839000	almost a year together.
1839000	1841000	My appreciation.
1845000	1847000	Open it.
1855000	1857000	They're beautiful.
1857000	1859000	I've never had real pearls before.
1859000	1861000	They are real, aren't they?
1863000	1865000	There.
1869000	1871000	I don't know what to say.
1871000	1873000	I love you, Maggie.
1875000	1877000	Let's get married, okay?
1879000	1881000	I...
1881000	1883000	Well?
1887000	1889000	Well, why are you changing the rules?
1889000	1891000	I mean, we've had such a great year.
1891000	1893000	I want the next one to be even better.
1893000	1895000	We bought a lamp together.
1895000	1897000	Two of my bosses came
1897000	1899000	into my office this afternoon.
1899000	1901000	That partnership's going to happen.
1901000	1903000	You're kidding.
1903000	1905000	Wonderful.
1905000	1907000	Congratulations. Thank you.
1907000	1909000	Why didn't you tell me? I am telling you.
1909000	1911000	I've screwed up so many relationships in my time.
1911000	1913000	Now that I finally got it right,
1913000	1915000	I thought, you know...
1915000	1917000	Thank you.
1917000	1919000	At the end of the summer,
1919000	1921000	they owe me three weeks and you've got your summer application.
1921000	1923000	Damn.
1923000	1925000	I've applied to go back and get my doctorate.
1925000	1927000	You know that.
1927000	1929000	I mean, you said you weren't sure.
1929000	1931000	Well, I might need that degree if I go back
1931000	1933000	to college someday.
1933000	1935000	I just have to
1935000	1937000	feel that it's right.
1937000	1939000	I need
1939000	1941000	to feel a buzz, you know?
1941000	1943000	Yeah, I've seen it go off
1943000	1945000	about that kid in your class.
1945000	1947000	And, uh...
1947000	1949000	you and me?
1949000	1951000	There isn't a buzz.
1951000	1953000	I'm just saying that
1953000	1955000	I need to get a grip on my own life
1955000	1957000	before I take on somebody else's, that's all.
1957000	1959000	You're shutting down, Meg.
1959000	1961000	I asked you to marry me.
1961000	1963000	No.
1963000	1965000	You asked me to change my whole life.
1965000	1967000	It really scares you, doesn't it?
1967000	1969000	The idea of trusting someone that much.
1973000	1975000	I don't want to change you, Meg.
1977000	1979000	I just want to be with you.
1979000	1981000	I want to be with you.
1987000	1989000	They're beautiful.
2001000	2003000	Morning, Caitlin.
2009000	2011000	Good morning.
2017000	2019000	Would you put the clips in my hair now?
2019000	2021000	You bet.
2021000	2023000	I think this morning I'm going to give you
2023000	2025000	the full beauty treatment, head to toe.
2025000	2027000	A bath.
2027000	2029000	I found some nice things for you
2029000	2031000	in our clothes box.
2031000	2033000	My paw won't let me keep them.
2033000	2035000	We always see about that.
2035000	2037000	Anyway,
2037000	2039000	you know, I
2039000	2041000	noticed some scars on your back
2041000	2043000	and on your ankle.
2043000	2045000	What happened?
2045000	2047000	I fell.
2049000	2051000	Caitlin, did your paw ever
2051000	2053000	leave any marks on you?
2053000	2055000	You know, like maybe spank you real hard
2055000	2057000	or something?
2059000	2061000	It was my mom.
2061000	2063000	But my paw, he loves me
2063000	2065000	and never ever run away or dump me.
2067000	2069000	Why did your mom do that?
2075000	2077000	What happened?
2079000	2081000	Well, I'm trying, man,
2081000	2083000	but it is tough, I'll tell you.
2083000	2085000	I told you things have changed
2085000	2087000	since we were stationed down here.
2087000	2089000	Yeah, well, I sure as hell ain't right.
2089000	2091000	And this thing all the way back to Portland, I'll tell you that.
2091000	2093000	Listen, I'll hook something up.
2093000	2095000	Don't worry.
2095000	2097000	We'll talk soon.
2097000	2099000	Traylor's getting a little small for three people.
2099000	2101000	I heard that.
2101000	2103000	Um, Ms. Joldridge?
2103000	2105000	Oh, hi. I'm Keaton's teacher.
2105000	2107000	Hey, give me a minute.
2107000	2109000	Listen, I'm out of here, all right?
2115000	2117000	What's she done now, lady?
2117000	2119000	She hasn't done anything.
2119000	2121000	Really, she's a great kid.
2121000	2123000	So,
2123000	2125000	are you going to take her away?
2127000	2129000	Could we step inside?
2139000	2141000	And there's some clothes at school
2141000	2143000	that we could give, Caitlin.
2143000	2145000	I also wanted to tell you
2145000	2147000	what a great read of your little girl is.
2147000	2149000	Oh, yeah?
2149000	2151000	So, what's she done bad?
2151000	2153000	She hasn't done anything bad.
2153000	2155000	I came to tell you
2155000	2157000	that she's really very smart
2157000	2159000	and I wanted her to have the clothes.
2159000	2161000	You see him? That's Jimmy.
2161000	2163000	That's Caitlin's brother.
2163000	2165000	He was my boy
2165000	2167000	until that bitch took him away.
2169000	2171000	He left me with that little bastard
2171000	2173000	and I can't do anything with her.
2175000	2177000	What about a foster home?
2177000	2179000	I mean, that's a solution.
2179000	2181000	Well, what kind of a bastard
2181000	2183000	would I be if I gave her up?
2183000	2185000	You want me to give her up?
2185000	2187000	No, you're full of crap.
2187000	2189000	There's no need to talk that way.
2189000	2191000	Miguel, it's all right. It's all right, Mr. Eldridge.
2191000	2193000	Mr. Eldridge, listen, listen.
2193000	2195000	You said...
2195000	2197000	You said you couldn't control her.
2197000	2199000	I was just trying to make a suggestion.
2199000	2201000	No, no, no, no, no.
2201000	2203000	Thank you so much.
2203000	2205000	I think you have to leave now.
2205000	2207000	We don't want your clothes.
2207000	2209000	Thank you.
2209000	2211000	We don't need your charity.
2211000	2213000	Come on.
2213000	2215000	Thank you.
2219000	2221000	You should go back to lifting refrigerators, huh?
2221000	2223000	It's discouraging, isn't it?
2223000	2225000	But you're going to have to deal
2225000	2227000	with all kinds of things when you work with these kids.
2227000	2229000	I don't know if I want to.
2231000	2233000	Family used to live in a place like this.
2233000	2235000	Now, that's why I don't like touching the rat.
2237000	2239000	Seven brothers and sisters.
2239000	2241000	Me in the middle, all in three rooms.
2241000	2243000	I understand.
2243000	2245000	It's sad, too, because you're great with children.
2245000	2247000	My girlfriend.
2247000	2249000	She wants me to go back to school to be a teacher.
2249000	2251000	Smart girlfriend.
2253000	2255000	You can't do this for me.
2255000	2257000	Two days, just take two days off.
2257000	2259000	Next Thursday and Friday.
2259000	2261000	Yes.
2261000	2263000	Too soon. I can't leave Caitlyn for two days.
2263000	2265000	Suddenly like that. She's right on the edge.
2265000	2267000	I've been working on a defense for this case for two months
2267000	2269000	because Wally wants to nail that account.
2269000	2271000	When Wally, the most senior partner,
2271000	2273000	asks the most junior partner to join him
2273000	2275000	for a long weekend at the beach house with a client,
2275000	2277000	the most junior partner goes.
2277000	2279000	So why do I have to go?
2279000	2281000	Because Wally specifically asked me to bring it to couples' thing.
2281000	2283000	I just can't.
2283000	2285000	I'm the only safe fridge she has.
2285000	2287000	Give me a break.
2287000	2289000	I mean it.
2289000	2291000	You see the way she lives.
2291000	2293000	I feel for the kid, but you're going overboard on this.
2293000	2295000	We're talking two days here.
2295000	2297000	It is tough for a kid to trust
2297000	2299000	after she has been so badly abused.
2299000	2301000	And I thought the time away would be good for us.
2301000	2303000	For a lot of reasons.
2303000	2305000	You're right.
2305000	2307000	It's just bad timing, that's all.
2307000	2309000	Well, everything is these days.
2319000	2321000	Does it have to be next weekend?
2321000	2323000	Yes, it has to be next.
2323000	2325000	Why do you always have to try to control everything?
2325000	2327000	I am not trying to control everything.
2327000	2329000	What are you talking about?
2329000	2331000	Everything. That girl's life, my life, this relationship.
2331000	2333000	I am not trying to control you.
2333000	2335000	You are trying to control me.
2335000	2337000	Control for you means not having to let go of anything, Maggie,
2337000	2339000	including your feelings.
2339000	2341000	Down?
2349000	2351000	Let's go.
2351000	2353000	For three days.
2353000	2355000	I'll take Friday off.
2355000	2357000	We can drive to Santa Barbara on Thursday night.
2359000	2361000	I want to.
2361000	2363000	Really.
2365000	2367000	I'll, um...
2367000	2369000	I'll try to leave the kids in the classroom.
2397000	2399000	Okay, everybody.
2399000	2401000	It's a stop.
2401000	2403000	Fun now.
2403000	2405000	I got the platform.
2405000	2407000	Can we go again in a little while?
2407000	2409000	Let's wait here.
2409000	2411000	Is Kate okay?
2411000	2413000	I don't know.
2413000	2415000	Did you see that look on her face when I told her
2415000	2417000	I was going to be in Santa Barbara?
2417000	2419000	Maybe I shouldn't take Friday off.
2419000	2421000	No, it should be all right.
2421000	2423000	I'm really going to put her in that hospital tonight.
2423000	2425000	She's just so raw right now.
2425000	2427000	She'll be okay though, you know?
2427000	2429000	She's not acting out.
2429000	2431000	Acting out? You're learning fast.
2431000	2433000	She didn't run.
2433000	2435000	She didn't make a major explosion, but she's ticking down now, you know?
2435000	2437000	What, sweetheart?
2437000	2439000	Can you look through your guts?
2439000	2441000	Come on.
2441000	2443000	Show me where, sweetheart.
2443000	2445000	Where?
2445000	2447000	Here you go.
2447000	2449000	Here you go.
2449000	2451000	Come here.
2451000	2453000	Come here. I know.
2453000	2455000	I know, sweetheart.
2455000	2457000	He's okay.
2459000	2461000	Feeling a little better, huh?
2461000	2463000	Caitlin, answer me.
2465000	2467000	Oh, sweetie.
2469000	2471000	I wish I could make you understand,
2471000	2473000	but I can leave for a day and you'll be all right.
2477000	2479000	Katie, I'm your teacher, you know,
2479000	2481000	and we won't always be together.
2481000	2483000	Listen to me. Listen.
2483000	2485000	This one day that I'll be away,
2485000	2487000	you can get along without me.
2491000	2493000	And it's so important that you understand that.
2497000	2499000	When are you gonna be back?
2499000	2501000	Monday morning.
2501000	2503000	Before you know it.
2507000	2509000	Trust me.
2511000	2513000	I'll be right back.
2517000	2519000	Did you fix something with my hair, right?
2521000	2523000	I think that's a great idea.
2533000	2535000	I like the way your lady plays the game.
2535000	2537000	Serious. You too?
2537000	2539000	You know, I had that backhand volley,
2539000	2541000	and I missed it.
2541000	2543000	I'll tell you, Wally, she never thinks she's good enough.
2551000	2553000	So, Maggie, we're having a charity tournament next month,
2553000	2555000	and you are such a great player. We'd love to have you.
2555000	2557000	You know, a lot of the wives are gonna be there.
2557000	2559000	Well, thanks. I appreciate it.
2561000	2563000	Great.
2563000	2565000	Give me a break.
2565000	2567000	She needs Lisa and wants to order.
2569000	2571000	Would you like some stew?
2571000	2573000	Okay.
2573000	2575000	So would you like anything?
2575000	2577000	One stew.
2577000	2579000	Okay.
2579000	2581000	Two stews coming right up.
2581000	2583000	Yes. That's a good boy, Derek.
2583000	2585000	You hung up your coat by yourself.
2585000	2587000	Didn't you?
2587000	2589000	You be our customer.
2589000	2591000	You're ready for this guy.
2591000	2593000	I wanna be the cook.
2593000	2595000	I wanna be the cook. I want to.
2595000	2597000	You have to be the waitress.
2599000	2601000	I am the cook.
2601000	2603000	Fine. You can be it for a minute,
2603000	2605000	and then I'll be the cook.
2607000	2609000	Brad, you didn't tell her.
2609000	2611000	She was such a good storyteller.
2611000	2613000	You know, I thought you were gonna tell us the...
2613000	2615000	Excuse me.
2615000	2617000	You know, Doris, I thought you were gonna tell us the one
2617000	2619000	about the three guys and the rat.
2619000	2621000	You know, the man of the cloth,
2621000	2623000	the doctor and the lawyer, okay?
2625000	2627000	Why are you doing this?
2627000	2629000	I'm trying to reach McGill.
2629000	2631000	Something's gotta be wrong.
2631000	2633000	Maggie, you've left the table three times
2633000	2635000	in the last 15 minutes. It's making people uncomfortable.
2635000	2637000	Dan, I'm worried.
2637000	2639000	Look, I'll tell them about Caitlin,
2639000	2641000	and then they don't have to feel uncomfortable.
2641000	2643000	I don't think they're interested. They're trying to enjoy their dinner
2643000	2645000	and not talk about their work.
2645000	2647000	I'm sorry if sometimes my job
2647000	2649000	and my life are a little...
2649000	2651000	a little.
2653000	2655000	Just come back to the table, okay?
2655000	2657000	I will. I'll be right there.
2657000	2659000	I promise.
2673000	2675000	Dan, would you come in
2675000	2677000	or close the door?
2679000	2681000	No.
2703000	2705000	It's freezing out there.
2705000	2707000	No more than that is in here.
2709000	2711000	You aren't gonna let it go, are you?
2711000	2713000	Not it, Maggie.
2713000	2715000	You.
2715000	2717000	You.
2717000	2719000	I don't want to let you go.
2723000	2725000	Dan, I made a mistake.
2725000	2727000	I never should have
2727000	2729000	said I was gonna come.
2729000	2731000	I just don't fit in
2731000	2733000	as one of the wives.
2733000	2735000	I don't want you to be
2735000	2737000	one of the wives.
2739000	2741000	No.
2745000	2747000	Why do you have to do this?
2749000	2751000	What?
2751000	2753000	Push me off.
2757000	2759000	I don't know.
2759000	2761000	Something
2761000	2763000	happens to me when somebody
2763000	2765000	gets too close.
2769000	2771000	Well, I'm sorry.
2775000	2777000	It makes you a tough woman
2777000	2779000	to love.
2799000	2801000	Slumming it?
2804000	2806000	She's going in.
2807000	2809000	The school board didn't think it was warranted
2809000	2811000	to appeal.
2813000	2815000	Not warranted.
2817000	2819000	What about a lawsuit?
2819000	2821000	There has to be something that we can do.
2821000	2823000	No. They expect an opening soon
2823000	2825000	before Easter, they think.
2825000	2827000	But you should feel proud, you know?
2829000	2831000	You've brought her so far.
2839000	2841000	Obviously, not far enough.
2855000	2857000	Why? Why should I continue teaching?
2857000	2859000	So I can watch another child
2859000	2861000	be destroyed by the system.
2861000	2863000	Every child can't be saved, Maggie.
2863000	2865000	You're a teacher.
2865000	2867000	That's the equation.
2867000	2869000	What else would you do?
2869000	2871000	Teach a muffin.
2871000	2873000	You know, you're never gonna change
2873000	2875000	the system the way you want.
2875000	2877000	You want it all perfect.
2877000	2879000	Well, that's your terrific teaching
2879000	2881000	and the energy.
2881000	2883000	That's what you do.
2883000	2885000	That's your terrific teaching and the energy.
2885000	2887000	And sometimes you'll even make a difference.
2887000	2889000	A little difference.
2889000	2891000	Let's get real.
2891000	2893000	There ain't no Camelot.
2893000	2895000	That's not a reality that I can live with.
2895000	2897000	Okay, okay.
2897000	2899000	Solve your own problems.
2899000	2901000	I can't. Please.
2901000	2903000	Call him off.
2905000	2907000	I'll slow it down.
2907000	2909000	You want some muffin?
2909000	2911000	No, go ahead.
2911000	2913000	Oh, Sam, one other thing.
2913000	2915000	You know, my class doesn't get to go to assembly
2915000	2917000	but the rest of the school.
2917000	2919000	I mean, if they did, it would be great.
2919000	2921000	You never stopped, do you?
2921000	2923000	First recess, now assembly.
2923000	2925000	They've already learned the Pledge of Allegiance, Sam.
2929000	2931000	Give me your mom's leave.
2931000	2933000	Deal.
2941000	2943000	Yes, sweetie?
2943000	2945000	Can you tell me a story?
2945000	2947000	I'm really busy right now.
2947000	2949000	Maybe later when you're waiting for the bus, okay?
2971000	2973000	My favorite story was about a little girl
2973000	2975000	who lived in a forest far, far away.
2975000	2977000	It was a beautiful forest.
2977000	2979000	But the little girl was very lonely
2979000	2981000	because she had nobody to play with.
2981000	2983000	And then one day,
2983000	2985000	she saw a big lion
2985000	2987000	standing on a rock staring down at her.
2987000	2989000	Well,
2989000	2991000	she was so lonely
2991000	2993000	that she decided to ask for help.
2993000	2995000	And then one day,
2995000	2997000	she saw a big lion
2997000	2999000	standing on a rock staring down at her.
2999000	3001000	She was so lonely
3001000	3003000	that she decided to ask the lion
3003000	3005000	if he would play with her.
3005000	3007000	But the lion said he couldn't
3007000	3009000	because he hadn't been tamed.
3009000	3011000	What's that, tamed?
3011000	3013000	Well, that is the exact same question
3013000	3015000	that the little girl asked the lion.
3015000	3017000	And the lion told her
3017000	3019000	that being tamed was about becoming friends.
3019000	3021000	And he said
3021000	3023000	that he'd been born wild
3023000	3025000	and fierce.
3025000	3027000	And that
3027000	3029000	he wanted to.
3029000	3031000	She could become his friend
3031000	3033000	if she would give him all of her love
3033000	3035000	and trust.
3035000	3037000	You see, the idea was that
3037000	3039000	once the lion felt what it was like
3039000	3041000	to be needed
3041000	3043000	and to trust,
3043000	3045000	then he would have to love the little girl back.
3045000	3047000	And then the lion
3047000	3049000	would be tamed.
3049000	3051000	Well,
3051000	3053000	it had been so long since the little girl
3053000	3055000	had had anybody to play with
3055000	3057000	that she agreed
3057000	3059000	to do what the lion asked.
3061000	3063000	And you know what?
3063000	3065000	Very soon
3065000	3067000	they had learned
3067000	3069000	together to love
3069000	3071000	and to need
3071000	3073000	and to trust.
3073000	3075000	And then they were
3075000	3077000	in each other's hearts forever.
3077000	3079000	And then they both were tamed.
3085000	3087000	And then
3087000	3089000	they were
3089000	3091000	in each other's hearts forever.
3091000	3093000	And then
3093000	3095000	they both were tamed.
3095000	3097000	And then
3097000	3099000	they both were tamed.
3099000	3101000	And then
3101000	3103000	they both were tamed.
3103000	3105000	And then
3105000	3107000	they both were tamed.
3107000	3109000	And then
3109000	3111000	they both were tamed.
3111000	3113000	And then
3113000	3115000	they both were tamed.
3115000	3117000	Hi, Dan here.
3117000	3119000	Now it's your turn.
3119000	3121000	Okay.
3143000	3145000	Rain stop.
3147000	3149000	Tomorrow I go back to school.
3149000	3151000	Yeah.
3153000	3155000	What a lousy day
3155000	3157000	for you dad to pick up a job, huh?
3161000	3163000	Wanna play checkers?
3165000	3167000	No.
3173000	3175000	You like your dolly, don't you?
3179000	3181000	Can I have it for me?
3193000	3195000	You know we could
3197000	3199000	we could play house.
3199000	3201000	You could be my dolly.
3207000	3209000	This one's better.
3209000	3211000	This one's better.
3211000	3213000	This one's better.
3213000	3215000	This one's better.
3215000	3217000	Which one?
3217000	3219000	That one.
3219000	3221000	This one's too hard.
3221000	3223000	No.
3223000	3225000	This one's better.
3225000	3227000	Yeah, that's good.
3229000	3231000	Okay, I'll try.
3231000	3233000	This one's better.
3233000	3235000	Okay, sweetie.
3235000	3237000	Okay.
3237000	3239000	Now let's do some math, alright?
3239000	3241000	I can't.
3241000	3243000	Come here, I'll help you.
3243000	3245000	Come on.
3245000	3247000	You guys finish up over there.
3247000	3249000	Okay.
3249000	3251000	Now let's see, where were we?
3251000	3253000	Okay, we've got two more to do, okay?
3253000	3255000	So now number nine.
3255000	3257000	If it's not 12 minus seven
3257000	3259000	then what number is it?
3259000	3261000	Sweetheart, what number is it?
3261000	3263000	If it's not...
3263000	3265000	Oh, hey look.
3265000	3267000	Oh my God.
3267000	3269000	Oh, come here, come here.
3269000	3271000	Sweetheart, just lay back, just lay back.
3271000	3273000	Come here.
3273000	3275000	Alright.
3275000	3277000	Okay, I'll just stand and be alright.
3277000	3279000	I'll just stand and be alright.
3279000	3281000	I'm right here.
3281000	3283000	I think it's gonna be okay.
3283000	3285000	Okay, here we go.
3285000	3287000	Alright, what's that up in the yard?
3287000	3289000	Alright, let's go.
3289000	3291000	Alright, make sure they don't weigh that much in, alright?
3293000	3295000	Alright everybody, let's get ready
3295000	3297000	to go out for recess.
3297000	3299000	I don't want to go out until Caitlyn comes back.
3299000	3301000	I understand, sweetie.
3301000	3303000	Come on.
3303000	3305000	My grandpa was to the hospital
3305000	3307000	and he died there.
3307000	3309000	Caitlyn's gonna die.
3309000	3311000	Come here, sweetie.
3311000	3313000	She's gonna be fine, really.
3313000	3315000	She's gonna be much better.
3315000	3317000	Hey, the operation is to stop the bleeding.
3317000	3319000	And she's getting stronger and stronger every day.
3319000	3321000	Okay, she's gonna live a long, long time.
3321000	3323000	My mom said her dad's friend who did that
3323000	3325000	should be killed dead.
3325000	3327000	I don't want to talk about this anymore.
3327000	3329000	Bradley, come here, come here.
3329000	3331000	Come here.
3331000	3333000	Alright, everybody.
3333000	3335000	I know it's a real scary thing.
3335000	3337000	What happened to Caitlyn?
3337000	3339000	Alright, I'll tell you what.
3339000	3341000	Before we go out for recess, let's have a talk.
3341000	3343000	Alright?
3343000	3345000	And bring your pictures for Caitlyn.
3347000	3349000	Come on, kids, let's go.
3349000	3351000	Doctor, that is the CCU.
3351000	3353000	Doctor, that is the CCU. Please.
3369000	3371000	Take it all.
3375000	3377000	Don't cry, Maggie.
3377000	3379000	It doesn't hurt too much anymore.
3379000	3381000	It makes me feel a little bit better
3381000	3383000	to cry sometimes, kitty.
3383000	3385000	Here you go.
3391000	3395000	Do you want to hold my marble like you did yesterday?
3395000	3399000	No, I think I just want to hold your hand tonight.
3403000	3405000	Last night, when I woke up,
3407000	3409000	it was sort of scary.
3409000	3411000	I wanted my paw,
3411000	3413000	but I didn't cry none.
3415000	3417000	Miguel went to get him, sweetheart.
3423000	3425000	It's for you, from everybody.
3425000	3427000	Just for me?
3429000	3431000	Hello, Maggie.
3431000	3433000	Oh, great, Miguel.
3433000	3435000	Hello, Caitlyn. How are you?
3435000	3437000	Good.
3439000	3441000	Papa.
3455000	3457000	Mr. Elvish, why don't you go talk to her?
3457000	3459000	She asked for you.
3461000	3463000	Well, I can't help her in home.
3463000	3465000	She wants me to see her like that.
3469000	3471000	I got this, uh...
3473000	3475000	today.
3483000	3485000	I can't believe that this rock...
3493000	3495000	Hey.
3495000	3497000	Hey.
3497000	3499000	Thanks for meeting me.
3499000	3501000	No problem.
3501000	3503000	Just had to cancel three and a half major clients, that's all.
3505000	3507000	How's Caitlyn?
3507000	3509000	She's fine. She's up, walking,
3509000	3511000	mending fast.
3511000	3513000	Good.
3513000	3515000	Dan, I called you because I have to know.
3515000	3517000	I'm sorry.
3517000	3519000	I'm sorry.
3519000	3521000	I'm sorry.
3521000	3523000	Dan, I called you because I have to know.
3523000	3525000	If I can petition the court.
3525000	3527000	I mean, can I appeal her case?
3527000	3529000	Wait a minute. You mean just you?
3529000	3531000	I know I'm not her guardian or anything official,
3531000	3533000	but can I appeal?
3533000	3535000	You want to go over the heads of, what, the school board,
3535000	3537000	the social services department?
3537000	3539000	I don't want to. I have to.
3539000	3541000	Everybody has turned me down.
3541000	3543000	And believe me, I've made as much noise as I possibly can.
3543000	3545000	I bet you have.
3547000	3549000	Maggie the Madwoman.
3549000	3551000	Come on, there's a decent new place around the corner.
3551000	3553000	You lose your job, you know that?
3553000	3555000	I'm giving up teaching at the end of the year anyway.
3555000	3557000	I decided to get my doctorate.
3557000	3559000	You're kidding.
3559000	3561000	No, I'm serious.
3561000	3563000	Anyway, Caitlyn's the issue now.
3563000	3565000	Saving Caitlyn.
3565000	3567000	Yeah, she always had a little more buzz than anyone around for me.
3567000	3569000	I'll tell you the truth, Maggie.
3569000	3571000	I was a little jealous.
3571000	3573000	I was disappointed you called about her instead of us.
3573000	3575000	I found us.
3575000	3577000	Why? You're the one who snuck off with his hat
3577000	3579000	and left a note on the rock.
3579000	3581000	Dan, a note?
3581000	3583000	Not only corny, but a little chicken, wasn't it?
3585000	3587000	I had my reasons.
3587000	3589000	I don't want to talk about this.
3593000	3595000	Okay, well, my opinion is you can't appeal the case.
3595000	3597000	It's risky. Nobody's going to like it.
3597000	3599000	But you say you don't care.
3599000	3601000	Will you take it on?
3601000	3603000	Oh, boy, you've got guts.
3603000	3605000	Maggie the Madwoman.
3605000	3607000	And a friend.
3607000	3609000	A good friend who needs you very much.
3609000	3611000	I hope you're buying the drinks.
3611000	3613000	I'm not going to make any money off this one.
3615000	3617000	It's tough on a child because
3617000	3619000	basically they have no choice.
3619000	3621000	Yeah, I worry for Caitlyn.
3621000	3623000	You know, it's so hard
3623000	3625000	to stop feeling for them.
3625000	3627000	Well, maybe that's what makes a good teacher.
3629000	3631000	Or a bad one.
3631000	3633000	You think maybe
3633000	3635000	maybe I make a good teacher?
3637000	3639000	I think you ought to look in the mirror
3639000	3641000	and ask yourself that question.
3641000	3643000	There he is.
3647000	3649000	Okay, I'll go to the payphone and call Dan.
3659000	3661000	I let that bastard stay here
3661000	3663000	for two months and look what he does.
3667000	3669000	I beat the crap out of them though
3669000	3671000	before they took him off to jail.
3671000	3673000	No, thanks.
3673000	3675000	Well, I appreciate you bringing me
3675000	3677000	the groceries very much.
3683000	3685000	Mr. Eldage, we need you to do something
3685000	3687000	for your little girl.
3687000	3689000	It's important for her, you know.
3689000	3691000	You're appealing to the court,
3691000	3693000	not to send Caitlyn to the state hospital.
3693000	3695000	And we want you to come to court next Thursday
3695000	3697000	and just answer a few questions.
3697000	3699000	Go to court?
3699000	3701000	This is the date of the court appearance,
3701000	3703000	the time, and the place.
3705000	3707000	It's for your daughter, you understand?
3707000	3709000	I ain't sure I got a daughter.
3709000	3711000	Now you're full of it. You've got a daughter
3711000	3713000	and from what I understand she's a great little kid.
3713000	3715000	Now you'll be there
3715000	3717000	for her.
3717000	3719000	Here.
3719000	3721000	You take this.
3721000	3723000	What's that for?
3723000	3725000	Take it.
3725000	3727000	Oh.
3727000	3729000	Take your money, Mr.
3729000	3731000	and you get the hell out of here.
3731000	3733000	Mr. Eldage.
3733000	3735000	This is my house!
3735000	3737000	That guy's crazy.
3737000	3739000	Damn.
3739000	3741000	Can we win without him?
3741000	3743000	Hey!
3743000	3745000	Hey!
3747000	3749000	Okay.
3749000	3751000	One, two, three, four.
3751000	3753000	Here, here.
3753000	3755000	You buy Caitlyn her dress.
3755000	3757000	Green.
3757000	3759000	I think she likes green.
3767000	3769000	Did you remember the tapes?
3769000	3771000	They're right here in my briefcase.
3771000	3773000	It's all just...
3773000	3775000	The parents of the boy she burned.
3775000	3777000	I didn't know they were going to be here.
3777000	3779000	I figured they would be. They want to see Caitlyn put away forever.
3781000	3783000	Where's Pa?
3785000	3787000	Told him Peter, half hour ago.
3787000	3789000	Come here sweetheart, sit down.
3789000	3791000	I don't think your Pa's going to be able to make it.
3791000	3793000	You should have thrown him in the car and dragged him down here
3793000	3795000	whether he likes courtrooms or not.
3797000	3799000	What I brought you?
3799000	3801000	I want you to draw me a beautiful picture.
3801000	3803000	Is everything okay?
3803000	3805000	Do you have any questions? You see that guard right there?
3807000	3809000	He'll call me.
3809000	3811000	I want to go and tell him right now.
3813000	3815000	It's okay.
3817000	3819000	He wasn't in there either.
3821000	3823000	Excuse me. Do you see that little girl right there?
3825000	3827000	You'll be safe here honey.
3827000	3829000	Maggie and I will be right there.
3829000	3831000	Appreciate it.
3831000	3833000	Okay?
3833000	3835000	Right.
3843000	3845000	No problem.
3861000	3863000	Thank you.
3891000	3893000	Here you go sweetie.
3903000	3905000	Did I do good enough?
3907000	3909000	You did great kiddo.
3909000	3911000	I think the judge was very impressed.
3911000	3913000	Dan is in the judge's chambers right now
3913000	3915000	discussing everything that went on in the courtroom.
3917000	3919000	And then the judge will make his decision.
3921000	3923000	Is he going to send me away for a long time?
3925000	3927000	I hope not kiddo.
3929000	3931000	Okay.
3931000	3933000	Based on the testimony one could deduce
3933000	3935000	that she shows some and I underline
3935000	3937000	some signs of improvement.
3937000	3939000	But what does that really mean?
3939000	3941000	That she fits in a class full of misfits?
3941000	3943000	Oh come on. Look that is just
3943000	3945000	cheap name calling. This is a child
3945000	3947000	who had never experienced even the smallest
3947000	3949000	expression of love.
3949000	3951000	And then she was put into a healthy,
3951000	3953000	nurturing environment and incredible things happened.
3953000	3955000	You saw the videotape her teacher made.
3955000	3957000	This Caitlyn
3957000	3959000	is a different child.
3959000	3963000	I can't think of anything more to get real time for this.
3963000	3965000	This is Ryan.
3965000	3967000	What is it?
3967000	3969000	Could you excuse us just for a minute?
3975000	3977000	I want you to know that I didn't appeal
3977000	3979000	to the court on behalf of Caitlyn.
3979000	3981000	Because I excuse what she did to your son.
3983000	3985000	It was awful and cruel.
3987000	3989000	Then why not put her away?
3989000	3991000	Because I know
3991000	3993000	that the pain she inflicted came from such
3993000	3995000	tremendous hurt and fear
3995000	3997000	that she was having to hold inside.
3997000	3999000	And now that she's learning to release
3999000	4001000	those feelings responsibly, there's no
4001000	4003000	need to act them out. She doesn't have
4003000	4005000	to keep trying to prove that she is a
4005000	4007000	bad girl.
4007000	4009000	You want me to feel sorry for her?
4009000	4011000	Well, I don't.
4013000	4015000	Neither do I.
4015000	4017000	Feeling sorry for kids like Caitlyn.
4017000	4019000	That doesn't help them survive.
4019000	4021000	That's exactly what I try to teach each of
4021000	4023000	my kids how to survive
4023000	4025000	in a world that
4025000	4027000	hands them almost nothing besides pain
4027000	4029000	and rejection.
4029000	4031000	I can't do anything about the past.
4031000	4033000	I wish I could, but I can't.
4035000	4037000	Nobody is going to gain
4037000	4039000	from trying to destroy that little girl's future.
4051000	4053000	But how can you be sure?
4053000	4055000	How can you guarantee that she's not going to
4055000	4057000	torture some innocent kid as soon as
4057000	4059000	she gets away from that teacher?
4059000	4061000	Exactly.
4061000	4063000	Look,
4065000	4067000	I can't
4067000	4069000	guarantee anything,
4069000	4071000	your honor.
4071000	4073000	But what's the choice here
4073000	4075000	to shut a child with Caitlyn's
4075000	4077000	potential away from society
4077000	4079000	forever?
4079000	4081000	She is six and a half
4081000	4083000	years old.
4085000	4087000	What's taking so long?
4087000	4089000	Waiting so hard, isn't it, kiddo?
4091000	4093000	Maggie?
4095000	4097000	I want you to tame me
4097000	4099000	like the little girl did the lion.
4117000	4119000	No hospitals.
4119000	4121000	Just therapy.
4121000	4123000	Yes, yes.
4123000	4125000	Bottom line, the judge thought
4125000	4127000	that under the circumstances,
4127000	4129000	Caitlyn made major progress.
4129000	4131000	Enough to live at home and attend
4131000	4133000	regular classes next year.
4133000	4135000	That's wonderful.
4135000	4137000	Sweetheart, that's wonderful.
4137000	4139000	You're wonderful.
4139000	4141000	Hey, kiddo.
4141000	4143000	It's Caitlyn's time.
4143000	4145000	Let's celebrate.
4145000	4147000	Come on, pizza.
4147000	4149000	And hot dogs.
4149000	4151000	French fries.
4151000	4153000	And hot fudge sundaes for dessert.
4155000	4157000	Mr. Eldridge, we won.
4159000	4161000	Listen, we're going to go celebrate.
4161000	4163000	Would you join us?
4165000	4167000	No, I can't.
4167000	4169000	I mean, it's your party anyway.
4169000	4171000	You did it.
4171000	4173000	Well, you, uh...
4173000	4175000	You ought to know that your being here
4175000	4177000	was very important to the judge.
4179000	4181000	Thanks for the dress, Pa.
4181000	4183000	Meat color.
4183000	4185000	I can keep it, right?
4185000	4187000	Because you gave it to me.
4193000	4195000	You look real nice.
4195000	4197000	Go have some fun.
4197000	4199000	Huh?
4199000	4201000	Behave yourself.
4207000	4209000	Come on, kiddo. Let's go.
4209000	4211000	Yeah!
4211000	4213000	All right!
4213000	4215000	Me, too.
4215000	4217000	Come on, kiddo. Pizza.
4225000	4227000	You know, there are a lot of places
4227000	4229000	you can teach in Seattle.
4229000	4231000	You don't care that I changed my mind.
4231000	4233000	Well...
4233000	4235000	What else is new?
4239000	4241000	When I saw Caitlyn tonight,
4241000	4243000	I knew...
4243000	4245000	I knew you to understand something.
4247000	4249000	I was able to give that little word
4249000	4251000	to the judge.
4251000	4253000	I was able to understand something.
4253000	4255000	I was able to give that little girl
4255000	4257000	a love that nobody else
4257000	4259000	had ever been able to give her before.
4259000	4261000	A love that...
4261000	4263000	I didn't even realize
4263000	4265000	that I had with him to give.
4267000	4269000	And she was so vulnerable
4269000	4271000	and so scared.
4271000	4273000	And she risked it all
4273000	4275000	by loving me back.
4275000	4277000	And I was the only person there
4277000	4279000	who could celebrate
4279000	4281000	our existence.
4283000	4285000	That's why I'm gonna
4285000	4287000	go back and teach again.
4289000	4291000	It's what I do.
4297000	4299000	You really get me.
4309000	4311000	So when do you move?
4311000	4313000	Next month.
4313000	4315000	You know, the reason I wrote you that
4315000	4317000	chicken letter
4317000	4319000	I left on a half rack
4319000	4321000	was because I knew I had to leave.
4321000	4323000	I knew if I
4323000	4325000	looked into your eyes, I wouldn't be able to.
4339000	4341000	And you think it'll be
4341000	4343000	a breeze for me to leave?
4345000	4347000	Me or Kate?
4347000	4349000	And sometimes
4349000	4351000	you are such a butt head.
4351000	4353000	You didn't answer my question, Maggie.
4353000	4355000	I need to know.
4355000	4357000	Then I'm drawing really hard
4357000	4359000	this time
4359000	4361000	not to shut down.
4365000	4367000	Well...
4369000	4371000	I still have a little more than three weeks.
4387000	4389000	Good morning, Margaret.
4389000	4391000	Hello, Harold.
4391000	4393000	Margaret, what would you say
4393000	4395000	if Caitlin and
4395000	4397000	two of your more advanced kids
4397000	4399000	went to the color guard
4399000	4401000	at the last assembly of the year?
4401000	4403000	I'd say terrific, Harold.
4403000	4405000	But why just Caitlin and two of the others?
4405000	4407000	I think you'd be even more proud
4407000	4409000	of your special ed class
4409000	4411000	if they all were the color guard.
4411000	4413000	Well, I think that's risking a bit too much.
4413000	4415000	Come on, Harold. Don't let your good instincts
4415000	4417000	fail you now.
4421000	4423000	I ain't gonna go.
4423000	4425000	This is my class.
4425000	4427000	Margaret, the school year
4427000	4429000	will be over in a few weeks.
4429000	4431000	And everybody's agreed, Mr. Sherman,
4431000	4433000	the school board, everybody,
4433000	4435000	that you're ready to go into a regular class
4435000	4437000	next year.
4437000	4439000	I wanna stay in this crazy class with you.
4443000	4445000	Kittle.
4445000	4447000	Come on, Lisa. Let's go paint.
4447000	4449000	Listen,
4449000	4451000	you know, next year
4451000	4453000	I probably won't be here.
4453000	4455000	I've been good. You said so.
4455000	4457000	My pa said so.
4457000	4459000	He bring home a pizza.
4459000	4461000	Sometimes
4461000	4463000	new ideas take a little time, don't they?
4463000	4465000	Come on.
4465000	4467000	Let's get ready and practice
4467000	4469000	for assembly, okay?
4469000	4471000	Come on.
4477000	4479000	Good, good, and...
4479000	4481000	What's in here?
4481000	4483000	No, and to the public.
4485000	4487000	Don't we paint this? We're always smoothing
4487000	4489000	into this bunch.
4489000	4491000	Good, good.
4491000	4493000	Other than
4493000	4495000	invisible
4495000	4497000	for liberty and justice for all.
4497000	4499000	Yeah, good job, Derek. Good job.
4499000	4501000	You go help those guys clean up, okay?
4501000	4503000	Come on.
4503000	4505000	I'm so sad to leave them.
4505000	4507000	I know. The end of the year always hurts.
4507000	4509000	Okay.
4509000	4511000	For you, I have
4511000	4513000	a little thank you.
4521000	4523000	California University
4523000	4525000	is pleased to admit Miguel Prado
4525000	4527000	for the fall semester.
4527000	4529000	Come here, you.
4529000	4531000	Congratulations.
4531000	4533000	Where did you... Oh, he's...
4533000	4535000	It's wonderful. It's wonderful.
4535000	4537000	I looked in the mirror and I said,
4537000	4539000	this guy could be a good teacher.
4539000	4541000	You know, I think that man was right.
4541000	4543000	Derek.
4543000	4545000	Derek.
4545000	4547000	Come here.
4547000	4549000	Come on. It's always going to get hurt.
4549000	4551000	Okay, everybody, assembly in five minutes.
4551000	4553000	You have to go to the bathroom now's the time.
4553000	4555000	You're going to break your class next year.
4555000	4557000	You and me. No more geeks.
4557000	4559000	He's a mean incredible broadcaster
4559000	4561000	and I'm so happy with him.
4561000	4563000	And he hangs his coat every time.
4563000	4565000	He knows the pledge. What do you see him in when he's in?
4565000	4567000	When he's just too fresh?
4567000	4569000	Maggie, Maggie, excuse me.
4569000	4571000	Um, Caitlin slipped out of the auditorium.
4571000	4573000	I don't know where... Okay.
4573000	4575000	Go back with the others. I'll find her.
4575000	4577000	Okay. This is Foster. I'm sorry, but...
4577000	4579000	I'll talk to you if this isn't okay.
4579000	4581000	Oh, okay. That's all right.
4589000	4591000	Sorry.
4591000	4593000	Okay, now.
4593000	4595000	What's wrong?
4595000	4597000	Caitlin.
4603000	4605000	She's not here.
4605000	4607000	Okay, I'll be right back.
4607000	4609000	Okay.
4621000	4623000	I was worried about you, sweetie.
4623000	4625000	Come on, the assembly's starting.
4625000	4627000	Let's go.
4627000	4629000	Gordie and Derek, they're waiting for you to leave them, you know?
4629000	4631000	Let's go, sweetie. Come on.
4631000	4633000	No.
4633000	4635000	I don't want you to ruin the day for everybody.
4635000	4637000	Don't kick me out.
4637000	4639000	I'm not going to kick me out.
4639000	4641000	I'm not taking you out, honey.
4641000	4643000	You don't need this class anymore.
4643000	4645000	What do you mean, you don't need them, sweetie?
4645000	4647000	I'm not taking you out, honey.
4647000	4649000	You don't need this class anymore.
4649000	4651000	What do you mean, you don't need them, still crazy?
4651000	4653000	You are not crazy.
4653000	4655000	Now stop thinking that.
4655000	4657000	Fine, then I'll be the craziest girl in the whole world.
4657000	4659000	Then I'll make you kick me here.
4659000	4661000	Caitlin, listen to me. Listen to me carefully.
4661000	4663000	I am going away next year.
4663000	4665000	I am not going to be here.
4667000	4669000	Sweetheart, you have grown so much,
4669000	4671000	and so have I.
4671000	4673000	And now it's time to see how good that growing up was.
4675000	4677000	You're ready to try it on your own.
4679000	4681000	You're strong.
4683000	4685000	Oh, sweetheart.
4689000	4691000	No, he's going to pull me again.
4691000	4693000	Okay, that's all right. Where is she?
4693000	4695000	Look, Maggie's not here yet, okay?
4695000	4697000	Yeah, I'm sorry.
4697000	4699000	But if these kids are not ready in five minutes,
4699000	4701000	I'm going to have to send some band members out.
4701000	4703000	I'm doing the best I can.
4703000	4705000	I'm sorry.
4705000	4707000	I don't know where they are.
4707000	4709000	Where's my hair?
4711000	4713000	You want to know what my mama did when she left me?
4713000	4715000	You want to know?
4715000	4717000	Of course I do, sweetheart, but everybody's waiting.
4717000	4719000	Just listen.
4719000	4721000	We were in the car.
4721000	4723000	See?
4725000	4727000	Jimmy wanted it.
4727000	4729000	No way. My mama gave it to me.
4729000	4731000	It's the best that each ever did give me.
4733000	4735000	Sweetheart, we're ready.
4735000	4737000	I was screaming in the back.
4737000	4739000	I was back there trying to make a nice...
4741000	4743000	Mama said,
4743000	4745000	Caitlin, come up here.
4747000	4749000	She gave me a kiss on the cheek
4749000	4751000	and opened the door
4753000	4755000	and pushed me onto the highway.
4759000	4761000	See?
4761000	4763000	I know, sweetheart.
4763000	4765000	See? You're just like my mama leaving.
4765000	4767000	How come you're not going to stay or make me good?
4767000	4769000	I am not leaving you.
4771000	4773000	Remember the story that I told you about
4773000	4775000	the little girl who lived in the forest
4775000	4777000	and how she tamed the lion
4777000	4779000	by showing him that she loved him?
4779000	4781000	Well, that's how it is with us.
4781000	4783000	We'll always love each other.
4783000	4785000	And just like that little girl found out,
4785000	4787000	going away is easier than
4787000	4789000	because every time you think of that special person,
4789000	4791000	you can feel
4791000	4793000	a little bit of their love.
4793000	4795000	And that love is inside you forever.
4799000	4801000	Okay?
4803000	4805000	Come on.
4811000	4813000	Ow!
4813000	4815000	Jordan, watch where you walk.
4815000	4817000	Ow!
4817000	4819000	Okay, we're here.
4819000	4821000	We're here. Let's go.
4821000	4823000	It's too late, man. It's too late.
4823000	4825000	Do you want to bet?
4825000	4827000	Come on, you guys. We can do it.
4827000	4829000	Come on. Line up.
4829000	4831000	Come on, let's go.
4831000	4833000	We can do it. Line up. Here we go.
4833000	4835000	No, it goes over the right shoulder.
4835000	4837000	No, wait. It goes over the right shoulder.
4837000	4839000	Get this. Mr. Sherman.
4839000	4841000	Maggie, no, no, no.
4841000	4843000	Can't do it.
4843000	4845000	You ready?
4845000	4847000	Let's go.
4847000	4849000	Come on.
4849000	4851000	Jordan.
4851000	4853000	Come on.
4853000	4855000	Come on.
4855000	4857000	Come on.
4857000	4859000	They're late.
4859000	4861000	Ow!
4861000	4863000	Ow!
4863000	4865000	Let's get in.
4865000	4867000	Damn it, baby.
4867000	4869000	Let's go.
4869000	4871000	Come on.
4871000	4873000	Come on.
4873000	4875000	Come on.
4875000	4877000	Come on.
4877000	4879000	Come on.
4879000	4881000	Come on.
4881000	4883000	Come on.
4883000	4885000	Let's play.
4895000	4897000	I pledge allegiance
4897000	4899000	to the flag of
4899000	4901000	the United Nations
4901000	4903000	to the flag
4903000	4905000	of the United States
4905000	4907000	of America
4907000	4909000	and to the Republic
4909000	4911000	for which it stands
4911000	4913000	one nation,
4913000	4915000	one God
4915000	4917000	indivisible
4917000	4919000	with liberty and justice
4919000	4921000	for all.
4933000	4935000	Thank you.
4943000	4945000	All right.
4963000	4965000	Thank you.
4977000	4979000	It was crazy.
4979000	4981000	We were wonderful.
4981000	4983000	We were happy.
4983000	4985000	You did a great job.
4985000	4987000	We did a great job.
4987000	4989000	We did a great job.
4989000	4991000	We did a great job.
4991000	4993000	We did a great job.
5011000	5013000	Goodbye, honey.
5013000	5015000	Remember, we're going to write letters
5015000	5017000	and every time we think about each other,
5017000	5019000	we're going to feel
5019000	5021000	a whole lot of love.
5021000	5023000	I'll be bad.
5023000	5025000	You'll have to come back.
5025000	5027000	No, I won't, Caitlin.
5027000	5029000	And I'm counting on you to be good.
5029000	5031000	I'm betting on you, kiddo.
5047000	5049000	I'll be good, Mary.
5049000	5051000	I promise.
5051000	5053000	Just for you?
5053000	5055000	No, just for you.
5055000	5057000	I will.
5057000	5059000	Bye.
5059000	5061000	Bye.
5077000	5079000	Maggie, I tamed you too.
5107000	5109000	I did move to Seattle,
5109000	5111000	and as it turned out,
5111000	5113000	mine was the last special education class
5113000	5115000	at Lindbrook Elementary School.
5115000	5117000	I wondered if I'd ever hear from Caitlin,
5117000	5119000	because I had decided
5119000	5121000	to let her make that decision on her own.
5121000	5123000	Well, a couple of months ago,
5123000	5125000	in the manor,
5125000	5127000	I found out that
5127000	5129000	I had a special education class
5129000	5131000	at Lindbrook Elementary School.
5131000	5133000	I wondered if I'd ever hear from Caitlin,
5133000	5135000	because I had decided
5135000	5137000	a couple of months ago,
5137000	5139000	in the mail came a crumpled,
5139000	5141000	water-stained piece of notebook paper
5141000	5143000	written on with a green felt-tip marker.
5143000	5145000	No letter accompanied it.
5145000	5147000	It was inscribed to Maggie
5147000	5149000	with much love,
5149000	5151000	and it said,
5151000	5153000	You were right to say you'd never leave me,
5153000	5155000	because I could always feel you there
5155000	5157000	to dry my tears when I get lonely.
5157000	5159000	I'm happy I carry your smile in my mind,
5159000	5161000	so I can remember just how scary
5161000	5163000	but very kind it was
5163000	5165000	for you to show me to myself.
5165000	5167000	And now I need to let you know
5167000	5169000	that every single day I grow,
5169000	5171000	and so does the joy that
5171000	5173000	only you would teach me to share.
5175000	5177000	Caitlin was right.
5177000	5179000	She did tame me,
5179000	5181000	and I will always be a teacher.
5193000	5195000	Thank you for watching!
