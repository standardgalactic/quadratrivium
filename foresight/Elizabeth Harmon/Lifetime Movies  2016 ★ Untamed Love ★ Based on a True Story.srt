1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Come here. Stay right there. Stay right there.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No, no, no.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, no, no.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, the lady...

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The cage tipped over in here.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hold her. It's okay. Just hold her.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, there. Okay.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But the lady inside told me that you're Mr. Bernard.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Bernard, yep. That's me.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
My name is Miguel Prado. I'm supposed to be your assistant.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, great. Great.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes, I'm from Social Services.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I could get my slip right here from the unemployment department.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Unemployment?

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you have any training? Any experience?

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Sure I do. You know, they send me out on all kinds of jobs.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You know, I do everything.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Painting houses, unloading computers, that kind of stuff.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hold on. I'll be right back.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Carol.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That young man just introduced himself.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Happy New Year, Margaret. Have a good holiday.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Happy New Year. That young man just introduced himself as my new aide from unemployment.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What happened to my full-time experience teaching assistant?

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're lucky to get anybody. There is no money in the budget.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I had to take some money out of maintenance just to pay him.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Figures.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, what happened at the school board meeting?

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Did they approve my class heading recess with the rest of the school?

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, no. Margaret, that wasn't discussed. We ran out of time.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why? You were going to bring it up.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But there just wasn't time.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is not the most pressing issue.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Come on, buddy. It's okay.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's okay. Come on. Come on.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come on, buddy. Come on.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Come on.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hold on a minute.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's all right. Come on.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll take care of you.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There you go.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Carol.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You promised. You said this was the time. You were going to bring it up.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Look, we have had a special ed class in this school for, what, five years?

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And it's always been separate from the rest of the school.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It works best that way. Why change it?

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The parents are comfortable.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The parents are comfortable?

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Harold, I have six very challenged kids in my class.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What about what makes them feel comfortable?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Margaret, I don't even know if we're going to have a special ed class next year.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't know if we can afford it.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now, things are going very well for your class this year, right?

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So don't rock the boat.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The Rudds wish me to stress their son has second degree burns on 80% of his body.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I understand, Mrs. Miyako.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
My question, however, related to Caitlyn and why she's acting out this kind of violence.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But, Your Honor, what Caitlyn Eldridge did is more than acting out.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's psychotic and dangerous.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This child must be institutionalized.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ms. Brown, it's up to you to suggest an alternative.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Social services tried, but that doesn't seem to be one with her history.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Can I say something?

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't go ahead, Mrs. Rudd.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
When this sick child tied Tommy to a tree and set a match to a...

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She turned my son into some kind of a freak.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now, he has to deal with that pain for the rest of his life.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And so do we.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want you to put her away, Judge.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So she can't never hurt another kid like she done mine.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't look at me, Judge. I can't control her. No way.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But you're her father, Mr. Eldridge.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't make no difference.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
She just turned out bad. That's all.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Caitlyn?

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Caitlyn?

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This isn't easy, is it?

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Well, maybe you can help me.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Can you tell me why you did what you did?

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Caitlyn?

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You see? What did I tell you?

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Good morning, Lisa Anne. Good morning, sweetheart.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
All right, let's try it. Good morning, Maggie.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Good morning, Maggie. Look at my nose. Look at my nose.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, give me some air. Like a big girl. Come on, give me air.

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's a good try. We'll work on it, all right? Let's go sing.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go sing.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Where do you want me to put this stuff?

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, just put it on the plant table and the rest of stuff in the fridge.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I want to be the fish.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I want you to be a big boy now, remember? It's Bradley, the big boy.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I want to be the fish.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Jordan, you can come on and boss it down.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Crap. Crap.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right, hang it up. Here we go. Everything's fine.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
All right.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Come on, Derek, big boy. Take the thumb out of your mouth. That's it.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Stand up. There you go.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now we're going to have our morning circle.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Jordan, stop. Okay, sit down. Right here.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't know. Come on, circle. Come on. Right here, next to Shanice.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
There you go. Okay.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Want to chime out?

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No. All right. Stand up there.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Get your body in control.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay. Good. Let's say morning song.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There you go.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Jorge.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Christmas is over.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Christmas is over.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's it. I know Christmas is over, but this is so beautiful.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And we're going to hang it up all year round.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's good to see you all.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Take off your jacket.

118
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And get ready to sing and do the play.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Miguel, help him with his coat.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Because his mother has to drive.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Come on.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay. We're a pretty wild group here after vacation, huh?

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay. Everybody sitting ready? Bradley, sitting ready?

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay. Make room for our new guest.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
His name. I'm not going to tell you his name.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you notice anybody who's new in the group?

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Him.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Him and him has a name and his name is what?

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Miguel.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And he's going to help us, okay?

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Bradley, come here.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
See you in just a second.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Sam, could you wait just a minute, please? Thanks.

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Bradley, I want you to come sit here.

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Come on, Bradley.

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Come on. I mean, a child that sets other children on fire.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You've got to be kidding.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Foster care won't touch it.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
My father's no help.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What about homebound? Why can't a teacher go to our house?

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Nobody will go. Everybody's scared of this little...

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, I'm scared. And I'm scared for my kids.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sam, don't do this to me.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Where are you going?

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No words.

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Listen, I got to get back.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
My kids have finally calmed down.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You know, it took four months, but they formed a cohesive group.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They finally feel safe.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You bring a child like this into my class and everything's going to explode.

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's nothing we can do.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The law says the girl deserves to go to school.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
She has a right to go to school.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What are you going to do with that?

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Keep it, but they don't give them as a quick mention of the garbage glass.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And so the evil queen asked for a magic mirror.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Here's the magic mirror.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, which one is two?

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
One is two.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This one is two.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What number is this?

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
One.

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What number is this?

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Two.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What number is this?

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Three.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
My turn! No!

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
My turn! No!

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, got it.

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Which one's two?

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
One is two.

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Bradley?

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Which one?

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Bradley, go sit down.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, keep going, keep going.

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No window.

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No window.

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay, which one's two?

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's go back.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
One is two.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh, and when you're working with Derek, don't rush to give him the answer.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You know, be patient.

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He'll surprise you sometimes.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Is it like this every day?

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
First days after vacation are pretty tough.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Tomorrow should be better.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
See you in the morning.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't know if I can be here tomorrow.

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have to go to an appointment tomorrow, you know, and check in.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You'll be here.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You have a knack for this.

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Finished.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What time is it?

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That was our clue.

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, man, four hours to do that closing statement.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm not even charging the client.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I get angry they don't make me a partner.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Screwed up priorities, huh?

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I like your priorities.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This intake information sheet on the new kid, I get...

202
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ah!

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
How is it?

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's unbelievable.

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You get her tomorrow?

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I should have had a lawyer in a baseball cap plead my case.

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You would charge her.

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I bet you would.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
God.

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I mean, just read this, attacks other children.

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
She destroys properties, smears feces on the wall.

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And then this underlining red, unteachable child.

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
No match for you.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's not funny.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's frightening.

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Take a compliment, huh?

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You'll handle her.

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You'll connect.

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I got it out.

220
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I can't have finished my plan.

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You know, we should have a rule.

222
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The first one who finishes their homework,

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the other one has to take some time out.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And we just hang together.

225
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Oh, so it's my house and you're making the rules?

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I live here most of the time.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is where I hang my hats.

228
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I should get some jurisdiction.

229
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Good night, teacher.

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Everything I know better you have in that file when you're off.

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay, okay, I'll read it.

232
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes.

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now, what do you suppose it might feel like

234
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
if you were new to some place and you didn't know anybody?

235
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What would that feel like?

236
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Or hey?

237
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Really bad.

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I've had enough.

239
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah, what did that feel like right here?

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't know. She stinks.

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Jordan, I don't want her sitting near me.

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
She'll spit me out.

243
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
She does stink like pee.

244
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
She needs help.

245
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're being very rude. That's dumb.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What do you think it feels like to tell someone that they stink?

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's terrible. It stinks terrible.

248
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It hurt my feelings.

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Thank you, Horey.

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And what might be a better way that we could teach her?

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You can learn her in private.

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That she stinks.

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And she wouldn't have to change her colors.

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's great. Good talking, too.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What else? What else do we do?

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We could pluck up our nose.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Ready?

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Backward. All of you.

259
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay, Derek, that's it.

260
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't want you to go any higher, okay?

261
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
All right.

262
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Jordan, Jordan's slow.

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Take it easy.

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm going to the very top.

265
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Nobody else can come up here.

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
She can come up here.

267
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No!

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Stop! Get out of my playroom!

269
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Come on!

270
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Get away from me!

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Don't come up here.

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Maybe you may be.

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Caitlin, if you'd like to play, you can join us.

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Come on!

275
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I want to be the only one out here.

276
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Nobody else can come up here.

277
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Get down!

278
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay.

279
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Jordan, watch where he's stepping.

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
All right. Thank you very much.

281
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What's up, Derek?

282
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There you go.

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's go back there.

284
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Come on.

285
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I got a cheese.

286
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Wow.

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Caitlin was deserted by her mother at the age of four

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and then left with her father, who was on welfare.

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Her father spent time in state prison for theft

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and she's currently residing with her father in a trader park.

291
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Wow.

292
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Her options closed pretty early, didn't they?

293
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't know.

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't know.

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I didn't give her any work yet.

296
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, you know, it's temporary.

297
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You don't have to teach her.

298
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Just let her sit.

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And just do nothing?

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think it would be easier on the other kids

301
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
not to stir this one up.

302
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Carol, I'm sorry.

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Carol, speaking of being kinder to my kids,

317
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
will you please talk to the school board

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
about recess with the rest of the school?

319
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
When the time is right, I will.

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You think you will?

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah.

322
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I found him hard enough.

323
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I think you're pretty good at pounding.

324
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, I am, aren't I?

325
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Come on.

326
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You have a cuddle.

327
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You didn't say hello to Melissa.

328
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hello.

329
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Here, everybody.

330
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Discussion time.

331
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Help him out with this mockery.

332
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Thanks, Miguel.

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Go ahead.

334
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Go ahead.

335
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Good luck, discussion.

336
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Good luck, discussion.

337
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Bradley, my push book.

338
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Caitlin.

339
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Caitlin.

340
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We need to have a talk.

341
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Now, listen.

342
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We went over the rules in class, right?

343
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And one of the rules is you have to try to talk.

344
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Now, I know it's really hard, but I need you to try.

345
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Shanice didn't talk when she first came here.

346
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Nathan did, Derek.

347
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay?

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And the next rule is that I want you to participate in discussion.

349
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Or we all get together as a group.

350
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And we talk about our feelings.

351
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
All right?

352
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Come on, let's go.

353
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Come on, sweetheart.

354
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Come here.

355
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Push her down the toilet.

356
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
She's crap.

357
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Crap.

358
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
No.

359
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
No.

360
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No.

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Push her down the toilet.

362
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
She's crap.

363
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Come on.

364
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Come on.

365
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
No.

366
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
No.

367
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No.

368
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No.

369
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
No.

370
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
No.

371
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No.

372
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
No.

373
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
No.

374
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No.

375
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No.

376
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No.

377
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No.

378
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No.

379
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No.

380
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
No.

381
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No.

382
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No.

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
No.

384
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
No.

385
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
No.

386
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
No.

387
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Are you ready?

388
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
When you're ready.

389
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You can come and join us.

390
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, it was the first blind date I've been on since high school.

391
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Ooh.

392
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So what was he like?

393
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Well, he wasn't exactly handsome.

394
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It wasn't exactly handsome, I'd call it more like distinguished.

395
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, so it was a dog.

396
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, he wasn't a dog. He was not a dog.

397
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What are you doing? He was...

398
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
He was a dog.

399
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He was a dog.

400
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
He was barking, baby. Let me tell you, he was barking.

401
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Miss Bernard, some girl's throwing stuff all over the classroom.

402
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Come on, give me the pencil. Give it to me.

403
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Kaelin, give me the pencil. Give me the pencil.

404
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Give me the pencil. Kaelin, give it to me. Give it.

405
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Kaelin, give me the pencil. Give me the pencil.

406
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Kaelin, give me the pencil. Kaelin, give me the pencil.

407
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Kaelin, give me the pencil.

408
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Stop. Stop.

409
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Grab your shoe.

410
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Stop.

411
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Stop.

412
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Help me.

413
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Help me, baby.

414
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Help me.

415
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Help me.

416
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What is happening this evening?

417
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Help me.

418
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm going to die.

419
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm going to die.

420
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm going to die.

421
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
With a child like Kaelin Eldridge,

422
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
there is always going to be potential danger.

423
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Look.

424
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The bottom line is

425
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
everybody is concerned

426
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
what are we going to do about this?

427
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Serve better coffee than seven in the morning starters.

428
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
We're better.

429
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What about social services,

430
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
putting more pressure on the hospital

431
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
and officially force them

432
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
to make an opening for her and take her in?

433
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I mean, like next week.

434
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
We can try. I don't know that it will do any good,

435
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
but we can try.

436
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And until then,

437
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I was wondering, I mean,

438
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
are we all going to celebrate when we send this little girl

439
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
to the mental hospital,

440
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
knowing that she probably will never get out again?

441
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No, I'm confused.

442
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Are you going to class indefinitely

443
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
after the goldfish catastrophe yesterday?

444
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I mean...

445
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No.

446
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No, I don't.

447
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Okay, so we're all agreed.

448
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Let's get her in the hospital as soon as possible, right?

449
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Meantime, Maggie,

450
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you should have lunch with your class every day

451
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
as long as she's with us, all right?

452
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Great.

453
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Guess what?

454
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm supposed to tell you

455
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
that Caitlin's early this morning

456
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and from now on.

457
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What are you talking about?

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well, the only bus that connects with her home,

459
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I guess it's very far, is the high school bus.

460
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So she'll be arriving here half an hour early every day.

461
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're kidding me.

462
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And then the afternoon, the bus will leave

463
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
from the high school one hour after your class.

464
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What are you talking about?

465
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
She has to wait here.

466
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Here, here.

467
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Look, I was in the office getting my mail.

468
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Carmen says it's only temporary.

469
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
She's probably going into the hospital a lot.

470
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Have a good day.

471
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The Marvel's realm is a death ray.

472
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's not a death ray and she's not going to hurt you.

473
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I want you to go back and do your letters, all right?

474
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You're a good mailman and you're doing a great job.

475
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Okay.

476
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I bet you, uh,

477
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
don't know how many Marvel's you've got.

478
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay.

479
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
How many Marvel's?

480
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Do you have one?

481
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Get up.

482
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's time to do some math. Come on.

483
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We're going to do math.

484
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No.

485
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
No.

486
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Right here.

487
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Get some blocks.

488
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Okay.

489
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
All right.

490
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I want you to take your hand.

491
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay. And I want you to count three.

492
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Count three.

493
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
All right. I'm going to help you.

494
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
One.

495
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Two.

496
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Bradley, come back.

497
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Come back here and finish your work.

498
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That is not acceptable.

499
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Now, we're going to do it again.

500
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll help you.

501
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Ready?

502
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
One.

503
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Two.

504
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's unacceptable.

505
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Right now.

506
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Miguel, don't have to resist.

507
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Now?

508
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Everybody, it's recess.

509
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We don't have the other kids like we talked about.

510
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But it's not your time.

511
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What the hell with their time?

512
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You take them out now.

513
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
No.

514
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yes.

515
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
No.

516
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No.

517
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We're doing math.

518
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes.

519
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yes.

520
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No.

521
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's time for you to learn.

522
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
We're going to learn.

523
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
No.

524
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No.

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
No.

526
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes.

527
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You know, most of the time, Katelyn still stinks.

528
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Like a toilet.

529
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
She'd be on that side from rabbit.

530
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Come on, Jordan. Don't make fun, okay?

531
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
If we had a pancake, Katelyn should be on the side with the pancake.

532
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Do you like my picture?

533
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yeah. Yeah. And I could treat.

534
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You remember what Maggie said about being nice?

535
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
About being kind, huh? Hey, hey, you remember?

536
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
No.

537
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Come on, go back and do your work.

538
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Come on, finish what you're doing.

539
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
All right, Stacy.

540
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Stop laughing now.

541
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Come on, let's go back to work.

542
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Get ready. I want you to find number four.

543
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Good job.

544
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You're number five.

545
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
All right, great.

546
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Ready?

547
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We have to go pee.

548
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You can go to the bathroom.

549
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And then we'll do some math, right?

550
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Right?

551
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Okay.

552
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
All right.

553
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Count out three.

554
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Good.

555
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Show me ten.

556
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Okay.

557
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
How about two plus two?

558
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
All right, I'm going to get you on this one.

559
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Fifteen, take away nine.

560
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Pretty smart, aren't you?

561
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Let's try some more.

562
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I mean, do you know how phenomenal that is?

563
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yeah, I think I do.

564
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Because the hardest part of this job

565
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
is that you can't ever really change these kids.

566
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I mean, no matter what.

567
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Because their brain is actually impaired in some way.

568
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Well, that doesn't stop you.

569
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I mean, Lisa Ann and Derek, they're autistic.

570
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I can't exactly set a goal for them.

571
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So it's basically a day-to-day kind of trying

572
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
to hold them together.

573
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But then with Caitlyn, you know,

574
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
she opened up like that.

575
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
It was a dream.

576
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I mean, what's the matter?

577
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I mean, I don't know if she can read yet.

578
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And I don't know if she's ever going to open up again,

579
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
but I reached her.

580
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Okay. This is it.

581
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
What do you think?

582
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's okay. Do you know what I'm saying to you?

583
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay, I thought it was perfect for over the kitchen table.

584
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You're not listening to me. Do you know what I'm trying to tell you?

585
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yes, I hear what you're trying to tell me.

586
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So enough of your kids, okay? We're going to interior decorate.

587
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But that's the point. She's not like the other kids.

588
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
She's different.

589
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Maggie, look.

590
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Can we just focus on that for one minute?

591
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It's nice.

592
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's a light.

593
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm sorry. I thought it was a porridge.

594
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Do you feel hurt? Guy can tell you fast, please.

595
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What I feel behind on, I've been trying to corner this guy for two days.

596
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Can I just steal him for a minute?

597
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah. Thanks.

598
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
We need to figure this out before lunch.

599
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I don't know. I'll try.

600
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Carol, have you heard about Caitlin?

601
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
What about her?

602
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
An opening in the hospital. I mean, they haven't gotten her in yet.

603
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I can't believe they're taking so long.

604
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'll call again today, okay?

605
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
No. Listen, something phenomenal has happened.

606
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
She is reading at a third grade level.

607
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
She's doing second grade math.

608
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And then I had Donald test her IQ yesterday.

609
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We are talking 168.

610
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Huh. Read.

611
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah, ask him. He'll tell you 168.

612
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That's genius.

613
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I mean, to put a little girl like that in a mental hospital,

614
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
it's just, it's a tragedy.

615
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
She's going to revert back to her behavior,

616
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and of course, I'll have to punish her.

617
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Can we appeal the decision?

618
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Can who appeal?

619
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
The school board.

620
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Based on her ability.

621
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And her behavior now.

622
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
No outbursts, no fighting, nothing destructive.

623
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I mean, she's almost like a new child.

624
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh, but that's true.

625
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You really deserve your reputation, don't you?

626
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Crazy kids, crazy teacher.

627
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah.

628
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh, one other thing.

629
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The recesses are going great,

630
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
and can we have assembly with the rest of the classes?

631
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Maybe.

632
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
One thing at a time, okay?

633
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay.

634
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
But you will try to find out about appealing the court decision.

635
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You want to know what troubles me most

636
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
about that little girl's future?

637
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
According to her file,

638
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
she never cries,

639
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and a child that never cries,

640
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
that's inhuman.

641
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You've never seen that before, haven't you?

642
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I've seen a lot of things in my class

643
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
that I've never seen before.

644
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Very human.

645
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You know what?

646
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Melissa's going to a party tonight.

647
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
She is? Yeah, you going to go with her?

648
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
No.

649
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
She's going to go by herself?

650
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah, I'm just going to take her.

651
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
But you're going to drop her off?

652
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Oh, you figure it out.

653
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Oh, good. Well, you run off,

654
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and I'll see you tomorrow, sweetie. Bye-bye.

655
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Bye-bye.

656
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Caitlin.

657
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Where's we?

658
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I've got a great idea.

659
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Come on.

660
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay.

661
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I thought we could

662
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
comb your hair out so it looks just like mine.

663
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Now, hmm.

664
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
How come you're being nice to me?

665
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Because I like you.

666
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Okay?

667
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Now I'm going to put the other bread in.

668
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I just

669
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
like

670
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
that.

671
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Maybe tomorrow

672
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
we'll give it a wash, okay?

673
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You ready?

674
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You look

675
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
beautiful, Caitlin.

676
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
My pa,

677
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
he'll take him away

678
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
and say I stole him.

679
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Nobody ever gave

680
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
me nothing.

681
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'll tell you what.

682
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Why don't you wear them when you're in school?

683
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And then I'll keep them

684
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
very safe for you at night.

685
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Okay?

686
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Okay.

687
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It's too big to carry around.

688
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
For

689
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
almost a year together.

690
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
My appreciation.

691
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Open it.

692
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
They're beautiful.

693
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I've never had real pearls before.

694
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
They are real, aren't they?

695
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
There.

696
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I don't know what to say.

697
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I love you, Maggie.

698
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Let's get married, okay?

699
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I...

700
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Well?

701
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Well, why are you changing the rules?

702
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I mean, we've had such a great year.

703
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I want the next one to be even better.

704
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
We bought a lamp together.

705
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Two of my bosses came

706
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
into my office this afternoon.

707
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That partnership's going to happen.

708
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You're kidding.

709
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Wonderful.

710
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Congratulations. Thank you.

711
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Why didn't you tell me? I am telling you.

712
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I've screwed up so many relationships in my time.

713
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Now that I finally got it right,

714
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I thought, you know...

715
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Thank you.

716
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
At the end of the summer,

717
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
they owe me three weeks and you've got your summer application.

718
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Damn.

719
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I've applied to go back and get my doctorate.

720
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You know that.

721
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I mean, you said you weren't sure.

722
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Well, I might need that degree if I go back

723
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
to college someday.

724
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I just have to

725
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
feel that it's right.

726
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I need

727
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
to feel a buzz, you know?

728
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah, I've seen it go off

729
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
about that kid in your class.

730
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And, uh...

731
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
you and me?

732
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
There isn't a buzz.

733
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm just saying that

734
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I need to get a grip on my own life

735
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
before I take on somebody else's, that's all.

736
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You're shutting down, Meg.

737
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I asked you to marry me.

738
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
No.

739
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You asked me to change my whole life.

740
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It really scares you, doesn't it?

741
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
The idea of trusting someone that much.

742
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't want to change you, Meg.

743
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I just want to be with you.

744
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I want to be with you.

745
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
They're beautiful.

746
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Morning, Caitlin.

747
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Good morning.

748
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Would you put the clips in my hair now?

749
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You bet.

750
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I think this morning I'm going to give you

751
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
the full beauty treatment, head to toe.

752
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
A bath.

753
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I found some nice things for you

754
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
in our clothes box.

755
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
My paw won't let me keep them.

756
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
We always see about that.

757
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Anyway,

758
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
you know, I

759
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
noticed some scars on your back

760
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
and on your ankle.

761
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
What happened?

762
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I fell.

763
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Caitlin, did your paw ever

764
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
leave any marks on you?

765
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
You know, like maybe spank you real hard

766
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
or something?

767
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
It was my mom.

768
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But my paw, he loves me

769
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and never ever run away or dump me.

770
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Why did your mom do that?

771
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
What happened?

772
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Well, I'm trying, man,

773
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
but it is tough, I'll tell you.

774
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I told you things have changed

775
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
since we were stationed down here.

776
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Yeah, well, I sure as hell ain't right.

777
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And this thing all the way back to Portland, I'll tell you that.

778
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Listen, I'll hook something up.

779
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Don't worry.

780
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
We'll talk soon.

781
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Traylor's getting a little small for three people.

782
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I heard that.

783
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Um, Ms. Joldridge?

784
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Oh, hi. I'm Keaton's teacher.

785
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Hey, give me a minute.

786
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Listen, I'm out of here, all right?

787
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
What's she done now, lady?

788
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
She hasn't done anything.

789
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Really, she's a great kid.

790
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So,

791
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
are you going to take her away?

792
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Could we step inside?

793
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And there's some clothes at school

794
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
that we could give, Caitlin.

795
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I also wanted to tell you

796
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
what a great read of your little girl is.

797
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Oh, yeah?

798
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So, what's she done bad?

799
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
She hasn't done anything bad.

800
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I came to tell you

801
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
that she's really very smart

802
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
and I wanted her to have the clothes.

803
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You see him? That's Jimmy.

804
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That's Caitlin's brother.

805
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
He was my boy

806
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
until that bitch took him away.

807
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
He left me with that little bastard

808
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and I can't do anything with her.

809
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
What about a foster home?

810
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I mean, that's a solution.

811
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Well, what kind of a bastard

812
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
would I be if I gave her up?

813
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You want me to give her up?

814
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
No, you're full of crap.

815
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
There's no need to talk that way.

816
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Miguel, it's all right. It's all right, Mr. Eldridge.

817
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Mr. Eldridge, listen, listen.

818
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You said...

819
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You said you couldn't control her.

820
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I was just trying to make a suggestion.

821
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
No, no, no, no, no.

822
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Thank you so much.

823
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I think you have to leave now.

824
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
We don't want your clothes.

825
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Thank you.

826
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
We don't need your charity.

827
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Come on.

828
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Thank you.

829
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You should go back to lifting refrigerators, huh?

830
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's discouraging, isn't it?

831
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But you're going to have to deal

832
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
with all kinds of things when you work with these kids.

833
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I don't know if I want to.

834
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Family used to live in a place like this.

835
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Now, that's why I don't like touching the rat.

836
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Seven brothers and sisters.

837
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Me in the middle, all in three rooms.

838
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I understand.

839
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's sad, too, because you're great with children.

840
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
My girlfriend.

841
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
She wants me to go back to school to be a teacher.

842
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Smart girlfriend.

843
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You can't do this for me.

844
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Two days, just take two days off.

845
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Next Thursday and Friday.

846
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yes.

847
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Too soon. I can't leave Caitlyn for two days.

848
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Suddenly like that. She's right on the edge.

849
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I've been working on a defense for this case for two months

850
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
because Wally wants to nail that account.

851
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
When Wally, the most senior partner,

852
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
asks the most junior partner to join him

853
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
for a long weekend at the beach house with a client,

854
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
the most junior partner goes.

855
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So why do I have to go?

856
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Because Wally specifically asked me to bring it to couples' thing.

857
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I just can't.

858
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm the only safe fridge she has.

859
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Give me a break.

860
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I mean it.

861
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You see the way she lives.

862
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I feel for the kid, but you're going overboard on this.

863
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
We're talking two days here.

864
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
It is tough for a kid to trust

865
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
after she has been so badly abused.

866
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And I thought the time away would be good for us.

867
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
For a lot of reasons.

868
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You're right.

869
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It's just bad timing, that's all.

870
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Well, everything is these days.

871
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Does it have to be next weekend?

872
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yes, it has to be next.

873
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Why do you always have to try to control everything?

874
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I am not trying to control everything.

875
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
What are you talking about?

876
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Everything. That girl's life, my life, this relationship.

877
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I am not trying to control you.

878
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You are trying to control me.

879
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Control for you means not having to let go of anything, Maggie,

880
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
including your feelings.

881
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Down?

882
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Let's go.

883
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
For three days.

884
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'll take Friday off.

885
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
We can drive to Santa Barbara on Thursday night.

886
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I want to.

887
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Really.

888
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'll, um...

889
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll try to leave the kids in the classroom.

890
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay, everybody.

891
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's a stop.

892
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Fun now.

893
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I got the platform.

894
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Can we go again in a little while?

895
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Let's wait here.

896
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Is Kate okay?

897
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I don't know.

898
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Did you see that look on her face when I told her

899
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I was going to be in Santa Barbara?

900
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Maybe I shouldn't take Friday off.

901
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
No, it should be all right.

902
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm really going to put her in that hospital tonight.

903
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
She's just so raw right now.

904
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
She'll be okay though, you know?

905
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
She's not acting out.

906
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Acting out? You're learning fast.

907
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
She didn't run.

908
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
She didn't make a major explosion, but she's ticking down now, you know?

909
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What, sweetheart?

910
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Can you look through your guts?

911
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Come on.

912
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Show me where, sweetheart.

913
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Where?

914
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Here you go.

915
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Here you go.

916
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Come here.

917
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Come here. I know.

918
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I know, sweetheart.

919
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
He's okay.

920
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Feeling a little better, huh?

921
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Caitlin, answer me.

922
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Oh, sweetie.

923
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I wish I could make you understand,

924
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
but I can leave for a day and you'll be all right.

925
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Katie, I'm your teacher, you know,

926
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
and we won't always be together.

927
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Listen to me. Listen.

928
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
This one day that I'll be away,

929
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
you can get along without me.

930
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And it's so important that you understand that.

931
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
When are you gonna be back?

932
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Monday morning.

933
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Before you know it.

934
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Trust me.

935
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'll be right back.

936
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Did you fix something with my hair, right?

937
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I think that's a great idea.

938
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I like the way your lady plays the game.

939
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Serious. You too?

940
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You know, I had that backhand volley,

941
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
and I missed it.

942
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'll tell you, Wally, she never thinks she's good enough.

943
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So, Maggie, we're having a charity tournament next month,

944
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and you are such a great player. We'd love to have you.

945
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
You know, a lot of the wives are gonna be there.

946
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Well, thanks. I appreciate it.

947
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Great.

948
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Give me a break.

949
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
She needs Lisa and wants to order.

950
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Would you like some stew?

951
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Okay.

952
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So would you like anything?

953
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
One stew.

954
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Okay.

955
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Two stews coming right up.

956
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Yes. That's a good boy, Derek.

957
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You hung up your coat by yourself.

958
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Didn't you?

959
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
You be our customer.

960
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You're ready for this guy.

961
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I wanna be the cook.

962
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I wanna be the cook. I want to.

963
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You have to be the waitress.

964
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I am the cook.

965
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Fine. You can be it for a minute,

966
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and then I'll be the cook.

967
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Brad, you didn't tell her.

968
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
She was such a good storyteller.

969
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You know, I thought you were gonna tell us the...

970
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Excuse me.

971
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
You know, Doris, I thought you were gonna tell us the one

972
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
about the three guys and the rat.

973
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
You know, the man of the cloth,

974
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
the doctor and the lawyer, okay?

975
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Why are you doing this?

976
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm trying to reach McGill.

977
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Something's gotta be wrong.

978
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Maggie, you've left the table three times

979
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
in the last 15 minutes. It's making people uncomfortable.

980
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Dan, I'm worried.

981
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Look, I'll tell them about Caitlin,

982
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
and then they don't have to feel uncomfortable.

983
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I don't think they're interested. They're trying to enjoy their dinner

984
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and not talk about their work.

985
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm sorry if sometimes my job

986
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
and my life are a little...

987
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
a little.

988
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Just come back to the table, okay?

989
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I will. I'll be right there.

990
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I promise.

991
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Dan, would you come in

992
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
or close the door?

993
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
No.

994
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It's freezing out there.

995
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
No more than that is in here.

996
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You aren't gonna let it go, are you?

997
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Not it, Maggie.

998
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You.

999
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You.

1000
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I don't want to let you go.

1001
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Dan, I made a mistake.

1002
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I never should have

1003
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
said I was gonna come.

1004
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I just don't fit in

1005
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
as one of the wives.

1006
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I don't want you to be

1007
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
one of the wives.

1008
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
No.

1009
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Why do you have to do this?

1010
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
What?

1011
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Push me off.

1012
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I don't know.

1013
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Something

1014
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
happens to me when somebody

1015
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
gets too close.

1016
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Well, I'm sorry.

1017
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It makes you a tough woman

1018
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
to love.

1019
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Slumming it?

1020
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
She's going in.

1021
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
The school board didn't think it was warranted

1022
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
to appeal.

1023
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Not warranted.

1024
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
What about a lawsuit?

1025
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
There has to be something that we can do.

1026
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
No. They expect an opening soon

1027
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
before Easter, they think.

1028
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But you should feel proud, you know?

1029
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
You've brought her so far.

1030
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Obviously, not far enough.

1031
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Why? Why should I continue teaching?

1032
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So I can watch another child

1033
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
be destroyed by the system.

1034
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Every child can't be saved, Maggie.

1035
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You're a teacher.

1036
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
That's the equation.

1037
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
What else would you do?

1038
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Teach a muffin.

1039
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You know, you're never gonna change

1040
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
the system the way you want.

1041
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
You want it all perfect.

1042
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Well, that's your terrific teaching

1043
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
and the energy.

1044
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
That's what you do.

1045
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
That's your terrific teaching and the energy.

1046
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And sometimes you'll even make a difference.

1047
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
A little difference.

1048
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Let's get real.

1049
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
There ain't no Camelot.

1050
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
That's not a reality that I can live with.

1051
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Okay, okay.

1052
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Solve your own problems.

1053
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I can't. Please.

1054
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Call him off.

1055
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I'll slow it down.

1056
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
You want some muffin?

1057
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
No, go ahead.

1058
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Oh, Sam, one other thing.

1059
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
You know, my class doesn't get to go to assembly

1060
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
but the rest of the school.

1061
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I mean, if they did, it would be great.

1062
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You never stopped, do you?

1063
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
First recess, now assembly.

1064
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
They've already learned the Pledge of Allegiance, Sam.

1065
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Give me your mom's leave.

1066
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Deal.

1067
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Yes, sweetie?

1068
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Can you tell me a story?

1069
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm really busy right now.

1070
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Maybe later when you're waiting for the bus, okay?

1071
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
My favorite story was about a little girl

1072
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
who lived in a forest far, far away.

1073
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It was a beautiful forest.

1074
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But the little girl was very lonely

1075
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
because she had nobody to play with.

1076
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
And then one day,

1077
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
she saw a big lion

1078
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
standing on a rock staring down at her.

1079
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Well,

1080
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
she was so lonely

1081
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
that she decided to ask for help.

1082
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And then one day,

1083
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
she saw a big lion

1084
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
standing on a rock staring down at her.

1085
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
She was so lonely

1086
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
that she decided to ask the lion

1087
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
if he would play with her.

1088
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
But the lion said he couldn't

1089
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
because he hadn't been tamed.

1090
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
What's that, tamed?

1091
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Well, that is the exact same question

1092
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
that the little girl asked the lion.

1093
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And the lion told her

1094
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
that being tamed was about becoming friends.

1095
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And he said

1096
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
that he'd been born wild

1097
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
and fierce.

1098
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
And that

1099
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
he wanted to.

1100
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
She could become his friend

1101
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
if she would give him all of her love

1102
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
and trust.

1103
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
You see, the idea was that

1104
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
once the lion felt what it was like

1105
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
to be needed

1106
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and to trust,

1107
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
then he would have to love the little girl back.

1108
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And then the lion

1109
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
would be tamed.

1110
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Well,

1111
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
it had been so long since the little girl

1112
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
had had anybody to play with

1113
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
that she agreed

1114
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
to do what the lion asked.

1115
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And you know what?

1116
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Very soon

1117
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
they had learned

1118
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
together to love

1119
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
and to need

1120
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and to trust.

1121
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And then they were

1122
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
in each other's hearts forever.

1123
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And then they both were tamed.

1124
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And then

1125
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
they were

1126
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
in each other's hearts forever.

1127
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And then

1128
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
they both were tamed.

1129
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And then

1130
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
they both were tamed.

1131
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And then

1132
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
they both were tamed.

1133
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And then

1134
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
they both were tamed.

1135
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And then

1136
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
they both were tamed.

1137
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And then

1138
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
they both were tamed.

1139
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Hi, Dan here.

1140
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Now it's your turn.

1141
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Okay.

1142
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Rain stop.

1143
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Tomorrow I go back to school.

1144
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Yeah.

1145
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
What a lousy day

1146
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
for you dad to pick up a job, huh?

1147
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Wanna play checkers?

1148
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
No.

1149
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You like your dolly, don't you?

1150
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Can I have it for me?

1151
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
You know we could

1152
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
we could play house.

1153
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You could be my dolly.

1154
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
This one's better.

1155
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
This one's better.

1156
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
This one's better.

1157
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
This one's better.

1158
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Which one?

1159
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
That one.

1160
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
This one's too hard.

1161
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
No.

1162
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
This one's better.

1163
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah, that's good.

1164
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Okay, I'll try.

1165
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
This one's better.

1166
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Okay, sweetie.

1167
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Okay.

1168
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Now let's do some math, alright?

1169
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I can't.

1170
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Come here, I'll help you.

1171
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Come on.

1172
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
You guys finish up over there.

1173
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Okay.

1174
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Now let's see, where were we?

1175
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Okay, we've got two more to do, okay?

1176
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So now number nine.

1177
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
If it's not 12 minus seven

1178
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
then what number is it?

1179
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Sweetheart, what number is it?

1180
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
If it's not...

1181
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Oh, hey look.

1182
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Oh my God.

1183
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Oh, come here, come here.

1184
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Sweetheart, just lay back, just lay back.

1185
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Come here.

1186
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Alright.

1187
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Okay, I'll just stand and be alright.

1188
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I'll just stand and be alright.

1189
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I'm right here.

1190
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I think it's gonna be okay.

1191
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Okay, here we go.

1192
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Alright, what's that up in the yard?

1193
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Alright, let's go.

1194
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Alright, make sure they don't weigh that much in, alright?

1195
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Alright everybody, let's get ready

1196
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
to go out for recess.

1197
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I don't want to go out until Caitlyn comes back.

1198
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I understand, sweetie.

1199
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Come on.

1200
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
My grandpa was to the hospital

1201
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
and he died there.

1202
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Caitlyn's gonna die.

1203
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Come here, sweetie.

1204
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
She's gonna be fine, really.

1205
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
She's gonna be much better.

1206
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Hey, the operation is to stop the bleeding.

1207
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And she's getting stronger and stronger every day.

1208
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Okay, she's gonna live a long, long time.

1209
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
My mom said her dad's friend who did that

1210
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
should be killed dead.

1211
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

1212
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Bradley, come here, come here.

1213
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Come here.

1214
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Alright, everybody.

1215
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I know it's a real scary thing.

1216
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
What happened to Caitlyn?

1217
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Alright, I'll tell you what.

1218
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Before we go out for recess, let's have a talk.

1219
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Alright?

1220
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And bring your pictures for Caitlyn.

1221
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Come on, kids, let's go.

1222
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Doctor, that is the CCU.

1223
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Doctor, that is the CCU. Please.

1224
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Take it all.

1225
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Don't cry, Maggie.

1226
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
It doesn't hurt too much anymore.

1227
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
It makes me feel a little bit better

1228
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
to cry sometimes, kitty.

1229
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Here you go.

1230
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Do you want to hold my marble like you did yesterday?

1231
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
No, I think I just want to hold your hand tonight.

1232
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Last night, when I woke up,

1233
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
it was sort of scary.

1234
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I wanted my paw,

1235
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
but I didn't cry none.

1236
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Miguel went to get him, sweetheart.

1237
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
It's for you, from everybody.

1238
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Just for me?

1239
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Hello, Maggie.

1240
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Oh, great, Miguel.

1241
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Hello, Caitlyn. How are you?

1242
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Good.

1243
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Papa.

1244
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Mr. Elvish, why don't you go talk to her?

1245
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
She asked for you.

1246
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Well, I can't help her in home.

1247
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
She wants me to see her like that.

1248
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I got this, uh...

1249
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
today.

1250
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I can't believe that this rock...

1251
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Hey.

1252
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Hey.

1253
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Thanks for meeting me.

1254
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
No problem.

1255
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Just had to cancel three and a half major clients, that's all.

1256
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
How's Caitlyn?

1257
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
She's fine. She's up, walking,

1258
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
mending fast.

1259
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Good.

1260
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Dan, I called you because I have to know.

1261
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I'm sorry.

1262
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I'm sorry.

1263
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I'm sorry.

1264
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Dan, I called you because I have to know.

1265
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
If I can petition the court.

1266
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I mean, can I appeal her case?

1267
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Wait a minute. You mean just you?

1268
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
I know I'm not her guardian or anything official,

1269
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
but can I appeal?

1270
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
You want to go over the heads of, what, the school board,

1271
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
the social services department?

1272
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I don't want to. I have to.

1273
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Everybody has turned me down.

1274
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
And believe me, I've made as much noise as I possibly can.

1275
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I bet you have.

1276
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Maggie the Madwoman.

1277
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Come on, there's a decent new place around the corner.

1278
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
You lose your job, you know that?

1279
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I'm giving up teaching at the end of the year anyway.

1280
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I decided to get my doctorate.

1281
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You're kidding.

1282
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
No, I'm serious.

1283
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Anyway, Caitlyn's the issue now.

1284
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Saving Caitlyn.

1285
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Yeah, she always had a little more buzz than anyone around for me.

1286
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I'll tell you the truth, Maggie.

1287
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I was a little jealous.

1288
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I was disappointed you called about her instead of us.

1289
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I found us.

1290
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Why? You're the one who snuck off with his hat

1291
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
and left a note on the rock.

1292
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Dan, a note?

1293
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Not only corny, but a little chicken, wasn't it?

1294
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I had my reasons.

1295
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I don't want to talk about this.

1296
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Okay, well, my opinion is you can't appeal the case.

1297
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It's risky. Nobody's going to like it.

1298
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
But you say you don't care.

1299
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Will you take it on?

1300
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Oh, boy, you've got guts.

1301
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Maggie the Madwoman.

1302
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And a friend.

1303
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
A good friend who needs you very much.

1304
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I hope you're buying the drinks.

1305
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I'm not going to make any money off this one.

1306
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
It's tough on a child because

1307
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
basically they have no choice.

1308
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Yeah, I worry for Caitlyn.

1309
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
You know, it's so hard

1310
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
to stop feeling for them.

1311
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Well, maybe that's what makes a good teacher.

1312
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Or a bad one.

1313
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
You think maybe

1314
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
maybe I make a good teacher?

1315
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I think you ought to look in the mirror

1316
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
and ask yourself that question.

1317
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
There he is.

1318
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Okay, I'll go to the payphone and call Dan.

1319
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I let that bastard stay here

1320
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
for two months and look what he does.

1321
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I beat the crap out of them though

1322
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
before they took him off to jail.

1323
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
No, thanks.

1324
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Well, I appreciate you bringing me

1325
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
the groceries very much.

1326
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Mr. Eldage, we need you to do something

1327
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
for your little girl.

1328
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It's important for her, you know.

1329
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
You're appealing to the court,

1330
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
not to send Caitlyn to the state hospital.

1331
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And we want you to come to court next Thursday

1332
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
and just answer a few questions.

1333
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Go to court?

1334
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
This is the date of the court appearance,

1335
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
the time, and the place.

1336
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
It's for your daughter, you understand?

1337
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I ain't sure I got a daughter.

1338
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Now you're full of it. You've got a daughter

1339
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and from what I understand she's a great little kid.

1340
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Now you'll be there

1341
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
for her.

1342
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Here.

1343
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You take this.

1344
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
What's that for?

1345
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Take it.

1346
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Oh.

1347
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Take your money, Mr.

1348
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and you get the hell out of here.

1349
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Mr. Eldage.

1350
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
This is my house!

1351
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
That guy's crazy.

1352
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Damn.

1353
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Can we win without him?

1354
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Hey!

1355
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Hey!

1356
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Okay.

1357
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
One, two, three, four.

1358
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Here, here.

1359
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
You buy Caitlyn her dress.

1360
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Green.

1361
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I think she likes green.

1362
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Did you remember the tapes?

1363
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
They're right here in my briefcase.

1364
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It's all just...

1365
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
The parents of the boy she burned.

1366
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I didn't know they were going to be here.

1367
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I figured they would be. They want to see Caitlyn put away forever.

1368
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Where's Pa?

1369
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Told him Peter, half hour ago.

1370
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Come here sweetheart, sit down.

1371
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I don't think your Pa's going to be able to make it.

1372
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
You should have thrown him in the car and dragged him down here

1373
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
whether he likes courtrooms or not.

1374
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
What I brought you?

1375
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I want you to draw me a beautiful picture.

1376
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Is everything okay?

1377
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Do you have any questions? You see that guard right there?

1378
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
He'll call me.

1379
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I want to go and tell him right now.

1380
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
It's okay.

1381
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
He wasn't in there either.

1382
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Excuse me. Do you see that little girl right there?

1383
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
You'll be safe here honey.

1384
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Maggie and I will be right there.

1385
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Appreciate it.

1386
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Okay?

1387
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Right.

1388
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
No problem.

1389
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Thank you.

1390
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Here you go sweetie.

1391
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Did I do good enough?

1392
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
You did great kiddo.

1393
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I think the judge was very impressed.

1394
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Dan is in the judge's chambers right now

1395
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
discussing everything that went on in the courtroom.

1396
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And then the judge will make his decision.

1397
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Is he going to send me away for a long time?

1398
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I hope not kiddo.

1399
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Okay.

1400
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Based on the testimony one could deduce

1401
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
that she shows some and I underline

1402
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
some signs of improvement.

1403
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But what does that really mean?

1404
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
That she fits in a class full of misfits?

1405
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Oh come on. Look that is just

1406
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
cheap name calling. This is a child

1407
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
who had never experienced even the smallest

1408
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
expression of love.

1409
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And then she was put into a healthy,

1410
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
nurturing environment and incredible things happened.

1411
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
You saw the videotape her teacher made.

1412
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
This Caitlyn

1413
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
is a different child.

1414
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I can't think of anything more to get real time for this.

1415
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
This is Ryan.

1416
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
What is it?

1417
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Could you excuse us just for a minute?

1418
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I want you to know that I didn't appeal

1419
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
to the court on behalf of Caitlyn.

1420
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Because I excuse what she did to your son.

1421
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It was awful and cruel.

1422
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Then why not put her away?

1423
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Because I know

1424
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
that the pain she inflicted came from such

1425
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
tremendous hurt and fear

1426
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
that she was having to hold inside.

1427
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And now that she's learning to release

1428
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
those feelings responsibly, there's no

1429
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
need to act them out. She doesn't have

1430
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
to keep trying to prove that she is a

1431
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
bad girl.

1432
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
You want me to feel sorry for her?

1433
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Well, I don't.

1434
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Neither do I.

1435
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Feeling sorry for kids like Caitlyn.

1436
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
That doesn't help them survive.

1437
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
That's exactly what I try to teach each of

1438
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
my kids how to survive

1439
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
in a world that

1440
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
hands them almost nothing besides pain

1441
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
and rejection.

1442
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I can't do anything about the past.

1443
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I wish I could, but I can't.

1444
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Nobody is going to gain

1445
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
from trying to destroy that little girl's future.

1446
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
But how can you be sure?

1447
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
How can you guarantee that she's not going to

1448
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
torture some innocent kid as soon as

1449
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
she gets away from that teacher?

1450
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Exactly.

1451
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Look,

1452
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I can't

1453
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
guarantee anything,

1454
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
your honor.

1455
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
But what's the choice here

1456
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
to shut a child with Caitlyn's

1457
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
potential away from society

1458
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
forever?

1459
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
She is six and a half

1460
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
years old.

1461
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
What's taking so long?

1462
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Waiting so hard, isn't it, kiddo?

1463
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Maggie?

1464
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I want you to tame me

1465
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
like the little girl did the lion.

1466
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
No hospitals.

1467
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Just therapy.

1468
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Yes, yes.

1469
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Bottom line, the judge thought

1470
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
that under the circumstances,

1471
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Caitlyn made major progress.

1472
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Enough to live at home and attend

1473
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
regular classes next year.

1474
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
That's wonderful.

1475
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Sweetheart, that's wonderful.

1476
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
You're wonderful.

1477
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Hey, kiddo.

1478
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It's Caitlyn's time.

1479
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Let's celebrate.

1480
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Come on, pizza.

1481
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And hot dogs.

1482
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
French fries.

1483
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And hot fudge sundaes for dessert.

1484
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Mr. Eldridge, we won.

1485
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Listen, we're going to go celebrate.

1486
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Would you join us?

1487
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
No, I can't.

1488
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I mean, it's your party anyway.

1489
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
You did it.

1490
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Well, you, uh...

1491
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You ought to know that your being here

1492
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
was very important to the judge.

1493
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Thanks for the dress, Pa.

1494
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Meat color.

1495
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I can keep it, right?

1496
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Because you gave it to me.

1497
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
You look real nice.

1498
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Go have some fun.

1499
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Huh?

1500
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Behave yourself.

1501
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Come on, kiddo. Let's go.

1502
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Yeah!

1503
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
All right!

1504
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Me, too.

1505
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Come on, kiddo. Pizza.

1506
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
You know, there are a lot of places

1507
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
you can teach in Seattle.

1508
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You don't care that I changed my mind.

1509
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Well...

1510
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
What else is new?

1511
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
When I saw Caitlyn tonight,

1512
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I knew...

1513
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I knew you to understand something.

1514
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I was able to give that little word

1515
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
to the judge.

1516
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I was able to understand something.

1517
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I was able to give that little girl

1518
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
a love that nobody else

1519
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
had ever been able to give her before.

1520
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
A love that...

1521
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I didn't even realize

1522
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
that I had with him to give.

1523
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
And she was so vulnerable

1524
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
and so scared.

1525
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
And she risked it all

1526
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
by loving me back.

1527
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And I was the only person there

1528
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
who could celebrate

1529
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
our existence.

1530
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
That's why I'm gonna

1531
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
go back and teach again.

1532
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
It's what I do.

1533
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You really get me.

1534
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
So when do you move?

1535
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Next month.

1536
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
You know, the reason I wrote you that

1537
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
chicken letter

1538
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I left on a half rack

1539
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
was because I knew I had to leave.

1540
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I knew if I

1541
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
looked into your eyes, I wouldn't be able to.

1542
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And you think it'll be

1543
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
a breeze for me to leave?

1544
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Me or Kate?

1545
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And sometimes

1546
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
you are such a butt head.

1547
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You didn't answer my question, Maggie.

1548
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I need to know.

1549
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Then I'm drawing really hard

1550
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
this time

1551
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
not to shut down.

1552
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Well...

1553
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I still have a little more than three weeks.

1554
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Good morning, Margaret.

1555
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Hello, Harold.

1556
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Margaret, what would you say

1557
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
if Caitlin and

1558
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
two of your more advanced kids

1559
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
went to the color guard

1560
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
at the last assembly of the year?

1561
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I'd say terrific, Harold.

1562
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
But why just Caitlin and two of the others?

1563
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I think you'd be even more proud

1564
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
of your special ed class

1565
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
if they all were the color guard.

1566
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Well, I think that's risking a bit too much.

1567
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Come on, Harold. Don't let your good instincts

1568
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
fail you now.

1569
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I ain't gonna go.

1570
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
This is my class.

1571
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Margaret, the school year

1572
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
will be over in a few weeks.

1573
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
And everybody's agreed, Mr. Sherman,

1574
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
the school board, everybody,

1575
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
that you're ready to go into a regular class

1576
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
next year.

1577
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I wanna stay in this crazy class with you.

1578
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Kittle.

1579
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Come on, Lisa. Let's go paint.

1580
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Listen,

1581
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
you know, next year

1582
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I probably won't be here.

1583
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I've been good. You said so.

1584
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
My pa said so.

1585
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
He bring home a pizza.

1586
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Sometimes

1587
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
new ideas take a little time, don't they?

1588
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Come on.

1589
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Let's get ready and practice

1590
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
for assembly, okay?

1591
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Come on.

1592
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Good, good, and...

1593
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
What's in here?

1594
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
No, and to the public.

1595
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Don't we paint this? We're always smoothing

1596
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
into this bunch.

1597
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Good, good.

1598
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Other than

1599
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
invisible

1600
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
for liberty and justice for all.

1601
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Yeah, good job, Derek. Good job.

1602
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
You go help those guys clean up, okay?

1603
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Come on.

1604
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm so sad to leave them.

1605
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I know. The end of the year always hurts.

1606
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Okay.

1607
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
For you, I have

1608
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
a little thank you.

1609
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
California University

1610
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
is pleased to admit Miguel Prado

1611
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
for the fall semester.

1612
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Come here, you.

1613
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Congratulations.

1614
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Where did you... Oh, he's...

1615
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
It's wonderful. It's wonderful.

1616
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I looked in the mirror and I said,

1617
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
this guy could be a good teacher.

1618
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
You know, I think that man was right.

1619
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Derek.

1620
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Derek.

1621
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Come here.

1622
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Come on. It's always going to get hurt.

1623
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Okay, everybody, assembly in five minutes.

1624
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
You have to go to the bathroom now's the time.

1625
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You're going to break your class next year.

1626
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
You and me. No more geeks.

1627
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
He's a mean incredible broadcaster

1628
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
and I'm so happy with him.

1629
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
And he hangs his coat every time.

1630
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
He knows the pledge. What do you see him in when he's in?

1631
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
When he's just too fresh?

1632
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Maggie, Maggie, excuse me.

1633
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Um, Caitlin slipped out of the auditorium.

1634
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I don't know where... Okay.

1635
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Go back with the others. I'll find her.

1636
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Okay. This is Foster. I'm sorry, but...

1637
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I'll talk to you if this isn't okay.

1638
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Oh, okay. That's all right.

1639
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Sorry.

1640
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Okay, now.

1641
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
What's wrong?

1642
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Caitlin.

1643
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
She's not here.

1644
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Okay, I'll be right back.

1645
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Okay.

1646
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I was worried about you, sweetie.

1647
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Come on, the assembly's starting.

1648
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Let's go.

1649
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Gordie and Derek, they're waiting for you to leave them, you know?

1650
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Let's go, sweetie. Come on.

1651
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
No.

1652
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I don't want you to ruin the day for everybody.

1653
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Don't kick me out.

1654
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I'm not going to kick me out.

1655
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I'm not taking you out, honey.

1656
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
You don't need this class anymore.

1657
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
What do you mean, you don't need them, sweetie?

1658
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I'm not taking you out, honey.

1659
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You don't need this class anymore.

1660
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
What do you mean, you don't need them, still crazy?

1661
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
You are not crazy.

1662
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Now stop thinking that.

1663
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Fine, then I'll be the craziest girl in the whole world.

1664
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Then I'll make you kick me here.

1665
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Caitlin, listen to me. Listen to me carefully.

1666
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I am going away next year.

1667
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I am not going to be here.

1668
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Sweetheart, you have grown so much,

1669
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
and so have I.

1670
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And now it's time to see how good that growing up was.

1671
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
You're ready to try it on your own.

1672
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
You're strong.

1673
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Oh, sweetheart.

1674
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
No, he's going to pull me again.

1675
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Okay, that's all right. Where is she?

1676
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Look, Maggie's not here yet, okay?

1677
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1678
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
But if these kids are not ready in five minutes,

1679
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I'm going to have to send some band members out.

1680
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I'm doing the best I can.

1681
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm sorry.

1682
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I don't know where they are.

1683
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Where's my hair?

1684
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
You want to know what my mama did when she left me?

1685
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
You want to know?

1686
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Of course I do, sweetheart, but everybody's waiting.

1687
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Just listen.

1688
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
We were in the car.

1689
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
See?

1690
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Jimmy wanted it.

1691
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
No way. My mama gave it to me.

1692
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
It's the best that each ever did give me.

1693
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Sweetheart, we're ready.

1694
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I was screaming in the back.

1695
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I was back there trying to make a nice...

1696
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Mama said,

1697
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Caitlin, come up here.

1698
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
She gave me a kiss on the cheek

1699
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
and opened the door

1700
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
and pushed me onto the highway.

1701
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
See?

1702
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I know, sweetheart.

1703
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
See? You're just like my mama leaving.

1704
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
How come you're not going to stay or make me good?

1705
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I am not leaving you.

1706
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Remember the story that I told you about

1707
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
the little girl who lived in the forest

1708
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
and how she tamed the lion

1709
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
by showing him that she loved him?

1710
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Well, that's how it is with us.

1711
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
We'll always love each other.

1712
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And just like that little girl found out,

1713
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
going away is easier than

1714
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
because every time you think of that special person,

1715
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
you can feel

1716
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
a little bit of their love.

1717
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
And that love is inside you forever.

1718
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Okay?

1719
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Come on.

1720
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Ow!

1721
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Jordan, watch where you walk.

1722
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Ow!

1723
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Okay, we're here.

1724
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
We're here. Let's go.

1725
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
It's too late, man. It's too late.

1726
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Do you want to bet?

1727
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Come on, you guys. We can do it.

1728
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Come on. Line up.

1729
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Come on, let's go.

1730
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
We can do it. Line up. Here we go.

1731
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
No, it goes over the right shoulder.

1732
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
No, wait. It goes over the right shoulder.

1733
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Get this. Mr. Sherman.

1734
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Maggie, no, no, no.

1735
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Can't do it.

1736
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
You ready?

1737
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Let's go.

1738
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Come on.

1739
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Jordan.

1740
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Come on.

1741
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Come on.

1742
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Come on.

1743
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
They're late.

1744
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Ow!

1745
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Ow!

1746
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Let's get in.

1747
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Damn it, baby.

1748
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Let's go.

1749
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Come on.

1750
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Come on.

1751
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Come on.

1752
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Come on.

1753
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Come on.

1754
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Come on.

1755
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Come on.

1756
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Let's play.

1757
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I pledge allegiance

1758
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
to the flag of

1759
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
the United Nations

1760
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
to the flag

1761
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
of the United States

1762
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
of America

1763
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
and to the Republic

1764
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
for which it stands

1765
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
one nation,

1766
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
one God

1767
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
indivisible

1768
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
with liberty and justice

1769
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
for all.

1770
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Thank you.

1771
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
All right.

1772
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Thank you.

1773
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
It was crazy.

1774
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
We were wonderful.

1775
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
We were happy.

1776
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
You did a great job.

1777
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
We did a great job.

1778
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
We did a great job.

1779
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
We did a great job.

1780
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
We did a great job.

1781
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Goodbye, honey.

1782
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Remember, we're going to write letters

1783
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
and every time we think about each other,

1784
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
we're going to feel

1785
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
a whole lot of love.

1786
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I'll be bad.

1787
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
You'll have to come back.

1788
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
No, I won't, Caitlin.

1789
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And I'm counting on you to be good.

1790
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I'm betting on you, kiddo.

1791
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I'll be good, Mary.

1792
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
I promise.

1793
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Just for you?

1794
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
No, just for you.

1795
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I will.

1796
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Bye.

1797
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Bye.

1798
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Maggie, I tamed you too.

1799
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I did move to Seattle,

1800
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
and as it turned out,

1801
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
mine was the last special education class

1802
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
at Lindbrook Elementary School.

1803
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I wondered if I'd ever hear from Caitlin,

1804
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
because I had decided

1805
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
to let her make that decision on her own.

1806
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Well, a couple of months ago,

1807
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
in the manor,

1808
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I found out that

1809
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I had a special education class

1810
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
at Lindbrook Elementary School.

1811
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I wondered if I'd ever hear from Caitlin,

1812
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
because I had decided

1813
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
a couple of months ago,

1814
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
in the mail came a crumpled,

1815
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
water-stained piece of notebook paper

1816
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
written on with a green felt-tip marker.

1817
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
No letter accompanied it.

1818
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
It was inscribed to Maggie

1819
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
with much love,

1820
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
and it said,

1821
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
You were right to say you'd never leave me,

1822
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
because I could always feel you there

1823
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
to dry my tears when I get lonely.

1824
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I'm happy I carry your smile in my mind,

1825
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
so I can remember just how scary

1826
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
but very kind it was

1827
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
for you to show me to myself.

1828
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And now I need to let you know

1829
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
that every single day I grow,

1830
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
and so does the joy that

1831
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
