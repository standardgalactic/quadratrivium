00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Come here. Stay right there. Stay right there.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
No, no, no.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
No, no, no.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm sorry.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah, the lady...

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
The cage tipped over in here.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Hold her. It's okay. Just hold her.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, there. Okay.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
But the lady inside told me that you're Mr. Bernard.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Bernard, yep. That's me.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
My name is Miguel Prado. I'm supposed to be your assistant.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Oh, great. Great.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Yes, I'm from Social Services.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
I could get my slip right here from the unemployment department.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Unemployment?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yes.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Do you have any training? Any experience?

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Sure I do. You know, they send me out on all kinds of jobs.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
You know, I do everything.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Painting houses, unloading computers, that kind of stuff.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Hold on. I'll be right back.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Carol.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
That young man just introduced himself.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Happy New Year, Margaret. Have a good holiday.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Happy New Year. That young man just introduced himself as my new aide from unemployment.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
What happened to my full-time experience teaching assistant?

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
You're lucky to get anybody. There is no money in the budget.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
I had to take some money out of maintenance just to pay him.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Figures.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Oh, what happened at the school board meeting?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Did they approve my class heading recess with the rest of the school?

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh, no. Margaret, that wasn't discussed. We ran out of time.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Why? You were going to bring it up.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
But there just wasn't time.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
This is not the most pressing issue.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Come on, buddy. It's okay.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
It's okay. Come on. Come on.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Come on, buddy. Come on.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Come on.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Hold on a minute.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
It's all right. Come on.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I'll take care of you.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
There you go.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Carol.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
You promised. You said this was the time. You were going to bring it up.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
Look, we have had a special ed class in this school for, what, five years?

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
And it's always been separate from the rest of the school.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
It works best that way. Why change it?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
The parents are comfortable.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
The parents are comfortable?

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Harold, I have six very challenged kids in my class.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
What about what makes them feel comfortable?

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Margaret, I don't even know if we're going to have a special ed class next year.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I don't know if we can afford it.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Now, things are going very well for your class this year, right?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
So don't rock the boat.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
The Rudds wish me to stress their son has second degree burns on 80% of his body.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
I understand, Mrs. Miyako.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
My question, however, related to Caitlyn and why she's acting out this kind of violence.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
But, Your Honor, what Caitlyn Eldridge did is more than acting out.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
It's psychotic and dangerous.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
This child must be institutionalized.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Ms. Brown, it's up to you to suggest an alternative.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
Social services tried, but that doesn't seem to be one with her history.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Can I say something?

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Don't go ahead, Mrs. Rudd.

03:59.000 --> 04:08.000
When this sick child tied Tommy to a tree and set a match to a...

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
She turned my son into some kind of a freak.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Now, he has to deal with that pain for the rest of his life.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
And so do we.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I want you to put her away, Judge.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
So she can't never hurt another kid like she done mine.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Don't look at me, Judge. I can't control her. No way.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
But you're her father, Mr. Eldridge.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
I don't make no difference.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
She just turned out bad. That's all.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Caitlyn?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Caitlyn?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
This isn't easy, is it?

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Well, maybe you can help me.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
Can you tell me why you did what you did?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Caitlyn?

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
You see? What did I tell you?

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
Good morning, Lisa Anne. Good morning, sweetheart.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
All right, let's try it. Good morning, Maggie.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Good morning, Maggie. Look at my nose. Look at my nose.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Okay, give me some air. Like a big girl. Come on, give me air.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
That's a good try. We'll work on it, all right? Let's go sing.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go sing.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Where do you want me to put this stuff?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Oh, just put it on the plant table and the rest of stuff in the fridge.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
I want to be the fish.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
I want you to be a big boy now, remember? It's Bradley, the big boy.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I want to be the fish.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Jordan, you can come on and boss it down.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Crap. Crap.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
All right, hang it up. Here we go. Everything's fine.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
All right.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Come on, Derek, big boy. Take the thumb out of your mouth. That's it.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Stand up. There you go.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Now we're going to have our morning circle.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Jordan, stop. Okay, sit down. Right here.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
I don't know. Come on, circle. Come on. Right here, next to Shanice.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
There you go. Okay.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Want to chime out?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
No. All right. Stand up there.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Get your body in control.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Okay. Good. Let's say morning song.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
There you go.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Jorge.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Christmas is over.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Christmas is over.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
That's it. I know Christmas is over, but this is so beautiful.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
And we're going to hang it up all year round.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
It's good to see you all.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Take off your jacket.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
And get ready to sing and do the play.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Miguel, help him with his coat.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Because his mother has to drive.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Come on.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay. We're a pretty wild group here after vacation, huh?

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Okay. Everybody sitting ready? Bradley, sitting ready?

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Okay. Make room for our new guest.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
His name. I'm not going to tell you his name.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Do you notice anybody who's new in the group?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Him.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
Him and him has a name and his name is what?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Miguel.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
And he's going to help us, okay?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Bradley, come here.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
See you in just a second.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Sam, could you wait just a minute, please? Thanks.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Bradley, I want you to come sit here.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Come on, Bradley.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Come on. I mean, a child that sets other children on fire.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
You've got to be kidding.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Foster care won't touch it.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
My father's no help.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
What about homebound? Why can't a teacher go to our house?

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Nobody will go. Everybody's scared of this little...

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Well, I'm scared. And I'm scared for my kids.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Sam, don't do this to me.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Where are you going?

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
No words.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Listen, I got to get back.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
My kids have finally calmed down.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
You know, it took four months, but they formed a cohesive group.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
They finally feel safe.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
You bring a child like this into my class and everything's going to explode.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
It's nothing we can do.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
The law says the girl deserves to go to school.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
She has a right to go to school.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
What are you going to do with that?

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Keep it, but they don't give them as a quick mention of the garbage glass.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And so the evil queen asked for a magic mirror.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Here's the magic mirror.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Okay, which one is two?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
One is two.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
This one is two.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
What number is this?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
One.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
What number is this?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Two.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
What number is this?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Three.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
My turn! No!

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
My turn! No!

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Okay, got it.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Which one's two?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
One is two.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Bradley?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Which one?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Bradley, go sit down.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Okay, keep going, keep going.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
No window.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
No window.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Okay, which one's two?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Let's go back.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
One is two.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Oh, and when you're working with Derek, don't rush to give him the answer.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
You know, be patient.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
He'll surprise you sometimes.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Is it like this every day?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
First days after vacation are pretty tough.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Tomorrow should be better.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
See you in the morning.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I don't know if I can be here tomorrow.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
I have to go to an appointment tomorrow, you know, and check in.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
You'll be here.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
You have a knack for this.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Finished.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
What time is it?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
That was our clue.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Oh, man, four hours to do that closing statement.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm not even charging the client.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I get angry they don't make me a partner.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Screwed up priorities, huh?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I like your priorities.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Oh.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
This intake information sheet on the new kid, I get...

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Ah!

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
How is it?

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
It's unbelievable.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You get her tomorrow?

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
I should have had a lawyer in a baseball cap plead my case.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
You would charge her.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
I bet you would.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
God.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
I mean, just read this, attacks other children.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
She destroys properties, smears feces on the wall.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
And then this underlining red, unteachable child.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
No match for you.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
It's not funny.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
It's frightening.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Take a compliment, huh?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
You'll handle her.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
You'll connect.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
I got it out.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
I can't have finished my plan.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
You know, we should have a rule.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
The first one who finishes their homework,

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
the other one has to take some time out.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
And we just hang together.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Oh, so it's my house and you're making the rules?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I live here most of the time.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
This is where I hang my hats.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
I should get some jurisdiction.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Good night, teacher.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Everything I know better you have in that file when you're off.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay, okay, I'll read it.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Yes.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Now, what do you suppose it might feel like

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
if you were new to some place and you didn't know anybody?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
What would that feel like?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Or hey?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Really bad.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I've had enough.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah, what did that feel like right here?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I don't know. She stinks.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Jordan, I don't want her sitting near me.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
She'll spit me out.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
She does stink like pee.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
She needs help.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
You're being very rude. That's dumb.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
What do you think it feels like to tell someone that they stink?

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
It's terrible. It stinks terrible.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
It hurt my feelings.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Thank you, Horey.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
And what might be a better way that we could teach her?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
You can learn her in private.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
That she stinks.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
And she wouldn't have to change her colors.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
That's great. Good talking, too.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
What else? What else do we do?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
We could pluck up our nose.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Ready?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Backward. All of you.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Okay, Derek, that's it.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I don't want you to go any higher, okay?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
All right.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Jordan, Jordan's slow.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Take it easy.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
I'm going to the very top.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Nobody else can come up here.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
She can come up here.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
No!

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Stop! Get out of my playroom!

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Come on!

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Get away from me!

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Don't come up here.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Maybe you may be.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Caitlin, if you'd like to play, you can join us.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
Come on!

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I want to be the only one out here.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Nobody else can come up here.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Get down!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Okay.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Jordan, watch where he's stepping.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
All right. Thank you very much.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
What's up, Derek?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
There you go.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Let's go back there.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Come on.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
I got a cheese.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Wow.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Caitlin was deserted by her mother at the age of four

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
and then left with her father, who was on welfare.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Her father spent time in state prison for theft

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
and she's currently residing with her father in a trader park.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Wow.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Her options closed pretty early, didn't they?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
I don't know.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I don't know.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I didn't give her any work yet.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Well, you know, it's temporary.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
You don't have to teach her.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
Just let her sit.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
And just do nothing?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I think it would be easier on the other kids

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
not to stir this one up.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Carol, I'm sorry.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I'm sorry.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
I'm sorry.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
I'm sorry.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
I'm sorry.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
I'm sorry.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
I'm sorry.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm sorry.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
I'm sorry.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
I'm sorry.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
I'm sorry.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
I'm sorry.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
I'm sorry.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
I'm sorry.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Carol, speaking of being kinder to my kids,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
will you please talk to the school board

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
about recess with the rest of the school?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
When the time is right, I will.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
You think you will?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Yeah.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I found him hard enough.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I think you're pretty good at pounding.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Yeah, I am, aren't I?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Come on.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
You have a cuddle.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
You didn't say hello to Melissa.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Hello.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Here, everybody.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Discussion time.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Help him out with this mockery.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Thanks, Miguel.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Go ahead.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Go ahead.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Good luck, discussion.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Good luck, discussion.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Bradley, my push book.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Caitlin.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Caitlin.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
We need to have a talk.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Now, listen.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
We went over the rules in class, right?

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
And one of the rules is you have to try to talk.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
Now, I know it's really hard, but I need you to try.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
Shanice didn't talk when she first came here.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Nathan did, Derek.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
Okay?

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
And the next rule is that I want you to participate in discussion.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Or we all get together as a group.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
And we talk about our feelings.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
All right?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Come on, let's go.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Come on, sweetheart.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Come here.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Push her down the toilet.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
She's crap.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Crap.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
No.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
No.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
No.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Push her down the toilet.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
She's crap.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Come on.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Come on.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
No.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
No.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
No.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
No.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
No.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
No.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
No.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
No.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
No.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
No.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
No.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
No.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
No.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
No.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
No.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
No.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
No.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
No.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
No.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
No.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
No.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
No.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Are you ready?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
When you're ready.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
You can come and join us.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Well, it was the first blind date I've been on since high school.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Ooh.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
So what was he like?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Well, he wasn't exactly handsome.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
It wasn't exactly handsome, I'd call it more like distinguished.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Oh, so it was a dog.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
No, he wasn't a dog. He was not a dog.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
What are you doing? He was...

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
He was a dog.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
He was a dog.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
He was barking, baby. Let me tell you, he was barking.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Miss Bernard, some girl's throwing stuff all over the classroom.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
Come on, give me the pencil. Give it to me.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Kaelin, give me the pencil. Give me the pencil.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Give me the pencil. Kaelin, give it to me. Give it.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Kaelin, give me the pencil. Give me the pencil.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Kaelin, give me the pencil. Kaelin, give me the pencil.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Kaelin, give me the pencil.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Stop. Stop.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Grab your shoe.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Stop.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Stop.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Help me.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Help me, baby.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Help me.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Help me.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
What is happening this evening?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Help me.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I'm going to die.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I'm going to die.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm going to die.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
With a child like Kaelin Eldridge,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
there is always going to be potential danger.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Look.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
The bottom line is

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
everybody is concerned

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
what are we going to do about this?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Serve better coffee than seven in the morning starters.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
We're better.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
What about social services,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
putting more pressure on the hospital

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
and officially force them

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
to make an opening for her and take her in?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I mean, like next week.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
We can try. I don't know that it will do any good,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
but we can try.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
And until then,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I was wondering, I mean,

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
are we all going to celebrate when we send this little girl

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
to the mental hospital,

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
knowing that she probably will never get out again?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
No, I'm confused.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Are you going to class indefinitely

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
after the goldfish catastrophe yesterday?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I mean...

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
No.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
No, I don't.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Okay, so we're all agreed.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Let's get her in the hospital as soon as possible, right?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Meantime, Maggie,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
you should have lunch with your class every day

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
as long as she's with us, all right?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Great.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Guess what?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I'm supposed to tell you

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
that Caitlin's early this morning

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
and from now on.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
What are you talking about?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Well, the only bus that connects with her home,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I guess it's very far, is the high school bus.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
So she'll be arriving here half an hour early every day.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
You're kidding me.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
And then the afternoon, the bus will leave

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
from the high school one hour after your class.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
What are you talking about?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
She has to wait here.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Here, here.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Look, I was in the office getting my mail.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Carmen says it's only temporary.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
She's probably going into the hospital a lot.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Have a good day.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
The Marvel's realm is a death ray.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
It's not a death ray and she's not going to hurt you.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I want you to go back and do your letters, all right?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
You're a good mailman and you're doing a great job.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Okay.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I bet you, uh,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
don't know how many Marvel's you've got.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Okay.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
How many Marvel's?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Do you have one?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Get up.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
It's time to do some math. Come on.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
We're going to do math.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
No.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
No.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Right here.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Get some blocks.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Okay.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
All right.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I want you to take your hand.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Okay. And I want you to count three.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Count three.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
All right. I'm going to help you.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
One.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Two.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Bradley, come back.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Come back here and finish your work.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
That is not acceptable.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Now, we're going to do it again.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I'll help you.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Ready?

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
One.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Two.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
It's unacceptable.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Right now.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Miguel, don't have to resist.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Now?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Everybody, it's recess.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
We don't have the other kids like we talked about.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
But it's not your time.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
What the hell with their time?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
You take them out now.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
No.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Yes.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
No.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
No.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
We're doing math.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Yes.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Yes.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
No.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
It's time for you to learn.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
We're going to learn.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
No.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
No.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
No.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Yes.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
You know, most of the time, Katelyn still stinks.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Like a toilet.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
She'd be on that side from rabbit.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Come on, Jordan. Don't make fun, okay?

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
If we had a pancake, Katelyn should be on the side with the pancake.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Do you like my picture?

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Yeah. Yeah. And I could treat.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
You remember what Maggie said about being nice?

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
About being kind, huh? Hey, hey, you remember?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
No.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Come on, go back and do your work.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Come on, finish what you're doing.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
All right, Stacy.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Stop laughing now.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Come on, let's go back to work.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Get ready. I want you to find number four.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Good job.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
You're number five.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
All right, great.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Ready?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
We have to go pee.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
You can go to the bathroom.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
And then we'll do some math, right?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Right?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Okay.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
All right.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Count out three.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Good.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Show me ten.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Okay.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
How about two plus two?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
All right, I'm going to get you on this one.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Fifteen, take away nine.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Pretty smart, aren't you?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Let's try some more.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I mean, do you know how phenomenal that is?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Yeah, I think I do.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Because the hardest part of this job

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
is that you can't ever really change these kids.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I mean, no matter what.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Because their brain is actually impaired in some way.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Well, that doesn't stop you.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I mean, Lisa Ann and Derek, they're autistic.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
I can't exactly set a goal for them.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
So it's basically a day-to-day kind of trying

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
to hold them together.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
But then with Caitlyn, you know,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
she opened up like that.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
It was a dream.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
I mean, what's the matter?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I mean, I don't know if she can read yet.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
And I don't know if she's ever going to open up again,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
but I reached her.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Okay. This is it.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
What do you think?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
It's okay. Do you know what I'm saying to you?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Okay, I thought it was perfect for over the kitchen table.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
You're not listening to me. Do you know what I'm trying to tell you?

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
Yes, I hear what you're trying to tell me.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
So enough of your kids, okay? We're going to interior decorate.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
But that's the point. She's not like the other kids.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
She's different.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Maggie, look.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Can we just focus on that for one minute?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
It's nice.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
It's a light.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I'm sorry. I thought it was a porridge.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Do you feel hurt? Guy can tell you fast, please.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
What I feel behind on, I've been trying to corner this guy for two days.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Can I just steal him for a minute?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Yeah. Thanks.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
We need to figure this out before lunch.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I don't know. I'll try.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Carol, have you heard about Caitlin?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
What about her?

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
An opening in the hospital. I mean, they haven't gotten her in yet.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I can't believe they're taking so long.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I'll call again today, okay?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
No. Listen, something phenomenal has happened.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
She is reading at a third grade level.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
She's doing second grade math.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And then I had Donald test her IQ yesterday.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
We are talking 168.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Huh. Read.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Yeah, ask him. He'll tell you 168.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
That's genius.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I mean, to put a little girl like that in a mental hospital,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
it's just, it's a tragedy.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
She's going to revert back to her behavior,

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
and of course, I'll have to punish her.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Can we appeal the decision?

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Can who appeal?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
The school board.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Based on her ability.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
And her behavior now.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
No outbursts, no fighting, nothing destructive.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I mean, she's almost like a new child.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Oh, but that's true.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
You really deserve your reputation, don't you?

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Crazy kids, crazy teacher.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Yeah.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Oh, one other thing.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
The recesses are going great,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
and can we have assembly with the rest of the classes?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Maybe.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
One thing at a time, okay?

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Okay.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
But you will try to find out about appealing the court decision.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
You want to know what troubles me most

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
about that little girl's future?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
According to her file,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
she never cries,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
and a child that never cries,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
that's inhuman.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
You've never seen that before, haven't you?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I've seen a lot of things in my class

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
that I've never seen before.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Very human.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
You know what?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
Melissa's going to a party tonight.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
She is? Yeah, you going to go with her?

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
No.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
She's going to go by herself?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Yeah, I'm just going to take her.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
But you're going to drop her off?

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Oh, you figure it out.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Oh, good. Well, you run off,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
and I'll see you tomorrow, sweetie. Bye-bye.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Bye-bye.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Caitlin.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Where's we?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
I've got a great idea.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Come on.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Okay.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
I thought we could

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
comb your hair out so it looks just like mine.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Now, hmm.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
How come you're being nice to me?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
Because I like you.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Okay?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Now I'm going to put the other bread in.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
I just

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
like

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
that.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Maybe tomorrow

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
we'll give it a wash, okay?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
You ready?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
You look

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
beautiful, Caitlin.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
My pa,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
he'll take him away

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
and say I stole him.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Nobody ever gave

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
me nothing.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I'll tell you what.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Why don't you wear them when you're in school?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
And then I'll keep them

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
very safe for you at night.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Okay?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
Okay.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
It's too big to carry around.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
For

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
almost a year together.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
My appreciation.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Open it.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
They're beautiful.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
I've never had real pearls before.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
They are real, aren't they?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
There.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
I don't know what to say.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I love you, Maggie.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Let's get married, okay?

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I...

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Well?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Well, why are you changing the rules?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I mean, we've had such a great year.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I want the next one to be even better.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
We bought a lamp together.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
Two of my bosses came

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
into my office this afternoon.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
That partnership's going to happen.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
You're kidding.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Wonderful.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Congratulations. Thank you.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Why didn't you tell me? I am telling you.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
I've screwed up so many relationships in my time.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Now that I finally got it right,

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
I thought, you know...

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Thank you.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
At the end of the summer,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
they owe me three weeks and you've got your summer application.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Damn.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I've applied to go back and get my doctorate.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
You know that.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I mean, you said you weren't sure.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Well, I might need that degree if I go back

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
to college someday.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I just have to

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
feel that it's right.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I need

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
to feel a buzz, you know?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Yeah, I've seen it go off

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
about that kid in your class.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
And, uh...

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
you and me?

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
There isn't a buzz.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I'm just saying that

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
I need to get a grip on my own life

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
before I take on somebody else's, that's all.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
You're shutting down, Meg.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I asked you to marry me.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
No.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
You asked me to change my whole life.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It really scares you, doesn't it?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
The idea of trusting someone that much.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
I don't want to change you, Meg.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I just want to be with you.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
I want to be with you.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
They're beautiful.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Morning, Caitlin.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Good morning.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
Would you put the clips in my hair now?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
You bet.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
I think this morning I'm going to give you

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
the full beauty treatment, head to toe.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
A bath.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
I found some nice things for you

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
in our clothes box.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
My paw won't let me keep them.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
We always see about that.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Anyway,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
you know, I

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
noticed some scars on your back

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
and on your ankle.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
What happened?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I fell.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Caitlin, did your paw ever

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
leave any marks on you?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
You know, like maybe spank you real hard

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
or something?

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
It was my mom.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
But my paw, he loves me

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
and never ever run away or dump me.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Why did your mom do that?

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
What happened?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Well, I'm trying, man,

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
but it is tough, I'll tell you.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I told you things have changed

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
since we were stationed down here.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Yeah, well, I sure as hell ain't right.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
And this thing all the way back to Portland, I'll tell you that.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Listen, I'll hook something up.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Don't worry.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
We'll talk soon.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Traylor's getting a little small for three people.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
I heard that.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Um, Ms. Joldridge?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Oh, hi. I'm Keaton's teacher.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Hey, give me a minute.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Listen, I'm out of here, all right?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
What's she done now, lady?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
She hasn't done anything.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Really, she's a great kid.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
So,

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
are you going to take her away?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Could we step inside?

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
And there's some clothes at school

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
that we could give, Caitlin.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
I also wanted to tell you

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
what a great read of your little girl is.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Oh, yeah?

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
So, what's she done bad?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
She hasn't done anything bad.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I came to tell you

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
that she's really very smart

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
and I wanted her to have the clothes.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
You see him? That's Jimmy.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
That's Caitlin's brother.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
He was my boy

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
until that bitch took him away.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
He left me with that little bastard

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
and I can't do anything with her.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
What about a foster home?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I mean, that's a solution.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Well, what kind of a bastard

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
would I be if I gave her up?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
You want me to give her up?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
No, you're full of crap.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
There's no need to talk that way.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Miguel, it's all right. It's all right, Mr. Eldridge.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Mr. Eldridge, listen, listen.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
You said...

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
You said you couldn't control her.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I was just trying to make a suggestion.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
No, no, no, no, no.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
Thank you so much.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I think you have to leave now.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
We don't want your clothes.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Thank you.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
We don't need your charity.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Come on.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Thank you.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
You should go back to lifting refrigerators, huh?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
It's discouraging, isn't it?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
But you're going to have to deal

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
with all kinds of things when you work with these kids.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I don't know if I want to.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Family used to live in a place like this.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Now, that's why I don't like touching the rat.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Seven brothers and sisters.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Me in the middle, all in three rooms.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
I understand.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
It's sad, too, because you're great with children.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
My girlfriend.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
She wants me to go back to school to be a teacher.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
Smart girlfriend.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
You can't do this for me.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Two days, just take two days off.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Next Thursday and Friday.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Yes.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Too soon. I can't leave Caitlyn for two days.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Suddenly like that. She's right on the edge.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
I've been working on a defense for this case for two months

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
because Wally wants to nail that account.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
When Wally, the most senior partner,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
asks the most junior partner to join him

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
for a long weekend at the beach house with a client,

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
the most junior partner goes.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
So why do I have to go?

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Because Wally specifically asked me to bring it to couples' thing.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
I just can't.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
I'm the only safe fridge she has.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Give me a break.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
I mean it.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
You see the way she lives.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
I feel for the kid, but you're going overboard on this.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
We're talking two days here.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
It is tough for a kid to trust

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
after she has been so badly abused.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
And I thought the time away would be good for us.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
For a lot of reasons.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
You're right.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
It's just bad timing, that's all.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Well, everything is these days.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Does it have to be next weekend?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Yes, it has to be next.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
Why do you always have to try to control everything?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
I am not trying to control everything.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
What are you talking about?

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Everything. That girl's life, my life, this relationship.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I am not trying to control you.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
You are trying to control me.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Control for you means not having to let go of anything, Maggie,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
including your feelings.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Down?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Let's go.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
For three days.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
I'll take Friday off.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
We can drive to Santa Barbara on Thursday night.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I want to.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Really.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
I'll, um...

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I'll try to leave the kids in the classroom.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Okay, everybody.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
It's a stop.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Fun now.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
I got the platform.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Can we go again in a little while?

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Let's wait here.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Is Kate okay?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
I don't know.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Did you see that look on her face when I told her

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I was going to be in Santa Barbara?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Maybe I shouldn't take Friday off.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
No, it should be all right.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
I'm really going to put her in that hospital tonight.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
She's just so raw right now.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
She'll be okay though, you know?

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
She's not acting out.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
Acting out? You're learning fast.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
She didn't run.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
She didn't make a major explosion, but she's ticking down now, you know?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
What, sweetheart?

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Can you look through your guts?

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Come on.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Show me where, sweetheart.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Where?

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Here you go.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Here you go.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Come here.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Come here. I know.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
I know, sweetheart.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
He's okay.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Feeling a little better, huh?

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Caitlin, answer me.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
Oh, sweetie.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
I wish I could make you understand,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
but I can leave for a day and you'll be all right.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Katie, I'm your teacher, you know,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
and we won't always be together.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Listen to me. Listen.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
This one day that I'll be away,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
you can get along without me.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
And it's so important that you understand that.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
When are you gonna be back?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Monday morning.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Before you know it.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Trust me.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I'll be right back.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Did you fix something with my hair, right?

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I think that's a great idea.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
I like the way your lady plays the game.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Serious. You too?

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
You know, I had that backhand volley,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
and I missed it.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
I'll tell you, Wally, she never thinks she's good enough.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
So, Maggie, we're having a charity tournament next month,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
and you are such a great player. We'd love to have you.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
You know, a lot of the wives are gonna be there.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Well, thanks. I appreciate it.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
Great.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Give me a break.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
She needs Lisa and wants to order.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Would you like some stew?

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Okay.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
So would you like anything?

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
One stew.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Okay.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Two stews coming right up.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Yes. That's a good boy, Derek.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
You hung up your coat by yourself.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Didn't you?

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
You be our customer.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
You're ready for this guy.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I wanna be the cook.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
I wanna be the cook. I want to.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
You have to be the waitress.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I am the cook.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Fine. You can be it for a minute,

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
and then I'll be the cook.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Brad, you didn't tell her.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
She was such a good storyteller.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
You know, I thought you were gonna tell us the...

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Excuse me.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
You know, Doris, I thought you were gonna tell us the one

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
about the three guys and the rat.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
You know, the man of the cloth,

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
the doctor and the lawyer, okay?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Why are you doing this?

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
I'm trying to reach McGill.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Something's gotta be wrong.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Maggie, you've left the table three times

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
in the last 15 minutes. It's making people uncomfortable.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Dan, I'm worried.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Look, I'll tell them about Caitlin,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
and then they don't have to feel uncomfortable.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
I don't think they're interested. They're trying to enjoy their dinner

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
and not talk about their work.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
I'm sorry if sometimes my job

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
and my life are a little...

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
a little.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Just come back to the table, okay?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
I will. I'll be right there.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
I promise.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Dan, would you come in

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
or close the door?

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
No.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
It's freezing out there.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
No more than that is in here.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
You aren't gonna let it go, are you?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Not it, Maggie.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
You.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
You.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I don't want to let you go.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Dan, I made a mistake.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I never should have

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
said I was gonna come.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
I just don't fit in

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
as one of the wives.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I don't want you to be

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
one of the wives.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
No.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Why do you have to do this?

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
What?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Push me off.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
I don't know.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Something

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
happens to me when somebody

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
gets too close.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Well, I'm sorry.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
It makes you a tough woman

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
to love.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Slumming it?

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
She's going in.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
The school board didn't think it was warranted

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
to appeal.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Not warranted.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
What about a lawsuit?

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
There has to be something that we can do.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
No. They expect an opening soon

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
before Easter, they think.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
But you should feel proud, you know?

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
You've brought her so far.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Obviously, not far enough.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Why? Why should I continue teaching?

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
So I can watch another child

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
be destroyed by the system.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Every child can't be saved, Maggie.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
You're a teacher.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
That's the equation.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
What else would you do?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Teach a muffin.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
You know, you're never gonna change

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
the system the way you want.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
You want it all perfect.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Well, that's your terrific teaching

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
and the energy.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
That's what you do.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
That's your terrific teaching and the energy.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
And sometimes you'll even make a difference.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
A little difference.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Let's get real.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
There ain't no Camelot.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
That's not a reality that I can live with.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Okay, okay.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Solve your own problems.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I can't. Please.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Call him off.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
I'll slow it down.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
You want some muffin?

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
No, go ahead.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Oh, Sam, one other thing.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
You know, my class doesn't get to go to assembly

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
but the rest of the school.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
I mean, if they did, it would be great.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
You never stopped, do you?

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
First recess, now assembly.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
They've already learned the Pledge of Allegiance, Sam.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Give me your mom's leave.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Deal.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Yes, sweetie?

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Can you tell me a story?

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I'm really busy right now.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Maybe later when you're waiting for the bus, okay?

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
My favorite story was about a little girl

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
who lived in a forest far, far away.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
It was a beautiful forest.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
But the little girl was very lonely

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
because she had nobody to play with.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
And then one day,

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
she saw a big lion

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
standing on a rock staring down at her.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Well,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
she was so lonely

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
that she decided to ask for help.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
And then one day,

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
she saw a big lion

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
standing on a rock staring down at her.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
She was so lonely

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
that she decided to ask the lion

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
if he would play with her.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
But the lion said he couldn't

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
because he hadn't been tamed.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
What's that, tamed?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Well, that is the exact same question

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
that the little girl asked the lion.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
And the lion told her

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
that being tamed was about becoming friends.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
And he said

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
that he'd been born wild

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
and fierce.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
And that

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
he wanted to.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
She could become his friend

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
if she would give him all of her love

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
and trust.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
You see, the idea was that

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
once the lion felt what it was like

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
to be needed

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
and to trust,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
then he would have to love the little girl back.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
And then the lion

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
would be tamed.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Well,

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
it had been so long since the little girl

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
had had anybody to play with

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
that she agreed

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
to do what the lion asked.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
And you know what?

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Very soon

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
they had learned

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
together to love

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
and to need

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
and to trust.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
And then they were

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
in each other's hearts forever.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
And then they both were tamed.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
And then

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
they were

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
in each other's hearts forever.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
And then

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
they both were tamed.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
And then

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
they both were tamed.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
And then

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
they both were tamed.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
And then

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
they both were tamed.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
And then

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
they both were tamed.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
And then

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
they both were tamed.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Hi, Dan here.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Now it's your turn.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Okay.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Rain stop.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Tomorrow I go back to school.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Yeah.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
What a lousy day

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
for you dad to pick up a job, huh?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Wanna play checkers?

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
No.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
You like your dolly, don't you?

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Can I have it for me?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
You know we could

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
we could play house.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
You could be my dolly.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
This one's better.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
This one's better.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
This one's better.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
This one's better.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Which one?

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
That one.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
This one's too hard.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
No.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
This one's better.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Yeah, that's good.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Okay, I'll try.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
This one's better.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Okay, sweetie.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Okay.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Now let's do some math, alright?

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
I can't.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Come here, I'll help you.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Come on.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
You guys finish up over there.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Okay.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Now let's see, where were we?

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Okay, we've got two more to do, okay?

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
So now number nine.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
If it's not 12 minus seven

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
then what number is it?

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Sweetheart, what number is it?

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
If it's not...

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Oh, hey look.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Oh my God.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Oh, come here, come here.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Sweetheart, just lay back, just lay back.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Come here.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Alright.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Okay, I'll just stand and be alright.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I'll just stand and be alright.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I'm right here.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I think it's gonna be okay.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Okay, here we go.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Alright, what's that up in the yard?

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Alright, let's go.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Alright, make sure they don't weigh that much in, alright?

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Alright everybody, let's get ready

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
to go out for recess.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I don't want to go out until Caitlyn comes back.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I understand, sweetie.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Come on.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
My grandpa was to the hospital

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
and he died there.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Caitlyn's gonna die.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Come here, sweetie.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
She's gonna be fine, really.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
She's gonna be much better.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Hey, the operation is to stop the bleeding.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
And she's getting stronger and stronger every day.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Okay, she's gonna live a long, long time.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
My mom said her dad's friend who did that

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
should be killed dead.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Bradley, come here, come here.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Come here.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Alright, everybody.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I know it's a real scary thing.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
What happened to Caitlyn?

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Alright, I'll tell you what.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Before we go out for recess, let's have a talk.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Alright?

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
And bring your pictures for Caitlyn.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Come on, kids, let's go.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Doctor, that is the CCU.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Doctor, that is the CCU. Please.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Take it all.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Don't cry, Maggie.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
It doesn't hurt too much anymore.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
It makes me feel a little bit better

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
to cry sometimes, kitty.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Here you go.

56:31.000 --> 56:35.000
Do you want to hold my marble like you did yesterday?

56:35.000 --> 56:39.000
No, I think I just want to hold your hand tonight.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Last night, when I woke up,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
it was sort of scary.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I wanted my paw,

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
but I didn't cry none.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Miguel went to get him, sweetheart.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
It's for you, from everybody.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Just for me?

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Hello, Maggie.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Oh, great, Miguel.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Hello, Caitlyn. How are you?

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Good.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Papa.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Mr. Elvish, why don't you go talk to her?

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
She asked for you.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Well, I can't help her in home.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
She wants me to see her like that.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
I got this, uh...

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
today.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
I can't believe that this rock...

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Hey.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Hey.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Thanks for meeting me.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
No problem.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Just had to cancel three and a half major clients, that's all.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
How's Caitlyn?

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
She's fine. She's up, walking,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
mending fast.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Good.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Dan, I called you because I have to know.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I'm sorry.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
I'm sorry.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
I'm sorry.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Dan, I called you because I have to know.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
If I can petition the court.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
I mean, can I appeal her case?

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Wait a minute. You mean just you?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
I know I'm not her guardian or anything official,

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
but can I appeal?

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
You want to go over the heads of, what, the school board,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
the social services department?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
I don't want to. I have to.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Everybody has turned me down.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
And believe me, I've made as much noise as I possibly can.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I bet you have.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Maggie the Madwoman.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Come on, there's a decent new place around the corner.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
You lose your job, you know that?

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I'm giving up teaching at the end of the year anyway.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
I decided to get my doctorate.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
You're kidding.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
No, I'm serious.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Anyway, Caitlyn's the issue now.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Saving Caitlyn.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
Yeah, she always had a little more buzz than anyone around for me.

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
I'll tell you the truth, Maggie.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
I was a little jealous.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
I was disappointed you called about her instead of us.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I found us.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Why? You're the one who snuck off with his hat

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
and left a note on the rock.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Dan, a note?

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Not only corny, but a little chicken, wasn't it?

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
I had my reasons.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I don't want to talk about this.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Okay, well, my opinion is you can't appeal the case.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
It's risky. Nobody's going to like it.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
But you say you don't care.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Will you take it on?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Oh, boy, you've got guts.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Maggie the Madwoman.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
And a friend.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
A good friend who needs you very much.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
I hope you're buying the drinks.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I'm not going to make any money off this one.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
It's tough on a child because

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
basically they have no choice.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Yeah, I worry for Caitlyn.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
You know, it's so hard

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
to stop feeling for them.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Well, maybe that's what makes a good teacher.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Or a bad one.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
You think maybe

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
maybe I make a good teacher?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I think you ought to look in the mirror

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
and ask yourself that question.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
There he is.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Okay, I'll go to the payphone and call Dan.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I let that bastard stay here

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
for two months and look what he does.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I beat the crap out of them though

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
before they took him off to jail.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
No, thanks.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Well, I appreciate you bringing me

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
the groceries very much.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Mr. Eldage, we need you to do something

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
for your little girl.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It's important for her, you know.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
You're appealing to the court,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
not to send Caitlyn to the state hospital.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And we want you to come to court next Thursday

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
and just answer a few questions.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Go to court?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
This is the date of the court appearance,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
the time, and the place.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It's for your daughter, you understand?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I ain't sure I got a daughter.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Now you're full of it. You've got a daughter

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
and from what I understand she's a great little kid.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Now you'll be there

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
for her.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Here.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
You take this.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
What's that for?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Take it.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Oh.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Take your money, Mr.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
and you get the hell out of here.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Mr. Eldage.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
This is my house!

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
That guy's crazy.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Damn.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Can we win without him?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Hey!

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Hey!

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Okay.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
One, two, three, four.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Here, here.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
You buy Caitlyn her dress.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Green.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I think she likes green.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Did you remember the tapes?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
They're right here in my briefcase.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
It's all just...

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
The parents of the boy she burned.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I didn't know they were going to be here.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I figured they would be. They want to see Caitlyn put away forever.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Where's Pa?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Told him Peter, half hour ago.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Come here sweetheart, sit down.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I don't think your Pa's going to be able to make it.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
You should have thrown him in the car and dragged him down here

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
whether he likes courtrooms or not.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
What I brought you?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I want you to draw me a beautiful picture.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Is everything okay?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Do you have any questions? You see that guard right there?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
He'll call me.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I want to go and tell him right now.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
It's okay.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
He wasn't in there either.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Excuse me. Do you see that little girl right there?

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
You'll be safe here honey.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Maggie and I will be right there.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Appreciate it.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Okay?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Right.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
No problem.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Thank you.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Here you go sweetie.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Did I do good enough?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
You did great kiddo.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I think the judge was very impressed.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Dan is in the judge's chambers right now

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
discussing everything that went on in the courtroom.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And then the judge will make his decision.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Is he going to send me away for a long time?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I hope not kiddo.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Okay.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Based on the testimony one could deduce

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
that she shows some and I underline

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
some signs of improvement.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
But what does that really mean?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
That she fits in a class full of misfits?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Oh come on. Look that is just

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
cheap name calling. This is a child

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
who had never experienced even the smallest

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
expression of love.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And then she was put into a healthy,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
nurturing environment and incredible things happened.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
You saw the videotape her teacher made.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
This Caitlyn

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
is a different child.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I can't think of anything more to get real time for this.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
This is Ryan.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
What is it?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Could you excuse us just for a minute?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I want you to know that I didn't appeal

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
to the court on behalf of Caitlyn.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Because I excuse what she did to your son.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
It was awful and cruel.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Then why not put her away?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Because I know

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
that the pain she inflicted came from such

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
tremendous hurt and fear

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
that she was having to hold inside.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
And now that she's learning to release

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
those feelings responsibly, there's no

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
need to act them out. She doesn't have

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
to keep trying to prove that she is a

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
bad girl.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
You want me to feel sorry for her?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Well, I don't.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Neither do I.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Feeling sorry for kids like Caitlyn.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
That doesn't help them survive.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
That's exactly what I try to teach each of

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
my kids how to survive

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
in a world that

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
hands them almost nothing besides pain

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
and rejection.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I can't do anything about the past.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I wish I could, but I can't.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Nobody is going to gain

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
from trying to destroy that little girl's future.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
But how can you be sure?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
How can you guarantee that she's not going to

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
torture some innocent kid as soon as

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
she gets away from that teacher?

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Exactly.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Look,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I can't

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
guarantee anything,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
your honor.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
But what's the choice here

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
to shut a child with Caitlyn's

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
potential away from society

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
forever?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
She is six and a half

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
years old.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
What's taking so long?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Waiting so hard, isn't it, kiddo?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Maggie?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I want you to tame me

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
like the little girl did the lion.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
No hospitals.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Just therapy.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Yes, yes.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Bottom line, the judge thought

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
that under the circumstances,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Caitlyn made major progress.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Enough to live at home and attend

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
regular classes next year.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
That's wonderful.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Sweetheart, that's wonderful.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
You're wonderful.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Hey, kiddo.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
It's Caitlyn's time.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Let's celebrate.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Come on, pizza.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And hot dogs.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
French fries.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And hot fudge sundaes for dessert.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Mr. Eldridge, we won.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Listen, we're going to go celebrate.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Would you join us?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
No, I can't.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I mean, it's your party anyway.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
You did it.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Well, you, uh...

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
You ought to know that your being here

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
was very important to the judge.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Thanks for the dress, Pa.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Meat color.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I can keep it, right?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Because you gave it to me.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
You look real nice.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Go have some fun.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Huh?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Behave yourself.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Come on, kiddo. Let's go.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Yeah!

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
All right!

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Me, too.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Come on, kiddo. Pizza.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
You know, there are a lot of places

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
you can teach in Seattle.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
You don't care that I changed my mind.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Well...

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
What else is new?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
When I saw Caitlyn tonight,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I knew...

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I knew you to understand something.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I was able to give that little word

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
to the judge.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I was able to understand something.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I was able to give that little girl

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
a love that nobody else

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
had ever been able to give her before.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
A love that...

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
I didn't even realize

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
that I had with him to give.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And she was so vulnerable

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and so scared.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
And she risked it all

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
by loving me back.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And I was the only person there

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
who could celebrate

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
our existence.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
That's why I'm gonna

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
go back and teach again.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
It's what I do.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
You really get me.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
So when do you move?

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Next month.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
You know, the reason I wrote you that

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
chicken letter

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I left on a half rack

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
was because I knew I had to leave.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I knew if I

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
looked into your eyes, I wouldn't be able to.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And you think it'll be

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
a breeze for me to leave?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Me or Kate?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And sometimes

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
you are such a butt head.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
You didn't answer my question, Maggie.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I need to know.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Then I'm drawing really hard

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
this time

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
not to shut down.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Well...

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
I still have a little more than three weeks.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Good morning, Margaret.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Hello, Harold.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Margaret, what would you say

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
if Caitlin and

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
two of your more advanced kids

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
went to the color guard

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
at the last assembly of the year?

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I'd say terrific, Harold.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
But why just Caitlin and two of the others?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I think you'd be even more proud

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
of your special ed class

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
if they all were the color guard.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Well, I think that's risking a bit too much.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Come on, Harold. Don't let your good instincts

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
fail you now.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I ain't gonna go.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
This is my class.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Margaret, the school year

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
will be over in a few weeks.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
And everybody's agreed, Mr. Sherman,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
the school board, everybody,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
that you're ready to go into a regular class

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
next year.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I wanna stay in this crazy class with you.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Kittle.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Come on, Lisa. Let's go paint.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Listen,

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
you know, next year

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I probably won't be here.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I've been good. You said so.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
My pa said so.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
He bring home a pizza.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Sometimes

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
new ideas take a little time, don't they?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Come on.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Let's get ready and practice

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
for assembly, okay?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Come on.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Good, good, and...

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
What's in here?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
No, and to the public.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Don't we paint this? We're always smoothing

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
into this bunch.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Good, good.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Other than

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
invisible

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
for liberty and justice for all.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Yeah, good job, Derek. Good job.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
You go help those guys clean up, okay?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Come on.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I'm so sad to leave them.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
I know. The end of the year always hurts.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Okay.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
For you, I have

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
a little thank you.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
California University

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
is pleased to admit Miguel Prado

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
for the fall semester.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Come here, you.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Congratulations.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Where did you... Oh, he's...

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
It's wonderful. It's wonderful.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I looked in the mirror and I said,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
this guy could be a good teacher.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
You know, I think that man was right.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Derek.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Derek.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Come here.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Come on. It's always going to get hurt.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Okay, everybody, assembly in five minutes.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
You have to go to the bathroom now's the time.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
You're going to break your class next year.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
You and me. No more geeks.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
He's a mean incredible broadcaster

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
and I'm so happy with him.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
And he hangs his coat every time.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
He knows the pledge. What do you see him in when he's in?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
When he's just too fresh?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Maggie, Maggie, excuse me.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Um, Caitlin slipped out of the auditorium.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I don't know where... Okay.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Go back with the others. I'll find her.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Okay. This is Foster. I'm sorry, but...

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
I'll talk to you if this isn't okay.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Oh, okay. That's all right.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Sorry.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Okay, now.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
What's wrong?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Caitlin.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
She's not here.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Okay, I'll be right back.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Okay.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I was worried about you, sweetie.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Come on, the assembly's starting.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Let's go.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Gordie and Derek, they're waiting for you to leave them, you know?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Let's go, sweetie. Come on.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
No.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I don't want you to ruin the day for everybody.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Don't kick me out.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I'm not going to kick me out.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I'm not taking you out, honey.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
You don't need this class anymore.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
What do you mean, you don't need them, sweetie?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I'm not taking you out, honey.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
You don't need this class anymore.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
What do you mean, you don't need them, still crazy?

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
You are not crazy.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Now stop thinking that.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Fine, then I'll be the craziest girl in the whole world.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Then I'll make you kick me here.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Caitlin, listen to me. Listen to me carefully.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I am going away next year.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I am not going to be here.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Sweetheart, you have grown so much,

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
and so have I.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And now it's time to see how good that growing up was.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
You're ready to try it on your own.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
You're strong.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Oh, sweetheart.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
No, he's going to pull me again.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Okay, that's all right. Where is she?

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Look, Maggie's not here yet, okay?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
But if these kids are not ready in five minutes,

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I'm going to have to send some band members out.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I'm doing the best I can.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I'm sorry.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I don't know where they are.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Where's my hair?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
You want to know what my mama did when she left me?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
You want to know?

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Of course I do, sweetheart, but everybody's waiting.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Just listen.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
We were in the car.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
See?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Jimmy wanted it.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
No way. My mama gave it to me.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
It's the best that each ever did give me.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Sweetheart, we're ready.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I was screaming in the back.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I was back there trying to make a nice...

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Mama said,

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Caitlin, come up here.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
She gave me a kiss on the cheek

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
and opened the door

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and pushed me onto the highway.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
See?

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I know, sweetheart.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
See? You're just like my mama leaving.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
How come you're not going to stay or make me good?

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I am not leaving you.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Remember the story that I told you about

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
the little girl who lived in the forest

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
and how she tamed the lion

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
by showing him that she loved him?

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Well, that's how it is with us.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
We'll always love each other.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
And just like that little girl found out,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
going away is easier than

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
because every time you think of that special person,

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
you can feel

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
a little bit of their love.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And that love is inside you forever.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Okay?

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Come on.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Ow!

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Jordan, watch where you walk.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Ow!

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Okay, we're here.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
We're here. Let's go.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
It's too late, man. It's too late.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Do you want to bet?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Come on, you guys. We can do it.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Come on. Line up.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Come on, let's go.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
We can do it. Line up. Here we go.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
No, it goes over the right shoulder.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
No, wait. It goes over the right shoulder.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Get this. Mr. Sherman.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Maggie, no, no, no.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Can't do it.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
You ready?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Let's go.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Come on.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Jordan.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Come on.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Come on.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Come on.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
They're late.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Ow!

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Ow!

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Let's get in.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Damn it, baby.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Let's go.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Come on.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Come on.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Come on.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Come on.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Come on.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Come on.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Come on.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Let's play.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I pledge allegiance

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
to the flag of

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
the United Nations

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
to the flag

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
of the United States

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
of America

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
and to the Republic

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
for which it stands

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
one nation,

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
one God

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
indivisible

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
with liberty and justice

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
for all.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Thank you.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
All right.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Thank you.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
It was crazy.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
We were wonderful.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
We were happy.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
You did a great job.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
We did a great job.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
We did a great job.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
We did a great job.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
We did a great job.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Goodbye, honey.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Remember, we're going to write letters

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
and every time we think about each other,

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
we're going to feel

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
a whole lot of love.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
I'll be bad.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
You'll have to come back.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
No, I won't, Caitlin.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And I'm counting on you to be good.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I'm betting on you, kiddo.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I'll be good, Mary.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I promise.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Just for you?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
No, just for you.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I will.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Bye.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Bye.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Maggie, I tamed you too.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I did move to Seattle,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
and as it turned out,

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
mine was the last special education class

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
at Lindbrook Elementary School.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I wondered if I'd ever hear from Caitlin,

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
because I had decided

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
to let her make that decision on her own.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Well, a couple of months ago,

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
in the manor,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I found out that

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
I had a special education class

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
at Lindbrook Elementary School.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I wondered if I'd ever hear from Caitlin,

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
because I had decided

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
a couple of months ago,

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
in the mail came a crumpled,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
water-stained piece of notebook paper

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
written on with a green felt-tip marker.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
No letter accompanied it.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
It was inscribed to Maggie

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
with much love,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
and it said,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
You were right to say you'd never leave me,

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
because I could always feel you there

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
to dry my tears when I get lonely.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I'm happy I carry your smile in my mind,

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
so I can remember just how scary

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
but very kind it was

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
for you to show me to myself.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And now I need to let you know

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
that every single day I grow,

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
and so does the joy that

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
only you would teach me to share.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Caitlin was right.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
She did tame me,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
and I will always be a teacher.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Thank you for watching!
