a story of settlement, integration, and female mobility. Adapted from aplos.org, Open Archive

3
00:00:51,860 --> 00:01:01,620
article and narrated by D.W. Draphin. The aim of this study was to seek mitochondrial DNA markers

4
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,540
recovered from ancient samples that can be associated with Phoenician origins and ancestry,

5
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,740
enabling us to track Phoenician mobility and genetic impacts of settlement, in this case in

6
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:20,900
Sardinia. We collected ancient samples from documented middle bronze age and Phoenician

7
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:28,900
burials in Lebanon and from Monte Sirai Sardinia, one of the largest Phoenician-Punic necropolis

8
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:36,980
in the central Mediterranean. The Phoenicians, one of the great ancient civilizations, emerged in the

9
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:45,700
northern Levant around 1800 BCE and by the 9th century BCE had brought together east and west

10
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:53,140
by spreading their culture across the Mediterranean basin. They linked Asia, Europe, and Africa

11
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,220
through their trade networks and settlements, and they created the ancestral alphabet of most of the

12
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,260
western world today. They were skilled navigators, whose trade networks extended throughout the entire

13
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:13,220
Mediterranean basin, and they had completed an Egyptian sponsored circumnavigation of Africa

14
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:20,020
long before the Vikings ventured out of the sight of land. Despite their widespread influence,

15
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,380
what is known of the Phoenicians comes from what was written about them by the Greeks and Egyptians.

16
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,780
In this study, we investigate the extent of Phoenician integration with the Sardinian

17
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:40,740
communities they settled. We present 14 new, ancient mitogenome sequences from pre-Phoenician,

18
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:51,300
circa 1800 BCE, and Phoenician, circa 700-400 BCE, samples, four from Lebanon and 10 from Sardinia.

19
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,460
We then compare these with 87 new, complete mitogenomes from modern Lebanese and 21 recently

20
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,260
published pre-Phoenician ancient mitogenomes from Sardinia to investigate the population dynamics

21
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:14,340
of the Phoenician-Punic site of Montessirai in southern Sardinia. Our results indicate evidence

22
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,940
of continuity of some lineages from pre-Phoenician populations, suggesting integration of Indigenous

23
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:29,060
Sardinians in the Montessirai Phoenician community. We also find evidence of the arrival of new,

24
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:35,700
unique mitochondrial lineages, indicating the movement of women from sites in the Near East

25
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,980
or North Africa to Sardinia, but also possibly from non-Mediterranean populations and the likely

26
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:50,420
movement of women from Europe to Phoenician sites in Lebanon. Combined, this evidence suggests female

27
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:56,820
mobility and genetic diversity in Phoenician communities, reflecting the inclusive and

28
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:02,340
multicultural nature of Phoenician society. The Details

29
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,660
From their homeland in what is today Lebanon, the Phoenician sailed extensively across the

30
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:17,220
Mediterranean for trade and established settlements in Cyprus, Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, Ibiza,

31
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:25,060
the Iberian Peninsula, and along the North African coast, most notably Carthage. Their naval dominance

32
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:31,140
was respected throughout the Mediterranean, and they provided maritime support to the Persians

33
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:38,020
and the Egyptians. Despite their enduring influence, scant historical documentation

34
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,580
attributed directly to the Phoenicians exists. Most of the Phoenician historic documents were

35
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,540
written on papyrus and have not survived or been discovered yet. What we do know of them is what

36
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:58,820
others, the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, wrote about them. They were never a unified political state

37
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:05,460
or distinct ethnicity within their homeland. The emerging coastal city-states of Biblos and

38
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:12,740
Sidon thrived as maritime trade centers during the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, and later,

39
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:19,620
the city of Tyre. During the 1st millennium BCE, their occupants were referred to by the Greeks,

40
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,860
and thus today, as the Phoenicians, from the Greek Phoenicae, or purple country,

41
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,860
in reference to their production of the valuable purple dye used in textile production.

42
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,580
Prior to this, however, the region was occupied by Canaanites, who, due to political events in the

43
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:45,380
north, south and east, were confined to the thin coastal strip between the steep, cedar-covered

44
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:52,180
mountains of Lebanon and the eastern Mediterranean. This coastal isolation meant that Phoenicians

45
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:59,060
could only expand westwards, and this they did, targeting sources of valuable metals including

46
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,780
silver and tin. They established settlements across the Mediterranean and dominated maritime

47
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:12,660
trade networks for centuries. Starting in the middle of the 8th century BCE,

48
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,260
the Assyrians waged war on the Phoenicians and soon after they brought them under their yoke.

49
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,660
With the decline of Phoenician influence in the east, Carthage, a city that was settled by

50
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:31,940
Phoenicians fleeing Tyre in 813 BCE, became the center of western Phoenician or Punic

51
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,900
dominance until its destruction in 146 BCE by the Romans in the Third Punic War.

52
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,180
Carthage, like many of the early Phoenician cities around the Mediterranean,

53
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,660
adopted many of the rituals and features of their homeland.

54
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,340
The island of Sardinia, like Cyprus, Malta, Sicily and Ibiza, was a significant location

55
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,260
in the early Phoenician trade routes to the Iberian and North African coasts and later

56
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,180
in the Punic interaction sphere. Phoenician settlements were established primarily along

57
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,340
the south and west coast of Sardinia, with two of the earliest located at Sulkis and slightly

58
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:21,620
inland, Monte Sirai. As was common in Phoenician Sardinia, Monte Sirai was built next to the

59
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:28,260
previous Nouragic tower used by the first inhabitants, like a shrine. The Necropolis at

60
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:34,660
Monte Sirai was one of the largest Punic burial sites in Sardinia and was used between the end

61
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:42,820
of the 7th and the first half of the 4th century BCE. This period of use coincides with the Carthaginian

62
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,940
Dominion in Sardinia, starting at the end of the 6th century BCE.

63
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:55,220
Genetic research on modern populations in Lebanon and the Levant, the homeland of the Phoenicians,

64
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,420
shows that much of the genetic structure of the region today is influenced by historic migrations

65
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,500
associated with the spread of major religions, Christians, Muslims, and Druze.

66
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,220
Research on the Y chromosome DNA of men currently living in locations of historic

67
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,700
Phoenician influence from across the Mediterranean, compared with men from nearby locations with no

68
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:29,700
evidence of Phoenician contact, has identified likely Phoenician Y chromosome markers. These

69
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,340
markers were present in more than 6% of the men living in Phoenician influenced locations around

70
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:45,860
the Mediterranean and in more than 30% of Lebanese men. Comparative analyses of uniparental genetic

71
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,980
markers in modern Lebanese indicate different genetic histories between males and females,

72
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:00,580
with significantly more European lineages evident in the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA,

73
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:08,980
than observed for the paternally inherited Y chromosome. When these European derived lineages

74
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:16,420
were integrated into the Lebanese population, is not yet fully resolved. If identified,

75
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,020
mitochondrial markers associated with Phoenician settlement around the Mediterranean

76
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,420
may help document the movement of women within the Phoenician networks.

77
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,620
They can also be used to indicate how much integration with indigenous inhabitants occurred

78
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,620
in Phoenician settlements. We now have the opportunity to investigate the genetic and

79
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:46,100
cultural history of the Phoenicians and their spread across the Mediterranean through the analysis of

80
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:53,220
ancient DNA from skeletal remains recovered from pre-Phoenician, Phoenician, and Punic

81
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:01,140
archaeological sites across the Mediterranean. A total of 28 ancient tooth samples were obtained

82
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:09,700
for ancient DNA analyses from four archaeological sites in Lebanon, including Telfados Quvarabida

83
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:16,100
and one site Montessori in Sardinia. The archaeological context of the samples

84
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:24,740
from the first Lebanese site relates to the late Phoenician Achaemenid period, 539-330 BCE.

85
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:32,500
In addition to the stratigraphy, a pilgrim flask, a dish, a pitcher, a gold ring, and red

86
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,460
carnelian beads were found in the tomb, enabling accurate dating of this archaeological context.

87
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:46,340
At one site in Beirut, the skeletal remains of children were found in pits excavated in the

88
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:54,420
geological substrate. All these burial rituals are consistent with a 5th to 4th century BCE date.

89
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:01,620
At Telfados Quvarabida, a town situated two kilometers south of the coastal town of Batrun,

90
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:08,580
we sourced our samples from three tombs. The pottery from the three tombs is quite homogeneous

91
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:17,540
and can be dated to the end of the Middle Bronze Age I, circa 1800 BCE. This dating is also supported

92
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:24,660
by a scarab found within one of the burials, which dates to the late 12th to 13th Egyptian

93
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:31,940
Middle Kingdom dynasty. The archaeological site of Montessori is a hilltop settlement located

94
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:39,060
in Carbonia, southwestern Sardinia, Italy. The site is comprised of three large sectors.

95
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,980
The main sector of the settlement, the acropolis, located in the southern portion of the hill,

96
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,380
the sacred place, or taffet, located in the northern portion of the site, and the large

97
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:58,260
necropolis located in the valley separating the settlement from the taffet. Archaeological evidence

98
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:04,660
indicates that Montessori was founded by Phoenicians in the last quarter of the 8th century BCE

99
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:12,980
and totally abandoned during the 1st century BCE. The necropolis contained several tune types,

100
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,740
including inhumations of single and multiple individuals, primary cremations,

101
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,380
enchatrysmoi, child burials in transport amphorae, and semi-combustions.

102
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:32,580
The archaeological interpretation of the group burials in Montessori is that they could represent

103
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:39,940
family burials. We found that one group burial containing four individuals included two

104
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,500
six to twelve year olds who had near identical haplotypes. They also shared two novel mutations.

105
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:53,060
It is therefore possible that these two were indeed siblings or otherwise maternally related,

106
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:59,140
for example cousins. The other two burials in that group had two non-local lineages,

107
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:06,740
another six to twelve year old and a young adult female sixteen to twenty-two years of age. While

108
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,860
this indicates that there is not a maternal connection between these four individuals who were

109
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:18,020
buried together, it is possible that they are family members related through paternal connections.

110
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:25,220
Analysis of more burials from Montessori and possible extended analyses of Y chromosome

111
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:32,820
or autosomal data are necessary to further test the relatedness of individuals buried in Montessori.

112
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,620
Without ancient DNA, a Phoenician-introduced signature can be difficult to distinguish

113
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:46,820
from earlier Near Eastern lineages that spread during the Neolithic expansion to European sites

114
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:53,620
that were later colonized by the Phoenicians like Montessori. It is expected, however,

115
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:59,300
the Neolithic expansions would spread lineages broadly across the landscape,

116
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,660
where Phoenician signatures are likely to be restricted to locations of well-established

117
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:12,260
Phoenician contact. Due to the relative isolation of Sardinia and the unusual genetic signature

118
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:18,500
of its population, modern Sardinians are often presented as the best representation

119
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,660
of the early Neolithic population that expanded from the Near East into Southern Europe.

120
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,860
While the later Phoenician influence in Sardinia was likely via Carthage, as indicated by the

121
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,260
archaeological evidence from Montessori, we still might expect to see the appearance of new Near

122
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:44,500
Eastern and or North African mitochondrial lineages in the burials from the site, given

123
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:51,700
that Carthage was settled directly from Tyre. The most common Haplogroup scene in our ancient

124
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Lebanese and Sardinian samples was the Super Haplogroup H, identified in seven of fourteen samples.

125
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,060
Two of the four ancient Lebanese samples belong to Haplogroup H,

126
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:11,780
and a third belongs to the sister-clade R0. Five of the Montessori samples, 50%,

127
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:19,140
were identified as having H haplotypes. There were no shared haplotypes between the ancient

128
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:26,020
samples of Lebanon and those from Montessori. However, all sequences belonging to Haplogroup's

129
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:34,260
H and R0, ancient samples of Lebanon and Sardinia and Montessori, are very closely related,

130
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:41,780
as they are separated by only a few mutations. In modern populations, the frequencies of

131
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:48,900
Haplogroup H range between 40-50% in Europe and about 20% in Southwest Asia.

132
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:58,420
Subclades H1 and H3, the major subclades of this Haplogroup, are almost exclusively European.

133
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:08,180
H1 and H3 are the most common found in modern Sardinians. No H3 lineages were found in our

134
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,900
ancient or modern Lebanese samples. Its presence in Sardinia in ancient samples,

135
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:20,980
both pre-Phoenician and Phoenician, combined with a diversity seen in the modern Sardinian

136
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,660
population, is consistent with at least a Neolithic introduction to the island,

137
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:34,180
if not pre-Neolithic. Haplogroup HV is also an ancient European lineage,

138
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,620
likely originating in the Mediterranean region during the last glacial maximum,

139
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,940
and has been identified in early Neolithic remains from Spain.

140
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:52,740
Two samples from Montessori have J1C haplotypes. This full motif was not found in any of our

141
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:59,540
modern Lebanese samples. This haplotype was identified in one pre-Phoenician sample dating

142
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:08,260
to around 4000 BCE in the Near East. It is clear that J1C was present in Sardinia prior to the

143
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:15,940
arrival of Phoenicians, and possibly prior to Neolithic expansions. The presence of one sample

144
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:23,460
from Montessori, a 6-12-year-old child that has an N1B haplotype, is of particular interest.

145
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:32,740
Haplogroup N lineages are rare in modern Sardinians. Brandt and others suggest that N is a marker of

146
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,220
Western European hunter-gatherers, as it has been found in Mesolithic samples from Portugal

147
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:46,660
and a Paleolithic sample in southern Italy. Ancient samples with haplogroup N1A have been found in

148
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:53,780
early Neolithic sites from Spain and Germany, but N1B has not been recorded in Neolithic samples

149
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:01,380
outside of the Levant, with two exceptions from Anatolia. N1B is a relatively common haplogroup

150
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:09,140
in Lebanon, occurring in 10% of modern samples. While we have not found any N1B in our ancient

151
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:16,820
Lebanese samples, it is not unlikely that this haplogroup was introduced to Sardinia via Phoenician

152
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:23,860
contact, either directly from the Levant or via Phoenician Punic settlements in North Africa,

153
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:31,620
for example Carthage. N1B1A lineages have been identified in modern Tunisians

154
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:38,260
and in a modern Moroccan, as well as in a modern individual from Sicily, another island with

155
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:46,020
known Phoenician settlement. Haplogroup W is thought to have evolved during the last glacial

156
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:57,380
maximum around the Caspian Sea region. Haplogroup W1, W3, and W6 have been found in late Neolithic

157
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:04,820
and early Bronze Age sites in Germany and Russia, and W1 has been identified in a Neolithic sample

158
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:14,580
from the Iberian Peninsula. While Haplogroup W1, W3, and W10 are present in modern Sardinians,

159
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,700
the archaeological sample from Montessirai of a young female included in a group burial is,

160
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:30,260
as far as we know, the first W5 identified in Sardinia. Our ancient result from Montessirai is

161
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:38,420
indeed significant and establishes a minimum date of late 5th century BCE for Haplogroup W5

162
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:44,020
in the Mediterranean region and, given the Phoenician trade networks, could explain the

163
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:52,180
presence of W5 in North Africa. It is possible that Haplogroup W5 got into the Mediterranean via

164
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:59,780
the Phoenician tin trade with Britain or Ireland, though only further ancient DNA work can confirm

165
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:09,220
this hypothesis. A sample from Montessirai belonged to Haplogroup X2B. Haplogroup X is

166
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:16,820
relatively rare in Europe, generally found at frequencies of less than 1%. The highest frequencies

167
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:24,340
of X in Europe are reported in Catalonia, the Pyrenees, and southern Portugal at about 2.5%.

168
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:32,260
It is found at relatively high frequencies in Druze from the Levant, where it reaches frequencies

169
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:40,260
of up to 15%, though we did not identify X haplotypes in any of our modern Lebanese samples.

170
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:48,980
It is possible that X2B was a Phoenician Haplogroup introduced to Sardinia either directly from Lebanon

171
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:56,020
or via North Africa, though an earlier early Neolithic introduction, perhaps via a Maritime

172
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:04,260
route, cannot be rejected. However, Haplogroup X was not found in any of the 21 ancient Sardinian

173
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:12,420
samples of earlier studies. And finally, a sample in Beirut was identified as a T2B,

174
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,980
a Haplogroup that we did not identify in any of the modern Lebanese we sequenced,

175
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:25,380
though T2 is found at low frequencies there today and was identified in one of our modern

176
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:32,820
Lebanese samples. Haplogroup T2 is currently found at around 10% frequency in Northern and

177
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:38,340
Central Europe, though some of the highest rates are in Sardinia, Southern Portugal,

178
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:45,860
and pockets in Northern Spain. T2B is the most common T2 subgroup found in Europe today,

179
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,780
and it has been identified in ancient samples from Central Europe. There has been some debate

180
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,060
regarding the origins of the T2 lineages, which were originally thought to have had a

181
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:03,700
Near East origin and spread into Europe with Neolithic expansions. It is possible that the

182
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:12,100
origins of T2, and in particular T2B, may indeed be in Southern Central Europe in the last glacial

183
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:21,060
maximum. The presence of a T2B3 haplotype in an ancient sample from Lebanon is unusual,

184
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:28,020
as it does not appear to be an indigenous lineage. The tomb in which the burial was found was not

185
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:34,420
marked, and did not have any of the artifacts found in other sites, suggesting different burial

186
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:40,900
customs. This is further evidence that this individual belonged to a different socioeconomic

187
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:47,620
class or ethnic group, perhaps a slave brought to Beirut from one of the Phoenician settlements,

188
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:55,460
such as Kaliari, Sardinia, formerly Karali. Our ancient Beirut sample is most closely related

189
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:02,100
to modern samples from Tunisia, again possibly indicating movement of women through the

190
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:08,740
Phoenician networks from European colonies and trading ports to Phoenician cities in the homeland

191
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:15,940
and Carthage. Earlier studies suggest that Sardinian-specific haplogroups and ancient

192
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:22,660
genomes dating to between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago may indicate that the earliest

193
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:28,420
inhabitants of the island arrived prior to the Neolithic expansion into the region,

194
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:34,420
which is consistent with archaeological and Y chromosome data suggesting earlier settlement.

195
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:42,740
Recent analyses of 3,514 whole genome sequences of modern Sardinians

196
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,260
suggest pre-Neolithic occupation of the island, and that some of the populations,

197
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:54,900
particularly those in the mountainous central eastern Genargentu region of the island,

198
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:01,460
carry higher levels of this hunter-gatherer DNA compared to populations from more accessible

199
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:08,660
regions. Our result may be indicative of early social and or geographic isolation

200
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:15,940
of those hunter-gatherer populations. The proposed Phoenician lineages W5,

201
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:25,220
N1B1A5, and X2B are not found in Sardinians today suggesting rare introductions of the

202
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:31,140
nature of single individuals rather than as representative of major colonizing groups.

203
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:39,300
We suggest that N1B1A5 could be an introduction from Carthage or some other North African location

204
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,100
within the Phoenician network. Conclusions

205
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:52,260
Our analyses of ancient pre-Phoenician and Phoenician mito genomes from Lebanon and Sardinia

206
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:59,540
provide important clues on cultural expansion, assimilation, and population mobility in the

207
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:08,100
Mediterranean between the 5th and 3rd centuries BCE. First we see a certain degree of continuity

208
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:15,140
of population ancestry between Phoenician and pre-Phoenician populations in Sardinia,

209
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,980
which is consistent with archaeological evidence of integration between the cultures.

210
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:28,340
However, our data from Montessirai, combined with our previously published result identifying a

211
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:37,700
European mitochondrial haplogroup U5B2C1 in a young man buried in a Phoenician crypt in Carthage,

212
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:44,740
North Africa, provide evidence of several instances of unexpected non-Indigenous

213
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:51,700
mitochondrial haplotypes in Phoenician burials both in and outside the homeland of Lebanon.

214
00:25:52,580 --> 00:26:01,860
These include the T2B3 haplotype in Beirut and the Near Eastern N1B1A5 and a Northern European

215
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:09,700
W5 found in Montessirai, Sardinia. The Sardinian population is often described as the best

216
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:17,140
representation of early farmer ancestry, and indeed, we do see the likely early farmer

217
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:23,460
mitochondrial DNA lineages combined with those of the southwestern central Mediterranean

218
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:31,940
Mesolithic, particularly haplogroups H, and possibly H1, H3, and H5 in the Phoenician samples

219
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:41,780
at Montessirai. N1B1A5 and W5, which have not yet been recorded in modern Sardinian populations,

220
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:48,420
and possibly X2B, we suggest, are examples of Phoenician introductions to Sardinia,

221
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,700
not only from the Phoenician homeland or via Punic settlements in North Africa,

222
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,740
but may represent the mobility of women through the wider Phoenician trade networks.

223
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,820
While previous Y chromosome analyses of modern populations around the Mediterranean

224
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,860
demonstrated the impact of Phoenician males on the genetic makeup of many communities,

225
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:16,180
we now see that it is likely that the Phoenician trade networks or settlement strategies

226
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:23,060
also included the translocation of women throughout the region, as well as the assimilation of

227
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:30,180
indigenous women in Phoenician settlements. Analyses of genetic variation in modern Lebanese

228
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:37,060
populations suggest closer affiliations with Europe, based on mitochondrial lineages.

229
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:45,780
Our result, identifying the European lineage T2B3 in the Beirut site, suggests that some of those

230
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:52,180
European mitochondrial DNA lineages could be associated with the integration of European

231
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:59,540
women in Phoenician communities in Lebanon. Finally, numerous studies published in the

232
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:06,420
last five years highlight the importance of ancestral DNA studies in understanding population

233
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,620
change through time, though most of these have focused on the Neolithic transition.

234
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:18,420
While these studies tell a story of significant population replacement in Europe with the arrival

235
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:26,020
of farmers, analyses of later historic burials associated with Roman Britain, for example,

236
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:33,460
and now our data from Phoenician sites demonstrate that both migration and cultural assimilation

237
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:40,660
were common, resulting in surprisingly cosmopolitan communities in the past.
