Checking Study of Antiquity and the Middle Ages/The Origins of the Phoenicians (DNA).txt
 The study examines ancient DNA from Phoenician sites in Lebanon and Sardinia to understand population dynamics, cultural expansion, and mobility in the Mediterranean region between the 5th and 3rd centuries BCE. The researchers found that while there is some continuity of population ancestry between pre-Phoenician and Phoenician populations in Sardinia, there are also instances of non-Indigenous mitochondrial haplotypes in Phoenician burials, suggesting the movement of women through the Phoenician trade networks.

In Lebanon, the Phoenician population appears to have some European ancestry, as indicated by the discovery of a European mitochondrial haplogroup T2B3 in a man buried in Beirut. In Sardinia, the Phoenician samples at Montessirai show a combination of early farmer DNA lineages and Mesolithic ancestry, with the presence of haplogroups H and its sub-clades, as well as unexpected non-Indigenous lineages such as N1B1A5 from North Africa and W5 from Northern Europe. These findings suggest that the Phoenicians not only transported goods but also people, including women, across their trade networks, leading to cultural integration and assimilation.

The study highlights the importance of genetic analysis in understanding historical population movements and the formation of communities, revealing a more complex picture than simple migration. It shows that by the later historic period, there were cosmopolitan communities with diverse ancestry, including those influenced by the Phoenicians. This research contributes to our knowledge of ancient DNA and its role in shaping human history and cultural interactions.
