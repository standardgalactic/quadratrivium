Phoenician Origins, DNA, Genetics. Ancient mitochondrial DNA of Phoenicians from Sardinia and Lebanon,

00:42.720 --> 00:51.860
a story of settlement, integration, and female mobility. Adapted from aplos.org, Open Archive

00:51.860 --> 01:01.620
article and narrated by D.W. Draphin. The aim of this study was to seek mitochondrial DNA markers

01:01.620 --> 01:07.540
recovered from ancient samples that can be associated with Phoenician origins and ancestry,

01:08.100 --> 01:14.740
enabling us to track Phoenician mobility and genetic impacts of settlement, in this case in

01:14.740 --> 01:20.900
Sardinia. We collected ancient samples from documented middle bronze age and Phoenician

01:20.900 --> 01:28.900
burials in Lebanon and from Monte Sirai Sardinia, one of the largest Phoenician-Punic necropolis

01:28.900 --> 01:36.980
in the central Mediterranean. The Phoenicians, one of the great ancient civilizations, emerged in the

01:36.980 --> 01:45.700
northern Levant around 1800 BCE and by the 9th century BCE had brought together east and west

01:45.700 --> 01:53.140
by spreading their culture across the Mediterranean basin. They linked Asia, Europe, and Africa

01:53.140 --> 01:59.220
through their trade networks and settlements, and they created the ancestral alphabet of most of the

01:59.220 --> 02:06.260
western world today. They were skilled navigators, whose trade networks extended throughout the entire

02:06.260 --> 02:13.220
Mediterranean basin, and they had completed an Egyptian sponsored circumnavigation of Africa

02:13.220 --> 02:20.020
long before the Vikings ventured out of the sight of land. Despite their widespread influence,

02:20.020 --> 02:25.380
what is known of the Phoenicians comes from what was written about them by the Greeks and Egyptians.

02:26.180 --> 02:31.780
In this study, we investigate the extent of Phoenician integration with the Sardinian

02:31.780 --> 02:40.740
communities they settled. We present 14 new, ancient mitogenome sequences from pre-Phoenician,

02:40.740 --> 02:51.300
circa 1800 BCE, and Phoenician, circa 700-400 BCE, samples, four from Lebanon and 10 from Sardinia.

02:52.100 --> 02:59.460
We then compare these with 87 new, complete mitogenomes from modern Lebanese and 21 recently

02:59.460 --> 03:06.260
published pre-Phoenician ancient mitogenomes from Sardinia to investigate the population dynamics

03:06.260 --> 03:14.340
of the Phoenician-Punic site of Montessirai in southern Sardinia. Our results indicate evidence

03:14.340 --> 03:21.940
of continuity of some lineages from pre-Phoenician populations, suggesting integration of Indigenous

03:21.940 --> 03:29.060
Sardinians in the Montessirai Phoenician community. We also find evidence of the arrival of new,

03:29.060 --> 03:35.700
unique mitochondrial lineages, indicating the movement of women from sites in the Near East

03:35.700 --> 03:42.980
or North Africa to Sardinia, but also possibly from non-Mediterranean populations and the likely

03:42.980 --> 03:50.420
movement of women from Europe to Phoenician sites in Lebanon. Combined, this evidence suggests female

03:50.420 --> 03:56.820
mobility and genetic diversity in Phoenician communities, reflecting the inclusive and

03:56.820 --> 04:02.340
multicultural nature of Phoenician society. The Details

04:03.300 --> 04:08.660
From their homeland in what is today Lebanon, the Phoenician sailed extensively across the

04:08.660 --> 04:17.220
Mediterranean for trade and established settlements in Cyprus, Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, Ibiza,

04:17.220 --> 04:25.060
the Iberian Peninsula, and along the North African coast, most notably Carthage. Their naval dominance

04:25.060 --> 04:31.140
was respected throughout the Mediterranean, and they provided maritime support to the Persians

04:31.140 --> 04:38.020
and the Egyptians. Despite their enduring influence, scant historical documentation

04:38.020 --> 04:44.580
attributed directly to the Phoenicians exists. Most of the Phoenician historic documents were

04:44.580 --> 04:51.540
written on papyrus and have not survived or been discovered yet. What we do know of them is what

04:51.540 --> 04:58.820
others, the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, wrote about them. They were never a unified political state

04:58.820 --> 05:05.460
or distinct ethnicity within their homeland. The emerging coastal city-states of Biblos and

05:05.460 --> 05:12.740
Sidon thrived as maritime trade centers during the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, and later,

05:12.740 --> 05:19.620
the city of Tyre. During the 1st millennium BCE, their occupants were referred to by the Greeks,

05:19.620 --> 05:25.860
and thus today, as the Phoenicians, from the Greek Phoenicae, or purple country,

05:26.500 --> 05:31.860
in reference to their production of the valuable purple dye used in textile production.

05:32.740 --> 05:38.580
Prior to this, however, the region was occupied by Canaanites, who, due to political events in the

05:38.580 --> 05:45.380
north, south and east, were confined to the thin coastal strip between the steep, cedar-covered

05:45.380 --> 05:52.180
mountains of Lebanon and the eastern Mediterranean. This coastal isolation meant that Phoenicians

05:52.260 --> 05:59.060
could only expand westwards, and this they did, targeting sources of valuable metals including

05:59.060 --> 06:05.780
silver and tin. They established settlements across the Mediterranean and dominated maritime

06:05.780 --> 06:12.660
trade networks for centuries. Starting in the middle of the 8th century BCE,

06:12.660 --> 06:18.260
the Assyrians waged war on the Phoenicians and soon after they brought them under their yoke.

06:18.900 --> 06:24.660
With the decline of Phoenician influence in the east, Carthage, a city that was settled by

06:24.660 --> 06:31.940
Phoenicians fleeing Tyre in 813 BCE, became the center of western Phoenician or Punic

06:31.940 --> 06:38.900
dominance until its destruction in 146 BCE by the Romans in the Third Punic War.

06:39.700 --> 06:44.180
Carthage, like many of the early Phoenician cities around the Mediterranean,

06:44.740 --> 06:48.660
adopted many of the rituals and features of their homeland.

06:49.700 --> 06:56.340
The island of Sardinia, like Cyprus, Malta, Sicily and Ibiza, was a significant location

06:56.340 --> 07:02.260
in the early Phoenician trade routes to the Iberian and North African coasts and later

07:02.260 --> 07:08.180
in the Punic interaction sphere. Phoenician settlements were established primarily along

07:08.180 --> 07:14.340
the south and west coast of Sardinia, with two of the earliest located at Sulkis and slightly

07:14.340 --> 07:21.620
inland, Monte Sirai. As was common in Phoenician Sardinia, Monte Sirai was built next to the

07:21.620 --> 07:28.260
previous Nouragic tower used by the first inhabitants, like a shrine. The Necropolis at

07:28.260 --> 07:34.660
Monte Sirai was one of the largest Punic burial sites in Sardinia and was used between the end

07:34.660 --> 07:42.820
of the 7th and the first half of the 4th century BCE. This period of use coincides with the Carthaginian

07:42.820 --> 07:47.940
Dominion in Sardinia, starting at the end of the 6th century BCE.

07:49.140 --> 07:55.220
Genetic research on modern populations in Lebanon and the Levant, the homeland of the Phoenicians,

07:55.860 --> 08:02.420
shows that much of the genetic structure of the region today is influenced by historic migrations

08:02.500 --> 08:08.500
associated with the spread of major religions, Christians, Muslims, and Druze.

08:09.460 --> 08:15.220
Research on the Y chromosome DNA of men currently living in locations of historic

08:15.220 --> 08:21.700
Phoenician influence from across the Mediterranean, compared with men from nearby locations with no

08:21.700 --> 08:29.700
evidence of Phoenician contact, has identified likely Phoenician Y chromosome markers. These

08:29.700 --> 08:36.340
markers were present in more than 6% of the men living in Phoenician influenced locations around

08:36.340 --> 08:45.860
the Mediterranean and in more than 30% of Lebanese men. Comparative analyses of uniparental genetic

08:45.860 --> 08:52.980
markers in modern Lebanese indicate different genetic histories between males and females,

08:53.540 --> 09:00.580
with significantly more European lineages evident in the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA,

09:01.300 --> 09:08.980
than observed for the paternally inherited Y chromosome. When these European derived lineages

09:08.980 --> 09:16.420
were integrated into the Lebanese population, is not yet fully resolved. If identified,

09:16.420 --> 09:22.020
mitochondrial markers associated with Phoenician settlement around the Mediterranean

09:22.020 --> 09:26.420
may help document the movement of women within the Phoenician networks.

09:27.220 --> 09:33.620
They can also be used to indicate how much integration with indigenous inhabitants occurred

09:33.620 --> 09:39.620
in Phoenician settlements. We now have the opportunity to investigate the genetic and

09:39.620 --> 09:46.100
cultural history of the Phoenicians and their spread across the Mediterranean through the analysis of

09:46.100 --> 09:53.220
ancient DNA from skeletal remains recovered from pre-Phoenician, Phoenician, and Punic

09:53.220 --> 10:01.140
archaeological sites across the Mediterranean. A total of 28 ancient tooth samples were obtained

10:01.140 --> 10:09.700
for ancient DNA analyses from four archaeological sites in Lebanon, including Telfados Quvarabida

10:09.700 --> 10:16.100
and one site Montessori in Sardinia. The archaeological context of the samples

10:16.100 --> 10:24.740
from the first Lebanese site relates to the late Phoenician Achaemenid period, 539-330 BCE.

10:25.700 --> 10:32.500
In addition to the stratigraphy, a pilgrim flask, a dish, a pitcher, a gold ring, and red

10:32.500 --> 10:39.460
carnelian beads were found in the tomb, enabling accurate dating of this archaeological context.

10:40.340 --> 10:46.340
At one site in Beirut, the skeletal remains of children were found in pits excavated in the

10:46.340 --> 10:54.420
geological substrate. All these burial rituals are consistent with a 5th to 4th century BCE date.

10:55.300 --> 11:01.620
At Telfados Quvarabida, a town situated two kilometers south of the coastal town of Batrun,

11:02.260 --> 11:08.580
we sourced our samples from three tombs. The pottery from the three tombs is quite homogeneous

11:08.660 --> 11:17.540
and can be dated to the end of the Middle Bronze Age I, circa 1800 BCE. This dating is also supported

11:17.540 --> 11:24.660
by a scarab found within one of the burials, which dates to the late 12th to 13th Egyptian

11:24.660 --> 11:31.940
Middle Kingdom dynasty. The archaeological site of Montessori is a hilltop settlement located

11:31.940 --> 11:39.060
in Carbonia, southwestern Sardinia, Italy. The site is comprised of three large sectors.

11:39.620 --> 11:44.980
The main sector of the settlement, the acropolis, located in the southern portion of the hill,

11:45.620 --> 11:51.380
the sacred place, or taffet, located in the northern portion of the site, and the large

11:51.380 --> 11:58.260
necropolis located in the valley separating the settlement from the taffet. Archaeological evidence

11:58.260 --> 12:04.660
indicates that Montessori was founded by Phoenicians in the last quarter of the 8th century BCE

12:05.220 --> 12:12.980
and totally abandoned during the 1st century BCE. The necropolis contained several tune types,

12:12.980 --> 12:18.740
including inhumations of single and multiple individuals, primary cremations,

12:19.460 --> 12:25.380
enchatrysmoi, child burials in transport amphorae, and semi-combustions.

12:25.380 --> 12:32.580
The archaeological interpretation of the group burials in Montessori is that they could represent

12:32.580 --> 12:39.940
family burials. We found that one group burial containing four individuals included two

12:39.940 --> 12:46.500
six to twelve year olds who had near identical haplotypes. They also shared two novel mutations.

12:47.140 --> 12:53.060
It is therefore possible that these two were indeed siblings or otherwise maternally related,

12:53.060 --> 12:59.140
for example cousins. The other two burials in that group had two non-local lineages,

12:59.780 --> 13:06.740
another six to twelve year old and a young adult female sixteen to twenty-two years of age. While

13:06.740 --> 13:11.860
this indicates that there is not a maternal connection between these four individuals who were

13:11.860 --> 13:18.020
buried together, it is possible that they are family members related through paternal connections.

13:18.900 --> 13:25.220
Analysis of more burials from Montessori and possible extended analyses of Y chromosome

13:25.220 --> 13:32.820
or autosomal data are necessary to further test the relatedness of individuals buried in Montessori.

13:33.860 --> 13:39.620
Without ancient DNA, a Phoenician-introduced signature can be difficult to distinguish

13:39.620 --> 13:46.820
from earlier Near Eastern lineages that spread during the Neolithic expansion to European sites

13:46.820 --> 13:53.620
that were later colonized by the Phoenicians like Montessori. It is expected, however,

13:53.620 --> 13:59.300
the Neolithic expansions would spread lineages broadly across the landscape,

13:59.300 --> 14:04.660
where Phoenician signatures are likely to be restricted to locations of well-established

14:04.660 --> 14:12.260
Phoenician contact. Due to the relative isolation of Sardinia and the unusual genetic signature

14:12.260 --> 14:18.500
of its population, modern Sardinians are often presented as the best representation

14:18.500 --> 14:24.660
of the early Neolithic population that expanded from the Near East into Southern Europe.

14:25.700 --> 14:31.860
While the later Phoenician influence in Sardinia was likely via Carthage, as indicated by the

14:31.860 --> 14:38.260
archaeological evidence from Montessori, we still might expect to see the appearance of new Near

14:38.260 --> 14:44.500
Eastern and or North African mitochondrial lineages in the burials from the site, given

14:44.500 --> 14:51.700
that Carthage was settled directly from Tyre. The most common Haplogroup scene in our ancient

14:51.700 --> 14:59.700
Lebanese and Sardinian samples was the Super Haplogroup H, identified in seven of fourteen samples.

15:00.580 --> 15:05.060
Two of the four ancient Lebanese samples belong to Haplogroup H,

15:05.140 --> 15:11.780
and a third belongs to the sister-clade R0. Five of the Montessori samples, 50%,

15:12.660 --> 15:19.140
were identified as having H haplotypes. There were no shared haplotypes between the ancient

15:19.140 --> 15:26.020
samples of Lebanon and those from Montessori. However, all sequences belonging to Haplogroup's

15:26.020 --> 15:34.260
H and R0, ancient samples of Lebanon and Sardinia and Montessori, are very closely related,

15:34.260 --> 15:41.780
as they are separated by only a few mutations. In modern populations, the frequencies of

15:41.780 --> 15:48.900
Haplogroup H range between 40-50% in Europe and about 20% in Southwest Asia.

15:49.780 --> 15:58.420
Subclades H1 and H3, the major subclades of this Haplogroup, are almost exclusively European.

15:59.380 --> 16:08.180
H1 and H3 are the most common found in modern Sardinians. No H3 lineages were found in our

16:08.180 --> 16:14.900
ancient or modern Lebanese samples. Its presence in Sardinia in ancient samples,

16:14.900 --> 16:20.980
both pre-Phoenician and Phoenician, combined with a diversity seen in the modern Sardinian

16:20.980 --> 16:26.660
population, is consistent with at least a Neolithic introduction to the island,

16:26.660 --> 16:34.180
if not pre-Neolithic. Haplogroup HV is also an ancient European lineage,

16:34.180 --> 16:39.620
likely originating in the Mediterranean region during the last glacial maximum,

16:39.620 --> 16:43.940
and has been identified in early Neolithic remains from Spain.

16:45.140 --> 16:52.740
Two samples from Montessori have J1C haplotypes. This full motif was not found in any of our

16:52.740 --> 16:59.540
modern Lebanese samples. This haplotype was identified in one pre-Phoenician sample dating

16:59.540 --> 17:08.260
to around 4000 BCE in the Near East. It is clear that J1C was present in Sardinia prior to the

17:08.260 --> 17:15.940
arrival of Phoenicians, and possibly prior to Neolithic expansions. The presence of one sample

17:15.940 --> 17:23.460
from Montessori, a 6-12-year-old child that has an N1B haplotype, is of particular interest.

17:24.180 --> 17:32.740
Haplogroup N lineages are rare in modern Sardinians. Brandt and others suggest that N is a marker of

17:32.740 --> 17:39.220
Western European hunter-gatherers, as it has been found in Mesolithic samples from Portugal

17:39.220 --> 17:46.660
and a Paleolithic sample in southern Italy. Ancient samples with haplogroup N1A have been found in

17:46.660 --> 17:53.780
early Neolithic sites from Spain and Germany, but N1B has not been recorded in Neolithic samples

17:53.780 --> 18:01.380
outside of the Levant, with two exceptions from Anatolia. N1B is a relatively common haplogroup

18:01.380 --> 18:09.140
in Lebanon, occurring in 10% of modern samples. While we have not found any N1B in our ancient

18:09.140 --> 18:16.820
Lebanese samples, it is not unlikely that this haplogroup was introduced to Sardinia via Phoenician

18:16.820 --> 18:23.860
contact, either directly from the Levant or via Phoenician Punic settlements in North Africa,

18:23.860 --> 18:31.620
for example Carthage. N1B1A lineages have been identified in modern Tunisians

18:31.620 --> 18:38.260
and in a modern Moroccan, as well as in a modern individual from Sicily, another island with

18:38.260 --> 18:46.020
known Phoenician settlement. Haplogroup W is thought to have evolved during the last glacial

18:46.020 --> 18:57.380
maximum around the Caspian Sea region. Haplogroup W1, W3, and W6 have been found in late Neolithic

18:57.380 --> 19:04.820
and early Bronze Age sites in Germany and Russia, and W1 has been identified in a Neolithic sample

19:04.820 --> 19:14.580
from the Iberian Peninsula. While Haplogroup W1, W3, and W10 are present in modern Sardinians,

19:15.220 --> 19:21.700
the archaeological sample from Montessirai of a young female included in a group burial is,

19:21.700 --> 19:30.260
as far as we know, the first W5 identified in Sardinia. Our ancient result from Montessirai is

19:30.260 --> 19:38.420
indeed significant and establishes a minimum date of late 5th century BCE for Haplogroup W5

19:38.420 --> 19:44.020
in the Mediterranean region and, given the Phoenician trade networks, could explain the

19:44.100 --> 19:52.180
presence of W5 in North Africa. It is possible that Haplogroup W5 got into the Mediterranean via

19:52.180 --> 19:59.780
the Phoenician tin trade with Britain or Ireland, though only further ancient DNA work can confirm

19:59.780 --> 20:09.220
this hypothesis. A sample from Montessirai belonged to Haplogroup X2B. Haplogroup X is

20:09.220 --> 20:16.820
relatively rare in Europe, generally found at frequencies of less than 1%. The highest frequencies

20:16.820 --> 20:24.340
of X in Europe are reported in Catalonia, the Pyrenees, and southern Portugal at about 2.5%.

20:25.620 --> 20:32.260
It is found at relatively high frequencies in Druze from the Levant, where it reaches frequencies

20:32.260 --> 20:40.260
of up to 15%, though we did not identify X haplotypes in any of our modern Lebanese samples.

20:40.980 --> 20:48.980
It is possible that X2B was a Phoenician Haplogroup introduced to Sardinia either directly from Lebanon

20:48.980 --> 20:56.020
or via North Africa, though an earlier early Neolithic introduction, perhaps via a Maritime

20:56.020 --> 21:04.260
route, cannot be rejected. However, Haplogroup X was not found in any of the 21 ancient Sardinian

21:04.260 --> 21:12.420
samples of earlier studies. And finally, a sample in Beirut was identified as a T2B,

21:13.220 --> 21:18.980
a Haplogroup that we did not identify in any of the modern Lebanese we sequenced,

21:18.980 --> 21:25.380
though T2 is found at low frequencies there today and was identified in one of our modern

21:25.380 --> 21:32.820
Lebanese samples. Haplogroup T2 is currently found at around 10% frequency in Northern and

21:32.820 --> 21:38.340
Central Europe, though some of the highest rates are in Sardinia, Southern Portugal,

21:38.340 --> 21:45.860
and pockets in Northern Spain. T2B is the most common T2 subgroup found in Europe today,

21:45.860 --> 21:51.780
and it has been identified in ancient samples from Central Europe. There has been some debate

21:51.780 --> 21:57.060
regarding the origins of the T2 lineages, which were originally thought to have had a

21:57.060 --> 22:03.700
Near East origin and spread into Europe with Neolithic expansions. It is possible that the

22:03.700 --> 22:12.100
origins of T2, and in particular T2B, may indeed be in Southern Central Europe in the last glacial

22:12.100 --> 22:21.060
maximum. The presence of a T2B3 haplotype in an ancient sample from Lebanon is unusual,

22:21.060 --> 22:28.020
as it does not appear to be an indigenous lineage. The tomb in which the burial was found was not

22:28.020 --> 22:34.420
marked, and did not have any of the artifacts found in other sites, suggesting different burial

22:34.420 --> 22:40.900
customs. This is further evidence that this individual belonged to a different socioeconomic

22:40.900 --> 22:47.620
class or ethnic group, perhaps a slave brought to Beirut from one of the Phoenician settlements,

22:47.700 --> 22:55.460
such as Kaliari, Sardinia, formerly Karali. Our ancient Beirut sample is most closely related

22:55.460 --> 23:02.100
to modern samples from Tunisia, again possibly indicating movement of women through the

23:02.100 --> 23:08.740
Phoenician networks from European colonies and trading ports to Phoenician cities in the homeland

23:08.740 --> 23:15.940
and Carthage. Earlier studies suggest that Sardinian-specific haplogroups and ancient

23:16.260 --> 23:22.660
genomes dating to between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago may indicate that the earliest

23:22.660 --> 23:28.420
inhabitants of the island arrived prior to the Neolithic expansion into the region,

23:28.420 --> 23:34.420
which is consistent with archaeological and Y chromosome data suggesting earlier settlement.

23:35.380 --> 23:42.740
Recent analyses of 3,514 whole genome sequences of modern Sardinians

23:42.740 --> 23:48.260
suggest pre-Neolithic occupation of the island, and that some of the populations,

23:48.260 --> 23:54.900
particularly those in the mountainous central eastern Genargentu region of the island,

23:54.900 --> 24:01.460
carry higher levels of this hunter-gatherer DNA compared to populations from more accessible

24:01.460 --> 24:08.660
regions. Our result may be indicative of early social and or geographic isolation

24:08.660 --> 24:15.940
of those hunter-gatherer populations. The proposed Phoenician lineages W5,

24:15.940 --> 24:25.220
N1B1A5, and X2B are not found in Sardinians today suggesting rare introductions of the

24:25.220 --> 24:31.140
nature of single individuals rather than as representative of major colonizing groups.

24:31.860 --> 24:39.300
We suggest that N1B1A5 could be an introduction from Carthage or some other North African location

24:39.860 --> 24:44.100
within the Phoenician network. Conclusions

24:45.140 --> 24:52.260
Our analyses of ancient pre-Phoenician and Phoenician mito genomes from Lebanon and Sardinia

24:52.260 --> 24:59.540
provide important clues on cultural expansion, assimilation, and population mobility in the

24:59.540 --> 25:08.100
Mediterranean between the 5th and 3rd centuries BCE. First we see a certain degree of continuity

25:08.100 --> 25:15.140
of population ancestry between Phoenician and pre-Phoenician populations in Sardinia,

25:15.700 --> 25:20.980
which is consistent with archaeological evidence of integration between the cultures.

25:21.700 --> 25:28.340
However, our data from Montessirai, combined with our previously published result identifying a

25:28.340 --> 25:37.700
European mitochondrial haplogroup U5B2C1 in a young man buried in a Phoenician crypt in Carthage,

25:37.700 --> 25:44.740
North Africa, provide evidence of several instances of unexpected non-Indigenous

25:44.740 --> 25:51.700
mitochondrial haplotypes in Phoenician burials both in and outside the homeland of Lebanon.

25:52.580 --> 26:01.860
These include the T2B3 haplotype in Beirut and the Near Eastern N1B1A5 and a Northern European

26:01.860 --> 26:09.700
W5 found in Montessirai, Sardinia. The Sardinian population is often described as the best

26:09.700 --> 26:17.140
representation of early farmer ancestry, and indeed, we do see the likely early farmer

26:17.140 --> 26:23.460
mitochondrial DNA lineages combined with those of the southwestern central Mediterranean

26:23.460 --> 26:31.940
Mesolithic, particularly haplogroups H, and possibly H1, H3, and H5 in the Phoenician samples

26:31.940 --> 26:41.780
at Montessirai. N1B1A5 and W5, which have not yet been recorded in modern Sardinian populations,

26:41.780 --> 26:48.420
and possibly X2B, we suggest, are examples of Phoenician introductions to Sardinia,

26:48.980 --> 26:53.700
not only from the Phoenician homeland or via Punic settlements in North Africa,

26:53.700 --> 26:58.740
but may represent the mobility of women through the wider Phoenician trade networks.

26:59.620 --> 27:04.820
While previous Y chromosome analyses of modern populations around the Mediterranean

27:04.820 --> 27:09.860
demonstrated the impact of Phoenician males on the genetic makeup of many communities,

27:10.500 --> 27:16.180
we now see that it is likely that the Phoenician trade networks or settlement strategies

27:16.900 --> 27:23.060
also included the translocation of women throughout the region, as well as the assimilation of

27:23.060 --> 27:30.180
indigenous women in Phoenician settlements. Analyses of genetic variation in modern Lebanese

27:30.180 --> 27:37.060
populations suggest closer affiliations with Europe, based on mitochondrial lineages.

27:37.860 --> 27:45.780
Our result, identifying the European lineage T2B3 in the Beirut site, suggests that some of those

27:45.780 --> 27:52.180
European mitochondrial DNA lineages could be associated with the integration of European

27:52.180 --> 27:59.540
women in Phoenician communities in Lebanon. Finally, numerous studies published in the

27:59.540 --> 28:06.420
last five years highlight the importance of ancestral DNA studies in understanding population

28:06.420 --> 28:11.620
change through time, though most of these have focused on the Neolithic transition.

28:12.500 --> 28:18.420
While these studies tell a story of significant population replacement in Europe with the arrival

28:18.420 --> 28:26.020
of farmers, analyses of later historic burials associated with Roman Britain, for example,

28:26.020 --> 28:33.460
and now our data from Phoenician sites demonstrate that both migration and cultural assimilation

28:33.460 --> 28:40.660
were common, resulting in surprisingly cosmopolitan communities in the past.
