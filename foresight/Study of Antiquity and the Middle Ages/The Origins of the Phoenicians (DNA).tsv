30000	42720	Phoenician Origins, DNA, Genetics. Ancient mitochondrial DNA of Phoenicians from Sardinia and Lebanon,
42720	51860	a story of settlement, integration, and female mobility. Adapted from aplos.org, Open Archive
51860	61620	article and narrated by D.W. Draphin. The aim of this study was to seek mitochondrial DNA markers
61620	67540	recovered from ancient samples that can be associated with Phoenician origins and ancestry,
68100	74740	enabling us to track Phoenician mobility and genetic impacts of settlement, in this case in
74740	80900	Sardinia. We collected ancient samples from documented middle bronze age and Phoenician
80900	88900	burials in Lebanon and from Monte Sirai Sardinia, one of the largest Phoenician-Punic necropolis
88900	96980	in the central Mediterranean. The Phoenicians, one of the great ancient civilizations, emerged in the
96980	105700	northern Levant around 1800 BCE and by the 9th century BCE had brought together east and west
105700	113140	by spreading their culture across the Mediterranean basin. They linked Asia, Europe, and Africa
113140	119220	through their trade networks and settlements, and they created the ancestral alphabet of most of the
119220	126260	western world today. They were skilled navigators, whose trade networks extended throughout the entire
126260	133220	Mediterranean basin, and they had completed an Egyptian sponsored circumnavigation of Africa
133220	140020	long before the Vikings ventured out of the sight of land. Despite their widespread influence,
140020	145380	what is known of the Phoenicians comes from what was written about them by the Greeks and Egyptians.
146180	151780	In this study, we investigate the extent of Phoenician integration with the Sardinian
151780	160740	communities they settled. We present 14 new, ancient mitogenome sequences from pre-Phoenician,
160740	171300	circa 1800 BCE, and Phoenician, circa 700-400 BCE, samples, four from Lebanon and 10 from Sardinia.
172100	179460	We then compare these with 87 new, complete mitogenomes from modern Lebanese and 21 recently
179460	186260	published pre-Phoenician ancient mitogenomes from Sardinia to investigate the population dynamics
186260	194340	of the Phoenician-Punic site of Montessirai in southern Sardinia. Our results indicate evidence
194340	201940	of continuity of some lineages from pre-Phoenician populations, suggesting integration of Indigenous
201940	209060	Sardinians in the Montessirai Phoenician community. We also find evidence of the arrival of new,
209060	215700	unique mitochondrial lineages, indicating the movement of women from sites in the Near East
215700	222980	or North Africa to Sardinia, but also possibly from non-Mediterranean populations and the likely
222980	230420	movement of women from Europe to Phoenician sites in Lebanon. Combined, this evidence suggests female
230420	236820	mobility and genetic diversity in Phoenician communities, reflecting the inclusive and
236820	242340	multicultural nature of Phoenician society. The Details
243300	248660	From their homeland in what is today Lebanon, the Phoenician sailed extensively across the
248660	257220	Mediterranean for trade and established settlements in Cyprus, Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, Ibiza,
257220	265060	the Iberian Peninsula, and along the North African coast, most notably Carthage. Their naval dominance
265060	271140	was respected throughout the Mediterranean, and they provided maritime support to the Persians
271140	278020	and the Egyptians. Despite their enduring influence, scant historical documentation
278020	284580	attributed directly to the Phoenicians exists. Most of the Phoenician historic documents were
284580	291540	written on papyrus and have not survived or been discovered yet. What we do know of them is what
291540	298820	others, the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, wrote about them. They were never a unified political state
298820	305460	or distinct ethnicity within their homeland. The emerging coastal city-states of Biblos and
305460	312740	Sidon thrived as maritime trade centers during the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE, and later,
312740	319620	the city of Tyre. During the 1st millennium BCE, their occupants were referred to by the Greeks,
319620	325860	and thus today, as the Phoenicians, from the Greek Phoenicae, or purple country,
326500	331860	in reference to their production of the valuable purple dye used in textile production.
332740	338580	Prior to this, however, the region was occupied by Canaanites, who, due to political events in the
338580	345380	north, south and east, were confined to the thin coastal strip between the steep, cedar-covered
345380	352180	mountains of Lebanon and the eastern Mediterranean. This coastal isolation meant that Phoenicians
352260	359060	could only expand westwards, and this they did, targeting sources of valuable metals including
359060	365780	silver and tin. They established settlements across the Mediterranean and dominated maritime
365780	372660	trade networks for centuries. Starting in the middle of the 8th century BCE,
372660	378260	the Assyrians waged war on the Phoenicians and soon after they brought them under their yoke.
378900	384660	With the decline of Phoenician influence in the east, Carthage, a city that was settled by
384660	391940	Phoenicians fleeing Tyre in 813 BCE, became the center of western Phoenician or Punic
391940	398900	dominance until its destruction in 146 BCE by the Romans in the Third Punic War.
399700	404180	Carthage, like many of the early Phoenician cities around the Mediterranean,
404740	408660	adopted many of the rituals and features of their homeland.
409700	416340	The island of Sardinia, like Cyprus, Malta, Sicily and Ibiza, was a significant location
416340	422260	in the early Phoenician trade routes to the Iberian and North African coasts and later
422260	428180	in the Punic interaction sphere. Phoenician settlements were established primarily along
428180	434340	the south and west coast of Sardinia, with two of the earliest located at Sulkis and slightly
434340	441620	inland, Monte Sirai. As was common in Phoenician Sardinia, Monte Sirai was built next to the
441620	448260	previous Nouragic tower used by the first inhabitants, like a shrine. The Necropolis at
448260	454660	Monte Sirai was one of the largest Punic burial sites in Sardinia and was used between the end
454660	462820	of the 7th and the first half of the 4th century BCE. This period of use coincides with the Carthaginian
462820	467940	Dominion in Sardinia, starting at the end of the 6th century BCE.
469140	475220	Genetic research on modern populations in Lebanon and the Levant, the homeland of the Phoenicians,
475860	482420	shows that much of the genetic structure of the region today is influenced by historic migrations
482500	488500	associated with the spread of major religions, Christians, Muslims, and Druze.
489460	495220	Research on the Y chromosome DNA of men currently living in locations of historic
495220	501700	Phoenician influence from across the Mediterranean, compared with men from nearby locations with no
501700	509700	evidence of Phoenician contact, has identified likely Phoenician Y chromosome markers. These
509700	516340	markers were present in more than 6% of the men living in Phoenician influenced locations around
516340	525860	the Mediterranean and in more than 30% of Lebanese men. Comparative analyses of uniparental genetic
525860	532980	markers in modern Lebanese indicate different genetic histories between males and females,
533540	540580	with significantly more European lineages evident in the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA,
541300	548980	than observed for the paternally inherited Y chromosome. When these European derived lineages
548980	556420	were integrated into the Lebanese population, is not yet fully resolved. If identified,
556420	562020	mitochondrial markers associated with Phoenician settlement around the Mediterranean
562020	566420	may help document the movement of women within the Phoenician networks.
567220	573620	They can also be used to indicate how much integration with indigenous inhabitants occurred
573620	579620	in Phoenician settlements. We now have the opportunity to investigate the genetic and
579620	586100	cultural history of the Phoenicians and their spread across the Mediterranean through the analysis of
586100	593220	ancient DNA from skeletal remains recovered from pre-Phoenician, Phoenician, and Punic
593220	601140	archaeological sites across the Mediterranean. A total of 28 ancient tooth samples were obtained
601140	609700	for ancient DNA analyses from four archaeological sites in Lebanon, including Telfados Quvarabida
609700	616100	and one site Montessori in Sardinia. The archaeological context of the samples
616100	624740	from the first Lebanese site relates to the late Phoenician Achaemenid period, 539-330 BCE.
625700	632500	In addition to the stratigraphy, a pilgrim flask, a dish, a pitcher, a gold ring, and red
632500	639460	carnelian beads were found in the tomb, enabling accurate dating of this archaeological context.
640340	646340	At one site in Beirut, the skeletal remains of children were found in pits excavated in the
646340	654420	geological substrate. All these burial rituals are consistent with a 5th to 4th century BCE date.
655300	661620	At Telfados Quvarabida, a town situated two kilometers south of the coastal town of Batrun,
662260	668580	we sourced our samples from three tombs. The pottery from the three tombs is quite homogeneous
668660	677540	and can be dated to the end of the Middle Bronze Age I, circa 1800 BCE. This dating is also supported
677540	684660	by a scarab found within one of the burials, which dates to the late 12th to 13th Egyptian
684660	691940	Middle Kingdom dynasty. The archaeological site of Montessori is a hilltop settlement located
691940	699060	in Carbonia, southwestern Sardinia, Italy. The site is comprised of three large sectors.
699620	704980	The main sector of the settlement, the acropolis, located in the southern portion of the hill,
705620	711380	the sacred place, or taffet, located in the northern portion of the site, and the large
711380	718260	necropolis located in the valley separating the settlement from the taffet. Archaeological evidence
718260	724660	indicates that Montessori was founded by Phoenicians in the last quarter of the 8th century BCE
725220	732980	and totally abandoned during the 1st century BCE. The necropolis contained several tune types,
732980	738740	including inhumations of single and multiple individuals, primary cremations,
739460	745380	enchatrysmoi, child burials in transport amphorae, and semi-combustions.
745380	752580	The archaeological interpretation of the group burials in Montessori is that they could represent
752580	759940	family burials. We found that one group burial containing four individuals included two
759940	766500	six to twelve year olds who had near identical haplotypes. They also shared two novel mutations.
767140	773060	It is therefore possible that these two were indeed siblings or otherwise maternally related,
773060	779140	for example cousins. The other two burials in that group had two non-local lineages,
779780	786740	another six to twelve year old and a young adult female sixteen to twenty-two years of age. While
786740	791860	this indicates that there is not a maternal connection between these four individuals who were
791860	798020	buried together, it is possible that they are family members related through paternal connections.
798900	805220	Analysis of more burials from Montessori and possible extended analyses of Y chromosome
805220	812820	or autosomal data are necessary to further test the relatedness of individuals buried in Montessori.
813860	819620	Without ancient DNA, a Phoenician-introduced signature can be difficult to distinguish
819620	826820	from earlier Near Eastern lineages that spread during the Neolithic expansion to European sites
826820	833620	that were later colonized by the Phoenicians like Montessori. It is expected, however,
833620	839300	the Neolithic expansions would spread lineages broadly across the landscape,
839300	844660	where Phoenician signatures are likely to be restricted to locations of well-established
844660	852260	Phoenician contact. Due to the relative isolation of Sardinia and the unusual genetic signature
852260	858500	of its population, modern Sardinians are often presented as the best representation
858500	864660	of the early Neolithic population that expanded from the Near East into Southern Europe.
865700	871860	While the later Phoenician influence in Sardinia was likely via Carthage, as indicated by the
871860	878260	archaeological evidence from Montessori, we still might expect to see the appearance of new Near
878260	884500	Eastern and or North African mitochondrial lineages in the burials from the site, given
884500	891700	that Carthage was settled directly from Tyre. The most common Haplogroup scene in our ancient
891700	899700	Lebanese and Sardinian samples was the Super Haplogroup H, identified in seven of fourteen samples.
900580	905060	Two of the four ancient Lebanese samples belong to Haplogroup H,
905140	911780	and a third belongs to the sister-clade R0. Five of the Montessori samples, 50%,
912660	919140	were identified as having H haplotypes. There were no shared haplotypes between the ancient
919140	926020	samples of Lebanon and those from Montessori. However, all sequences belonging to Haplogroup's
926020	934260	H and R0, ancient samples of Lebanon and Sardinia and Montessori, are very closely related,
934260	941780	as they are separated by only a few mutations. In modern populations, the frequencies of
941780	948900	Haplogroup H range between 40-50% in Europe and about 20% in Southwest Asia.
949780	958420	Subclades H1 and H3, the major subclades of this Haplogroup, are almost exclusively European.
959380	968180	H1 and H3 are the most common found in modern Sardinians. No H3 lineages were found in our
968180	974900	ancient or modern Lebanese samples. Its presence in Sardinia in ancient samples,
974900	980980	both pre-Phoenician and Phoenician, combined with a diversity seen in the modern Sardinian
980980	986660	population, is consistent with at least a Neolithic introduction to the island,
986660	994180	if not pre-Neolithic. Haplogroup HV is also an ancient European lineage,
994180	999620	likely originating in the Mediterranean region during the last glacial maximum,
999620	1003940	and has been identified in early Neolithic remains from Spain.
1005140	1012740	Two samples from Montessori have J1C haplotypes. This full motif was not found in any of our
1012740	1019540	modern Lebanese samples. This haplotype was identified in one pre-Phoenician sample dating
1019540	1028260	to around 4000 BCE in the Near East. It is clear that J1C was present in Sardinia prior to the
1028260	1035940	arrival of Phoenicians, and possibly prior to Neolithic expansions. The presence of one sample
1035940	1043460	from Montessori, a 6-12-year-old child that has an N1B haplotype, is of particular interest.
1044180	1052740	Haplogroup N lineages are rare in modern Sardinians. Brandt and others suggest that N is a marker of
1052740	1059220	Western European hunter-gatherers, as it has been found in Mesolithic samples from Portugal
1059220	1066660	and a Paleolithic sample in southern Italy. Ancient samples with haplogroup N1A have been found in
1066660	1073780	early Neolithic sites from Spain and Germany, but N1B has not been recorded in Neolithic samples
1073780	1081380	outside of the Levant, with two exceptions from Anatolia. N1B is a relatively common haplogroup
1081380	1089140	in Lebanon, occurring in 10% of modern samples. While we have not found any N1B in our ancient
1089140	1096820	Lebanese samples, it is not unlikely that this haplogroup was introduced to Sardinia via Phoenician
1096820	1103860	contact, either directly from the Levant or via Phoenician Punic settlements in North Africa,
1103860	1111620	for example Carthage. N1B1A lineages have been identified in modern Tunisians
1111620	1118260	and in a modern Moroccan, as well as in a modern individual from Sicily, another island with
1118260	1126020	known Phoenician settlement. Haplogroup W is thought to have evolved during the last glacial
1126020	1137380	maximum around the Caspian Sea region. Haplogroup W1, W3, and W6 have been found in late Neolithic
1137380	1144820	and early Bronze Age sites in Germany and Russia, and W1 has been identified in a Neolithic sample
1144820	1154580	from the Iberian Peninsula. While Haplogroup W1, W3, and W10 are present in modern Sardinians,
1155220	1161700	the archaeological sample from Montessirai of a young female included in a group burial is,
1161700	1170260	as far as we know, the first W5 identified in Sardinia. Our ancient result from Montessirai is
1170260	1178420	indeed significant and establishes a minimum date of late 5th century BCE for Haplogroup W5
1178420	1184020	in the Mediterranean region and, given the Phoenician trade networks, could explain the
1184100	1192180	presence of W5 in North Africa. It is possible that Haplogroup W5 got into the Mediterranean via
1192180	1199780	the Phoenician tin trade with Britain or Ireland, though only further ancient DNA work can confirm
1199780	1209220	this hypothesis. A sample from Montessirai belonged to Haplogroup X2B. Haplogroup X is
1209220	1216820	relatively rare in Europe, generally found at frequencies of less than 1%. The highest frequencies
1216820	1224340	of X in Europe are reported in Catalonia, the Pyrenees, and southern Portugal at about 2.5%.
1225620	1232260	It is found at relatively high frequencies in Druze from the Levant, where it reaches frequencies
1232260	1240260	of up to 15%, though we did not identify X haplotypes in any of our modern Lebanese samples.
1240980	1248980	It is possible that X2B was a Phoenician Haplogroup introduced to Sardinia either directly from Lebanon
1248980	1256020	or via North Africa, though an earlier early Neolithic introduction, perhaps via a Maritime
1256020	1264260	route, cannot be rejected. However, Haplogroup X was not found in any of the 21 ancient Sardinian
1264260	1272420	samples of earlier studies. And finally, a sample in Beirut was identified as a T2B,
1273220	1278980	a Haplogroup that we did not identify in any of the modern Lebanese we sequenced,
1278980	1285380	though T2 is found at low frequencies there today and was identified in one of our modern
1285380	1292820	Lebanese samples. Haplogroup T2 is currently found at around 10% frequency in Northern and
1292820	1298340	Central Europe, though some of the highest rates are in Sardinia, Southern Portugal,
1298340	1305860	and pockets in Northern Spain. T2B is the most common T2 subgroup found in Europe today,
1305860	1311780	and it has been identified in ancient samples from Central Europe. There has been some debate
1311780	1317060	regarding the origins of the T2 lineages, which were originally thought to have had a
1317060	1323700	Near East origin and spread into Europe with Neolithic expansions. It is possible that the
1323700	1332100	origins of T2, and in particular T2B, may indeed be in Southern Central Europe in the last glacial
1332100	1341060	maximum. The presence of a T2B3 haplotype in an ancient sample from Lebanon is unusual,
1341060	1348020	as it does not appear to be an indigenous lineage. The tomb in which the burial was found was not
1348020	1354420	marked, and did not have any of the artifacts found in other sites, suggesting different burial
1354420	1360900	customs. This is further evidence that this individual belonged to a different socioeconomic
1360900	1367620	class or ethnic group, perhaps a slave brought to Beirut from one of the Phoenician settlements,
1367700	1375460	such as Kaliari, Sardinia, formerly Karali. Our ancient Beirut sample is most closely related
1375460	1382100	to modern samples from Tunisia, again possibly indicating movement of women through the
1382100	1388740	Phoenician networks from European colonies and trading ports to Phoenician cities in the homeland
1388740	1395940	and Carthage. Earlier studies suggest that Sardinian-specific haplogroups and ancient
1396260	1402660	genomes dating to between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago may indicate that the earliest
1402660	1408420	inhabitants of the island arrived prior to the Neolithic expansion into the region,
1408420	1414420	which is consistent with archaeological and Y chromosome data suggesting earlier settlement.
1415380	1422740	Recent analyses of 3,514 whole genome sequences of modern Sardinians
1422740	1428260	suggest pre-Neolithic occupation of the island, and that some of the populations,
1428260	1434900	particularly those in the mountainous central eastern Genargentu region of the island,
1434900	1441460	carry higher levels of this hunter-gatherer DNA compared to populations from more accessible
1441460	1448660	regions. Our result may be indicative of early social and or geographic isolation
1448660	1455940	of those hunter-gatherer populations. The proposed Phoenician lineages W5,
1455940	1465220	N1B1A5, and X2B are not found in Sardinians today suggesting rare introductions of the
1465220	1471140	nature of single individuals rather than as representative of major colonizing groups.
1471860	1479300	We suggest that N1B1A5 could be an introduction from Carthage or some other North African location
1479860	1484100	within the Phoenician network. Conclusions
1485140	1492260	Our analyses of ancient pre-Phoenician and Phoenician mito genomes from Lebanon and Sardinia
1492260	1499540	provide important clues on cultural expansion, assimilation, and population mobility in the
1499540	1508100	Mediterranean between the 5th and 3rd centuries BCE. First we see a certain degree of continuity
1508100	1515140	of population ancestry between Phoenician and pre-Phoenician populations in Sardinia,
1515700	1520980	which is consistent with archaeological evidence of integration between the cultures.
1521700	1528340	However, our data from Montessirai, combined with our previously published result identifying a
1528340	1537700	European mitochondrial haplogroup U5B2C1 in a young man buried in a Phoenician crypt in Carthage,
1537700	1544740	North Africa, provide evidence of several instances of unexpected non-Indigenous
1544740	1551700	mitochondrial haplotypes in Phoenician burials both in and outside the homeland of Lebanon.
1552580	1561860	These include the T2B3 haplotype in Beirut and the Near Eastern N1B1A5 and a Northern European
1561860	1569700	W5 found in Montessirai, Sardinia. The Sardinian population is often described as the best
1569700	1577140	representation of early farmer ancestry, and indeed, we do see the likely early farmer
1577140	1583460	mitochondrial DNA lineages combined with those of the southwestern central Mediterranean
1583460	1591940	Mesolithic, particularly haplogroups H, and possibly H1, H3, and H5 in the Phoenician samples
1591940	1601780	at Montessirai. N1B1A5 and W5, which have not yet been recorded in modern Sardinian populations,
1601780	1608420	and possibly X2B, we suggest, are examples of Phoenician introductions to Sardinia,
1608980	1613700	not only from the Phoenician homeland or via Punic settlements in North Africa,
1613700	1618740	but may represent the mobility of women through the wider Phoenician trade networks.
1619620	1624820	While previous Y chromosome analyses of modern populations around the Mediterranean
1624820	1629860	demonstrated the impact of Phoenician males on the genetic makeup of many communities,
1630500	1636180	we now see that it is likely that the Phoenician trade networks or settlement strategies
1636900	1643060	also included the translocation of women throughout the region, as well as the assimilation of
1643060	1650180	indigenous women in Phoenician settlements. Analyses of genetic variation in modern Lebanese
1650180	1657060	populations suggest closer affiliations with Europe, based on mitochondrial lineages.
1657860	1665780	Our result, identifying the European lineage T2B3 in the Beirut site, suggests that some of those
1665780	1672180	European mitochondrial DNA lineages could be associated with the integration of European
1672180	1679540	women in Phoenician communities in Lebanon. Finally, numerous studies published in the
1679540	1686420	last five years highlight the importance of ancestral DNA studies in understanding population
1686420	1691620	change through time, though most of these have focused on the Neolithic transition.
1692500	1698420	While these studies tell a story of significant population replacement in Europe with the arrival
1698420	1706020	of farmers, analyses of later historic burials associated with Roman Britain, for example,
1706020	1713460	and now our data from Phoenician sites demonstrate that both migration and cultural assimilation
1713460	1720660	were common, resulting in surprisingly cosmopolitan communities in the past.
