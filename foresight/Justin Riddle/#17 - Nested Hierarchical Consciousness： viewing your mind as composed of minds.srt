00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Welcome back to the show that tells you you are a quantum computer with free will

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,320
at the apex of a hierarchy of conscious beings. My name is Justin Riddle and this

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,880
is episode 17 of the quantum consciousness series. In today's episode

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,640
we'll be talking about nested hierarchical consciousness, the idea that

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,120
information processing is occurring at multiple different scales in your brain

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,920
and this information needs to be communicated up and down the hierarchy.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,040
By the end of today's episode we'll ask the question, are you a conscious being

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,800
that's composed of conscious beings that's composed of conscious beings add

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,720
infinitum? This episode is available on YouTube and an audio-only version is

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,360
Hey there, my name is Justin Riddle, a little background on myself. I got a PhD

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,080
from UC Berkeley in psychology studying cognitive neuroscience. While at UC

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,560
Berkeley I taught a course on quantum consciousness for seven years and this

16
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,280
YouTube series is really a translation and extension of that material. Right now

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,400
I do research in humans and I deliver magnetic and electrical non-invasive

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,280
brain stimulation in order to get a better understanding of the role of

19
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,480
neural oscillations in cognition and how they become impaired in psychiatric

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:58,600
illness. So the topic for today is nested hierarchical consciousness and I'll be

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,800
talking about in particular this theory called the nested observer windows

22
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,840
model and this is a model that I developed in collaboration with Professor

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,440
Jonathan Schuehler who's at the University of California Santa Barbara

24
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,520
and we've been working on this model for many years now and at the time of this

25
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,720
recording we're currently in the process of submitting it for publication. So to

26
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,320
give you a big overview on what this model is and then speculating on some

27
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,200
of the implications for quantum consciousness and quantum computers in

28
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,000
general at the end we'll be running through the details of this model and

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,640
some of the evidence from cognitive neuroscience and some of just the

30
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,400
theoretical motivation for this model and this will really tie into the overall

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,760
story of this series but this one is a much more sort of based in the cognitive

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,560
neuroscience literature so I'll be doing a lot of talking about that. So here's

33
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,720
the pitch and I'm gonna start off by reading a quote from William James and

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,640
William James is really one of the like foundational philosophers, researchers

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,000
doing a lot of introspection in the early days of the field of psychology and

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,720
so the quote goes like this, we know what it is to get out of bed on a freezing

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,280
morning in a room without a fire and how the very vital principle within us

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,760
protests against the ordeal. Probably most persons have lain on certain

39
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,160
mornings for an hour at a time, unable to brace themselves to the resolve. We

40
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,480
think how late we shall be, how the duties of the day will suffer, we say I

41
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,800
must get up, this is ignominous, etc. But still the warm couch feels too

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,920
delicious, the cold outside too cruel, and resolution faints away and postpones

43
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,160
itself again and again just as it seemed on the verge of bursting the

44
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,960
resistance and passing over into the decisive act. Now how do we ever get up

45
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,120
under such circumstances? If I may generalize from my own experience, we more

46
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,120
often than not get up without any struggle or decision at all. We suddenly

47
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,760
find that we have got up, a fortunate lapse of consciousness occurs, we forget

48
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,640
both the warmth and the cold. We fall into some reverie connected with the

49
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,640
day's life, in the course of which the idea flashes across us, holo, I must

50
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,960
lie here no longer, an idea which at that lucky instant awakens no

51
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,320
contradictory or paralyzing suggestion and consequently produces immediately

52
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,680
its appropriate motor effects. It was our acute consciousness of both the warmth

53
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,800
and the cold during the period of struggle which paralyzed our activity

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,800
then and kept our idea of rising in the condition of wish and not of will. The

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,480
moment these inhibitory ideas ceased, the original idea exerted its effects.

56
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,040
William James, Principles of Psychology, Volume 2. So what's so fascinating about

57
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,440
this is I think it violates a few different sort of intuitions that we

58
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,120
have about our own experience being a human being. And one of those is this

59
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,560
idea that we have this narrator in our mind. And so we've kind of been told and

60
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,080
we kind of take it at face value that there is this narrative flow to our

61
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,600
minds and that we're sort of witnessing this unfolding of events. We have some

62
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,360
free will, some ability to change that unfolding of events, but we view it as a

63
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,200
single narrative self inside of us. And what this really challenges us to think

64
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,520
about is how when we decide to do things we are sometimes met with internal

65
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,520
resistance. And what is it when you have a conflicting set of ideas in your mind?

66
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,360
I would argue, and the nested observer window model argues, that there's

67
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,240
actually this debate, this collaboration, this dialogue between many different

68
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,400
voices in your head. And it's not really just a single narrative self, but so

69
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,320
much of our inner life of our cognition is really characterized by inner

70
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,080
conflict. Should I do this? Should I do that? That might be fun, but am I wasting

71
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,520
my time? You know, there's all this debate, this internal struggle that we

72
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:38,320
experience, which is really core and inherent to our lives. Another sort

73
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,880
of intuition that we have that the nested observer window or now model sort of

74
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,840
goes against is this idea that we have sort of a possessive or a feeling of

75
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,640
ownership over our thoughts. We think I created this thought, I am the creative

76
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:02,680
owner of my thoughts. I am generating and sort of assembling things together in my

77
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,240
mind. And while a lot of times there are periods where we're actively thinking

78
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,000
about something, and we really are assembling these big macro abstract

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,240
ideas together, and we're forming new solutions or new concepts out of sort of

80
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,720
more basic concepts. And all of that is going on at this very abstract level. But

81
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,760
in addition, we get many ideas that just pop into our mind. And we sometimes don't

82
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,280
even want ownership of our ideas. Sometimes an idea pops into your head and

83
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,640
you wonder, why did I think that? Where did that come from? And sometimes you even

84
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,280
suppress the unwanted thought, or you're kind of in awe, like where did this

85
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,920
thought come from? And so in the now model, we propose that thoughts do sort of

86
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,520
emerge into your mind fully formed. And even when you are assembling thoughts

87
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,640
together, you're doing so at such an abstract level, that there's so much

88
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,040
built into those concepts already. And even the basic concepts which are there

89
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,880
for you to assemble already have this sort of coming out of nowhere popping

90
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,920
into existence feeling to them, where there's so much that is entailed in

91
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,440
those in those basic concepts, even in the act of assembling. And then the sort

92
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,880
of another or like the final violation of intuition that I'll provide right now,

93
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,840
and there'll be more throughout throughout this episode, is the idea that we have a

94
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:45,960
limited interface with our own bodies, right? And so the idea is when I decide

95
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:53,800
I'm gonna move around in the world, that decision to move can sometimes be met

96
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,000
with resistance, or the movement itself might not come out like how I thought it

97
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,520
was gonna come out. Maybe I say, oh, I'm gonna walk over there and then I trip and

98
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,920
fall, you know, face first into the floor. That was not the plan, right? So we are

99
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:16,120
enacting very abstract action plans into our body. And we're not aware of the fine

100
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,280
motor movements, all the detailed muscle activation that needs to occur. And so

101
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,680
we're really operating at these very high abstract levels. And so there's

102
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,120
limited influence that we even have over our bodies. And another interesting way

103
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,120
of thinking about this is, you know, you can consciously pay attention to

104
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,960
breathing. But when you're not paying attention, you're still breathing. You

105
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,960
know, it's one of those weird flexible acts where you can simultaneously take it

106
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,520
under volitional control, or just let it go on unconsciously. So the argument is

107
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,760
that, you know, you're at the top of this hierarchy of conscious beings, and you

108
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:59,600
have limited influence on the lower levels beneath you. So that's sort of

109
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,520
from an experiential sense why the now model is sort of challenging the status

110
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:10,560
quo of how we think about ourselves. From a practical sense, when we do

111
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,760
science, we're trying to understand for the most part the human condition. What

112
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,160
is it like to be a mind? Who am I? What's going on? And of course, there's more

113
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,600
like medical applications or technological applications, but in the

114
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,960
field of psychology, we're trying to understand fundamentally, you know, who

115
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,440
we are. And so in that field, there's many different researchers studying the

116
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:43,320
phenomenon of the human mind. But some people study fMRI, EEG, these really

117
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,440
macro scale entire regions, activating the blood flow to different regions in

118
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,000
the brain with fMRI. These are macroscopic large regions. With EEG, we're

119
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,160
studying these big electric fields that emerge from the brain and relating

120
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,520
those to cognition. But then people also study neurons, and neurons are

121
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:12,120
operating at the scale of a thousand times per second, right? So while fMRI, EEG

122
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,000
is happening on the scale of seconds or sub seconds, you know, a small fraction

123
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,800
of a second, but maybe just like one tenth of a second, neurons are

124
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,400
activating at scales at the kilohertz range, like 1000 times per second. And

125
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,920
then beneath that, there's proteins, and there's synaptic interactions or

126
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,720
protein pathways that are that are, you know, processing information in their

127
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,160
own ways. And those are happening another order of magnitude faster, let's say

128
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,880
like the megahertz or even gigahertz range, right? A million times per second or

129
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,600
sometimes even a billion times per second. So there's all these different

130
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,680
scales, and you'll find people that are neuroscientists and they're interested

131
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,000
in the human mind. But they'll study the human mind at so many different scales.

132
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,040
And the question is, you know, we can find some relationship or correlation of

133
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,480
these fMRI and EEG signals to our minds. We find a correlation of neural activity

134
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,640
to our perceptions and our actions. And with proteins, once again, the presence

135
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,440
of a protein or not, or, you know, when light comes into the eyeball, it activates

136
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,840
a protein cascade, and that correlates with the detection of light. So that

137
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,600
also relates to our experience. And so the question is, how are all these

138
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,720
different processes happening at multiple different scales? And the nested

139
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,920
observer window model proposes a unique solution where you can view all of these

140
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,520
different levels as meaningfully processing information, and also sharing

141
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,720
that information up and down across these very different spatial temporal scales,

142
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,520
right? So we have centimeters and seconds, we have millimeters and kilohertz,

143
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,520
and then we have micrometers or even angstroms in the range of megahertz and

144
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,640
gigahertz, right? And so all of these processes seem to be contributing to

145
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,720
our experience. But how do we study these? How do we make sense of these? And it

146
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,520
would be really cool if you could have more interdisciplinary study where

147
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,520
people studying neurons could talk directly with like people using fMRI,

148
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,200
right? It would be cool to have ways in which in a principled manner, the

149
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,880
information or the content being created at these different scales is being

150
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,760
communicated to each other. So that's a lot of the big picture motivation for

151
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,280
the now model. So now I'm going to propose what is the now model

152
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:52,040
fundamentally. So the now model fundamentally is a way of defining

153
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,800
information integration units, and we call them observer windows. And an

154
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,800
observer window is at a certain spatial temporal scale, and it's integrating

155
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,760
information, and it has sort of a rhythmic processing to that information

156
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,000
integration, which is sort of the time scale, the integration rate at which it

157
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
operates. And then within that scale, you have a bunch of observer windows

158
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,200
communicating with each other at the same level. And then you also have

159
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,000
observer windows nested within each other, so that each observer window is

160
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
composed of observer windows, and then information is processed up and down

161
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,320
these different scales. And so we propose sort of a unique way of

162
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,600
information integration, which we call mosaic integration. And the idea here is

163
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,640
that we're really leveraging the nested nature of this system. And the metaphor

164
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:01,920
for what this looks like and the details will need to be hashed out by some

165
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,160
computational model, I would assume. But the idea is that this feels like a

166
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,560
mosaic image, where you can think of an image that's made up of a bunch of

167
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:20,280
tiles, and each of those tiles is itself an image. But when you're at the level

168
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,560
of a full image composed of tiles, you know, a single gestalt comes out, a

169
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,800
single representation, a single image appears. But then you can zoom into

170
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,160
these tiles, and you'll find that each tile has an image. And that tile is

171
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:43,360
composed of more tiles. And you can zoom in infinitely, or maybe there's

172
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,440
some limitation on how much you could zoom. But this this form of mosaic

173
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,680
integration is the way that you're able to assemble and build more abstract

174
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,800
representations. And a cool property of this form of integration would be that

175
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,120
you're sort of preserving a lot of the rich detail as you move up to the

176
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,840
higher and higher levels in the hierarchy. Alright, so we have these

177
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,000
observer windows, they have a fixed boundary, a fixed spatial and fixed

178
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,200
temporal boundary on where they are and what they are. And they're integrating

179
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,960
information from their environment. And they're also nested within other

180
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,600
observer windows and processing information up and down this hierarchy.

181
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,040
And so there's a few implications. And so first, I'm going to talk about the

182
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,000
implications for consciousness, where does consciousness fit into this? And then

183
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,280
I'll go into the the details of what this information integration might look

184
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,400
like, and the phenomenon coming out of cognitive neuroscience that that

185
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,080
motivates thinking about this model. And then I'll end talking about how

186
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,120
quantum mechanics might play a role in particular in one of these principles

187
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,920
that I'm going to talk about in a second here. So the question is, where does

188
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,400
consciousness come in? And so one idea is that consciousness is just at the top

189
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:18,040
level, that you have this hierarchy of observer windows, and you, the viewer are

190
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,920
the highest level, you are the one observer window at the top of the

191
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,360
hierarchy. And there's all these sort of autonomous observer windows at lower

192
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,560
levels or semi autonomous observer windows integrating information. But all

193
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,480
of those are just worker bees. And you are the only one that's a conscious

194
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,280
being and you're the only one that really has the the qualia, the feeling of

195
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:49,040
being a self. And all these lower levels are, yeah, just unconscious, subconscious,

196
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,000
pre conscious, proto conscious, whatever, you know, fun prefix you want to fit

197
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,440
onto conscious. And this really feels a lot like the global workspace model, or

198
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,480
these sort of emergentist views of consciousness, where you try to describe,

199
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,760
you know, at the level of the whole brain, there's some sort of emergent

200
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,880
property or some sort of being that comes out at this highest level. An

201
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,480
alternative way of putting consciousness into the now model is that there's some

202
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:27,120
sort of threshold for information complexity, or for the integration of

203
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,880
information to be occurring. There's some threshold for what that looks like. And

204
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,840
then only once you breach that threshold, do you have a conscious being. So here

205
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,920
there would be some level in the brain or in the body, where you have a conscious

206
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:50,200
being. And above that level are conscious beings nested within each other. But

207
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:58,600
beneath that level, it's automaton, right, it's non conscious, just processors. The

208
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:06,080
third and final option is sort of a form of pan psychism, pan, pan, meaning all, and

209
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,520
psychism being, you know, a root of consciousness. So pan psychism, everything

210
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,920
is conscious. And now in the now model, we assert that, you know, not everything

211
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,240
can arbitrarily be called a consciousness. But in the now model, the observer

212
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:31,440
windows have a biological infrastructure, a boundary that limits what could be a

213
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,760
conscious being. But you're at the top of the hierarchy, and there's conscious

214
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,800
beings nested beneath you. And it goes down and down and down. And all of those

215
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:50,800
are conscious beings at various smaller and smaller levels. So not quite sure

216
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,600
what the correct answer is. I personally really love this pan psychist model where

217
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,360
all these levels are conscious beings. And we'll come back to this idea a bit

218
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,440
later. But it really does kind of blow your mind. And so maybe I'm just drawn to

219
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,800
it because it is such a mind blowing reality shifting type of way of viewing

220
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,040
yourself as being composed genuinely of conscious beings. You're running the show,

221
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:21,280
maybe mostly. You're at the top, probably, but there's still conscious beings

222
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:28,920
beneath you. And you're sort of the CEO of this corporation of conscious beings

223
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:36,760
directing what to do. But all of these entities underneath you still have a say

224
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,840
they have an input on what gets carried out eventually. And all of your

225
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,320
reality and perception is being filtered through these lower levels. And you're

226
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,400
making decisions at this very abstract higher level. So it's still sort of an

227
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,120
integrated interplay between all these different levels of conscious beings.

228
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,640
Alright, so now I'm going to dive into the three principles of the now model. And

229
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:15,880
they are synchrony. This is a zero phase lag high degree of correlation between a

230
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:21,640
bunch of components. And this forms the integration unit forms the observer

231
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:29,840
window. It is difficult to achieve a zero phase lag entirely correlated system

232
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,200
with high synchrony. Everything is so coupled together that it loses individuality

233
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,200
and it becomes a single entity, right? That is synchrony, the formation of an

234
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:49,280
observer window. The second principle is coherence. And coherence is a non zero

235
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,960
phase lag coupling between two observer windows. And this is two observer windows

236
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,320
at the same spatial temporal level. So they're both processing information. They

237
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,040
both have their own integration rates, you know, of how they're processing

238
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:10,320
information. But they can communicate with each other. And it's a weak transient

239
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,520
communication, they form these functional networks of observer windows

240
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,320
communicating with each other. But it's inherently unstable and transient. And you

241
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,720
don't lose the individuality of the of the two observer windows that are

242
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:33,120
coherent. And then the final and third principle is cross frequency coupling. And

243
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,040
this is once again a weak form of coupling between two observer windows. Except

244
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,440
the catch here is that the observer windows are at different spatial temporal

245
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,320
scales. So you have big, slow, rhythmically integrating observer windows. And

246
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,960
these much smaller, faster observer windows integrating information. And

247
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,640
they're coupled to each other. And once again, the coupling is more weak. And it

248
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,920
happens between observer windows nested within other higher level observer

249
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,440
windows. And this is really sort of the critical way in which information is

250
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,040
transferred up and down a hierarchy, right up and down this this nested

251
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:19,360
observer window hierarchy. And so we propose that electrical activity really

252
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:26,640
serves as the lingua franca or the, you know, universal generalizable principle at

253
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:35,040
play here. And so I'll talk to you today about brain regions or brain nuclei and

254
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,000
neurons. And we, you know, speculate that proteins are also observer windows and

255
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,400
potentially there's higher or lower observer windows also at play here, but

256
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,880
we'll really focus on brain nuclei and neurons. And we'll be talking about

257
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,680
electrical activity as really this universal form of communication, where

258
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,640
even though they're comprised of very different material, and they're, you know,

259
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,720
operating at very different scales, if information integration can occur, using a

260
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,320
common substrate, even though it's at different levels, this sort of

261
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,920
facilitates that communication of information. And we believe that this is a

262
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:22,920
plausible solution for the protein scale, maybe some intermediary scales and

263
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,440
potentially at even more fundamental lower scales, that electricity or

264
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:36,120
electromagnetism could be a very fundamental sort of substrate for

265
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,160
processing this information. And it's very apparent that electrical activity

266
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,240
plays a fundamental role in the level of neurons in brain nuclei, which we'll

267
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,840
talk about as examples. So I'm going to start off with our first principle,

268
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,720
synchrony. And synchrony is the formation of an observer window. And so a funny

269
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,840
example or analogy here is if you see a bunch of lights attached to the limbs of

270
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,880
a human, and they're walking through the night, so all you can see are those lights,

271
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,520
you'll witness the movement of a human. But if the human stands still, you just

272
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:19,240
see a smattering of lights and there's no human form available. And so when we're

273
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,680
studying the processing of information, we do really need to focus on that

274
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:33,280
process, you know, the movement through time of these biological systems. And

275
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,320
what's beautiful about synchrony is synchrony is really the creation and the

276
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,400
formation of a single unit. And so I feel like this is almost like, like it's

277
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,160
almost like a nuance that you accept, but you don't even realize that you've

278
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:55,840
already accepted this, is that you call things by their name, you call something

279
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,720
a thing. And in calling something a thing, you're inferring that that thing has a

280
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,280
strong degree of structural and temporal stability. And so synchrony is really

281
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:13,920
just putting a definition and a label on what that definition of a thing is, you

282
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,120
know. And so a good example is like a protein, we just call it a protein, but

283
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,440
really there's such a high degree of synchronization within the protein that

284
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:31,720
it acts as a single protein, right? neurons act as single cells. And brain

285
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,160
nuclei act as single brain nuclei. And so how do they do that? Well, just go

286
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,640
through the neuron and nuclei example. But neurons have this phospholipid

287
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,040
bilayer membrane, it acts as a capacitor for the neuron. And so it stores up this

288
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,640
strong electrical potential inside of the neuron. And you reach a point where the

289
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,720
neuron has such strong electrical coupling in its, you know, internally, that it

290
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,760
behaves as if it's a single electrical functional unit. Similarly, a brain

291
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,320
nuclei exhibits these synchronized electrical states, where the entire

292
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,000
nuclei will undergo this single electrical potential. And you can witness

293
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,480
these electrically vibrating fluctuations in the nuclei that you're

294
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,160
observing. And they have these characteristic electrical rhythms that

295
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,040
they exhibit. And these are enabled by a lot of structural properties in the

296
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,200
neuron, or in the architecture of the neurons. Typically, it's called a

297
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,840
phaptic coupling. Essentially, this is when a bunch of neurons are oriented

298
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,040
together, and they undergo their own electrical potentials or action

299
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,960
potentials or firing, as people usually call it. And a lot of these neurons are

300
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,520
oriented so that the electric fields generated within the neurons are then

301
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:06,120
propagated across a whole population. And so what you see in the wild is you see

302
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,400
a brain nuclei will exhibit these big electric fluctuations that are

303
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,240
basically enabled by all of these parallel fibers in these brain nuclei. And

304
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,000
then they start to serve a functional role and it begins to act as a single

305
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,160
functional unit, similar to these neurons behaving as single functional units. And

306
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,600
so what's really cool is that if you are measuring the electrical potential in

307
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:39,320
the brain, and let's say we're focusing on this slower frequency range where you

308
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,440
would see brain nuclei operating, you'll have this background activity in your

309
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,560
electrical recording. And when you found a brain nuclei that's forming

310
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,760
some functional area, some functional unit, you'll see this bump, this rhythmic

311
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,480
oscillation emerging from just the background noise of your recording. And

312
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,520
you can be fairly certain that when you see these electrical bumps in your

313
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,280
recording, after running a four-year transform and breaking it down into the

314
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,880
frequency domain, you can be sure that there's some sort of brain nuclei

315
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,680
processing information at this certain scale. And so the brain nuclei have

316
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:28,240
clearly defined boundaries, and they have a very clearly defined rhythm at which

317
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,480
they are operating. So what does synchrony mean practically or to cognition? And

318
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,720
so this was an idea proposed by Wolfgang Singer called Binding Biosynchrony. And

319
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:48,240
here we're using this exact concept in the now model. And the idea is that there's

320
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,480
this difficult challenge in psychology called the binding problem. I have a

321
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,440
gestalt representation of let's say a chair. I know what it looks like, I know

322
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,160
what it feels like, I know how to use it, I know what the texture is like, I know

323
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,080
what the color is like, how do I have this single representation of a chair? How

324
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,880
does all this information get bound together? And so Wolfgang Singer proposed

325
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:18,120
that synchrony forms a natural sort of neural mechanism for how you can have

326
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,720
information coming from different sources, and then it gets bound together

327
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,600
through this synchrony. In the now model we propose that there is a

328
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:32,160
integration rate that the observer window opens, it accumulates a bunch of

329
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,160
information, and then it binds that information into a single gestalt

330
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:44,760
representation. And once you have formed it, it exists, and you experience it if

331
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,200
you are that observer window, and then the next cycle a new representation is

332
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,560
generated. And it could be that this is some predictive coding model where

333
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,640
there's sort of a model of the world that gets update periodically, and so

334
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,000
there's an update that kicks in, and so there's sort of a continuity or a

335
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,480
stability through time, or you could view this as sort of these like discrete

336
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:14,960
refreshes of information with no time between them, it's just now, now, now,

337
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,840
now, there's just an experience now, a gestalt experience now, and another

338
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,600
gestalt experience now, and there actually is no time between those

339
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,800
discrete moments. So it's sort of an alternative framing for what this might

340
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:37,040
feel like in our conscious experience. So an example I really love is called the

341
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:42,160
flicker fusion rate, and there was a, you know, this phenomenon has been

342
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,680
studied quite a bit, but there was a cognitive neuroscience study that came

343
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:53,080
out in the past 10 years or so that was really interesting and impactful by

344
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,520
connecting it to these electrical oscillations. So the idea is that if I

345
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:03,400
present two flashes of light, very quickly, you will see them as two

346
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,400
different flashes of light. But as the time between the flashes shrinks, you

347
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,800
hit a point where the two flashes are really just one flash now, right? And

348
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,320
so the flashes fuse, you have a flickering light, and then you have the

349
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,760
fusion into a single light. The exact moment where you flip over from two

350
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:30,000
flashes into a single flash is called the flicker fusion rate. That is the

351
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,520
rate at which the lights switch from flicker into fusion. And there was this

352
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,440
really cool study by Samaha and Postal, who were looking at the visual

353
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,320
cortex, and the visual cortex has, it is, it can be conceptualized as a brain

354
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,520
nuclei with a electrical fluctuation and electrical potential. And this one is

355
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,600
often called the alpha oscillation, and it happens to be around 10 hertz, 10

356
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,440
times per second. And what they found is that there's some variation between

357
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,480
people at what that integration rate or what that refresh rate is in visual

358
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:14,240
cortex. And so people who have a slightly faster alpha oscillation in visual

359
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,800
cortex, they can actually still perceive the flicker at a smaller and smaller

360
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,880
time scale. So it takes, you know, they have to be much closer for the flashes

361
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:32,800
to fuse. And the idea is that every alpha oscillation is opening a window,

362
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:40,240
taking in some information. But if you have a slower rhythm in the back of your

363
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,640
brain, in the visual cortex, then both of the flashes are going to end up in the

364
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,560
same window, and they're going to get integrated together into a fused single

365
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:55,400
flash. And so this really fits nicely with the now model, where these observer

366
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,800
windows have these integration rates. And this is predictive of the rhythmic

367
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,480
refresh of information in this observer window. And so now we're talking about

368
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,120
this rhythmic refresh rate of these gestalt perceptions in different brain

369
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:16,440
nuclei. What does this mean for you as a conscious being? What is this rhythmic

370
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,360
refresh rate? Well, we argue in the now model that this rhythmic refresh rate is

371
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:29,600
equivalent to your perception of time. And so the temporal processing of this

372
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,680
information has a fixed rate. If you're a brain nuclei, it'll be occurring around

373
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,920
the scale of 10 times per second, five times per second. But if you're a neuron,

374
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,400
it might be happening at 1000 times per second or 100 times per second, much,

375
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:51,440
much, much faster, right? And so what it is like to be that observer window is to

376
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:59,200
feel a flow of time at the rate at which your refreshes are occurring. And so

377
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,080
what's really fascinating is there's a few anomalous experiences in our

378
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,920
experience that relate to time perception. So when you're in a life

379
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,800
threatening situation, you're driving down the freeway, a truck changes lanes into

380
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,920
you and you are feeling like an impending doom, you will have the

381
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,200
experience of time slowing down. What's happening? Could it be that the observer

382
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,960
window that is you is increasing the integration rate, that frequency of

383
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:40,160
gestalt representation generation is increased, you're tapping into more

384
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,000
concrete, less abstract information, you have less time to integrate a bunch of

385
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,640
interesting information, you have less integration time, but you can get much

386
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:55,880
more refreshes, right? You can get more static frames of what is happening. And

387
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,040
so time is experienced as a dilation, where it feels like time is moving slow.

388
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,320
But really, you're having more experience per second because your observer

389
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,360
window has frequency shifted into the faster range. On the flip side, we can

390
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:18,920
have the opposite, where time folds inward and dissolves away and an hour

391
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,800
passes in an instant and we lose track of time and suddenly we look up from our

392
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,400
book or we pull out of our thoughts and 10 minutes have flown by and we're

393
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,080
shocked that all this time has disappeared. Where did it go? So we suggest

394
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:39,080
that in this example, your observer window is shifting the opposite direction,

395
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,640
right? It's shifting towards longer integration times. More information is

396
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,680
able to enter into this open window and gets bound into a gestalt representation,

397
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,400
which is a large abstract integration of a lot of interesting and creative

398
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,960
abstract ideas. So when you're daydreaming, when you're mind wandering, when

399
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:09,000
you're lost in thought, you might have a sort of stretching of your temporal

400
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,240
experience as the integration windows expand to get more and more information

401
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,400
into a single integration and your thoughts become more abstract and yet

402
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:27,720
time flies by because you have less moments of consciousness per second.

403
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:34,240
However, there's more information in this abstract quality in each of those

404
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,880
thoughts. So we're going to move on to the second principle of coherence and

405
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,880
coherence is really best understood by contrasting it with synchrony. So

406
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,000
synchrony, remember, is how we create an observer window. This is no easy feat.

407
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:56,240
You need a lot of biological infrastructure like a capaciting membrane or

408
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:03,320
all these fibers oriented to create high synchronization in the brain nuclei.

409
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:10,840
So synchrony is the creation of single entities with zero lag. Everything is

410
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,520
just one thing all of a sudden and we can form this equivalent of a conscious

411
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:22,280
being with the capacity to integrate information. Coherence is like a

412
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,560
conversation. So the analogy here is that coherence can be understood of as two

413
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,600
people having a conversation. One person talks, the other one listens, the other

414
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,920
person talks, the other person listens. And so there's a communication going on.

415
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:43,840
And the words need to be transmitted to the other person, right? There is a

416
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,480
non zero phase lag. There is a lag between the information going from one

417
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,920
person to the other. And when the information is received, it's integrated

418
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,280
in that observer window and then it, you know, some new information is sent

419
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,360
back, right? And so when two people are having a productive conversation, they

420
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,040
are coherent. If you were to track their audio waves, you would find that

421
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,640
they're sort of vibing together, but they're not happening at the same time,

422
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,080
right? It's not the same person speaking the same words simultaneously. Sometimes

423
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,400
that can arbitrarily happen, but it's more of a predictive thing, right? So

424
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,320
their communication has delay. And you wouldn't say, oh, that conversation is

425
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,160
going so well, they've just fused into the same person, right? There's still two

426
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,320
different people. The synchrony is the creation of the two separate people. And

427
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:42,000
the coherence is the communication between the different people, right? So in

428
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,600
practice, in biology, we see that when brain regions want to communicate with

429
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,880
each other, there's something called neuronal communication through neuronal

430
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,240
coherence. This is developed by Pascal Fries. And Pascal Fries proposed,

431
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,800
essentially what I just told you here, you have these rhythmically oscillating

432
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,360
different units. And when they want to transmit information to each other, they

433
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,760
will sort of align their oscillations so that one transmits some information, the

434
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,960
other one receives it, and the transmissions are sent back and forth,

435
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,920
right? And so if we look into the brain and we look at some complex cognitive

436
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,640
control tasks where multiple regions need to communicate with each other, you'll

437
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,520
see that they'll become coherent with each other. And that information will

438
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,320
preferentially follow these different pathways. And so what's really cool about

439
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,840
coherence is that it's very dynamic, it's very transient. And so this really

440
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,760
contributes to cognitive flexibility, right? So if I had information come into

441
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,120
my brain, and it always went down the same pathways every single time, this

442
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,840
would limit my flexibility to dynamically interact with my environment. And

443
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:00,880
actually, we want our attention to route information in this pathway versus

444
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,560
another pathway. And so when you want to pay attention to one quality, but not

445
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,960
another, you'll see that those regions processing the qualities that you're

446
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,920
paying attention to will become coherent with each other. And the ones that you

447
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,720
don't want information to go to will kind of not have that strengthened

448
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,680
coherence together. And so there's this really fascinating phenomena in the

449
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:29,320
brain where so much of our processing is linked to very interesting, distinct

450
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:34,120
rhythms, and probably the most pronounced in human cognition is what's

451
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,880
called the theta rhythm. This is about five times to eight times per second,

452
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,240
kind of five to eight range. And the theta rhythm is found in so much of our

453
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,840
behavior and in a lot of our information coming into our brains and in a very

454
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:57,240
special brain nuclei called the hippocampus. And so when I am speaking to

455
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,040
you right now, the words that I am saying to you are actually entering your

456
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:09,920
ears at a rhythm of the theta rhythm. And shockingly, this theta rhythm is

457
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,840
found across many different cultures and languages. Doesn't matter what

458
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:19,680
country you're born in, what language or ancestry you have, all languages that

459
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,480
we've been able to find have a very pronounced eight Hertz to five Hertz

460
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,360
theta rhythm in the speech envelope that gets transmitted. So cross culturally,

461
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,760
people are talking to each other at the exact same rate, and it seems to have

462
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,520
maybe an evolutionary and a biological basis, right? So if your brain and your

463
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,160
hippocampus, this memory storage episodic memory construction region in the

464
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,400
brain, it is vibrating in the theta rhythm. And so when you're giving people

465
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,920
words and language, you want it to resonate into their episodic memories and

466
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,280
you want it to be constructed into present new memories, but you also wanted

467
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:11,040
to access old memories. In addition, your eyes are moving at roughly a theta

468
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,640
rhythm. Even when you fixate on a single fixed point, your eye is actually

469
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:23,240
twitching around in what's called micro saccades, small eye movements. Those

470
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,000
micro saccades and those macro saccades as you look around a room and explore a

471
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,960
new environment are all locked to the theta rhythm, right? So you have

472
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:40,760
audition, theta, vision, theta, major memory storage in theta. And so all of

473
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,440
these different regions in the brain are processing different information, but

474
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,680
they're transmitting that information to each other in the theta rhythm. And

475
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,280
there was this really cool paper by the Hanselmeyer lab that that actually

476
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,680
presented people with snippets of audio and flashes of video. And when those

477
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,680
snippets and flashes were presented in theta rhythm, coherently, you were

478
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:13,720
actually able to assemble an episodic memory for those audio visual parents.

479
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,200
And when they looked in the brain, they found electrical activity rhythmically

480
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,320
vibrating in theta frequency in visual cortex and in audio cortex. And there

481
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:27,520
was increased coherence when you were forming a memory and when you were

482
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,640
successfully sort of pairing that information together. And so coherence

483
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:39,640
is a way that this audio nuclei, this visual nuclei are sharing information

484
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,240
dynamically, routing it over to the hippocampus, routing it up to higher

485
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,560
order regions that need to process some information. And so coherence seems to

486
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,640
be this really fundamental role for how information is routed throughout the

487
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,880
brain. So what might this feel like? And so I think there's this idea that, you

488
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,120
know, hey, we're just routing information around. And so it's kind of just like

489
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:09,960
switchboards or circuit breakers just pumping information here and there. But

490
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:16,720
I wonder and I speculate whether the experience of being an observer window

491
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,600
within a coherent transient functional network feels like a dialogue, feels

492
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:28,640
like a conversation, maybe even like a debate, and not necessarily just like

493
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,320
the direct one to one transmission of information, right? We go back to the

494
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,840
analogy of two individuals communicating. If you're an observer window and

495
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,200
you're at this macro scale, you have all this neural information processing,

496
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,640
protein information processing, all these scales beneath you working to

497
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,840
generate all this information. Does this macro scale electrical activity that we

498
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,680
can measure for this nuclei? Is it like the equivalent of like a fully fledged

499
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,480
personality? And here, you know, there's a couple movies like that movie inside out

500
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,680
by Pixar, which sort of depicts these different personalities communicating

501
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,640
with each other in the brain. Is coherence more like a dialogue than just,

502
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,520
you know, sending a signal through a wire or like a carrier pigeon from one

503
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,040
place to another. Instead, it's a dynamic interplay or conversation between a

504
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,240
bunch of personalities. And so there's this guy, Richard Schwartz, who he was

505
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,240
studying, he was doing family therapy where he would take a dysfunctional

506
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,680
family and they'd go through a psychotherapeutic process where they'd

507
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,200
communicate and they'd look at different family roles that different people were

508
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,880
playing. And he found that psychologically, this psychotherapy that he was

509
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,800
using actually works well in an individual. An individual has an internal family

510
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,440
system, as he calls it, a bunch of personalities coexisting within your

511
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,280
mind and within your psyche. And these different personalities can be

512
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,840
dysfunctional. The conversation could not be going well. There could be

513
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:12,120
dysfunction in the family or there could be a coherent family unit where the

514
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,640
personalities are flowing and communicating effectively with each

515
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:22,600
other. Is coherence some signature or some direct neural mechanism for how

516
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,680
these different personalities in your brain communicate with each other? It's

517
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:32,440
not a carrier pigeon. It's a dynamic, interesting conversation between sub

518
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:40,600
entities within you. So being a observer window and undergoing coherence might

519
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:46,800
feel like more of a conversation than just shooting signals through wires.

520
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,800
Third and final principle is cross frequency coupling. And oh my God, I

521
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,160
love this principle. It is so exciting. So much of my own personal research has

522
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,160
been moving towards looking at cross frequency coupling, because it's really

523
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,720
this fascinating way that you can study multiple spatial temporal scales

524
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,000
interacting with each other. And so the first discovery of cross frequency

525
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,800
coupling was in the hippocampus, the region I mentioned to you previously. And

526
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,640
what they found was that the brain nuclei of the hippocampus was undergoing

527
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,640
these big slow rhythmic theta oscillations. And meanwhile, high frequency

528
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,960
neurons were also activating and going through these action potentials. And

529
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,600
they were coding for different regions in space. So there's a rat running

530
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:42,880
around a maze. And there's different cells called place cells that fire for

531
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,040
different locations along the maze. And they found that within the theta rhythm,

532
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:52,480
a sequence of these place cells were firing off. And as the place cells were

533
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,200
activating, they were all locked to a particular phase within the theta

534
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,200
oscillation. So every time the theta oscillation like went up, you get a bunch

535
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,840
of place cells activating, and then it goes down and there's silence. And then

536
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,240
it goes back up and a bunch of activations and it goes down and there's

537
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,000
silence, right? And so this is called phase amplitude coupling, it's a form of

538
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,040
cross frequency coupling, where the phase of the slow frequency oscillation is

539
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:25,240
related to the amplitude of the higher frequency oscillation, right? And so

540
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:32,080
research shows that you can actually decode trajectories of movement from

541
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:37,280
these theta oscillations in the hippocampus. And when you go down to the

542
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,920
neural level, you just see a cell fires for this place, a cell fires for that

543
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,160
place. But from the electric fields of the hippocampus, you could figure out a

544
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:52,160
trajectory of motion, right? And so it's it's basically forming some form of

545
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,520
abstraction, right? It's sequencing, it's organizing, it's it's basically

546
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:04,960
ordering the lower level information into this just stalled more abstract

547
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:11,080
representation. So it's not just like binding a more complex representation

548
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,320
like we talked about with synchrony, but it's really this form of abstraction.

549
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,320
You're building a more abstract representation from more concrete

550
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:26,800
information, right? Trajectory is more abstract than just a point. So here you

551
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,920
have like a vector and maybe a speed. But below it, you just have a single point

552
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:37,560
in in space and maybe in time. And so we can find a lot of evidence that when

553
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,600
you're doing these higher order cognitive tasks, right? When you're

554
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:48,120
undergoing some mental function, which requires abstract knowledge, you'll

555
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,320
find this phase amplitude coupling pattern, this cross frequency coupling

556
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:59,760
pattern, where you see these big slow rhythmic brain nuclei coupled to these

557
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,280
faster rhythms. And the the real canonical one is called theta gamma

558
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,440
coupling. And this was the example in the hippocampus that I mentioned. And you

559
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,360
find theta gamma coupling whenever you need to generate more abstract

560
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,600
representations, or you need to build more abstract items from more concrete

561
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:26,520
items. And so this seems to be sort of a universally applied mechanism in the

562
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:30,880
brain. And it's gaining a lot of traction. And we're finding more and more

563
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,880
evidence that this is taking place. Newer rhythm, which I've been sort of

564
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,320
pioneering and getting really interested in, is called delta beta

565
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:44,960
coupling. And this is the idea of similar to the to the building of abstract

566
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,280
ideas or representations. Delta beta coupling has been much more strongly

567
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:56,920
linked to action initiation and decision making and action planning. So in a way,

568
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:02,360
it's sort of like the top down equivalent to the theta gamma rhythm, where

569
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:08,160
you see these big slow prefrontal decision making regions oscillating when

570
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,080
you're trying to choose between a couple of different options. And then this

571
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,560
really fast beta rhythm, which is linked to spinal cord activation and muscle

572
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:22,080
innervation muscle activation. There's this coupling between this big slow

573
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:27,240
decision making process, and then the spinal cord bodily movements that get

574
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:32,800
enacted. And so just like cross frequency coupling sort of has this bottom up flow

575
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,240
of information as you're building more abstract representations moving up the

576
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,720
nested observer window hierarchy. There might be other frequency bands that are

577
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,720
really dedicated to taking the information from the tire order more

578
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,240
abstract regions, big slow observer windows down into the details where we

579
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:56,280
got to translate all these big abstract action plans into move that muscle, move

580
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:03,000
this muscle, you know, do this complex piano play with your fingers. But it

581
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,360
comes from these big abstract cartoony decisions that are being made. So what

582
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:13,120
does this feel like? Well, I think this one has a very clear experiential

583
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:17,440
analogy, right? The idea is, and I mentioned this earlier in the episode,

584
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,360
ideas popping into your head. This is the theta gamma experience. An idea shows

585
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:29,440
up, and it's in your mind, and it's fully formed to subtract delta beta. I

586
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,600
want to move my arm over here. I'm not thinking about I'm gonna use my flexor

587
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,160
extensor, and I'm going to use my elbow to do this thing, right? It's all just

588
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,040
this fluid motion that occurs. And I have very abstract ideas of what is

589
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,080
actually happening. And somehow it gets translated. I mean, you can barely think

590
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:51,560
about what you're doing, and you'll go and do it, right? A good analogy is with

591
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:57,440
professional sports, professional musicians, right? They they learn these

592
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,120
complex motor movements, but then it gets encoded into lower levels. And then

593
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,520
they're just activating cartoons, right? There's just these cartoonified

594
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:12,960
decisions being performed. And then and then it occurs. And I think another

595
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:19,800
cool analogy related to this is that cross frequency coupling is limited,

596
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:24,520
right? It's a weak form of coupling. You can only influence one level beneath

597
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,840
you, one level above you, you can't get much deeper than that, right? So you hit

598
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:34,800
a wall, and you can't go deeper. What does that feel like? I think a good

599
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,680
example is optical illusions, right? These undulating visual patterns that

600
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:47,400
come from black and white checkered visual effects. And so we know it's not

601
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,680
real, we know that there's nothing actually undulating. However, we can't

602
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,200
stop ourselves from seeing it. You don't have control over it, it's just coming

603
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:01,680
up. So we don't have like ultimate perceptual control over what our eyes

604
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,080
are doing, you know, we're only influencing one level beneath ourselves.

605
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,760
There are weird examples like with the Necker cube. It's a cube that you can

606
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,360
view from two different perspectives. And in that example, people are able to

607
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,040
flip between these different ways of viewing it. Is it popping out of the

608
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,800
screen? Is it sinking into the screen? And you can actually flip that at will.

609
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:30,600
But it's challenging. It's hard to flip the Necker cube for some people. Other

610
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,760
people find it easier. So what makes the difference between people that have an

611
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,920
easy time flipping the Necker cube and others that don't, you know? So I think

612
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:44,640
there's like, emphasizing this, you're the volitional agent at this higher level

613
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,240
trying to have top down influence on these lower levels. And sometimes you

614
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:54,000
struggle to have the influence that you want to have. Other times it takes the

615
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:02,040
form of cartoonified abstraction, right? And yet it makes its way down. But

616
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:06,520
you're only operating at a very higher level. All right, quick note on

617
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,000
fractals, and then we'll hop into the quantum computer question at the end.

618
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:17,040
So when we measure electrical activity in the brain, if this was all real, then

619
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,080
we'd want to see this sort of scale free observer windows at all these different

620
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,040
levels, cross frequency coupling going down this hierarchy, all this interesting

621
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,360
resonance structure. And what we do find is that the background noise of the

622
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:38,760
brain has this one over F power distribution, and it's called pink noise.

623
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:45,640
White noise is like equal noise at all frequency bands. Pink noise is shifted

624
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:51,280
towards the lower frequency end. So lower frequencies have more noise and

625
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,280
higher frequencies have less noise. This sounds like the ocean. You can look up

626
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,840
pink noise and listen to it for yourself. But it sounds a lot more like the

627
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,640
ocean, whereas white noise sounds like static. And the pink noise is a little

628
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:10,440
more soothing than this pure static. So when we measure the brain, we see pink

629
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:16,360
noise, we hear the ocean in the electrical activity of our brains. And what

630
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:22,800
this implies is that these big low frequency rhythms have a bit more of an

631
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:29,040
influence over the overall signal in our in our brains and in our bodies. And

632
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,280
this is what we would want to see if there was a scale free fractal like

633
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:41,520
organization to the activity in our bodies. And so there's a lesser known

634
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:48,560
principle in fractal mathematics called the Hearst exponent. So if you take the

635
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:54,240
Mandelbrot set, you kind of have this like Buddha looking figure at at once

636
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,080
one view of the Mandelbrot set. And as you zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,

637
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:03,040
zoom, you keep zooming, you see all these crazy patterns, crazy, crazy, crazy

638
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,520
patterns. Boom, you see the Buddha shape again, once you get deep enough into the

639
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,160
Mandelbrot. Keep zooming, keep zooming, keep zooming, boom, there it is again.

640
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:18,880
There is a certain rate at which you will zoom and then you see the original

641
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:25,800
pattern that you started off with, right? And so there's a rate of zoom until you

642
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:31,720
hit an interesting pattern. And so what we're using or what we're sort of

643
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:38,800
speculating is that observer windows are kind of like fractals in that they have

644
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:45,480
a certain depth that you have to zoom before you see more observer windows. We

645
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,200
have observer windows, they're neurons, let's say, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,

646
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,440
zoom, zoom, zoom, nothing, no observers, no observer windows, bam, proteins, these

647
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,880
are observer windows. Keep zooming, more time passes, more observer windows,

648
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,560
right? Zoom out from the neuron, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, bam, brain

649
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:10,520
nuclei. So the idea is that observer windows are not arbitrary, they're not

650
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:16,760
anywhere, there are clear boundaries on what can be an observer window and where

651
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:22,600
you find the observer windows. They're not infinitely spread like at all, at all

652
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:28,840
levels, but there's some sort of ratio or some sort of mathematical description

653
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:34,080
for when observer windows show up in your body and in your, in your brain. And

654
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:40,040
so a fun question here is how deep can we go? You know, is it turtles all the way

655
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:45,320
down, right? The, the classic example of the earth is flat, there's a turtle

656
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,680
holding it up, but who's holding up the turtle? Oh, another turtle, but who's

657
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,520
holding that turtle up? Oh, another turtle, oh, it must be turtles all the way

658
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:58,840
down, right? How deep does this observer window fractal go, right? Who knows,

659
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:03,080
maybe you hit Planck scale and that's the last observer window, you got these

660
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,800
Planck scale observer windows and everything's kind of built up out of

661
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:12,520
that level. If we zoom out, are there observer windows at larger, more

662
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:20,320
macroscopic, slower scales? Maybe, maybe biology is complex and biology needed to

663
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:24,600
be evolved. And so we are the largest observer windows on the planet. And

664
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:29,400
maybe we are giant observer windows relative to the rest of nature and

665
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,280
resting to the world around us, right? Maybe there are larger observer windows.

666
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,040
What would that look like? Very speculative, almost into the woo woo

667
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:44,720
range, but interesting and fun to think about. Okay, observer windows are

668
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,000
limited. They are difficult to create and they're defined by a high degree of

669
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,520
synchrony. How high is the synchrony requirement to be an observer window?

670
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,960
Well, you know, Jonathan Schuller and I are going to move forward publishing this

671
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:05,880
paper thinking about this, just very classical, sort of simpler terms, just

672
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,640
talking about electrical activity and coherence and synchrony is kind of a

673
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,680
matter of degree, you know, where coherence is weak coupling, synchrony is

674
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,920
strong coupling, but it needs to be strong enough that it forms that functional

675
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:24,920
unit, right? However, if you take a quantum computer, quantum consciousness,

676
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:32,920
take on all of this, what if synchrony was really quantum coherence? And here

677
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,560
the terminology gets very confusing because the word quantum coherence sounds

678
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:41,880
like the other word for coherence. But the idea here would be that really,

679
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:47,400
really strong coupling would be you form a single wave function, a bunch of

680
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,840
quantum bits, they're all entangled, they form a single quantum computer. And so

681
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:57,160
the observer window is a quantum computer. The high degree of synchrony that

682
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:03,200
you require is the ultimate level of synchrony. No environmental influence

683
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:09,880
whatsoever. Quantum mechanics has a definition where the superposition and

684
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:15,320
the entanglement effects reign supreme, they become dominant when there's no

685
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:20,840
environmental influence and it's like the state of ultimate synchrony, right? So

686
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:28,000
one way to recast the now model within the quantum consciousness paradigm is to

687
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,080
say that observer windows are quantum computers, right? There are quantum

688
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:37,880
computers, and there's quantum computers nested within quantum computers, and that

689
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:46,440
gets a little speculative and wild. But then these quantum computers set the

690
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:51,320
domain of what can be an observer window, and then all other forms of

691
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,320
compute quantum computers talking to each other is classical. Classical

692
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:59,880
communication has a phase lag, it has physical constraints on the communication.

693
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,120
And so coherence is classical communication between quantum computers.

694
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:11,840
Cross-requency coupling gets bizarre, but maybe it's some other form, yeah, of

695
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:17,960
classical communication, or maybe that is yet some third form of communication

696
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:22,960
that we don't really understand yet, right? Synchrony is quantum computation

697
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,800
fundamentally. Coherence is this digital classical, maybe forming a

698
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:35,320
digital computer network, and then that cross-requency coupling seems to defy

699
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,720
either of these forms. And I'll come back to this in our next episode, because

700
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:45,520
after this we're going to dive deeper into these notions of fractal computation,

701
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:51,480
and there's some fun ideas out there that I'd be remiss to not introduce you to.

702
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:58,000
So look forward to our next episode on fractal computation, and I'll leave you

703
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:05,720
to ponder tonight as you fall asleep. Are you a single conscious being? Are there

704
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:11,560
nested conscious beings within you? Are you a rich dialogue? Is your mind a

705
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:18,920
corporation of workers working with you for some common goal, which is your

706
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:23,360
life's mission, and this is a collaborative enterprise of conscious

707
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:30,040
beings nested within each other? Is that your reality, or are you a holistic

708
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:34,360
single individual, or are you a collection of physical processes and

709
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:39,120
chaotic influences? Alrighty, I'll talk to you again very soon.
