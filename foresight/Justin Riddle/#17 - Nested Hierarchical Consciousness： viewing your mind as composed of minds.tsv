0	4680	Welcome back to the show that tells you you are a quantum computer with free will
4680	10320	at the apex of a hierarchy of conscious beings. My name is Justin Riddle and this
10320	15880	is episode 17 of the quantum consciousness series. In today's episode
15880	20640	we'll be talking about nested hierarchical consciousness, the idea that
20640	25120	information processing is occurring at multiple different scales in your brain
25120	28920	and this information needs to be communicated up and down the hierarchy.
28920	34040	By the end of today's episode we'll ask the question, are you a conscious being
34040	37800	that's composed of conscious beings that's composed of conscious beings add
37800	43720	infinitum? This episode is available on YouTube and an audio-only version is

74320	79360	Hey there, my name is Justin Riddle, a little background on myself. I got a PhD
79360	85080	from UC Berkeley in psychology studying cognitive neuroscience. While at UC
85080	89560	Berkeley I taught a course on quantum consciousness for seven years and this
89560	95280	YouTube series is really a translation and extension of that material. Right now
95280	101400	I do research in humans and I deliver magnetic and electrical non-invasive
101400	105280	brain stimulation in order to get a better understanding of the role of
105320	110480	neural oscillations in cognition and how they become impaired in psychiatric
110480	118600	illness. So the topic for today is nested hierarchical consciousness and I'll be
118600	122800	talking about in particular this theory called the nested observer windows
122800	128840	model and this is a model that I developed in collaboration with Professor
128840	132440	Jonathan Schuehler who's at the University of California Santa Barbara
133160	136520	and we've been working on this model for many years now and at the time of this
136520	142720	recording we're currently in the process of submitting it for publication. So to
142720	148320	give you a big overview on what this model is and then speculating on some
148320	152200	of the implications for quantum consciousness and quantum computers in
152200	157000	general at the end we'll be running through the details of this model and
157000	160640	some of the evidence from cognitive neuroscience and some of just the
160760	166400	theoretical motivation for this model and this will really tie into the overall
166400	173760	story of this series but this one is a much more sort of based in the cognitive
173760	179560	neuroscience literature so I'll be doing a lot of talking about that. So here's
179560	184720	the pitch and I'm gonna start off by reading a quote from William James and
185400	192640	William James is really one of the like foundational philosophers, researchers
192640	198000	doing a lot of introspection in the early days of the field of psychology and
198000	204720	so the quote goes like this, we know what it is to get out of bed on a freezing
204720	209280	morning in a room without a fire and how the very vital principle within us
209280	213760	protests against the ordeal. Probably most persons have lain on certain
213760	219160	mornings for an hour at a time, unable to brace themselves to the resolve. We
219160	223480	think how late we shall be, how the duties of the day will suffer, we say I
223480	228800	must get up, this is ignominous, etc. But still the warm couch feels too
228800	234920	delicious, the cold outside too cruel, and resolution faints away and postpones
234920	239160	itself again and again just as it seemed on the verge of bursting the
239160	243960	resistance and passing over into the decisive act. Now how do we ever get up
243960	249120	under such circumstances? If I may generalize from my own experience, we more
249120	254120	often than not get up without any struggle or decision at all. We suddenly
254120	259760	find that we have got up, a fortunate lapse of consciousness occurs, we forget
259760	264640	both the warmth and the cold. We fall into some reverie connected with the
264640	270640	day's life, in the course of which the idea flashes across us, holo, I must
270640	274960	lie here no longer, an idea which at that lucky instant awakens no
274960	280320	contradictory or paralyzing suggestion and consequently produces immediately
280320	285680	its appropriate motor effects. It was our acute consciousness of both the warmth
285680	289800	and the cold during the period of struggle which paralyzed our activity
289800	296800	then and kept our idea of rising in the condition of wish and not of will. The
296800	302480	moment these inhibitory ideas ceased, the original idea exerted its effects.
302480	308040	William James, Principles of Psychology, Volume 2. So what's so fascinating about
308040	313440	this is I think it violates a few different sort of intuitions that we
313440	319120	have about our own experience being a human being. And one of those is this
319120	324560	idea that we have this narrator in our mind. And so we've kind of been told and
324560	329080	we kind of take it at face value that there is this narrative flow to our
329080	334600	minds and that we're sort of witnessing this unfolding of events. We have some
334600	339360	free will, some ability to change that unfolding of events, but we view it as a
339360	346200	single narrative self inside of us. And what this really challenges us to think
346200	352520	about is how when we decide to do things we are sometimes met with internal
352520	359520	resistance. And what is it when you have a conflicting set of ideas in your mind?
359520	365360	I would argue, and the nested observer window model argues, that there's
365360	371240	actually this debate, this collaboration, this dialogue between many different
371240	377400	voices in your head. And it's not really just a single narrative self, but so
377400	382320	much of our inner life of our cognition is really characterized by inner
382320	386080	conflict. Should I do this? Should I do that? That might be fun, but am I wasting
386080	390520	my time? You know, there's all this debate, this internal struggle that we
390520	398320	experience, which is really core and inherent to our lives. Another sort
398360	403880	of intuition that we have that the nested observer window or now model sort of
403880	409840	goes against is this idea that we have sort of a possessive or a feeling of
409840	415640	ownership over our thoughts. We think I created this thought, I am the creative
415640	422680	owner of my thoughts. I am generating and sort of assembling things together in my
422680	428240	mind. And while a lot of times there are periods where we're actively thinking
428240	434000	about something, and we really are assembling these big macro abstract
434000	440240	ideas together, and we're forming new solutions or new concepts out of sort of
440240	447720	more basic concepts. And all of that is going on at this very abstract level. But
447720	454760	in addition, we get many ideas that just pop into our mind. And we sometimes don't
454760	459280	even want ownership of our ideas. Sometimes an idea pops into your head and
459280	463640	you wonder, why did I think that? Where did that come from? And sometimes you even
463640	468280	suppress the unwanted thought, or you're kind of in awe, like where did this
468280	474920	thought come from? And so in the now model, we propose that thoughts do sort of
474920	480520	emerge into your mind fully formed. And even when you are assembling thoughts
480520	485640	together, you're doing so at such an abstract level, that there's so much
485640	491040	built into those concepts already. And even the basic concepts which are there
491040	496880	for you to assemble already have this sort of coming out of nowhere popping
496880	501920	into existence feeling to them, where there's so much that is entailed in
501920	508440	those in those basic concepts, even in the act of assembling. And then the sort
508440	512880	of another or like the final violation of intuition that I'll provide right now,
512880	517840	and there'll be more throughout throughout this episode, is the idea that we have a
517840	525960	limited interface with our own bodies, right? And so the idea is when I decide
525960	533800	I'm gonna move around in the world, that decision to move can sometimes be met
533800	539000	with resistance, or the movement itself might not come out like how I thought it
539000	542520	was gonna come out. Maybe I say, oh, I'm gonna walk over there and then I trip and
542520	547920	fall, you know, face first into the floor. That was not the plan, right? So we are
547920	556120	enacting very abstract action plans into our body. And we're not aware of the fine
556120	561280	motor movements, all the detailed muscle activation that needs to occur. And so
561280	565680	we're really operating at these very high abstract levels. And so there's
565680	571120	limited influence that we even have over our bodies. And another interesting way
571120	574120	of thinking about this is, you know, you can consciously pay attention to
574120	577960	breathing. But when you're not paying attention, you're still breathing. You
577960	582960	know, it's one of those weird flexible acts where you can simultaneously take it
582960	588520	under volitional control, or just let it go on unconsciously. So the argument is
588520	592760	that, you know, you're at the top of this hierarchy of conscious beings, and you
592760	599600	have limited influence on the lower levels beneath you. So that's sort of
599600	604520	from an experiential sense why the now model is sort of challenging the status
604520	610560	quo of how we think about ourselves. From a practical sense, when we do
610560	615760	science, we're trying to understand for the most part the human condition. What
615760	621160	is it like to be a mind? Who am I? What's going on? And of course, there's more
621160	624600	like medical applications or technological applications, but in the
624600	628960	field of psychology, we're trying to understand fundamentally, you know, who
628960	634440	we are. And so in that field, there's many different researchers studying the
634440	643320	phenomenon of the human mind. But some people study fMRI, EEG, these really
643360	649440	macro scale entire regions, activating the blood flow to different regions in
649440	655000	the brain with fMRI. These are macroscopic large regions. With EEG, we're
655000	660160	studying these big electric fields that emerge from the brain and relating
660160	666520	those to cognition. But then people also study neurons, and neurons are
666520	672120	operating at the scale of a thousand times per second, right? So while fMRI, EEG
672120	677000	is happening on the scale of seconds or sub seconds, you know, a small fraction
677000	681800	of a second, but maybe just like one tenth of a second, neurons are
681800	688400	activating at scales at the kilohertz range, like 1000 times per second. And
688400	692920	then beneath that, there's proteins, and there's synaptic interactions or
692920	697720	protein pathways that are that are, you know, processing information in their
697760	704160	own ways. And those are happening another order of magnitude faster, let's say
704160	709880	like the megahertz or even gigahertz range, right? A million times per second or
709880	713600	sometimes even a billion times per second. So there's all these different
713600	717680	scales, and you'll find people that are neuroscientists and they're interested
717680	723000	in the human mind. But they'll study the human mind at so many different scales.
723320	728040	And the question is, you know, we can find some relationship or correlation of
728040	733480	these fMRI and EEG signals to our minds. We find a correlation of neural activity
733480	739640	to our perceptions and our actions. And with proteins, once again, the presence
739640	744440	of a protein or not, or, you know, when light comes into the eyeball, it activates
744440	748840	a protein cascade, and that correlates with the detection of light. So that
748840	752600	also relates to our experience. And so the question is, how are all these
752640	757720	different processes happening at multiple different scales? And the nested
757720	763920	observer window model proposes a unique solution where you can view all of these
763920	769520	different levels as meaningfully processing information, and also sharing
769520	774720	that information up and down across these very different spatial temporal scales,
774720	780520	right? So we have centimeters and seconds, we have millimeters and kilohertz,
780520	786520	and then we have micrometers or even angstroms in the range of megahertz and
786520	791640	gigahertz, right? And so all of these processes seem to be contributing to
791640	797720	our experience. But how do we study these? How do we make sense of these? And it
797720	801520	would be really cool if you could have more interdisciplinary study where
801520	805520	people studying neurons could talk directly with like people using fMRI,
805560	811200	right? It would be cool to have ways in which in a principled manner, the
811200	814880	information or the content being created at these different scales is being
814880	820760	communicated to each other. So that's a lot of the big picture motivation for
820760	825280	the now model. So now I'm going to propose what is the now model
825280	832040	fundamentally. So the now model fundamentally is a way of defining
832480	838800	information integration units, and we call them observer windows. And an
838800	844800	observer window is at a certain spatial temporal scale, and it's integrating
844800	849760	information, and it has sort of a rhythmic processing to that information
849760	855000	integration, which is sort of the time scale, the integration rate at which it
855000	861000	operates. And then within that scale, you have a bunch of observer windows
861000	866200	communicating with each other at the same level. And then you also have
866200	871000	observer windows nested within each other, so that each observer window is
871000	876000	composed of observer windows, and then information is processed up and down
876600	882320	these different scales. And so we propose sort of a unique way of
882320	888600	information integration, which we call mosaic integration. And the idea here is
888600	895640	that we're really leveraging the nested nature of this system. And the metaphor
895640	901920	for what this looks like and the details will need to be hashed out by some
901920	908160	computational model, I would assume. But the idea is that this feels like a
908160	913560	mosaic image, where you can think of an image that's made up of a bunch of
913560	920280	tiles, and each of those tiles is itself an image. But when you're at the level
920280	925560	of a full image composed of tiles, you know, a single gestalt comes out, a
925560	930800	single representation, a single image appears. But then you can zoom into
930800	936160	these tiles, and you'll find that each tile has an image. And that tile is
936160	943360	composed of more tiles. And you can zoom in infinitely, or maybe there's
943360	949440	some limitation on how much you could zoom. But this this form of mosaic
949440	954680	integration is the way that you're able to assemble and build more abstract
954680	959800	representations. And a cool property of this form of integration would be that
959800	965120	you're sort of preserving a lot of the rich detail as you move up to the
965120	969840	higher and higher levels in the hierarchy. Alright, so we have these
969840	974000	observer windows, they have a fixed boundary, a fixed spatial and fixed
974000	979200	temporal boundary on where they are and what they are. And they're integrating
979200	983960	information from their environment. And they're also nested within other
983960	989600	observer windows and processing information up and down this hierarchy.
990040	994040	And so there's a few implications. And so first, I'm going to talk about the
994040	998000	implications for consciousness, where does consciousness fit into this? And then
998040	1004280	I'll go into the the details of what this information integration might look
1004280	1009400	like, and the phenomenon coming out of cognitive neuroscience that that
1009400	1015080	motivates thinking about this model. And then I'll end talking about how
1015080	1021120	quantum mechanics might play a role in particular in one of these principles
1021120	1024920	that I'm going to talk about in a second here. So the question is, where does
1024920	1030400	consciousness come in? And so one idea is that consciousness is just at the top
1030400	1038040	level, that you have this hierarchy of observer windows, and you, the viewer are
1038040	1043920	the highest level, you are the one observer window at the top of the
1043920	1049360	hierarchy. And there's all these sort of autonomous observer windows at lower
1049360	1053560	levels or semi autonomous observer windows integrating information. But all
1053560	1057480	of those are just worker bees. And you are the only one that's a conscious
1057480	1062280	being and you're the only one that really has the the qualia, the feeling of
1062280	1069040	being a self. And all these lower levels are, yeah, just unconscious, subconscious,
1069040	1074000	pre conscious, proto conscious, whatever, you know, fun prefix you want to fit
1074000	1080440	onto conscious. And this really feels a lot like the global workspace model, or
1081400	1086480	these sort of emergentist views of consciousness, where you try to describe,
1086480	1090760	you know, at the level of the whole brain, there's some sort of emergent
1090760	1094880	property or some sort of being that comes out at this highest level. An
1094880	1099480	alternative way of putting consciousness into the now model is that there's some
1099480	1107120	sort of threshold for information complexity, or for the integration of
1107120	1112880	information to be occurring. There's some threshold for what that looks like. And
1112880	1118840	then only once you breach that threshold, do you have a conscious being. So here
1118840	1124920	there would be some level in the brain or in the body, where you have a conscious
1124920	1130200	being. And above that level are conscious beings nested within each other. But
1130200	1138600	beneath that level, it's automaton, right, it's non conscious, just processors. The
1138600	1146080	third and final option is sort of a form of pan psychism, pan, pan, meaning all, and
1146080	1150520	psychism being, you know, a root of consciousness. So pan psychism, everything
1150520	1154920	is conscious. And now in the now model, we assert that, you know, not everything
1154960	1161240	can arbitrarily be called a consciousness. But in the now model, the observer
1161240	1171440	windows have a biological infrastructure, a boundary that limits what could be a
1171440	1176760	conscious being. But you're at the top of the hierarchy, and there's conscious
1176760	1182800	beings nested beneath you. And it goes down and down and down. And all of those
1182800	1190800	are conscious beings at various smaller and smaller levels. So not quite sure
1190800	1195600	what the correct answer is. I personally really love this pan psychist model where
1195600	1200360	all these levels are conscious beings. And we'll come back to this idea a bit
1200360	1204440	later. But it really does kind of blow your mind. And so maybe I'm just drawn to
1204440	1209800	it because it is such a mind blowing reality shifting type of way of viewing
1209800	1215040	yourself as being composed genuinely of conscious beings. You're running the show,
1215080	1221280	maybe mostly. You're at the top, probably, but there's still conscious beings
1221280	1228920	beneath you. And you're sort of the CEO of this corporation of conscious beings
1228920	1236760	directing what to do. But all of these entities underneath you still have a say
1236760	1243840	they have an input on what gets carried out eventually. And all of your
1243840	1249320	reality and perception is being filtered through these lower levels. And you're
1249320	1255400	making decisions at this very abstract higher level. So it's still sort of an
1255400	1260120	integrated interplay between all these different levels of conscious beings.
1261040	1267640	Alright, so now I'm going to dive into the three principles of the now model. And
1267640	1275880	they are synchrony. This is a zero phase lag high degree of correlation between a
1275880	1281640	bunch of components. And this forms the integration unit forms the observer
1281640	1289840	window. It is difficult to achieve a zero phase lag entirely correlated system
1289840	1296200	with high synchrony. Everything is so coupled together that it loses individuality
1296200	1301200	and it becomes a single entity, right? That is synchrony, the formation of an
1301200	1309280	observer window. The second principle is coherence. And coherence is a non zero
1309280	1314960	phase lag coupling between two observer windows. And this is two observer windows
1314960	1319320	at the same spatial temporal level. So they're both processing information. They
1319320	1324040	both have their own integration rates, you know, of how they're processing
1324040	1330320	information. But they can communicate with each other. And it's a weak transient
1330320	1335520	communication, they form these functional networks of observer windows
1335520	1342320	communicating with each other. But it's inherently unstable and transient. And you
1342320	1345720	don't lose the individuality of the of the two observer windows that are
1345720	1353120	coherent. And then the final and third principle is cross frequency coupling. And
1353120	1358040	this is once again a weak form of coupling between two observer windows. Except
1358040	1361440	the catch here is that the observer windows are at different spatial temporal
1361440	1367320	scales. So you have big, slow, rhythmically integrating observer windows. And
1367320	1371960	these much smaller, faster observer windows integrating information. And
1371960	1376640	they're coupled to each other. And once again, the coupling is more weak. And it
1376640	1380920	happens between observer windows nested within other higher level observer
1380920	1385440	windows. And this is really sort of the critical way in which information is
1385440	1392040	transferred up and down a hierarchy, right up and down this this nested
1392040	1399360	observer window hierarchy. And so we propose that electrical activity really
1399360	1406640	serves as the lingua franca or the, you know, universal generalizable principle at
1406640	1415040	play here. And so I'll talk to you today about brain regions or brain nuclei and
1415040	1420000	neurons. And we, you know, speculate that proteins are also observer windows and
1420000	1424400	potentially there's higher or lower observer windows also at play here, but
1424400	1429880	we'll really focus on brain nuclei and neurons. And we'll be talking about
1429880	1435680	electrical activity as really this universal form of communication, where
1435680	1440640	even though they're comprised of very different material, and they're, you know,
1440640	1447720	operating at very different scales, if information integration can occur, using a
1447720	1452320	common substrate, even though it's at different levels, this sort of
1452320	1456920	facilitates that communication of information. And we believe that this is a
1456920	1462920	plausible solution for the protein scale, maybe some intermediary scales and
1462920	1468440	potentially at even more fundamental lower scales, that electricity or
1468440	1476120	electromagnetism could be a very fundamental sort of substrate for
1476120	1481160	processing this information. And it's very apparent that electrical activity
1481160	1486240	plays a fundamental role in the level of neurons in brain nuclei, which we'll
1486240	1489840	talk about as examples. So I'm going to start off with our first principle,
1489840	1496720	synchrony. And synchrony is the formation of an observer window. And so a funny
1496720	1501840	example or analogy here is if you see a bunch of lights attached to the limbs of
1501840	1505880	a human, and they're walking through the night, so all you can see are those lights,
1506280	1512520	you'll witness the movement of a human. But if the human stands still, you just
1512520	1519240	see a smattering of lights and there's no human form available. And so when we're
1519240	1524680	studying the processing of information, we do really need to focus on that
1524680	1533280	process, you know, the movement through time of these biological systems. And
1533280	1538320	what's beautiful about synchrony is synchrony is really the creation and the
1538320	1544400	formation of a single unit. And so I feel like this is almost like, like it's
1544400	1548160	almost like a nuance that you accept, but you don't even realize that you've
1548160	1555840	already accepted this, is that you call things by their name, you call something
1556080	1561720	a thing. And in calling something a thing, you're inferring that that thing has a
1561720	1567280	strong degree of structural and temporal stability. And so synchrony is really
1567280	1573920	just putting a definition and a label on what that definition of a thing is, you
1573920	1580120	know. And so a good example is like a protein, we just call it a protein, but
1580120	1584440	really there's such a high degree of synchronization within the protein that
1584440	1591720	it acts as a single protein, right? neurons act as single cells. And brain
1591720	1596160	nuclei act as single brain nuclei. And so how do they do that? Well, just go
1596160	1601640	through the neuron and nuclei example. But neurons have this phospholipid
1601640	1608040	bilayer membrane, it acts as a capacitor for the neuron. And so it stores up this
1608040	1613640	strong electrical potential inside of the neuron. And you reach a point where the
1613640	1620720	neuron has such strong electrical coupling in its, you know, internally, that it
1620720	1626760	behaves as if it's a single electrical functional unit. Similarly, a brain
1626760	1632320	nuclei exhibits these synchronized electrical states, where the entire
1632320	1638000	nuclei will undergo this single electrical potential. And you can witness
1638000	1643480	these electrically vibrating fluctuations in the nuclei that you're
1643480	1648160	observing. And they have these characteristic electrical rhythms that
1648160	1654040	they exhibit. And these are enabled by a lot of structural properties in the
1654040	1659200	neuron, or in the architecture of the neurons. Typically, it's called a
1659200	1663840	phaptic coupling. Essentially, this is when a bunch of neurons are oriented
1663840	1669040	together, and they undergo their own electrical potentials or action
1669040	1674960	potentials or firing, as people usually call it. And a lot of these neurons are
1674960	1680520	oriented so that the electric fields generated within the neurons are then
1680520	1686120	propagated across a whole population. And so what you see in the wild is you see
1686120	1691400	a brain nuclei will exhibit these big electric fluctuations that are
1691400	1697240	basically enabled by all of these parallel fibers in these brain nuclei. And
1697240	1702000	then they start to serve a functional role and it begins to act as a single
1702000	1707160	functional unit, similar to these neurons behaving as single functional units. And
1707160	1712600	so what's really cool is that if you are measuring the electrical potential in
1712600	1719320	the brain, and let's say we're focusing on this slower frequency range where you
1719320	1725440	would see brain nuclei operating, you'll have this background activity in your
1725440	1731560	electrical recording. And when you found a brain nuclei that's forming
1731560	1736760	some functional area, some functional unit, you'll see this bump, this rhythmic
1736760	1741480	oscillation emerging from just the background noise of your recording. And
1741480	1747520	you can be fairly certain that when you see these electrical bumps in your
1747520	1751280	recording, after running a four-year transform and breaking it down into the
1751280	1755880	frequency domain, you can be sure that there's some sort of brain nuclei
1755880	1761680	processing information at this certain scale. And so the brain nuclei have
1761680	1768240	clearly defined boundaries, and they have a very clearly defined rhythm at which
1768240	1775480	they are operating. So what does synchrony mean practically or to cognition? And
1775520	1781720	so this was an idea proposed by Wolfgang Singer called Binding Biosynchrony. And
1781720	1788240	here we're using this exact concept in the now model. And the idea is that there's
1788240	1793480	this difficult challenge in psychology called the binding problem. I have a
1793480	1797440	gestalt representation of let's say a chair. I know what it looks like, I know
1797440	1801160	what it feels like, I know how to use it, I know what the texture is like, I know
1801160	1806080	what the color is like, how do I have this single representation of a chair? How
1806080	1810880	does all this information get bound together? And so Wolfgang Singer proposed
1810880	1818120	that synchrony forms a natural sort of neural mechanism for how you can have
1818120	1822720	information coming from different sources, and then it gets bound together
1822720	1826600	through this synchrony. In the now model we propose that there is a
1826680	1832160	integration rate that the observer window opens, it accumulates a bunch of
1832160	1838160	information, and then it binds that information into a single gestalt
1838160	1844760	representation. And once you have formed it, it exists, and you experience it if
1844760	1850200	you are that observer window, and then the next cycle a new representation is
1850200	1854560	generated. And it could be that this is some predictive coding model where
1854560	1858640	there's sort of a model of the world that gets update periodically, and so
1858640	1863000	there's an update that kicks in, and so there's sort of a continuity or a
1863000	1867480	stability through time, or you could view this as sort of these like discrete
1867480	1874960	refreshes of information with no time between them, it's just now, now, now,
1874960	1879840	now, there's just an experience now, a gestalt experience now, and another
1879840	1883600	gestalt experience now, and there actually is no time between those
1883680	1887800	discrete moments. So it's sort of an alternative framing for what this might
1887800	1897040	feel like in our conscious experience. So an example I really love is called the
1897040	1902160	flicker fusion rate, and there was a, you know, this phenomenon has been
1902160	1906680	studied quite a bit, but there was a cognitive neuroscience study that came
1906680	1913080	out in the past 10 years or so that was really interesting and impactful by
1913080	1917520	connecting it to these electrical oscillations. So the idea is that if I
1917520	1923400	present two flashes of light, very quickly, you will see them as two
1923400	1929400	different flashes of light. But as the time between the flashes shrinks, you
1929400	1934800	hit a point where the two flashes are really just one flash now, right? And
1934800	1939320	so the flashes fuse, you have a flickering light, and then you have the
1939320	1944760	fusion into a single light. The exact moment where you flip over from two
1944760	1950000	flashes into a single flash is called the flicker fusion rate. That is the
1950000	1955520	rate at which the lights switch from flicker into fusion. And there was this
1955520	1960440	really cool study by Samaha and Postal, who were looking at the visual
1960440	1965320	cortex, and the visual cortex has, it is, it can be conceptualized as a brain
1965320	1971520	nuclei with a electrical fluctuation and electrical potential. And this one is
1971520	1976600	often called the alpha oscillation, and it happens to be around 10 hertz, 10
1976600	1981440	times per second. And what they found is that there's some variation between
1981440	1987480	people at what that integration rate or what that refresh rate is in visual
1987480	1994240	cortex. And so people who have a slightly faster alpha oscillation in visual
1994240	2000800	cortex, they can actually still perceive the flicker at a smaller and smaller
2000800	2005880	time scale. So it takes, you know, they have to be much closer for the flashes
2005880	2012800	to fuse. And the idea is that every alpha oscillation is opening a window,
2012800	2020240	taking in some information. But if you have a slower rhythm in the back of your
2020240	2025640	brain, in the visual cortex, then both of the flashes are going to end up in the
2025640	2029560	same window, and they're going to get integrated together into a fused single
2029560	2035400	flash. And so this really fits nicely with the now model, where these observer
2035400	2039800	windows have these integration rates. And this is predictive of the rhythmic
2039800	2045480	refresh of information in this observer window. And so now we're talking about
2045480	2050120	this rhythmic refresh rate of these gestalt perceptions in different brain
2050120	2056440	nuclei. What does this mean for you as a conscious being? What is this rhythmic
2056440	2062360	refresh rate? Well, we argue in the now model that this rhythmic refresh rate is
2062360	2069600	equivalent to your perception of time. And so the temporal processing of this
2069600	2074680	information has a fixed rate. If you're a brain nuclei, it'll be occurring around
2074680	2078920	the scale of 10 times per second, five times per second. But if you're a neuron,
2078960	2083400	it might be happening at 1000 times per second or 100 times per second, much,
2083400	2091440	much, much faster, right? And so what it is like to be that observer window is to
2091440	2099200	feel a flow of time at the rate at which your refreshes are occurring. And so
2099200	2105080	what's really fascinating is there's a few anomalous experiences in our
2105080	2109920	experience that relate to time perception. So when you're in a life
2109920	2114800	threatening situation, you're driving down the freeway, a truck changes lanes into
2114800	2120920	you and you are feeling like an impending doom, you will have the
2120920	2127200	experience of time slowing down. What's happening? Could it be that the observer
2127200	2133960	window that is you is increasing the integration rate, that frequency of
2133960	2140160	gestalt representation generation is increased, you're tapping into more
2140160	2145000	concrete, less abstract information, you have less time to integrate a bunch of
2145000	2148640	interesting information, you have less integration time, but you can get much
2148640	2155880	more refreshes, right? You can get more static frames of what is happening. And
2155880	2161040	so time is experienced as a dilation, where it feels like time is moving slow.
2161200	2166320	But really, you're having more experience per second because your observer
2166320	2172360	window has frequency shifted into the faster range. On the flip side, we can
2172360	2178920	have the opposite, where time folds inward and dissolves away and an hour
2178920	2183800	passes in an instant and we lose track of time and suddenly we look up from our
2183800	2188400	book or we pull out of our thoughts and 10 minutes have flown by and we're
2188400	2193080	shocked that all this time has disappeared. Where did it go? So we suggest
2193080	2199080	that in this example, your observer window is shifting the opposite direction,
2199080	2204640	right? It's shifting towards longer integration times. More information is
2204640	2209680	able to enter into this open window and gets bound into a gestalt representation,
2209680	2216400	which is a large abstract integration of a lot of interesting and creative
2216400	2221960	abstract ideas. So when you're daydreaming, when you're mind wandering, when
2221960	2229000	you're lost in thought, you might have a sort of stretching of your temporal
2229000	2234240	experience as the integration windows expand to get more and more information
2234240	2240400	into a single integration and your thoughts become more abstract and yet
2240680	2247720	time flies by because you have less moments of consciousness per second.
2247720	2254240	However, there's more information in this abstract quality in each of those
2254240	2258880	thoughts. So we're going to move on to the second principle of coherence and
2258880	2263880	coherence is really best understood by contrasting it with synchrony. So
2263880	2270000	synchrony, remember, is how we create an observer window. This is no easy feat.
2270280	2276240	You need a lot of biological infrastructure like a capaciting membrane or
2276240	2283320	all these fibers oriented to create high synchronization in the brain nuclei.
2283320	2290840	So synchrony is the creation of single entities with zero lag. Everything is
2290840	2295520	just one thing all of a sudden and we can form this equivalent of a conscious
2295520	2302280	being with the capacity to integrate information. Coherence is like a
2302280	2307560	conversation. So the analogy here is that coherence can be understood of as two
2307560	2311600	people having a conversation. One person talks, the other one listens, the other
2311600	2316920	person talks, the other person listens. And so there's a communication going on.
2316920	2323840	And the words need to be transmitted to the other person, right? There is a
2324240	2330480	non zero phase lag. There is a lag between the information going from one
2330480	2334920	person to the other. And when the information is received, it's integrated
2334920	2338280	in that observer window and then it, you know, some new information is sent
2338280	2344360	back, right? And so when two people are having a productive conversation, they
2344360	2349040	are coherent. If you were to track their audio waves, you would find that
2349040	2353640	they're sort of vibing together, but they're not happening at the same time,
2353640	2358080	right? It's not the same person speaking the same words simultaneously. Sometimes
2358080	2363400	that can arbitrarily happen, but it's more of a predictive thing, right? So
2363440	2368320	their communication has delay. And you wouldn't say, oh, that conversation is
2368320	2372160	going so well, they've just fused into the same person, right? There's still two
2372160	2377320	different people. The synchrony is the creation of the two separate people. And
2377320	2382000	the coherence is the communication between the different people, right? So in
2382000	2387600	practice, in biology, we see that when brain regions want to communicate with
2387600	2392880	each other, there's something called neuronal communication through neuronal
2392880	2398240	coherence. This is developed by Pascal Fries. And Pascal Fries proposed,
2398280	2402800	essentially what I just told you here, you have these rhythmically oscillating
2402800	2407360	different units. And when they want to transmit information to each other, they
2407400	2412760	will sort of align their oscillations so that one transmits some information, the
2412760	2416960	other one receives it, and the transmissions are sent back and forth,
2416960	2421920	right? And so if we look into the brain and we look at some complex cognitive
2421920	2425640	control tasks where multiple regions need to communicate with each other, you'll
2425640	2429520	see that they'll become coherent with each other. And that information will
2429520	2434320	preferentially follow these different pathways. And so what's really cool about
2434320	2439840	coherence is that it's very dynamic, it's very transient. And so this really
2439840	2444760	contributes to cognitive flexibility, right? So if I had information come into
2444760	2450120	my brain, and it always went down the same pathways every single time, this
2450120	2454840	would limit my flexibility to dynamically interact with my environment. And
2454840	2460880	actually, we want our attention to route information in this pathway versus
2460920	2464560	another pathway. And so when you want to pay attention to one quality, but not
2464560	2469960	another, you'll see that those regions processing the qualities that you're
2469960	2473920	paying attention to will become coherent with each other. And the ones that you
2473920	2477720	don't want information to go to will kind of not have that strengthened
2477920	2482680	coherence together. And so there's this really fascinating phenomena in the
2482680	2489320	brain where so much of our processing is linked to very interesting, distinct
2489320	2494120	rhythms, and probably the most pronounced in human cognition is what's
2494120	2498880	called the theta rhythm. This is about five times to eight times per second,
2498880	2505240	kind of five to eight range. And the theta rhythm is found in so much of our
2505240	2510840	behavior and in a lot of our information coming into our brains and in a very
2510840	2517240	special brain nuclei called the hippocampus. And so when I am speaking to
2517240	2523040	you right now, the words that I am saying to you are actually entering your
2523080	2529920	ears at a rhythm of the theta rhythm. And shockingly, this theta rhythm is
2529920	2533840	found across many different cultures and languages. Doesn't matter what
2533840	2539680	country you're born in, what language or ancestry you have, all languages that
2539680	2544480	we've been able to find have a very pronounced eight Hertz to five Hertz
2544480	2551360	theta rhythm in the speech envelope that gets transmitted. So cross culturally,
2551800	2555760	people are talking to each other at the exact same rate, and it seems to have
2556040	2560520	maybe an evolutionary and a biological basis, right? So if your brain and your
2560520	2566160	hippocampus, this memory storage episodic memory construction region in the
2566160	2572400	brain, it is vibrating in the theta rhythm. And so when you're giving people
2572560	2578920	words and language, you want it to resonate into their episodic memories and
2578920	2583280	you want it to be constructed into present new memories, but you also wanted
2583280	2591040	to access old memories. In addition, your eyes are moving at roughly a theta
2591040	2596640	rhythm. Even when you fixate on a single fixed point, your eye is actually
2596680	2603240	twitching around in what's called micro saccades, small eye movements. Those
2603240	2607000	micro saccades and those macro saccades as you look around a room and explore a
2607000	2610960	new environment are all locked to the theta rhythm, right? So you have
2611560	2620760	audition, theta, vision, theta, major memory storage in theta. And so all of
2620760	2624440	these different regions in the brain are processing different information, but
2624480	2628680	they're transmitting that information to each other in the theta rhythm. And
2628680	2633280	there was this really cool paper by the Hanselmeyer lab that that actually
2633280	2639680	presented people with snippets of audio and flashes of video. And when those
2639680	2645680	snippets and flashes were presented in theta rhythm, coherently, you were
2645680	2653720	actually able to assemble an episodic memory for those audio visual parents.
2653960	2658200	And when they looked in the brain, they found electrical activity rhythmically
2658200	2663320	vibrating in theta frequency in visual cortex and in audio cortex. And there
2663320	2667520	was increased coherence when you were forming a memory and when you were
2667520	2673640	successfully sort of pairing that information together. And so coherence
2673880	2679640	is a way that this audio nuclei, this visual nuclei are sharing information
2679640	2684240	dynamically, routing it over to the hippocampus, routing it up to higher
2684240	2688560	order regions that need to process some information. And so coherence seems to
2688560	2693640	be this really fundamental role for how information is routed throughout the
2693640	2699880	brain. So what might this feel like? And so I think there's this idea that, you
2699880	2704120	know, hey, we're just routing information around. And so it's kind of just like
2704120	2709960	switchboards or circuit breakers just pumping information here and there. But
2709960	2716720	I wonder and I speculate whether the experience of being an observer window
2716720	2722600	within a coherent transient functional network feels like a dialogue, feels
2722600	2728640	like a conversation, maybe even like a debate, and not necessarily just like
2728680	2734320	the direct one to one transmission of information, right? We go back to the
2734320	2738840	analogy of two individuals communicating. If you're an observer window and
2738840	2743200	you're at this macro scale, you have all this neural information processing,
2743200	2747640	protein information processing, all these scales beneath you working to
2747640	2753840	generate all this information. Does this macro scale electrical activity that we
2753840	2759680	can measure for this nuclei? Is it like the equivalent of like a fully fledged
2759680	2765480	personality? And here, you know, there's a couple movies like that movie inside out
2765480	2769680	by Pixar, which sort of depicts these different personalities communicating
2769680	2775640	with each other in the brain. Is coherence more like a dialogue than just,
2775640	2780520	you know, sending a signal through a wire or like a carrier pigeon from one
2780520	2785040	place to another. Instead, it's a dynamic interplay or conversation between a
2785040	2790240	bunch of personalities. And so there's this guy, Richard Schwartz, who he was
2790240	2795240	studying, he was doing family therapy where he would take a dysfunctional
2795240	2798680	family and they'd go through a psychotherapeutic process where they'd
2798680	2802200	communicate and they'd look at different family roles that different people were
2802200	2807880	playing. And he found that psychologically, this psychotherapy that he was
2807920	2814800	using actually works well in an individual. An individual has an internal family
2814800	2819440	system, as he calls it, a bunch of personalities coexisting within your
2819440	2823280	mind and within your psyche. And these different personalities can be
2823280	2826840	dysfunctional. The conversation could not be going well. There could be
2826840	2832120	dysfunction in the family or there could be a coherent family unit where the
2832120	2835640	personalities are flowing and communicating effectively with each
2835640	2842600	other. Is coherence some signature or some direct neural mechanism for how
2842600	2846680	these different personalities in your brain communicate with each other? It's
2846680	2852440	not a carrier pigeon. It's a dynamic, interesting conversation between sub
2852440	2860600	entities within you. So being a observer window and undergoing coherence might
2860600	2866800	feel like more of a conversation than just shooting signals through wires.
2866920	2872800	Third and final principle is cross frequency coupling. And oh my God, I
2872800	2877160	love this principle. It is so exciting. So much of my own personal research has
2877160	2881160	been moving towards looking at cross frequency coupling, because it's really
2881160	2885720	this fascinating way that you can study multiple spatial temporal scales
2886000	2891000	interacting with each other. And so the first discovery of cross frequency
2891000	2895800	coupling was in the hippocampus, the region I mentioned to you previously. And
2895800	2900640	what they found was that the brain nuclei of the hippocampus was undergoing
2900640	2907640	these big slow rhythmic theta oscillations. And meanwhile, high frequency
2907680	2913960	neurons were also activating and going through these action potentials. And
2913960	2918600	they were coding for different regions in space. So there's a rat running
2918600	2922880	around a maze. And there's different cells called place cells that fire for
2922880	2927040	different locations along the maze. And they found that within the theta rhythm,
2927240	2932480	a sequence of these place cells were firing off. And as the place cells were
2932480	2938200	activating, they were all locked to a particular phase within the theta
2938200	2942200	oscillation. So every time the theta oscillation like went up, you get a bunch
2942320	2945840	of place cells activating, and then it goes down and there's silence. And then
2945840	2948240	it goes back up and a bunch of activations and it goes down and there's
2948240	2953000	silence, right? And so this is called phase amplitude coupling, it's a form of
2953000	2959040	cross frequency coupling, where the phase of the slow frequency oscillation is
2959040	2965240	related to the amplitude of the higher frequency oscillation, right? And so
2965400	2972080	research shows that you can actually decode trajectories of movement from
2972080	2977280	these theta oscillations in the hippocampus. And when you go down to the
2977280	2980920	neural level, you just see a cell fires for this place, a cell fires for that
2980920	2986160	place. But from the electric fields of the hippocampus, you could figure out a
2986160	2992160	trajectory of motion, right? And so it's it's basically forming some form of
2992160	2997520	abstraction, right? It's sequencing, it's organizing, it's it's basically
2997560	3004960	ordering the lower level information into this just stalled more abstract
3004960	3011080	representation. So it's not just like binding a more complex representation
3011080	3015320	like we talked about with synchrony, but it's really this form of abstraction.
3015640	3020320	You're building a more abstract representation from more concrete
3020320	3026800	information, right? Trajectory is more abstract than just a point. So here you
3026800	3031920	have like a vector and maybe a speed. But below it, you just have a single point
3032080	3037560	in in space and maybe in time. And so we can find a lot of evidence that when
3037560	3042600	you're doing these higher order cognitive tasks, right? When you're
3042600	3048120	undergoing some mental function, which requires abstract knowledge, you'll
3048120	3053320	find this phase amplitude coupling pattern, this cross frequency coupling
3053320	3059760	pattern, where you see these big slow rhythmic brain nuclei coupled to these
3059760	3065280	faster rhythms. And the the real canonical one is called theta gamma
3065280	3070440	coupling. And this was the example in the hippocampus that I mentioned. And you
3070440	3075360	find theta gamma coupling whenever you need to generate more abstract
3075360	3080600	representations, or you need to build more abstract items from more concrete
3080600	3086520	items. And so this seems to be sort of a universally applied mechanism in the
3086520	3090880	brain. And it's gaining a lot of traction. And we're finding more and more
3090880	3095880	evidence that this is taking place. Newer rhythm, which I've been sort of
3095880	3099320	pioneering and getting really interested in, is called delta beta
3099320	3104960	coupling. And this is the idea of similar to the to the building of abstract
3105200	3110280	ideas or representations. Delta beta coupling has been much more strongly
3110280	3116920	linked to action initiation and decision making and action planning. So in a way,
3116920	3122360	it's sort of like the top down equivalent to the theta gamma rhythm, where
3122360	3128160	you see these big slow prefrontal decision making regions oscillating when
3128160	3132080	you're trying to choose between a couple of different options. And then this
3132080	3136560	really fast beta rhythm, which is linked to spinal cord activation and muscle
3136560	3142080	innervation muscle activation. There's this coupling between this big slow
3142080	3147240	decision making process, and then the spinal cord bodily movements that get
3147240	3152800	enacted. And so just like cross frequency coupling sort of has this bottom up flow
3152800	3157240	of information as you're building more abstract representations moving up the
3157240	3161720	nested observer window hierarchy. There might be other frequency bands that are
3161720	3165720	really dedicated to taking the information from the tire order more
3165760	3171240	abstract regions, big slow observer windows down into the details where we
3171240	3176280	got to translate all these big abstract action plans into move that muscle, move
3176280	3183000	this muscle, you know, do this complex piano play with your fingers. But it
3183000	3188360	comes from these big abstract cartoony decisions that are being made. So what
3188360	3193120	does this feel like? Well, I think this one has a very clear experiential
3193120	3197440	analogy, right? The idea is, and I mentioned this earlier in the episode,
3197440	3202360	ideas popping into your head. This is the theta gamma experience. An idea shows
3202360	3209440	up, and it's in your mind, and it's fully formed to subtract delta beta. I
3209440	3213600	want to move my arm over here. I'm not thinking about I'm gonna use my flexor
3213600	3218160	extensor, and I'm going to use my elbow to do this thing, right? It's all just
3218160	3223040	this fluid motion that occurs. And I have very abstract ideas of what is
3223080	3227080	actually happening. And somehow it gets translated. I mean, you can barely think
3227080	3231560	about what you're doing, and you'll go and do it, right? A good analogy is with
3231560	3237440	professional sports, professional musicians, right? They they learn these
3237440	3242120	complex motor movements, but then it gets encoded into lower levels. And then
3242120	3246520	they're just activating cartoons, right? There's just these cartoonified
3246520	3252960	decisions being performed. And then and then it occurs. And I think another
3252960	3259800	cool analogy related to this is that cross frequency coupling is limited,
3259840	3264520	right? It's a weak form of coupling. You can only influence one level beneath
3264520	3269840	you, one level above you, you can't get much deeper than that, right? So you hit
3269840	3274800	a wall, and you can't go deeper. What does that feel like? I think a good
3274800	3280680	example is optical illusions, right? These undulating visual patterns that
3280720	3287400	come from black and white checkered visual effects. And so we know it's not
3287400	3291680	real, we know that there's nothing actually undulating. However, we can't
3291680	3296200	stop ourselves from seeing it. You don't have control over it, it's just coming
3296200	3301680	up. So we don't have like ultimate perceptual control over what our eyes
3301680	3306080	are doing, you know, we're only influencing one level beneath ourselves.
3306960	3310760	There are weird examples like with the Necker cube. It's a cube that you can
3310760	3316360	view from two different perspectives. And in that example, people are able to
3316360	3321040	flip between these different ways of viewing it. Is it popping out of the
3321040	3325800	screen? Is it sinking into the screen? And you can actually flip that at will.
3326040	3330600	But it's challenging. It's hard to flip the Necker cube for some people. Other
3330600	3334760	people find it easier. So what makes the difference between people that have an
3334760	3338920	easy time flipping the Necker cube and others that don't, you know? So I think
3338920	3344640	there's like, emphasizing this, you're the volitional agent at this higher level
3344640	3349240	trying to have top down influence on these lower levels. And sometimes you
3349240	3354000	struggle to have the influence that you want to have. Other times it takes the
3354000	3362040	form of cartoonified abstraction, right? And yet it makes its way down. But
3362040	3366520	you're only operating at a very higher level. All right, quick note on
3366520	3371000	fractals, and then we'll hop into the quantum computer question at the end.
3371880	3377040	So when we measure electrical activity in the brain, if this was all real, then
3377040	3382080	we'd want to see this sort of scale free observer windows at all these different
3382080	3387040	levels, cross frequency coupling going down this hierarchy, all this interesting
3387040	3393360	resonance structure. And what we do find is that the background noise of the
3393360	3398760	brain has this one over F power distribution, and it's called pink noise.
3399240	3405640	White noise is like equal noise at all frequency bands. Pink noise is shifted
3405640	3411280	towards the lower frequency end. So lower frequencies have more noise and
3411280	3416280	higher frequencies have less noise. This sounds like the ocean. You can look up
3416280	3419840	pink noise and listen to it for yourself. But it sounds a lot more like the
3419840	3424640	ocean, whereas white noise sounds like static. And the pink noise is a little
3424640	3430440	more soothing than this pure static. So when we measure the brain, we see pink
3430440	3436360	noise, we hear the ocean in the electrical activity of our brains. And what
3436360	3442800	this implies is that these big low frequency rhythms have a bit more of an
3442800	3449040	influence over the overall signal in our in our brains and in our bodies. And
3449040	3453280	this is what we would want to see if there was a scale free fractal like
3453480	3461520	organization to the activity in our bodies. And so there's a lesser known
3462800	3468560	principle in fractal mathematics called the Hearst exponent. So if you take the
3468560	3474240	Mandelbrot set, you kind of have this like Buddha looking figure at at once
3474240	3479080	one view of the Mandelbrot set. And as you zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,
3479080	3483040	zoom, you keep zooming, you see all these crazy patterns, crazy, crazy, crazy
3483040	3487520	patterns. Boom, you see the Buddha shape again, once you get deep enough into the
3487520	3492160	Mandelbrot. Keep zooming, keep zooming, keep zooming, boom, there it is again.
3492600	3498880	There is a certain rate at which you will zoom and then you see the original
3498880	3505800	pattern that you started off with, right? And so there's a rate of zoom until you
3505800	3511720	hit an interesting pattern. And so what we're using or what we're sort of
3511720	3518800	speculating is that observer windows are kind of like fractals in that they have
3519280	3525480	a certain depth that you have to zoom before you see more observer windows. We
3525480	3530200	have observer windows, they're neurons, let's say, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,
3530200	3534440	zoom, zoom, zoom, nothing, no observers, no observer windows, bam, proteins, these
3534440	3538880	are observer windows. Keep zooming, more time passes, more observer windows,
3538880	3544560	right? Zoom out from the neuron, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, bam, brain
3544560	3550520	nuclei. So the idea is that observer windows are not arbitrary, they're not
3550520	3556760	anywhere, there are clear boundaries on what can be an observer window and where
3556760	3562600	you find the observer windows. They're not infinitely spread like at all, at all
3562600	3568840	levels, but there's some sort of ratio or some sort of mathematical description
3568840	3574080	for when observer windows show up in your body and in your, in your brain. And
3574120	3580040	so a fun question here is how deep can we go? You know, is it turtles all the way
3580040	3585320	down, right? The, the classic example of the earth is flat, there's a turtle
3585320	3588680	holding it up, but who's holding up the turtle? Oh, another turtle, but who's
3588680	3591520	holding that turtle up? Oh, another turtle, oh, it must be turtles all the way
3591520	3598840	down, right? How deep does this observer window fractal go, right? Who knows,
3598840	3603080	maybe you hit Planck scale and that's the last observer window, you got these
3603080	3606800	Planck scale observer windows and everything's kind of built up out of
3606800	3612520	that level. If we zoom out, are there observer windows at larger, more
3612520	3620320	macroscopic, slower scales? Maybe, maybe biology is complex and biology needed to
3620320	3624600	be evolved. And so we are the largest observer windows on the planet. And
3624600	3629400	maybe we are giant observer windows relative to the rest of nature and
3629440	3633280	resting to the world around us, right? Maybe there are larger observer windows.
3633280	3638040	What would that look like? Very speculative, almost into the woo woo
3638040	3644720	range, but interesting and fun to think about. Okay, observer windows are
3644720	3650000	limited. They are difficult to create and they're defined by a high degree of
3650000	3655520	synchrony. How high is the synchrony requirement to be an observer window?
3656120	3659960	Well, you know, Jonathan Schuller and I are going to move forward publishing this
3659960	3665880	paper thinking about this, just very classical, sort of simpler terms, just
3665880	3669640	talking about electrical activity and coherence and synchrony is kind of a
3669640	3673680	matter of degree, you know, where coherence is weak coupling, synchrony is
3673680	3677920	strong coupling, but it needs to be strong enough that it forms that functional
3677920	3684920	unit, right? However, if you take a quantum computer, quantum consciousness,
3684920	3692920	take on all of this, what if synchrony was really quantum coherence? And here
3692920	3696560	the terminology gets very confusing because the word quantum coherence sounds
3696560	3701880	like the other word for coherence. But the idea here would be that really,
3701880	3707400	really strong coupling would be you form a single wave function, a bunch of
3707400	3711840	quantum bits, they're all entangled, they form a single quantum computer. And so
3711840	3717160	the observer window is a quantum computer. The high degree of synchrony that
3717160	3723200	you require is the ultimate level of synchrony. No environmental influence
3723200	3729880	whatsoever. Quantum mechanics has a definition where the superposition and
3729880	3735320	the entanglement effects reign supreme, they become dominant when there's no
3735320	3740840	environmental influence and it's like the state of ultimate synchrony, right? So
3740840	3748000	one way to recast the now model within the quantum consciousness paradigm is to
3748000	3753080	say that observer windows are quantum computers, right? There are quantum
3753080	3757880	computers, and there's quantum computers nested within quantum computers, and that
3757880	3766440	gets a little speculative and wild. But then these quantum computers set the
3766440	3771320	domain of what can be an observer window, and then all other forms of
3771320	3775320	compute quantum computers talking to each other is classical. Classical
3775320	3779880	communication has a phase lag, it has physical constraints on the communication.
3779880	3785120	And so coherence is classical communication between quantum computers.
3785120	3791840	Cross-requency coupling gets bizarre, but maybe it's some other form, yeah, of
3791840	3797960	classical communication, or maybe that is yet some third form of communication
3797960	3802960	that we don't really understand yet, right? Synchrony is quantum computation
3802960	3807800	fundamentally. Coherence is this digital classical, maybe forming a
3807800	3815320	digital computer network, and then that cross-requency coupling seems to defy
3815320	3820720	either of these forms. And I'll come back to this in our next episode, because
3820720	3825520	after this we're going to dive deeper into these notions of fractal computation,
3825520	3831480	and there's some fun ideas out there that I'd be remiss to not introduce you to.
3831480	3838000	So look forward to our next episode on fractal computation, and I'll leave you
3838000	3845720	to ponder tonight as you fall asleep. Are you a single conscious being? Are there
3845720	3851560	nested conscious beings within you? Are you a rich dialogue? Is your mind a
3851560	3858920	corporation of workers working with you for some common goal, which is your
3858920	3863360	life's mission, and this is a collaborative enterprise of conscious
3863360	3870040	beings nested within each other? Is that your reality, or are you a holistic
3870040	3874360	single individual, or are you a collection of physical processes and
3874360	3879120	chaotic influences? Alrighty, I'll talk to you again very soon.
