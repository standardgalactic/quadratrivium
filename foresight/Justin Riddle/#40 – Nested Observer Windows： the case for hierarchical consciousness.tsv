0	3160	Welcome back to the show that tells you you are a quantum
3160	7120	computer with free will supervising a vast hierarchy of
7120	10920	cognitive systems. My name is Justin Riddle. And this is
10920	15180	episode 40 of the quantum consciousness series. In today's
15180	18560	episode, I'll be giving you an update of the nested observer
18560	23360	Windows model and recapping a lecture I gave at the science
23360	27960	of consciousness conference in April of 2024. By the end of
27960	32000	today's episode, we'll ask the question, what is it like to be
32000	37360	at the apex of a hierarchical consciousness? This episode is
37360	40960	available on YouTube and an audio only version is available on
40960	44480	Spotify and Apple podcast. If you like what you hear today,

58120	75760	So today, I'm going to be basically recapping and giving
75760	79400	you the same lecture that I gave at the science of consciousness
79400	84200	conference in April of 2024. But I'll be giving it a little bit
84200	90560	of an expanded version. You can find the original recording on
91120	95240	on the internet, I'll provide a link that you can go look, you
95240	99800	know, at the original version if you so desire. But essentially,
99800	105000	this is a update to a previous episode on this channel that I
105000	110800	gave. However, the manuscript is now published in the neuroscience
110800	114720	of consciousness journal. I will also give a link to that
114720	118680	paper it is open access so free to download and read for
118680	121760	yourself. And this is work that I've done with Jonathan
121760	125040	Schuehler. He's a professor at the University of California,
125040	130120	Santa Barbara. So all of this work is collaborative with him. So
130120	134440	without further ado, let's hop right into it. So the title of
134440	138640	the paper is hierarchical consciousness, the nested observer
138640	143640	windows model, or the now model for short. So to introduce this
143640	147760	idea of hierarchical consciousness, because it is not,
147920	151840	you know, usually a typical way that people imagine that the
151840	155480	brain or the mind is organized. So I'll give you a quick
155480	160960	example here. So when driving, you start to mind wander, pondering
160960	164320	the nature of consciousness. Without warning, you suddenly
164320	167560	realize you were almost at your destination. You wonder where
167560	171560	the time went. Now your attention is focused on navigating
171600	175400	the which freeway exit to get off, and on what side street to
175400	179520	turn. You are acutely aware of the lack of awareness paid to
179520	183480	driving. But you do not notice that the wandering mind kept
183480	186160	wandering while you were focused on navigating the side
186160	190600	streets. When parking your car, you revisit the wandering mind.
191020	194560	There is a fresh batch of theories and models that seem to
194560	199080	have materialized. You diligently proceed to review those new
199080	204000	ideas, as you absentmindedly walk up the driveway. So this
204000	207760	example is meant to sort of showcase a couple different
207760	213080	ways in which we are not fully aware of all of the cognitive
213080	217880	processes that are ongoing within our own mind. And it appears
217880	221400	that there are many cognitive systems coexisting
221440	225360	simultaneously in your mind. And you usually can only pay
225360	229040	attention to one or a subset of these different cognitive
229040	233800	systems. So a very common example is driving. A lot of the
233800	238600	times we're flying down the freeway at 70 miles per hour. And
238600	243080	we're barely paying attention to what we're doing. But this is
243080	247240	kind of alarming, right? I mean, you could almost die at any
247240	251840	moment if you lost control of your vehicle. And yet we consume
251840	256720	our mind with fanciful ideas and and fun thought processes as
256720	260520	we are driving. And it's very second nature to just kind of
260520	265560	let your body take over the act of driving. And then at certain
265560	270520	moments, you need to interrupt your mind wandering and pay
270520	273760	attention to driving, you know, once again, and there's a way
273760	277220	that your mind can get your attention gets you reengaged
277220	281860	with the act of driving. And, you know, in the absence of
281860	286580	that call to pay attention, you can freely wander your mind
286580	293820	around. And in this example, we give kind of an additional way
293820	298380	that your mind could be operating autonomously. And that is
298380	303780	mind wandering itself. Could it be that there is a part of your
303780	309300	mind that is maybe always wandering, always engaged in
309300	313340	abstract thought. And when you pay attention to driving, let's
313340	316180	say you need to navigate some side streets as you're going to
316180	319460	your friend's house, you really need to pay attention to
319460	323460	everything that you're doing. And then you revisit the wandering
323460	328420	mind. And could it be that the wandering mind kept going when
328420	333060	you were paying attention to driving? This is something that
333060	338540	we much less often kind of attribute to what can be
338540	343780	performed autonomously in our brains in our minds. However,
344100	348380	why not? And I think if you were to introspect on your
348380	352040	conscious experience, you'd probably be able to recognize
352040	356020	many instances where there appears to be fully formed
356020	359820	ideas that are, you know, springing into your mind
359820	363260	springing into your attention. And you say, Hey, that was a
363260	367020	great idea. I just had. But where did that idea really come
367020	371820	from? Were you aware of the creation of that idea kind of
371820	376780	from the ground up? Okay, so hierarchical consciousness is a
376780	380820	very novel way of really thinking about you and your
380820	388100	mind. So you are at the top, you are the apex of a hierarchical
388100	392700	system. This means that there are systems nested within you.
392980	396980	And within those systems, there are further subsystems nested
396980	401460	within those. So what are some of the implications of
401500	406180	hierarchical consciousness? And what is it like to be at the apex
406180	410900	of a hierarchically consciousness system? So we often
410940	416220	kind of naively conceptualize the mind as a monologue. There's a
416220	420660	narrative stream, the story I'm telling myself as I go through
420660	425140	my day. And while there's a lot of validity to the idea of a
425140	430100	narrative monologue, there's also a lot of moments where our
430100	435060	mind is more like a dialogue, right? When you're in your
435060	439460	thoughts, and you're simulating these different ideas, you can
439460	443820	go for minutes and minutes and minutes at a time, debating
443820	448900	different positions, different ideas. And a lot of times we talk
448900	453580	to ourselves, you are talking through some idea, hearing your
453580	457340	own counterpoints to that idea. And it's as if there is a
457340	463140	dialogue of multiple competing interests within us. It says if
463140	467260	we have many different personalities, drives, views,
467500	471180	ways of conceptualizing the world around us, and they're not
471180	474860	necessarily compatible. And we're faced with a lot of
474860	482180	conflict, inner conflict as we navigate new situations. What
482180	485940	should we do here? What should we do there? Do we view this as
485940	489180	you know, viewpoint A or viewpoint B? And there's a
489180	496260	rich dialogue occurring internally. Another implication is
496260	499900	that we often kind of have this idea that we're creating our
499940	503500	thoughts. I thought this thought, this is my thought, we
503500	508580	claim ownership over our thinking. You are building and
508820	512940	constructing ideas. And once you have an idea, you proudly, you
512940	515900	know, tell the world, ah, look at my idea, I've created this
515900	520020	wonderful new product of my mind. And this is my product.
520780	524900	However, there are many examples, if we're kind of honest
524900	529700	with ourselves, where we just have an idea, and it seems to
529700	534660	spring out of nowhere. There's no experience of creating the
534660	538820	idea. It's like an epiphany moment, an idea is thrown into
538820	544860	your mind. Could this be some sort of nested substructure,
544860	549140	some cognitive system within you, that created and constructed
549140	552340	and did a lot of the hard work, and then just presented you
552340	558020	with an idea at the apex level. You still claim ownership over
558020	562020	that idea. However, you weren't really a part of the creation
562020	568220	process per se. Even more extreme, there are intrusive
568220	571740	thoughts. Sometimes we have a thought and we say, Oh, I did
571740	576500	not think that thought that was not me, my brain just generated
576500	580260	this thought and I am not responsible for that thought
580260	584500	whatsoever. This idea, this thought just occurred. But that,
584540	588340	you know, that's not me. I delete that I will willingly
588340	593300	suppress and remove that thought from my mind. And I also
593580	598140	reject ownership. I am not an owner of this thought. It was
598140	601660	something my brain generated. So this is also a very common
601660	605220	place example that, you know, if you introspect, you'll you'll
605220	609380	have many moments where you might not want to claim
609380	613020	responsibility over your own thinking. And we also have this
613060	617660	idea that we are in control of our bodies. You know, I choose
617660	621340	to move around and I'm making this hand gesture with my hands.
621620	626860	This is me controlling my body. However, I'm not really aware of
626860	631340	what my hands are actually doing. I am initiating a cartoon
631340	636380	version of what I want to happen. And then a very complex
636420	641700	intricate muscle activation pattern then arises. And so I am,
641860	647060	you know, in control of that to some degree. But I really don't
647060	650740	understand any of the details of what my body is actually doing.
651020	654500	And so on some level, you know, you're in control, but you're
654500	659500	not as in control as you might think that you are. And if you
659500	662580	really pay attention to what your body is doing, you will
662580	667860	sometimes find these sort of automated or seemingly unconscious
667860	671780	movements that your body is performing. And could it be that
671780	675620	there are nested systems within you that are potentially kind
675620	680180	of mediating your connection to the body. And when they act
680220	684220	semi autonomously from your will, when you're, you know, not
684220	689100	paying attention, there's some evidence of cognition or some
689100	694260	sort of will or form in your body's movements, even if you're
694260	700020	not fully consciously aware of what is occurring. So at the
700020	703340	core of hierarchical consciousness is the idea that
703380	707140	yes, you are a cognitive system. Yes, you are thinking. But
707140	711100	within you are thinking cognitive systems. And they are
711100	713980	providing you with this information with these
713980	718180	cognitive streams. And you are supervising a bit of a
718180	723900	corporation of subsystems within you. And this gives a very
723940	729340	rich landscape to our internal experience. There are so many
729340	733820	cognitive structures inside of you. And they all are acting in
733820	738500	these very complex nuanced ways. And this sort of increases the
738500	744180	richness, the variety of our inner life. And it gives a way of
744180	750180	kind of understanding biology from a from a new lens. So now I'm
750180	754860	going to dive into that kind of biological motivation. Alright,
754860	759780	so where did this hierarchical consciousness idea come from? On
759780	763860	some level, it came from introspection. But in another way,
764220	768180	there is a really strong motivation for hierarchical
768180	774260	consciousness that arises from our observations in biology and in
774260	781380	neuroscience. Okay, so if we ask the question, where in the
781380	785860	brain should we study consciousness, right? There are
785860	789940	many different people that are neuroscientists. And yet they
789940	793300	use very different tools, different systems that they're
793300	798940	studying. And so, you know, we might make this kind of pitch
799020	807220	of reductionism. Every system is reducible to a subsystem. Okay,
807660	812860	a brain region is made out of neurons. A neuron is made out of
812860	817820	synapses. Synapses are made out of proteins and proteins are made
817820	822500	out of atoms and atoms are made out of quarks and the forces of
822500	826940	particle physics. And so to understand a brain region, you
826940	828900	shouldn't study the brain region. It's actually just
828900	831700	neurons. You need to go study neurons. But you know, you
831700	835180	can't really study neurons because they're just too big. And
835220	838580	you know, they're not really real. Neurons are really just a
838580	841420	bunch of synapses and electrical potentials. But to
841420	844580	understand the electric potentials, you got to go study
844580	848620	the synapses. But you know, synapses are really not real
848620	851780	either. They're just made out of different proteins, different
851780	856860	receptors. And the synapse really just emerges from the mass
856860	862140	action of many, many protein receptors. So forget about the
862140	866180	synapse, we got to go study proteins. And then proteins are
866180	869500	really just emerging phenomenon of all these amino acids. And
869500	873180	those are really constrained by these, you know, more atomic
873180	878260	style chemical forces of organic chemistry. And then, you know,
878260	881980	it's an infinite reduction, maybe down until you hit
881980	884940	mathematics, or something like that. But then, oh, you know,
884940	889580	math is just a construct of humans and human society. So
889740	894380	really, there's this strong reductionist bias. And I would
894380	898940	make the argument that this is sort of a naive thought to say
898940	901780	that, you know, to study something, we have to go study
901780	905460	the parts. Because eventually, we're all just particle
905460	908580	physicists. And we're all going to our nearest, you know,
908580	913140	particle accelerator. And no one is doing neuroscience, right?
913420	915500	Then it's completely inappropriate to study the
915500	918740	brain at all, because we should all just be particle
918740	922300	physicists, right? So if you take reductionism to the ultimate
922300	928300	extreme, it gets a little ridiculous. So right now, the
928300	933340	status quo is that to study consciousness, you have to study
933340	938220	neurons. And in a weird way, this is like a an assumption that
938220	941780	people don't even admit that they have, right, there is a
941780	947020	strong bias to say the brain is neurons. And you have to study
947020	951020	neurons, right? But for the same reasons I just laid out with
951020	957100	reductionism. Why study neurons? Why not study synapses and
957100	961340	proteins? What is it that makes the neuron special? Well, you
961340	965180	could say, Well, the neuron has the capacity for action
965180	968700	potentials for these meaningful electrical potentials. It's that
968780	973340	electrical property, which is so meaningful. However, there are
973380	977300	very profound electrical properties at the level of
977300	982220	functional brain regions of entire brain nuclei. Why in the
982220	987300	world would you not be allowed to study brain nuclei? Why is it
987300	990820	inappropriate to study brain nuclei? And yet it is completely
990820	995020	appropriate to study neurons themselves, right? So moving in
995020	999340	either direction, you can construct some rationality for
999340	1005100	that movement. However, all theories out there, you know, in
1005460	1011260	status quo, typical neuroscience of consciousness are these kind of
1011260	1015740	toy cartoon neurons. And so hierarchical consciousness is
1015740	1020620	really making the pitch, you know, what if all of these levels
1020620	1024700	were meaningfully contributing to conscious experience to the
1024700	1028860	information processing of the brain? You can study brain nuclei,
1029260	1033020	and you can study neurons, and you can study proteins. And more
1033020	1038460	so, what if there was some system that actually allowed for
1038480	1043660	information transfer between all these different levels? If you
1043660	1048020	could transfer information across these levels, then perhaps
1048020	1052420	there is genuine information processing happening at these
1052420	1057140	different scales. And it might be different information that is
1057140	1061380	being processed, right? As you move from these orders of
1061380	1067340	magnitude of difference, there could be unique channels of
1067340	1071140	information being processed at these different scales, and then
1071140	1075540	some sort of meaningful exchange across levels. And so I
1075540	1079300	think there's a pretty good motivation to say that this is
1079300	1084740	happening in the brain. And then the follow up question would
1084740	1088700	be, what does this mean for consciousness? What if there's a
1088700	1093620	hierarchical biological system at play? How do we shove
1093620	1097500	consciousness or how do we make sense of consciousness within
1097500	1101300	that system? Could it be that there was some sort of
1101300	1106180	cognition, esch processing occurring at all these different
1106180	1111060	levels? And maybe there is even consciousness at multiple
1111060	1115220	levels within the brain. Alright, so to kind of motivate a
1115220	1120740	little bit of this theory of the evidence for it, I'm going to
1120740	1126100	pivot a little bit to say, you know, what is the evidence that
1126100	1131900	these large scale brain nuclei are real? Because in a strange
1131900	1134660	way, or maybe it's not so strange, it might align with
1134660	1139700	like just human bias of where the status quo is at. We are much
1139700	1146300	more hesitant as a field to say that brain nuclei functional
1146300	1153300	brain regions are real. Those get the label of epiphenomenal much
1153300	1156740	more often than a neuron. There are very few people walking
1156740	1159780	around saying neurons aren't real, they're just epiphenomenal.
1159980	1163100	However, there's many people walking around saying functional
1163100	1166060	brain regions aren't real, they just, you know, are kind of a
1166060	1171380	circle we draw around the brain in one way or another. But
1171380	1175260	really, we should all be studying neurons. So I like to give
1175260	1180580	the example of a train. So if we were to imagine the brain as an
1180580	1185740	engine as a train, what is it that pushes the brain train
1185740	1192540	forward through time? What is the engine of the system? And status
1192580	1196260	quo would say that the engine is neurons, there's a bunch of
1196260	1198900	neurons, and they have electrical potentials, the
1198900	1202980	spiking activities that are occurring, they release chemicals
1202980	1208780	from one onto another, and then they react and activate based on
1208780	1215180	this chemical signaling. However, if you put a recording device
1215260	1220380	inside of the brain, you observe these large electrical
1220420	1226220	fluctuations at the scale of entire populations of neurons.
1226740	1231340	And what we used to think as a field is that these electrical
1231340	1235180	fluctuations were just kind of the steam off of the brain
1235180	1241020	train. These are epiphenomenal. They're not real signals. Well,
1241020	1243820	there's signals in the sense that you can measure them, but
1243820	1247060	they're not really doing anything, right? It's not
1247100	1253540	contributing to the function of the brain. However, we now
1253580	1258500	realize after some experimental work and after some theoretical
1258500	1263300	work, that there might be a bit of a circular causation here
1263300	1267580	where even if these electric fields at the scale of hundreds
1267580	1271140	of thousands to millions of neurons, even if that's
1271140	1276460	generated from the activity of smaller, you know, neurons
1276460	1279780	themselves, and the mass collective action of these
1279780	1284020	neurons, once the electric field has been generated, once it
1284020	1289700	exists, it then exists independently of the individual
1289700	1294780	neurons, and that electric field can then change and constrain
1294780	1298540	the activity of neurons. And there's a little bit of a
1298540	1303580	circular causation here. Neurons can cause electric fields.
1303780	1307380	These electric fields can then change neurons. And it's not
1307380	1311220	saying that one is primary, although maybe you could make
1311220	1313980	the argument that you wouldn't have the electric field without
1314020	1320180	the neurons. And that is, you know, likely true. However,
1320220	1325260	they're, you know, they both are contributing meaningful to the
1325260	1329460	processing of these systems. And there has been a lot of work
1329460	1335820	lately, really diving into what do neural oscillations do for the
1335820	1339380	brain and for cognition, and we're getting more and more
1339380	1342540	evidence that they appear to be meaningfully related to
1342540	1346500	cognition. So what I would make an argument to you, why should
1346500	1348820	we care about these electric fields about these neural
1348820	1352940	oscillations? Well, these neural oscillations are really the
1352940	1357860	closest correlate that we have to cognition. So I'll give you a
1357860	1363580	couple examples here. So one example is the theta oscillation
1363580	1368980	that you can witness in sound waves. So as I am talking to
1368980	1373340	you, if you were to record the words coming out of my mouth,
1373780	1378580	you take that sound wave recording, and you break down
1378580	1382380	the frequency domain, the frequency components of my
1382380	1386540	speech, you'll see that there's a lot of rhythmic structure to
1386540	1391820	the way that we talk to each other. And more so, if you zoom
1391820	1396060	into individual words that I'm saying, there are different
1396060	1401660	sound chunks in each of my words. And those sound chunks are
1401660	1406900	coming at a very rhythmic rate across all different cultures
1406900	1411740	that we've measured. People tend to speak at a very canonical
1411740	1416980	rate. And there's a prominent theta frequency oscillation
1417220	1421820	roughly between four and eight hertz across all these different
1421820	1427420	languages that we can record from. And that rhythm is a very
1427420	1431300	prominent rhythm in the sound waves. And we can find that
1431300	1435180	rhythm from the sound waves in the electrical activity of the
1435180	1439780	brain. And if we look at auditory cortex, for example, as I'm
1439780	1442920	talking to you, your auditory cortex is rhythmically
1442920	1447900	fluctuating in sync to the words that I am saying. So this is a
1447900	1453180	really profound electrical property within the brain. And
1453180	1458340	it really closely correlates to the type of information that is
1458340	1463140	being processed in the world around us. And is it a
1463180	1467700	coincidence that we all speak at a certain rhythm? And this
1467700	1471900	rhythm is found all throughout the brain with various protein
1472500	1476540	constituents that give rise to this rhythm. There's a really
1476540	1481660	tight correspondence in frequency domain between our
1481660	1485260	behaviors and the electrical properties of our brains
1485260	1489420	themselves, which might suggest that, you know, our brains are
1489420	1493020	helping us produce language. There's some electrical
1493020	1497540	determinants, some biological brain determinants for our
1497540	1501660	speech. And then, you know, we're tuned into these rhythms in
1501660	1505300	our environment. Another example comes from the visual
1505300	1509360	cortex. So in the back of your brain, there is a electrical
1509360	1513380	rhythm called the alpha oscillation. This is occurring
1513380	1517540	roughly around 10 times per second, 10 hertz. And if you
1517540	1520620	measure visual cortex, you'll find this big prominent
1520620	1524300	electrical wave traveling through your visual cortex. And
1524300	1527660	what people have found in one example experiment is that if
1527660	1531900	you flash a light really quickly, there's a certain rate at
1531900	1535140	which if I flash the light really quickly, you will
1535140	1538820	perceive it as a single flash, versus if it's a little bit
1538820	1543260	slower, you perceive it as two separate flashes. And there's a
1543260	1547460	certain time point at which it crosses over from being
1547460	1551820	two flashes into getting fused into a single flash. And this
1551820	1557300	is the flicker into fusion rate. And this is roughly around
1557300	1562060	100 milliseconds in the average individual. And what people
1562060	1566300	have found is that the rate at which your visual cortex is
1566300	1572420	fluctuating is correlated with your flicker fusion rate. So the
1572460	1578060	time at which you shift from a flicker into a fusion is related
1578060	1581500	to the ongoing electrical fluctuations in your visual
1581500	1586220	cortex. So what this means is there's basically a one to one
1586220	1591980	correspondence between visual awareness, refreshes, and the
1591980	1596700	electrical activity in your brain. If the flashes show up in
1596700	1600460	different refreshes, then you have the experience of two
1600460	1604540	separate flashes. But if both flashes end up in one electrical
1604540	1607780	fluctuation in your visual cortex, then you just have the
1607780	1612900	experience of a single flash fused together. So this is quite
1612900	1616620	wild, right? I mean, this is basically saying that your visual
1616620	1620540	awareness, the perception that you're having right now of
1620540	1625660	visual information is actually flickering and updating. And we're
1625660	1630380	maybe not aware of this update in our experience. And you know,
1630380	1632620	I would argue that maybe it's because you're a little bit
1632620	1638540	slower up at the apex, but more on that a little bit later. And
1638540	1644060	this is directly related to the cognitive processing within your
1644060	1648620	system, right? So to be reductive and say, Well, who cares
1648620	1651100	about these electric field fluctuations, we got to dive into
1651100	1655100	the neurons because the neurons are all that matters. Well, we
1655100	1658860	have a very strong tight correlation between the electric
1658860	1664940	fields in this large brain structure and your experience. So
1664940	1670140	what evidence can we make that there is a strong correspondence
1670380	1674260	more so than just correlation, right? Because just because we
1674260	1677180	can measure something and just because something is correlated
1677460	1683100	doesn't mean that it's really or causally related to the thing
1683100	1687500	itself. So electrical activity happens, cognition happens as
1687500	1692340	well, these two phenomenon or correlated to each other. And so
1692340	1697100	the way that we can test this in the laboratory, and my lab
1697140	1701660	does, you know, exactly this, we will deliver what's called
1701660	1706020	noninvasive brain stimulation, and we can do this in humans,
1706940	1711620	where we can deliver a brief magnetic pulse to the brain. And
1711620	1716340	that causes a brief electric current to arise within a part
1716340	1721740	of cortex. And if we apply these brief pulses at a certain
1721940	1728140	spacing, right, then what we find is that we can very
1728140	1732380	selectively drive these electric field fluctuations in the
1732380	1736900	brain, where the repeated application of multiple pulses
1737140	1741220	will start to build up and ramp up an electric field
1741220	1746180	fluctuation. So here I'm including a image of you know,
1746180	1750260	some data that was recently published from my group, where
1750260	1754100	we essentially show just this that if you're delivering brief
1754140	1757380	magnetic pulses to the brain, and you're recording the electrical
1757380	1760980	activity in the brain region that you're targeting, you can see
1760980	1764620	a ramp up in these electric fields. And what's really
1764620	1768500	interesting is then we can actually change and shift
1768500	1773420	cognition as a function of just the frequency that we're
1773420	1778580	targeting in the brain. And you know, in my day job, I'm a
1778580	1783100	cognitive neuroscientist and a lot of my work is delivering
1783100	1787220	frequency specific brain stimulation in human participants
1787540	1792380	in order to alter or change their cognition. And the idea is
1792380	1796660	that this is a way of building causal evidence for these
1796660	1801020	macroscopic electric fields in the brain. It's not just
1801020	1805220	reducible to neurons, but by changing these electric fields,
1805460	1810580	we change cognition. So this is building much stronger evidence
1810820	1814820	that these electric fields are directly related to the cognitive
1814820	1819580	processing within the brain. So my work and that of others is
1819580	1824460	really trying to validate this highest level or one of the top
1824460	1829260	levels within the biological hierarchy, the level of functional
1829260	1833540	brain regions of electric field fluctuations roughly between 10
1833540	1838940	Hertz and two Hertz, this low frequency range in the brain
1839340	1844900	really is real. It's doing something for cognition. It is
1844900	1850060	a part of the engine of the brain. It is not just the steam
1850060	1854860	emanating from the brain, but it is really doing something for
1854860	1858300	cognition for our experience. And I think what is really
1858300	1864140	exciting about this work is that, you know, we have a very slow
1864180	1868300	reality, we're thinking our thoughts, we're pondering things,
1868740	1872820	our thoughts occur at the scale of multiple seconds, we're
1872820	1877460	perceiving things at the scale of sub seconds, doing analyses
1877460	1880500	like these and doing experiments like these really
1880500	1884300	build evidence that that low frequency electrical activity in
1884300	1889340	the brain is meaningfully related to cognition is meaningfully
1889340	1894620	related to the processing of the brain. And it one to one
1894620	1899700	relates to our experience of being a human being inside of
1899700	1904140	our brains. So the next question here is, is there a way to
1904140	1908900	communicate from one scale to another scale? And this is where
1908900	1913980	the concept of cross frequency coupling comes in. So cross
1913980	1917460	frequency coupling is saying that there's coupling between two
1917460	1923020	different frequencies across those frequencies. And this was
1923020	1927820	first observed in rodents with invasive recordings of the
1927820	1931460	hippocampus, which is a part of the brain involved in spatial
1931460	1936860	navigation. And what was found was that there are these big
1936860	1941540	electric field fluctuations in the hippocampus, as rats are
1941540	1946700	navigating mazes, and simultaneous to those big theta
1946700	1950780	frequency electric field fluctuations, you also have
1950780	1956940	neurons that are coding for individual locations in space. So
1956940	1960540	these are called place cells. And so you'll have, for example,
1960540	1965740	neuron A fires when you're in location A, you have neuron B
1965740	1970380	that fires when you're in location B, neuron C in location
1970380	1974780	C, neuron D in location D. And what you find is that in the
1974780	1980180	hippocampus, there is a sequential activation neuron A,
1980180	1984380	the neuron B, the neuron C, the neuron D, as the rat is sitting
1984380	1988860	at location A and thinking about the future of their movement
1989060	1992220	through location A and to B and to C and to D. And there's a
1992220	1998100	sequential activation of these neurons firing. And the sequence
1998100	2003500	of firing is occurring within a theta rhythm. So it says if the
2003500	2010780	brain is going ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, there's a rhythmic
2010780	2015300	activation of these place cells being activated through time.
2015700	2020980	And so this is the first observation of cross frequency
2020980	2025660	coupling between the scale of neurons and the scale of the
2025660	2032740	hippocampus. And the neurons are inside of the hippocampus. But
2032980	2039100	you can now decode a trajectory of motion, a movement of the
2039100	2044340	animal from the electric field activity on its own. And
2044380	2047620	granted, you know, all these neurons are coding for
2047620	2052260	information and building and, you know, projecting information
2052260	2056540	into these electric fields. And then the electric field is
2056540	2061180	sort of an abstract representation of all that
2061180	2065220	information at the lower level. So I think what's really
2065220	2070620	interesting here is that you've built a trajectory of motion
2070620	2076820	from locations, right? This is not a more complex location. This
2076820	2084380	is a abstraction away from location into movement. Movement
2084380	2090140	is like a higher concept than a location. And so we have the
2090140	2095180	construction of a higher order abstract concept from lower
2095180	2101500	order information. And maybe cross frequency coupling, the
2101500	2106020	co occurrence of fast neuron activity nested within low
2106020	2109940	frequency electric field activity, and the coupling the
2109940	2115220	systematic relationship between these levels. This is evidence
2115500	2120140	of some sort of mechanism, some sort of means of information
2120140	2126300	transfer between nested systems one within the other. This
2126300	2129660	example that I've shown you is called phase amplitude
2129660	2134100	coupling, where the phase of the theta frequency basically where
2134100	2139060	you are in a single cycle is related to the amplitude, the
2139060	2143960	activation of these neurons. And it says if the low frequency
2143960	2148820	signal is kind of sequencing the higher frequency signal. And
2148820	2152820	there's been a lot of work since this original rodent work on
2152820	2157380	the hippocampus finding cross frequency coupling in memory
2157380	2162300	processing, working memory, long term memory, attention,
2162500	2165860	decision making, there's many, many examples that we've now
2165860	2171060	observed of these big, low frequency, entire brain regions,
2171060	2174300	entire networks of brain regions, coupling to more
2174300	2179420	microscopic scales. So the next question is, you know, okay, we
2179420	2183340	can measure these correlations, but is it quote unquote, real?
2183660	2188380	Do we have causal evidence for cross frequency coupling? We can
2188380	2190540	use the same magnetic stimulation approach that I
2190540	2193980	told you about just previously. But we can also use what's
2193980	2198500	called transcranial electrical stimulation. And this is
2198500	2202380	something that my lab also uses actively. And there's been many
2202380	2205740	people, you know, using this tool. But essentially, you can
2205740	2209900	deliver electric current to the brain that's designed to mimic
2210140	2213140	these endogenous coupling patterns that you observe in the
2213140	2218460	brain. So one example that I'll show for you right now is we
2218460	2222620	can observe cross frequency coupling between one signal and
2222620	2227080	another signal, we can extract the peak frequency of that
2227080	2232220	coupling in a human participant using EEG. And then we
2232220	2238060	can derive a electrical stimulation waveform based on
2238060	2242780	our observation in EEG, and then deliver electrical
2242780	2248820	stimulation back into the brain to then change and enhance the
2248820	2252660	endogenous cross frequency coupling, and then change
2252660	2257940	people's cognition. So the example I'm showing you here, you
2257940	2261380	can go check out the papers if you're interested. But this was
2261380	2264860	a cognitive control tasks where people had to, you know,
2264860	2268820	memorize a bunch of different rules and use context. And
2268820	2272140	there was sort of a multi stage decision making process that
2272140	2276260	they had to engage with. And there were numerous cross
2276260	2279140	frequency coupling signals emerging from the brain. There
2279140	2284180	was a perception control signal and action control signal. And
2284180	2288620	we differentially targeted either the perceptual control
2288620	2291300	cross frequency coupling signal or that motor control
2291300	2295940	signal. And we could change behavior in a very systematic
2295940	2300500	way based on what frequency we were targeting, either that
2300500	2304340	motor control frequency or that perception control frequency.
2304420	2309740	Alright, so we have causal evidence for cross frequency
2309740	2313900	coupling for these interactions between many different stages
2313900	2318260	or scales in the brain. And so the question now is what does
2318260	2321700	this mean for consciousness? So in the nested observer
2321700	2327220	windows model, at the core of this model, is this idea of a
2327220	2332780	nested hierarchy? And this is directly motivated by cross
2332780	2337620	frequency coupling. And so the primary question in hierarchical
2337620	2341860	consciousness is what does it mean if we were to take cross
2341860	2346980	frequency coupling very, very seriously, right? Cross frequency
2347020	2352380	coupling is not only real, but it is a fundamental property of
2352380	2356100	what it means to be a conscious being. So what if cross
2356100	2360660	frequency coupling was very, very, very much real? And what
2360660	2364740	that would imply is that there is information processing
2364740	2370180	occurring at a slow, big scale, and information processing
2370180	2374340	happening at a faster, smaller scale, and these systems are
2374340	2379100	nested within each other. So the metaphor we use to describe
2379100	2384380	this is mosaic tiling. So in mosaic tiling, you have an image
2384380	2388620	that is made out of mosaic tiles. These are different smaller
2388620	2393180	tiles, and the collage of all these tiles together produces an
2393180	2400020	image, a mosaic image. And what we suggest is what if there is a
2400020	2406060	recursively nested mosaic tiling, where every image is made
2406100	2411460	out of images, where those images are then mosaic tiles of
2411460	2417180	even smaller images, and the pattern repeats recursively as
2417180	2422220	you zoom into an image. So what this means is that your
2422220	2428820	cognitive system, your experience is a collage of all of
2428820	2433060	these different cognitive systems within you. And all these
2433060	2437300	cognitive systems are bubbling up into your experience. And
2437300	2443940	collectively, they form you as this collage of cognition. But
2443940	2449220	if you were to dive into any one of these cognitive threads, you
2449220	2453900	would find that that is in and of itself, a collage of more
2453900	2459140	microscopic cognitive sub processes, and so on and so forth
2459140	2463500	as you zoom into smaller and smaller systems. So the nested
2463500	2469500	observer windows model is basically saying that you are an
2469500	2475900	observer window, you are a bounded space of cognition. And
2475900	2481020	within you are nested sub windows. And within those are more
2481020	2485300	sub windows. And there's a recursive process of nesting
2485620	2490540	motivated by the observations from modern cognitive neuroscience
2490740	2495020	for a role of cross frequency coupling in cognition. So the
2495020	2499260	now model in order to get to the point where we can talk about
2499260	2504420	these nested systems, we need a couple other metaphors, a couple
2504460	2508340	other mechanisms to kind of flesh out the model to be
2508340	2512340	complete. So the first metaphor is mosaic tiling. This is what
2512340	2517100	I already spelled out for you. The next metaphor is a theater.
2517420	2524140	We need a boundary around a cognitive system. And we use the
2524140	2529060	metaphor of a theater. And we call this an observer window. This
2529060	2535780	is a spatio temporally bounded system. And within it, there is
2535780	2541220	a holistic gestalt representation. There is sort of a
2541220	2546940	wholeness to what it is like to be an observer window. And
2546940	2552140	there's some boundary around the system that excludes the rest
2552460	2556780	of reality to say that either you're in the window or you're
2556780	2561100	not. And if you're in the window, you are bound together into a
2561100	2566180	single observer, a single frame of reference. Now, because there
2566180	2573540	is this nesting structure, what this really needs also to have
2574380	2579980	is a mechanism for dialogue or communication between observer
2579980	2585540	windows that are within the same scale. So it might be that you
2585540	2589700	at the apex, you're at the top, you're the the head honcho
2589740	2593420	observer window. As you zoom in, there's a bunch of cognitive
2593420	2598780	systems coexisting. But more so those cognitive systems, they
2598780	2602940	can communicate up to you to the observer window. But they also
2602940	2608380	need to communicate laterally to each other. And this requires a
2608380	2611780	different mechanism than just communicating up to the top
2611780	2615340	observer window or down to a sub observer window. You're
2615340	2619420	talking to your peers. And this we use the metaphor of
2619420	2623620	dialogue. And so there are three mechanisms that we propose in
2623620	2627500	the nested observer windows model. The first mechanism I
2627500	2630100	already talked to you about this is cross frequency
2630100	2634220	coupling. This is a means of transferring information up and
2634220	2638660	down the nested hierarchy. You can have a emergence of
2638660	2642780	information from the lower order into the higher order. You
2642780	2646940	can also have a submergence of information from you or from a
2646940	2652780	sub window down into the smaller faster windows. And this is a
2652780	2657500	means of sending control signals down into your sub
2657500	2663620	structures. Now the formation of an observer window, we use a
2663620	2668580	mechanism called synchrony. This is a zero phase lag
2668580	2673380	connection between all the components of a system. Very
2673380	2676700	simply put, it means that everything within an observer
2676700	2682300	window is perfectly synchronized. There is a zero lag
2682300	2687140	synchronization, where all the sub components form the whole
2687140	2690220	component. And this is something that we kind of
2690220	2696060	intuitively assume is the case. When you call a thing a thing,
2696500	2699580	you kind of assume that everything in that thing is
2699740	2703940	synchronized and acting as if it was one thing. Here, we're
2703940	2708900	kind of formalizing that and saying that synchrony is the
2708900	2712780	foundation for creating one of these observer windows. This is
2712780	2717860	very similar to wolf singers, binding by synchronization, the
2717860	2721820	idea that you can create a gestalt representation, a single
2722100	2726260	meaningful construct through synchrony, through
2726260	2729900	synchronization. So we're really just building off of and
2729900	2735660	using wolf singers mechanism here. And then finally, we have
2735660	2740620	coherence. Coherence is the mechanism for dialogue or
2740620	2745300	communication. This is very much akin to Pascal freezes,
2745500	2749580	neuronal communication through neuronal coherence. The idea is
2749580	2753700	that two systems that are fluctuating will will communicate
2753700	2756900	to each other. This isn't that they're so synchronized that
2756900	2761620	they fuse and become one thing. But there is a non zero phase
2761620	2765540	lag between the two systems, where one is kind of talking
2765540	2769820	while the other listens and vice versa, they're coordinating
2769860	2774100	their processing through time, their dynamics. But they are not
2774100	2778380	fully synchronizing and fusing into into one another. So we
2778380	2781940	updated communication through coherence to use the word
2781940	2786060	dialogue through coherence. It really is the same as Pascal
2786060	2790920	freezes method or his mechanism. However, we think dialogue
2790920	2793900	kind of preserves a little bit more of the autonomy of the
2793900	2797700	individuals, instead of viewing these as like switchboards in a
2797700	2802100	in a circuit diagram. Instead, they're kind of autonomous
2802100	2806340	beings or autonomous cognitive systems that are like talking to
2806340	2810620	each other, rather than fusing with some sort of direct wire
2810620	2814500	connection. All right, an important caveat slash question
2814500	2821060	here is, you know, we propose synchrony, coherence, cross
2821060	2825900	frequency coupling as the core mechanisms in the now model.
2826300	2831380	However, we want to kind of caution that we don't really
2831380	2836940	think that these mechanisms are sufficient to create
2836940	2841700	consciousness. We think that these are necessary mechanisms
2841700	2845300	for communication across scales for the formation of an
2845300	2848340	observer window for communication between observer
2848340	2851940	windows. However, just because you have stuff that is
2851940	2856180	synchronized, we don't think you're spontaneously just gonna
2856380	2859780	have consciousness anywhere that you have an electric field.
2861580	2865780	There's probably a little bit more to it than that. If you've
2865780	2869580	been watching my YouTube channel, then you'll know that I am
2869580	2873380	very much fascinated and interested in theories of
2873380	2877220	quantum consciousness, the idea that quantum computers might be
2877220	2881900	somehow core to the nature of reality and to the nature of
2881900	2886340	consciousness fundamentally. So I'm kind of holding out that
2886340	2890380	there are, you know, more mechanisms that we will discover
2890380	2894300	to be really at the core of what it means to be a conscious
2894300	2900060	being. However, in the meantime, we got to go out there and do
2900060	2903580	some cognitive neuroscience. And there's a lot of tools and
2903580	2907660	methods we can use from cognitive neuroscience like
2907660	2911380	non-invasive brain stimulation, like the observations made
2911380	2915140	with EEG or fMRI or invasive recordings, optogenetics, you
2915140	2917780	know, there's a lot of great tools out there. So we think
2917780	2921540	that, you know, there's a lot of work to be done just by viewing
2921540	2926980	these as necessary signals related to consciousness, even if
2926980	2931660	they're not sufficient to create consciousness outright in a
2931660	2936220	sort of generative way. But I think it's a really honest
2936220	2941100	portrayal of where the value of the theory is. There's a lot to
2941100	2944500	be done in this moment right now with the tools that we have.
2944780	2949900	And there's room in the future to incorporate new ideas that
2949900	2954420	inevitably will be emerging from advancements in technology and
2954420	2957580	in science. Alright, so let's dive a little bit more into the
2957580	2962700	phenomenology. What is it like to live at the apex of a
2962700	2968260	hierarchical consciousness system? So one way in which it is
2968260	2972740	like to be the top of this nested observer window hierarchy is
2972740	2978060	that ideas will just pop into your mind fully formed. This is a
2978060	2981860	pattern of emergence. So what does it mean to receive
2981860	2986820	information via cross frequency coupling? Maybe it would feel
2987180	2991500	like a light bulb going off in your head. Bam, there's an idea.
2991620	2995820	There's a fully formed, fully fleshed out concept right there
2995820	3000340	in front of you, right? The emergence process would kind of
3000580	3007020	abstract away the lower levels. You are really only aware of
3007020	3012300	maybe one layer deep into your brain, maybe two layers deep
3012300	3016140	into your brain. But once you get to three layers deep or even
3016140	3021220	two layers deep, probably it gets a lot more murky to kind of
3021220	3025300	see the origin of all this information. Another way that
3025300	3031220	it's like to be at the apex is we initiate a very cartoon image
3031540	3035380	of what we want to do. So let's imagine you're playing tennis
3035620	3038220	and you got to run to the other side of the court, swing your
3038220	3043540	racket. How aware are you of all the muscle activations of all
3043540	3047860	the groups in your in your hand, in your legs? We are
3047860	3051980	initiating cartoons in our minds. You know, and I think
3051980	3056620	cartoons are a very apt way of kind of thinking about apex
3056620	3061020	life. You know, your apex is a cartoon diagram. It exists at a
3061020	3067260	very abstract level. And yet it has access to all the details.
3068060	3074460	So we perceive HD reality, we perceive fast, high detail
3074460	3080340	information, and we generate very complex movements. However, we
3080340	3083860	experience these at a very abstract level. So one of the
3083860	3087860	beautiful things about the now model is that you can kind of
3087980	3092220	have your cake and eat it to in the sense that you are very
3092220	3098420	slow. And yet the data within your mind is very fast. So we get
3098460	3103180	all of the rich details of all the brain regions, all of the
3103180	3107140	neurons, all the proteins, all that information processing
3107140	3111740	that's bubbling up the hierarchy, you get access to it, you get
3112020	3116500	all of that information. And it's very fast, except you are
3116500	3120660	very slow. And there's no contradiction here, right? This
3120660	3123380	is a way of integrating information across very
3123380	3127900	different time scales. And you can think and act very slowly.
3128180	3132260	And yet you can propagate that down into the lower levels.
3132300	3135540	Another example of what it's like to be at the apex, we have
3135540	3139140	somewhat limited control over these lower levels. And there's
3139140	3142940	a few examples that I think really showcase or highlight that
3142940	3147620	limitation. So one of them is optical illusions. So you know,
3147620	3152420	if you have these undulating checker patterns in some image
3152420	3155580	that you're looking at, you could have full conscious
3155580	3160140	awareness that the sheet of paper or the the image is not
3160140	3166060	moving. However, there is an incorrigible sense that there is
3166060	3169180	some movement in the image, even though you know that it's not
3169180	3174540	there. You cannot help but perceive the optical illusion. And
3174540	3179740	this is a nice way of also showcasing the apex. You are not
3179740	3184060	fully in control of the subsystems. Okay, and I think this
3184060	3189020	is one of the real novel predictions of the now model is
3189020	3194580	that you cannot control your body fully. You are, you know,
3194660	3200300	sending commands out. But the body can't fully interpret your
3200300	3203780	commands. And you're so many levels of abstraction away,
3204140	3208300	that you can't even fully grasp all the sub processes going on
3208300	3213900	internally. And you are truly an abstraction within the body,
3214660	3217940	probably still have free will probably still have full control.
3218140	3222300	But your control is limited to what you are able to know. And
3222300	3226820	you're only able to know a very high level of detail. Alright,
3226820	3231340	so the apex is fundamentally slow. And I think that this is
3231340	3235540	kind of counterintuitive to what a lot of people imagine. And
3235540	3239380	this was one of the components of the now model, that it even
3239380	3242740	took us time to accept as we were kind of thinking through the
3242740	3249020	implications of our own theory. And the idea here is that you,
3249060	3256420	the apex are likely operating at the time scale of a second to
3256420	3263340	multiple seconds. Okay. And so what's happening here is you are
3263340	3270900	this fully integrated observer window. And you are observing the
3270940	3276140	information content within yourself. So it says if you are
3276140	3281540	looking down upon your hierarchy at all times, and you're
3281540	3285780	looking down at these cognitive subsystems and perceiving them,
3286180	3290280	and they're very fast. So you think to yourself, Ah, that's my
3290280	3292780	thought right there. Oh, that thought is mine too. That thought
3292780	3295860	is mine too. And you're like looking down on these nested
3295860	3300220	observer windows and identifying them as you and the nested
3300220	3306220	systems are faster than you. You are terrible at seeing
3306220	3311940	yourself. You only seal the sub windows. And so you mistake the
3311940	3317180	content of your mind for your mind. It is a part of you, it is a
3317180	3322140	part of your mind, but it is not your mind. So we now believe
3322420	3328500	that your mind is integrating over these faster cycles of
3328540	3333660	these nested systems. And here's a couple examples. You climbed
3333660	3337500	a mountain, you're looking out over the mountain, and your eyes
3337500	3341700	are darting around picking up information. So your phobia of
3341700	3343980	your retina, the center of your retina, the center of your
3343980	3349860	eyeball perceives high density color vision. The periphery of
3349860	3354100	your eye only perceives black and white. And it's very low
3354140	3359060	information content. So when you see the mountain, you just
3359060	3364300	hike to the top. Do you perceive little spotlights of your
3364300	3369940	retina as data is being collected? No, your eye darts
3369940	3374420	around at theta frequency, roughly six times per second,
3374420	3378180	your eye is moving around. And it's gathering all these
3378180	3383420	snapshots of the mountain scene. And then it assembles all of
3383420	3388060	that information into a gestalt representation of the mountain
3388060	3395220	scene. And our argument is that your mind is at the scale of
3395220	3399500	the gestalt representation of the full scene. There are
3399500	3405300	multiple processing time points where your eye gathers data
3405300	3407780	here gathers data there gathers data there gathers data
3407780	3411260	there and then it packages and integrates all that information.
3411540	3415060	And your experience is, wow, isn't that beautiful? Look at
3415060	3418700	that mountain scene. But if you zoomed into one of your nested
3418700	3422020	observer windows, they would only have Oh, there's a mountain.
3422580	3425780	Oh, there's some trees over there. Oh, there's the beautiful
3425780	3430620	sky over there with some clouds. Each of their snapshots,
3430940	3436660	their gestalt perceptions is the mountain is the trees is the
3436700	3442620	sky. But you are slow. At the scale of one second, you've had
3442620	3447420	six eye movements occur. And now all six of those eye movements,
3447420	3452380	all that data gets packaged into your experience. And you have
3452380	3457380	this wallah, this image of the whole mountain vista. Another
3457380	3460540	example, as I'm talking to you, I'm sending you all these
3460540	3466220	words. But think about what it's like to listen to words, to
3466220	3470140	listen to someone talking. You're not really paying attention
3470140	3475060	to my words. You don't actually really care or know all the
3475060	3479580	details of all the sound waves I'm sending. Your experience of
3479580	3483980	my words is, Oh, wow, a sentence. Oh, wow, another
3483980	3488660	sentence. Oh, wow, another sentence. We argue, and we are
3488660	3492540	like planning an experiment to like formally test this. We
3492540	3499460	argue that you are perceiving sentences fully gestalted
3499460	3504220	together. You're not really paying attention to all the
3504220	3507660	sound bites. Of course, a nested system is and if you want to
3507660	3511540	call that you go ahead and call that you. But you are most
3511540	3517780	closely this big slow observer window. And you receive the
3517820	3522740	fully packaged information content of a sentence. And if
3522740	3525620	you introspect on your experience, you can pay
3525620	3528660	attention to my words if you want to. But most of the time
3528660	3532060	you're not, you're just like, wow, what a cool idea. Oh, that's
3532060	3536260	an idea. Oh, that's an idea. You're perceiving the fully
3536260	3542980	fledged idea construct of the sentence more so than perceiving
3542980	3546780	words sequentially and building up a sentence. Of course,
3546820	3550660	there's violations of this. There's exceptions to this. It's
3550660	3554900	a nested interacting system. So there's ways of like diving in
3554900	3558780	and paying attention to the details. But if you choose not
3558780	3563060	to pay attention to the details, you still receive all the
3563060	3567460	information, right? And that is somewhat counterintuitive and
3567460	3571820	not the typical thinking on how cognition is occurring. Another
3571820	3576100	implication here is that it actually is quite hard to be
3576100	3584420	aware of separate sources of data in your mind. Okay, and we go
3584420	3586980	into this a little bit in the paper, but I'm going to expand
3587220	3592500	more on it right now. So when you introspect on your
3592500	3598420	experience, you are an integrated whole. And even if
3598420	3603220	there was let's say eight sub observer windows, and maybe you
3603220	3606900	could name them, you could say, Hey, this is, you know, Justin
3606900	3610740	one, Justin two, Justin three, Justin four, all these sub
3610780	3618100	processes within yourself. What if it's hard to distinguish who
3618100	3622700	is giving you this information, right? You are so highly
3622700	3627380	integrated at the top level, that you are terrible at
3627380	3631940	perceiving the individual sources of information that are
3631980	3636300	becoming integrated into the apex. And this is one of the
3636300	3642260	reasons why it's kind of eluded us that there are multiple
3642260	3647300	sub windows, right? Because it's kind of hard for us to learn
3647300	3651500	about these different sub processes. However, this isn't
3651500	3654740	to say that it is impossible to learn about these different
3654740	3658620	sub windows inside of you. And so we also make the argument
3658820	3663460	that maybe one reason that meditation is so bizarre and so
3663460	3667740	weird and why we would need to meditate is because if you close
3667740	3672980	your eyes and think about your experience in your mind, it is a
3672980	3677220	chaotic mess inside of your mind of all these different
3677220	3682140	thoughts and feelings and drives and perceptions. Could the
3682140	3686740	complexity of our inner life be because we are a nested
3686740	3690220	observer window system, and all these sub windows all have
3690220	3692140	different drives and different personalities and different
3692140	3696220	things they're trying to do. And you just naively say, I am
3696220	3699540	me, I'm one person. And yet there's all these different
3699540	3703980	conflicting selves internally. And when you try to introspect
3703980	3708540	on yourself on your experiences, that milieu of
3708540	3712740	cognitive systems are all being bounded together. And so the
3712740	3717820	observer window nature of yourself makes it even more
3717820	3723060	challenging to then introspect on the various sub components or
3723060	3727740	sub processes that might have a unique origin internally. Alright,
3727740	3733300	so what evidence do we have in the brain that we are modular?
3733740	3738420	And what's kind of wild is that the brain is almost bizarrely
3738460	3743540	over modular and the intuition that you're one person almost
3743540	3747420	doesn't line up with the data of the brain. If you look at the
3747420	3751500	brain, it's got two hemispheres. And these hemispheres, if you
3751500	3754100	hold the brain in your hand, you can kind of twisted and move
3754100	3759580	the brain. And it's really not touching itself that much. There
3759580	3763620	is a huge chasm running through the center of your brain,
3763780	3769260	separating it into two different halves. What if this is a huge
3769260	3774060	process of the observer window system, where your brain is
3774060	3780460	intentionally divided, right? The brain wants to create
3780460	3785940	cognitive dissonance. It wants competing narratives of self. And
3785940	3790740	by creating competing narratives, you encourage a greater
3790740	3795940	diversity of thought internally. And this leads to higher
3795940	3801340	intelligence through simulating more possibilities of what
3801340	3805500	could be out there of how to view and how to act. And this
3805500	3809180	would be maybe a evolutionarily beneficial thing to
3809180	3814700	create internally is a high, high, high modularity. You have
3814700	3818460	examples like split brain patients, right? If you cut the
3818460	3821860	brain in half, you cut the corpus callosum. These were
3821860	3825340	patients that had intractable epilepsy. So they were having a
3825340	3829860	lot of seizures. And so they cut the brain in half to try to
3829860	3832940	reduce the amount of seizures that these people were having.
3833340	3837060	And there's some really bizarre findings out of these patients.
3837420	3842260	Essentially, that immediately following the surgery, it appears
3842260	3846620	as if the individual now has two different personalities.
3846620	3849820	There's a lot of these like simple dissociations of
3849820	3852660	information coming in between different eyes or different
3852660	3856620	visual fields. The hands kind of being controlled by different
3856620	3860220	hemispheres. These are kind of like the simple things you learn
3860220	3863780	about in textbooks about split brain patients. But what you don't
3863780	3867740	learn as much about in standard textbooks is that following the
3867740	3871880	surgery, if you talk to people that work with these patients, it
3871880	3876980	appears as if there's two very distinct personalities co
3876980	3881600	habitating within the individual. All right. And
3881600	3885000	there's some pretty wild examples like one that VS
3885000	3890200	Ramachandran talks about, where people appear to display very
3890200	3894320	different belief systems. One hemisphere believes in God, the
3894320	3898600	other hemisphere does not. One hemisphere has like a funny sense
3898600	3902760	of humor. The other hemisphere is quite serious. You know,
3902760	3906600	there's a lot of internal conflict. And the stories you can
3906600	3909760	learn from people that work with these patients are quite
3909760	3913160	wild, right? And I feel like this is somewhat missed the
3913160	3919120	mainstream public discourse in a weird way. Partly, in my
3919120	3923920	opinion, because this is kind of fundamentally unsettling. In a
3923920	3927920	weird way, we don't want nested observer windows to be true.
3928120	3933080	Because it's so alien, and it feels so wrong to our naive
3933080	3936520	intuition of being a single individual. There's something
3936520	3940760	culturally preventing us from taking nested observer windows
3940760	3947040	seriously in a weird way. But is that just some cultural quirk, or
3947040	3952720	some bias that we've kind of grown into? And can you explain
3953280	3956920	two personalities coexisting within a single individual in
3956920	3960520	the split brain patients? Kind of bizarre. You also have the
3960520	3964720	inverse example. For example, Krista and Tatiana Hogan. These
3964720	3969360	are twins that are conjoined at the brain. So there is a
3969400	3974200	connection between the thalamus of these two girls, where
3974200	3978800	their skulls are fused and their brains are connected. And the
3978800	3983600	two girls are able to communicate telepathically with
3983600	3987040	each other. They can think thoughts and hear each other's
3987040	3990640	thoughts. They can allow each other to control each other's
3990640	3995200	bodies. They get annoyed at each other when they eat foods that
3995200	3999680	they don't like, right? They can tell each other jokes and have
3999680	4003880	you know, a fun time internally. And you know, I think this is
4003920	4007960	really interesting to ask the question, you know, are these two
4007960	4012520	girls one person, or are they two separate people? Probably
4012520	4016840	they're two separate people. However, it's quite strange that
4016840	4020800	they can communicate using just their minds. It's almost as if
4020800	4024520	there's two apex observer windows and a means of
4024520	4028440	communicating between the two apexes. And we might think to
4028440	4032840	ourselves, wow, this is so alien. This is so bizarre. I have no
4032840	4038960	idea what it would be like to be the Hogan twins. But if the
4038960	4042360	nested observer windows model is true, then you might actually
4042360	4044880	know what it's like to be the Hogan twins more than you might
4044880	4049560	realize. Maybe you're talking to yourself all the time when you
4049560	4053240	talk to your sub windows. Maybe you haven't had the experience
4053240	4056920	of having a lateral apex window, communicating between the
4056920	4061640	apexes. However, you have the experience of having sub windows
4061640	4064280	talking to each other and having internal conflict and
4064280	4069280	dialogue. So maybe it's not as foreign to your experience as
4069280	4073040	you might expect. I also think there's some really important
4073040	4077440	work occurring in the domain of psychotherapy to really
4077480	4083040	conceptualize the self as a family. So Richard Schwartz
4083040	4085800	developed what's called the internal family system
4085800	4090480	psychotherapy. He is a person working in the mental health
4090480	4096120	space. And he was working with family therapy. So he would take
4096160	4099480	a family that wanted to work through some of their issues
4099480	4104280	into his clinic. And he developed a method of having, you
4104280	4107160	know, different pairs of the family talk to each other work
4107160	4111480	through their differences. He crafted kind of a canonical
4111480	4115920	archetypal framework that most families appear to fall into.
4116200	4119920	There's different familial roles that people will take on in the
4119920	4124560	family. Bizarrely, what he discovered is this family based
4124560	4130440	psychotherapy was highly effective in the individual. So if
4130440	4136680	you took a single person, and you walked them through a family
4136680	4142840	based psychotherapy, you would realize or uncover that it is as
4142880	4147400	if there are different personalities internally, and
4147400	4154360	these forge the same canonical familial roles that you observe
4154360	4160680	in families. You have a family inside of your head, where
4160680	4165160	there's different personalities competing for space, competing
4165160	4171440	for time. And as you experience psychiatric illness, or cognitive
4171440	4176920	dissonance, it could be that there's some sort of battle debate
4176920	4183160	conflict between these different internal family members. And
4183160	4186960	this sounds completely bizarre. Maybe it's just a psychotherapy
4186960	4191720	that works. Hey, take it or leave it. Or it is metaphysically
4191720	4196440	ontologically reality, because there is a nested observer
4196440	4201240	window system inside of you. And if you dive into the observer
4201240	4207040	windows inside of your apex, these are your family members. You
4207040	4211720	have an internal family system of different sub windows with
4211720	4215280	different desires and goals, communicating with each other
4215280	4220720	throughout your entire life. You are a cooperative enterprise of
4220720	4226560	multiple competing, cooperating cognitive systems, feeding into
4226560	4231280	your experience. And this is the nesting within you that
4231280	4236000	explains who you are and what you're doing. What if you could
4236000	4240520	better characterize the different personalities that coexist
4240520	4245320	inside of you? Could you live a healthier, more productive life?
4246640	4250600	This is the, you know, the pitch of internal family systems.
4250600	4254240	Also, some really interesting cases, like dissociative
4254240	4258640	identity disorder or multiple personality disorder. So when I
4258640	4263560	was receiving clinical psychology training back in my postdoc,
4265240	4267920	I brought this up to some of my mentors, I was like, ooh, what
4267920	4270560	about multiple personality disorder? How does that, you
4270560	4275000	know, work in psychotherapy and in psychiatric illness? And
4275000	4278560	they told me, oh, that doesn't exist. That is made up from the
4278560	4282480	movies. There was a little bit more nuance to it. But essentially
4282480	4286880	the vibe or the impression was that multiple personality
4286880	4292640	disorder is not real. Okay. However, there's been a lot of
4292640	4297320	interesting reviews out recently. And I've talked to a couple
4297320	4301400	people who have, you know, loved ones with dissociative identity
4301400	4304560	disorder or who have worked with these patients or who are these
4304560	4309400	patients themselves. And I personally am fully convinced that
4309400	4314120	dissociative identity disorder is real. It really happens. But
4314120	4318880	let's wonder, you know, what is it that makes people so
4318880	4326480	resistive to DID being real? I think it's that metaphysically
4326480	4330880	ontologically, we don't have a way to make sense of this. It's
4330880	4335720	so bizarre to our intuition that we reject the premise that
4335720	4339440	this could ever be real. However, the nested observer
4339440	4343280	Windows model, of course, you know, has a way to account for
4343280	4348160	this. If the apex window experiences some really strong
4348160	4354320	trauma, then maybe it would dissolve. Maybe it would, you
4354320	4360720	know, loosen its grip slightly. And some of the sub windows
4360720	4367760	would take on a more viscerally real quality, right? The sub
4367760	4372520	windows are the multiple personality internal family
4372520	4379680	within all of us. And DID is not necessarily a complete
4380040	4385240	pathologicalization of, you know, reality. But there's some
4385240	4391320	truth in every psychiatric illness to our experience. And so
4391320	4397480	DID represents some component of us that maybe freaks us out.
4397480	4401480	Maybe we're not coming to terms with. But if there is this
4401480	4406840	rich internal cognitive nested hierarchical structure, then DID
4406880	4410720	is not impossible. It has a biological explanation. And
4410720	4414720	there's elements or components of their experience that
4414720	4419480	resonate and are true within your experience as well. It's not
4419480	4424080	so alien as to be impossible to empathize with or to
4424080	4428200	understand. So another phenomenon of relevance to the now
4428200	4432360	model, our topos and topomancers or the act of
4432400	4437480	topomancy. And so this is the intentional creation of an
4437480	4442560	imaginary friend. So these are people that actively and
4442560	4447680	willfully create a imaginary friend in their mind. And they
4447680	4451280	talk to this person, they listen to this person, they hang out
4451280	4455440	with this person. And this is not unlike the phenomenon of
4455440	4460720	children having very vivid and real imaginary friends in their
4460720	4467120	experience. And so topomancy is the as an adult intentional
4467120	4471880	creation of an imaginary friend. For what purpose? Well, for
4471880	4475880	fun, to deal with loneliness, maybe this is some sort of
4475880	4480920	coping strategy for your for your life. You know, whatever
4480920	4484520	your motivation for doing this, there's a growing community,
4484520	4489680	especially on Reddit, that is developing the skills related to
4489680	4494800	topomancy. And I think this is fascinating. In a way, this
4494800	4498920	lines up very well with the now model. Potentially, topos are
4498920	4504840	the recognition of a sub window internally, and encouraging a
4504840	4509040	sub window to take on its own voice, to take on its own
4509040	4513720	reality, and you encourage independence, separately from the
4513720	4517600	apex, or with a more direct line of communication with the apex.
4518040	4521600	So I think this is a really fascinating phenomenon and is
4521600	4525960	probably worth studying. So I'm talking with some people,
4525960	4529600	there's a few researchers out there, Tonya Lerman and Michael
4529600	4533920	Lifschitz, who are really diving into topos and topomancy. So I
4533920	4537800	think this is a really exciting area to kind of look at maybe
4537800	4541360	validating the now model. Alright, some other examples that
4541360	4546640	might be of relevance. There was some work recently, looking
4546680	4552560	into the octopus, for example, as a sort of exotic organism that
4552560	4557280	might show more of a hierarchical consciousness system than
4557280	4562240	humans display. So in the octopus, there is some pretty solid
4562240	4567680	evidence as of late, that the tentacles are semi autonomous,
4567960	4572480	they appear able to learn and act and behave somewhat
4572520	4577320	separately from the full organism. However, they can of
4577320	4581280	course be wrapped into the goal directed behavior of the full
4581280	4585280	octopus. And so this really like kind of in a beautiful way
4585280	4589320	exemplifies the now model, where you have semi autonomous
4589320	4595400	sub windows that are able to nest into the apex upon demand.
4595720	4601320	And maybe the octopus or other organisms might give us insight
4601320	4606640	into the human nested observer window framework, because there
4606640	4611560	might be different mechanism biological structures at play,
4611880	4616680	which tweak and change the expression of the biological
4616680	4620640	hierarchy. Maybe there's less cross frequency coupling, maybe
4620640	4623800	there's more autonomy at a lower level. And that would give
4623800	4629160	rise to a shift in what it is like to be this organism. But it
4629160	4633920	could be compared and contrasted with the human physiology. And
4633920	4637480	I think that is just a really fascinating new line of work to
4637480	4641680	dive into. Another philosopher neuroscientist, biologist on
4641680	4645920	this same kind of thought pattern is Michael Levin. Michael
4645920	4648600	Levin in his group have been doing some really great work
4648600	4652600	thinking about hierarchical information processing. And he
4652600	4656240	has these really bizarre xenobots, which are clumps of
4656240	4661400	cells that appear to form holistic organisms. And this is
4661400	4665360	super bizarre, right? There is no biological infrastructure to
4665360	4671440	make a xenobot. But it appears as if there is a macroscopic
4672040	4676280	structure that emerges from these clumps of cells. A different
4676280	4680400	approach as studying the octopus would be to look at the
4680400	4684880	emergence of maybe cross frequency coupling, some sort of
4684880	4689360	hierarchical consciousness system in these very simple models,
4689560	4694000	which might give us, you know, more novel insight. An important
4694000	4699080	question here, or a fun thing to think about is what is the
4699080	4705200	nature of consciousness in your brain? So the very safe, simple,
4705480	4710240	kind of naive one is what we call apex hierarchical
4710240	4714860	consciousness. This is the idea that you exist at the apex of
4714860	4719420	the hierarchy. And you are the only one that's conscious in your
4719420	4724880	brain. It's just you don't worry about those nested subsystems.
4725180	4729520	They are processing your cognition. But you're the only one
4729520	4733500	who's home. You're the only one that's conscious in your body.
4733540	4736900	Alternatively, there is a emergent hierarchical
4736900	4741940	consciousness, some threshold, where above this line, all of
4741940	4745980	these observer windows are conscious beings, your nested
4745980	4749440	observer windows are conscious, they have independent
4749440	4752580	experience from you, not fully independent, right? Because
4752580	4755980	there's some interaction, but they are conscious in and of
4755980	4760220	themselves. And then finally, there's some sort of panpsychic
4760220	4764140	hierarchical consciousness possibility, where every observer
4764140	4769340	window is a conscious being, period, full stop. However, you
4769340	4772780	know, the observer window requires synchrony. So there's
4772780	4776860	some threshold, some mechanism that needs to be at play to
4776860	4780140	create an observer window to create a conscious being. So
4780140	4782540	it's not that it like spontaneously consciousness can
4782540	4786820	just be everywhere. But you know, this still kind of holds some
4786820	4790100	sort of boundaries, some sort of condition for consciousness to
4790740	4794720	to be present. Alright, so I just want to end with a reference
4794720	4799360	to Daniel Dennett, who sadly recently passed away. He had
4799360	4803760	this idea called the Cartesian theater. And it's the idea that
4803760	4807800	you know, your naive sense of consciousness is that there is a
4807800	4811440	little little man in your head that's perceiving everything,
4811440	4814880	hearing everything, smelling everything, pulling the levers
4814880	4818880	moving the body around, he points out the confusion in this
4818880	4821880	that okay, if there is a little conscious being inside of your
4821880	4826840	body, wouldn't there need to be a smaller little conscious being
4826840	4830000	inside of that person's body? And then wouldn't there be an
4830000	4833200	even smaller conscious being inside of that person's body? And
4833200	4837080	there's an infinite regression of smaller and smaller people
4837080	4841080	inside of your mind. And so this is completely preposterous when
4841080	4844800	you need to do away with this simple notion of a theater of
4844800	4849040	experience. And he called this the homunculus problem, the
4849040	4853760	problem of having nested infinite consciousnesses. Well, the now
4853760	4858440	model right is very at odds with this. And so we you know,
4858440	4862800	think what if this is a homunculus solution? What if
4862800	4866920	there is a Cartesian multiplex? Instead of it having a
4866960	4870320	Cartesian single theater, there's only one show that's
4870320	4875600	playing. What if there are many shows, a multiplex or a
4875640	4880360	synaplex, a, a theatrical establishment with many movies
4880360	4884440	going on inside of your brain, the nested observer windows model
4884440	4889920	says there are many experiences internally. And you maybe are a
4889920	4893640	bit of a moviegoer popping between the many diverse
4893640	4898000	experiences happening inside of you. And there is maybe this
4898800	4904760	near infinite fractal of smaller beings nested inside of you. And
4904800	4908840	in that sense, it really would be turtles all the way down. Maybe
4908840	4912560	there's some floor, maybe it keeps going. And I think an
4912560	4915760	important question is, you know, could there be something bigger
4915760	4920520	than us, something larger than us going in the other direction?
4920880	4925040	Is there an observer window greater than the individual? And
4925040	4928800	at one point, I will have a couple episodes probably on the
4928800	4932640	concept of collective consciousness. Is there any
4932640	4937400	substance to the idea of a shared or collective experience? So
4937400	4943560	with that, wrapping up with the now model, check out the paper
4943560	4946520	for yourself. I think it's a really cool, exciting new
4946520	4950360	theory. Obviously, I do because I've, you know, poured a lot of
4950360	4953280	time and energy into this. I'm also want to, you know, point
4953280	4956720	out Jonathan Schueler is really a core contributor to these
4956720	4960480	ideas and to this model. And we're now looking at different
4960480	4964000	ways to test these theories in people with dissociative identity
4964000	4969040	disorder in people with tulpas in split brain patients, looking
4969040	4972480	at these low frequency integrations that are occurring
4972480	4977360	within your experience. So a lot of new research on the horizon.
4977680	4980520	And I will talk to you again very soon. Goodbye.
