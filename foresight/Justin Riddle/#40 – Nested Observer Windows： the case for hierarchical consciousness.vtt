00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
Welcome back to the show that tells you you are a quantum

00:03.160 --> 00:07.120
computer with free will supervising a vast hierarchy of

00:07.120 --> 00:10.920
cognitive systems. My name is Justin Riddle. And this is

00:10.920 --> 00:15.180
episode 40 of the quantum consciousness series. In today's

00:15.180 --> 00:18.560
episode, I'll be giving you an update of the nested observer

00:18.560 --> 00:23.360
Windows model and recapping a lecture I gave at the science

00:23.360 --> 00:27.960
of consciousness conference in April of 2024. By the end of

00:27.960 --> 00:32.000
today's episode, we'll ask the question, what is it like to be

00:32.000 --> 00:37.360
at the apex of a hierarchical consciousness? This episode is

00:37.360 --> 00:40.960
available on YouTube and an audio only version is available on

00:40.960 --> 00:44.480
Spotify and Apple podcast. If you like what you hear today,

00:44.480 --> 00:47.680

00:47.680 --> 00:50.360
a comment below or for the audio listener write a review.

00:58.120 --> 01:15.760
So today, I'm going to be basically recapping and giving

01:15.760 --> 01:19.400
you the same lecture that I gave at the science of consciousness

01:19.400 --> 01:24.200
conference in April of 2024. But I'll be giving it a little bit

01:24.200 --> 01:30.560
of an expanded version. You can find the original recording on

01:31.120 --> 01:35.240
on the internet, I'll provide a link that you can go look, you

01:35.240 --> 01:39.800
know, at the original version if you so desire. But essentially,

01:39.800 --> 01:45.000
this is a update to a previous episode on this channel that I

01:45.000 --> 01:50.800
gave. However, the manuscript is now published in the neuroscience

01:50.800 --> 01:54.720
of consciousness journal. I will also give a link to that

01:54.720 --> 01:58.680
paper it is open access so free to download and read for

01:58.680 --> 02:01.760
yourself. And this is work that I've done with Jonathan

02:01.760 --> 02:05.040
Schuehler. He's a professor at the University of California,

02:05.040 --> 02:10.120
Santa Barbara. So all of this work is collaborative with him. So

02:10.120 --> 02:14.440
without further ado, let's hop right into it. So the title of

02:14.440 --> 02:18.640
the paper is hierarchical consciousness, the nested observer

02:18.640 --> 02:23.640
windows model, or the now model for short. So to introduce this

02:23.640 --> 02:27.760
idea of hierarchical consciousness, because it is not,

02:27.920 --> 02:31.840
you know, usually a typical way that people imagine that the

02:31.840 --> 02:35.480
brain or the mind is organized. So I'll give you a quick

02:35.480 --> 02:40.960
example here. So when driving, you start to mind wander, pondering

02:40.960 --> 02:44.320
the nature of consciousness. Without warning, you suddenly

02:44.320 --> 02:47.560
realize you were almost at your destination. You wonder where

02:47.560 --> 02:51.560
the time went. Now your attention is focused on navigating

02:51.600 --> 02:55.400
the which freeway exit to get off, and on what side street to

02:55.400 --> 02:59.520
turn. You are acutely aware of the lack of awareness paid to

02:59.520 --> 03:03.480
driving. But you do not notice that the wandering mind kept

03:03.480 --> 03:06.160
wandering while you were focused on navigating the side

03:06.160 --> 03:10.600
streets. When parking your car, you revisit the wandering mind.

03:11.020 --> 03:14.560
There is a fresh batch of theories and models that seem to

03:14.560 --> 03:19.080
have materialized. You diligently proceed to review those new

03:19.080 --> 03:24.000
ideas, as you absentmindedly walk up the driveway. So this

03:24.000 --> 03:27.760
example is meant to sort of showcase a couple different

03:27.760 --> 03:33.080
ways in which we are not fully aware of all of the cognitive

03:33.080 --> 03:37.880
processes that are ongoing within our own mind. And it appears

03:37.880 --> 03:41.400
that there are many cognitive systems coexisting

03:41.440 --> 03:45.360
simultaneously in your mind. And you usually can only pay

03:45.360 --> 03:49.040
attention to one or a subset of these different cognitive

03:49.040 --> 03:53.800
systems. So a very common example is driving. A lot of the

03:53.800 --> 03:58.600
times we're flying down the freeway at 70 miles per hour. And

03:58.600 --> 04:03.080
we're barely paying attention to what we're doing. But this is

04:03.080 --> 04:07.240
kind of alarming, right? I mean, you could almost die at any

04:07.240 --> 04:11.840
moment if you lost control of your vehicle. And yet we consume

04:11.840 --> 04:16.720
our mind with fanciful ideas and and fun thought processes as

04:16.720 --> 04:20.520
we are driving. And it's very second nature to just kind of

04:20.520 --> 04:25.560
let your body take over the act of driving. And then at certain

04:25.560 --> 04:30.520
moments, you need to interrupt your mind wandering and pay

04:30.520 --> 04:33.760
attention to driving, you know, once again, and there's a way

04:33.760 --> 04:37.220
that your mind can get your attention gets you reengaged

04:37.220 --> 04:41.860
with the act of driving. And, you know, in the absence of

04:41.860 --> 04:46.580
that call to pay attention, you can freely wander your mind

04:46.580 --> 04:53.820
around. And in this example, we give kind of an additional way

04:53.820 --> 04:58.380
that your mind could be operating autonomously. And that is

04:58.380 --> 05:03.780
mind wandering itself. Could it be that there is a part of your

05:03.780 --> 05:09.300
mind that is maybe always wandering, always engaged in

05:09.300 --> 05:13.340
abstract thought. And when you pay attention to driving, let's

05:13.340 --> 05:16.180
say you need to navigate some side streets as you're going to

05:16.180 --> 05:19.460
your friend's house, you really need to pay attention to

05:19.460 --> 05:23.460
everything that you're doing. And then you revisit the wandering

05:23.460 --> 05:28.420
mind. And could it be that the wandering mind kept going when

05:28.420 --> 05:33.060
you were paying attention to driving? This is something that

05:33.060 --> 05:38.540
we much less often kind of attribute to what can be

05:38.540 --> 05:43.780
performed autonomously in our brains in our minds. However,

05:44.100 --> 05:48.380
why not? And I think if you were to introspect on your

05:48.380 --> 05:52.040
conscious experience, you'd probably be able to recognize

05:52.040 --> 05:56.020
many instances where there appears to be fully formed

05:56.020 --> 05:59.820
ideas that are, you know, springing into your mind

05:59.820 --> 06:03.260
springing into your attention. And you say, Hey, that was a

06:03.260 --> 06:07.020
great idea. I just had. But where did that idea really come

06:07.020 --> 06:11.820
from? Were you aware of the creation of that idea kind of

06:11.820 --> 06:16.780
from the ground up? Okay, so hierarchical consciousness is a

06:16.780 --> 06:20.820
very novel way of really thinking about you and your

06:20.820 --> 06:28.100
mind. So you are at the top, you are the apex of a hierarchical

06:28.100 --> 06:32.700
system. This means that there are systems nested within you.

06:32.980 --> 06:36.980
And within those systems, there are further subsystems nested

06:36.980 --> 06:41.460
within those. So what are some of the implications of

06:41.500 --> 06:46.180
hierarchical consciousness? And what is it like to be at the apex

06:46.180 --> 06:50.900
of a hierarchically consciousness system? So we often

06:50.940 --> 06:56.220
kind of naively conceptualize the mind as a monologue. There's a

06:56.220 --> 07:00.660
narrative stream, the story I'm telling myself as I go through

07:00.660 --> 07:05.140
my day. And while there's a lot of validity to the idea of a

07:05.140 --> 07:10.100
narrative monologue, there's also a lot of moments where our

07:10.100 --> 07:15.060
mind is more like a dialogue, right? When you're in your

07:15.060 --> 07:19.460
thoughts, and you're simulating these different ideas, you can

07:19.460 --> 07:23.820
go for minutes and minutes and minutes at a time, debating

07:23.820 --> 07:28.900
different positions, different ideas. And a lot of times we talk

07:28.900 --> 07:33.580
to ourselves, you are talking through some idea, hearing your

07:33.580 --> 07:37.340
own counterpoints to that idea. And it's as if there is a

07:37.340 --> 07:43.140
dialogue of multiple competing interests within us. It says if

07:43.140 --> 07:47.260
we have many different personalities, drives, views,

07:47.500 --> 07:51.180
ways of conceptualizing the world around us, and they're not

07:51.180 --> 07:54.860
necessarily compatible. And we're faced with a lot of

07:54.860 --> 08:02.180
conflict, inner conflict as we navigate new situations. What

08:02.180 --> 08:05.940
should we do here? What should we do there? Do we view this as

08:05.940 --> 08:09.180
you know, viewpoint A or viewpoint B? And there's a

08:09.180 --> 08:16.260
rich dialogue occurring internally. Another implication is

08:16.260 --> 08:19.900
that we often kind of have this idea that we're creating our

08:19.940 --> 08:23.500
thoughts. I thought this thought, this is my thought, we

08:23.500 --> 08:28.580
claim ownership over our thinking. You are building and

08:28.820 --> 08:32.940
constructing ideas. And once you have an idea, you proudly, you

08:32.940 --> 08:35.900
know, tell the world, ah, look at my idea, I've created this

08:35.900 --> 08:40.020
wonderful new product of my mind. And this is my product.

08:40.780 --> 08:44.900
However, there are many examples, if we're kind of honest

08:44.900 --> 08:49.700
with ourselves, where we just have an idea, and it seems to

08:49.700 --> 08:54.660
spring out of nowhere. There's no experience of creating the

08:54.660 --> 08:58.820
idea. It's like an epiphany moment, an idea is thrown into

08:58.820 --> 09:04.860
your mind. Could this be some sort of nested substructure,

09:04.860 --> 09:09.140
some cognitive system within you, that created and constructed

09:09.140 --> 09:12.340
and did a lot of the hard work, and then just presented you

09:12.340 --> 09:18.020
with an idea at the apex level. You still claim ownership over

09:18.020 --> 09:22.020
that idea. However, you weren't really a part of the creation

09:22.020 --> 09:28.220
process per se. Even more extreme, there are intrusive

09:28.220 --> 09:31.740
thoughts. Sometimes we have a thought and we say, Oh, I did

09:31.740 --> 09:36.500
not think that thought that was not me, my brain just generated

09:36.500 --> 09:40.260
this thought and I am not responsible for that thought

09:40.260 --> 09:44.500
whatsoever. This idea, this thought just occurred. But that,

09:44.540 --> 09:48.340
you know, that's not me. I delete that I will willingly

09:48.340 --> 09:53.300
suppress and remove that thought from my mind. And I also

09:53.580 --> 09:58.140
reject ownership. I am not an owner of this thought. It was

09:58.140 --> 10:01.660
something my brain generated. So this is also a very common

10:01.660 --> 10:05.220
place example that, you know, if you introspect, you'll you'll

10:05.220 --> 10:09.380
have many moments where you might not want to claim

10:09.380 --> 10:13.020
responsibility over your own thinking. And we also have this

10:13.060 --> 10:17.660
idea that we are in control of our bodies. You know, I choose

10:17.660 --> 10:21.340
to move around and I'm making this hand gesture with my hands.

10:21.620 --> 10:26.860
This is me controlling my body. However, I'm not really aware of

10:26.860 --> 10:31.340
what my hands are actually doing. I am initiating a cartoon

10:31.340 --> 10:36.380
version of what I want to happen. And then a very complex

10:36.420 --> 10:41.700
intricate muscle activation pattern then arises. And so I am,

10:41.860 --> 10:47.060
you know, in control of that to some degree. But I really don't

10:47.060 --> 10:50.740
understand any of the details of what my body is actually doing.

10:51.020 --> 10:54.500
And so on some level, you know, you're in control, but you're

10:54.500 --> 10:59.500
not as in control as you might think that you are. And if you

10:59.500 --> 11:02.580
really pay attention to what your body is doing, you will

11:02.580 --> 11:07.860
sometimes find these sort of automated or seemingly unconscious

11:07.860 --> 11:11.780
movements that your body is performing. And could it be that

11:11.780 --> 11:15.620
there are nested systems within you that are potentially kind

11:15.620 --> 11:20.180
of mediating your connection to the body. And when they act

11:20.220 --> 11:24.220
semi autonomously from your will, when you're, you know, not

11:24.220 --> 11:29.100
paying attention, there's some evidence of cognition or some

11:29.100 --> 11:34.260
sort of will or form in your body's movements, even if you're

11:34.260 --> 11:40.020
not fully consciously aware of what is occurring. So at the

11:40.020 --> 11:43.340
core of hierarchical consciousness is the idea that

11:43.380 --> 11:47.140
yes, you are a cognitive system. Yes, you are thinking. But

11:47.140 --> 11:51.100
within you are thinking cognitive systems. And they are

11:51.100 --> 11:53.980
providing you with this information with these

11:53.980 --> 11:58.180
cognitive streams. And you are supervising a bit of a

11:58.180 --> 12:03.900
corporation of subsystems within you. And this gives a very

12:03.940 --> 12:09.340
rich landscape to our internal experience. There are so many

12:09.340 --> 12:13.820
cognitive structures inside of you. And they all are acting in

12:13.820 --> 12:18.500
these very complex nuanced ways. And this sort of increases the

12:18.500 --> 12:24.180
richness, the variety of our inner life. And it gives a way of

12:24.180 --> 12:30.180
kind of understanding biology from a from a new lens. So now I'm

12:30.180 --> 12:34.860
going to dive into that kind of biological motivation. Alright,

12:34.860 --> 12:39.780
so where did this hierarchical consciousness idea come from? On

12:39.780 --> 12:43.860
some level, it came from introspection. But in another way,

12:44.220 --> 12:48.180
there is a really strong motivation for hierarchical

12:48.180 --> 12:54.260
consciousness that arises from our observations in biology and in

12:54.260 --> 13:01.380
neuroscience. Okay, so if we ask the question, where in the

13:01.380 --> 13:05.860
brain should we study consciousness, right? There are

13:05.860 --> 13:09.940
many different people that are neuroscientists. And yet they

13:09.940 --> 13:13.300
use very different tools, different systems that they're

13:13.300 --> 13:18.940
studying. And so, you know, we might make this kind of pitch

13:19.020 --> 13:27.220
of reductionism. Every system is reducible to a subsystem. Okay,

13:27.660 --> 13:32.860
a brain region is made out of neurons. A neuron is made out of

13:32.860 --> 13:37.820
synapses. Synapses are made out of proteins and proteins are made

13:37.820 --> 13:42.500
out of atoms and atoms are made out of quarks and the forces of

13:42.500 --> 13:46.940
particle physics. And so to understand a brain region, you

13:46.940 --> 13:48.900
shouldn't study the brain region. It's actually just

13:48.900 --> 13:51.700
neurons. You need to go study neurons. But you know, you

13:51.700 --> 13:55.180
can't really study neurons because they're just too big. And

13:55.220 --> 13:58.580
you know, they're not really real. Neurons are really just a

13:58.580 --> 14:01.420
bunch of synapses and electrical potentials. But to

14:01.420 --> 14:04.580
understand the electric potentials, you got to go study

14:04.580 --> 14:08.620
the synapses. But you know, synapses are really not real

14:08.620 --> 14:11.780
either. They're just made out of different proteins, different

14:11.780 --> 14:16.860
receptors. And the synapse really just emerges from the mass

14:16.860 --> 14:22.140
action of many, many protein receptors. So forget about the

14:22.140 --> 14:26.180
synapse, we got to go study proteins. And then proteins are

14:26.180 --> 14:29.500
really just emerging phenomenon of all these amino acids. And

14:29.500 --> 14:33.180
those are really constrained by these, you know, more atomic

14:33.180 --> 14:38.260
style chemical forces of organic chemistry. And then, you know,

14:38.260 --> 14:41.980
it's an infinite reduction, maybe down until you hit

14:41.980 --> 14:44.940
mathematics, or something like that. But then, oh, you know,

14:44.940 --> 14:49.580
math is just a construct of humans and human society. So

14:49.740 --> 14:54.380
really, there's this strong reductionist bias. And I would

14:54.380 --> 14:58.940
make the argument that this is sort of a naive thought to say

14:58.940 --> 15:01.780
that, you know, to study something, we have to go study

15:01.780 --> 15:05.460
the parts. Because eventually, we're all just particle

15:05.460 --> 15:08.580
physicists. And we're all going to our nearest, you know,

15:08.580 --> 15:13.140
particle accelerator. And no one is doing neuroscience, right?

15:13.420 --> 15:15.500
Then it's completely inappropriate to study the

15:15.500 --> 15:18.740
brain at all, because we should all just be particle

15:18.740 --> 15:22.300
physicists, right? So if you take reductionism to the ultimate

15:22.300 --> 15:28.300
extreme, it gets a little ridiculous. So right now, the

15:28.300 --> 15:33.340
status quo is that to study consciousness, you have to study

15:33.340 --> 15:38.220
neurons. And in a weird way, this is like a an assumption that

15:38.220 --> 15:41.780
people don't even admit that they have, right, there is a

15:41.780 --> 15:47.020
strong bias to say the brain is neurons. And you have to study

15:47.020 --> 15:51.020
neurons, right? But for the same reasons I just laid out with

15:51.020 --> 15:57.100
reductionism. Why study neurons? Why not study synapses and

15:57.100 --> 16:01.340
proteins? What is it that makes the neuron special? Well, you

16:01.340 --> 16:05.180
could say, Well, the neuron has the capacity for action

16:05.180 --> 16:08.700
potentials for these meaningful electrical potentials. It's that

16:08.780 --> 16:13.340
electrical property, which is so meaningful. However, there are

16:13.380 --> 16:17.300
very profound electrical properties at the level of

16:17.300 --> 16:22.220
functional brain regions of entire brain nuclei. Why in the

16:22.220 --> 16:27.300
world would you not be allowed to study brain nuclei? Why is it

16:27.300 --> 16:30.820
inappropriate to study brain nuclei? And yet it is completely

16:30.820 --> 16:35.020
appropriate to study neurons themselves, right? So moving in

16:35.020 --> 16:39.340
either direction, you can construct some rationality for

16:39.340 --> 16:45.100
that movement. However, all theories out there, you know, in

16:45.460 --> 16:51.260
status quo, typical neuroscience of consciousness are these kind of

16:51.260 --> 16:55.740
toy cartoon neurons. And so hierarchical consciousness is

16:55.740 --> 17:00.620
really making the pitch, you know, what if all of these levels

17:00.620 --> 17:04.700
were meaningfully contributing to conscious experience to the

17:04.700 --> 17:08.860
information processing of the brain? You can study brain nuclei,

17:09.260 --> 17:13.020
and you can study neurons, and you can study proteins. And more

17:13.020 --> 17:18.460
so, what if there was some system that actually allowed for

17:18.480 --> 17:23.660
information transfer between all these different levels? If you

17:23.660 --> 17:28.020
could transfer information across these levels, then perhaps

17:28.020 --> 17:32.420
there is genuine information processing happening at these

17:32.420 --> 17:37.140
different scales. And it might be different information that is

17:37.140 --> 17:41.380
being processed, right? As you move from these orders of

17:41.380 --> 17:47.340
magnitude of difference, there could be unique channels of

17:47.340 --> 17:51.140
information being processed at these different scales, and then

17:51.140 --> 17:55.540
some sort of meaningful exchange across levels. And so I

17:55.540 --> 17:59.300
think there's a pretty good motivation to say that this is

17:59.300 --> 18:04.740
happening in the brain. And then the follow up question would

18:04.740 --> 18:08.700
be, what does this mean for consciousness? What if there's a

18:08.700 --> 18:13.620
hierarchical biological system at play? How do we shove

18:13.620 --> 18:17.500
consciousness or how do we make sense of consciousness within

18:17.500 --> 18:21.300
that system? Could it be that there was some sort of

18:21.300 --> 18:26.180
cognition, esch processing occurring at all these different

18:26.180 --> 18:31.060
levels? And maybe there is even consciousness at multiple

18:31.060 --> 18:35.220
levels within the brain. Alright, so to kind of motivate a

18:35.220 --> 18:40.740
little bit of this theory of the evidence for it, I'm going to

18:40.740 --> 18:46.100
pivot a little bit to say, you know, what is the evidence that

18:46.100 --> 18:51.900
these large scale brain nuclei are real? Because in a strange

18:51.900 --> 18:54.660
way, or maybe it's not so strange, it might align with

18:54.660 --> 18:59.700
like just human bias of where the status quo is at. We are much

18:59.700 --> 19:06.300
more hesitant as a field to say that brain nuclei functional

19:06.300 --> 19:13.300
brain regions are real. Those get the label of epiphenomenal much

19:13.300 --> 19:16.740
more often than a neuron. There are very few people walking

19:16.740 --> 19:19.780
around saying neurons aren't real, they're just epiphenomenal.

19:19.980 --> 19:23.100
However, there's many people walking around saying functional

19:23.100 --> 19:26.060
brain regions aren't real, they just, you know, are kind of a

19:26.060 --> 19:31.380
circle we draw around the brain in one way or another. But

19:31.380 --> 19:35.260
really, we should all be studying neurons. So I like to give

19:35.260 --> 19:40.580
the example of a train. So if we were to imagine the brain as an

19:40.580 --> 19:45.740
engine as a train, what is it that pushes the brain train

19:45.740 --> 19:52.540
forward through time? What is the engine of the system? And status

19:52.580 --> 19:56.260
quo would say that the engine is neurons, there's a bunch of

19:56.260 --> 19:58.900
neurons, and they have electrical potentials, the

19:58.900 --> 20:02.980
spiking activities that are occurring, they release chemicals

20:02.980 --> 20:08.780
from one onto another, and then they react and activate based on

20:08.780 --> 20:15.180
this chemical signaling. However, if you put a recording device

20:15.260 --> 20:20.380
inside of the brain, you observe these large electrical

20:20.420 --> 20:26.220
fluctuations at the scale of entire populations of neurons.

20:26.740 --> 20:31.340
And what we used to think as a field is that these electrical

20:31.340 --> 20:35.180
fluctuations were just kind of the steam off of the brain

20:35.180 --> 20:41.020
train. These are epiphenomenal. They're not real signals. Well,

20:41.020 --> 20:43.820
there's signals in the sense that you can measure them, but

20:43.820 --> 20:47.060
they're not really doing anything, right? It's not

20:47.100 --> 20:53.540
contributing to the function of the brain. However, we now

20:53.580 --> 20:58.500
realize after some experimental work and after some theoretical

20:58.500 --> 21:03.300
work, that there might be a bit of a circular causation here

21:03.300 --> 21:07.580
where even if these electric fields at the scale of hundreds

21:07.580 --> 21:11.140
of thousands to millions of neurons, even if that's

21:11.140 --> 21:16.460
generated from the activity of smaller, you know, neurons

21:16.460 --> 21:19.780
themselves, and the mass collective action of these

21:19.780 --> 21:24.020
neurons, once the electric field has been generated, once it

21:24.020 --> 21:29.700
exists, it then exists independently of the individual

21:29.700 --> 21:34.780
neurons, and that electric field can then change and constrain

21:34.780 --> 21:38.540
the activity of neurons. And there's a little bit of a

21:38.540 --> 21:43.580
circular causation here. Neurons can cause electric fields.

21:43.780 --> 21:47.380
These electric fields can then change neurons. And it's not

21:47.380 --> 21:51.220
saying that one is primary, although maybe you could make

21:51.220 --> 21:53.980
the argument that you wouldn't have the electric field without

21:54.020 --> 22:00.180
the neurons. And that is, you know, likely true. However,

22:00.220 --> 22:05.260
they're, you know, they both are contributing meaningful to the

22:05.260 --> 22:09.460
processing of these systems. And there has been a lot of work

22:09.460 --> 22:15.820
lately, really diving into what do neural oscillations do for the

22:15.820 --> 22:19.380
brain and for cognition, and we're getting more and more

22:19.380 --> 22:22.540
evidence that they appear to be meaningfully related to

22:22.540 --> 22:26.500
cognition. So what I would make an argument to you, why should

22:26.500 --> 22:28.820
we care about these electric fields about these neural

22:28.820 --> 22:32.940
oscillations? Well, these neural oscillations are really the

22:32.940 --> 22:37.860
closest correlate that we have to cognition. So I'll give you a

22:37.860 --> 22:43.580
couple examples here. So one example is the theta oscillation

22:43.580 --> 22:48.980
that you can witness in sound waves. So as I am talking to

22:48.980 --> 22:53.340
you, if you were to record the words coming out of my mouth,

22:53.780 --> 22:58.580
you take that sound wave recording, and you break down

22:58.580 --> 23:02.380
the frequency domain, the frequency components of my

23:02.380 --> 23:06.540
speech, you'll see that there's a lot of rhythmic structure to

23:06.540 --> 23:11.820
the way that we talk to each other. And more so, if you zoom

23:11.820 --> 23:16.060
into individual words that I'm saying, there are different

23:16.060 --> 23:21.660
sound chunks in each of my words. And those sound chunks are

23:21.660 --> 23:26.900
coming at a very rhythmic rate across all different cultures

23:26.900 --> 23:31.740
that we've measured. People tend to speak at a very canonical

23:31.740 --> 23:36.980
rate. And there's a prominent theta frequency oscillation

23:37.220 --> 23:41.820
roughly between four and eight hertz across all these different

23:41.820 --> 23:47.420
languages that we can record from. And that rhythm is a very

23:47.420 --> 23:51.300
prominent rhythm in the sound waves. And we can find that

23:51.300 --> 23:55.180
rhythm from the sound waves in the electrical activity of the

23:55.180 --> 23:59.780
brain. And if we look at auditory cortex, for example, as I'm

23:59.780 --> 24:02.920
talking to you, your auditory cortex is rhythmically

24:02.920 --> 24:07.900
fluctuating in sync to the words that I am saying. So this is a

24:07.900 --> 24:13.180
really profound electrical property within the brain. And

24:13.180 --> 24:18.340
it really closely correlates to the type of information that is

24:18.340 --> 24:23.140
being processed in the world around us. And is it a

24:23.180 --> 24:27.700
coincidence that we all speak at a certain rhythm? And this

24:27.700 --> 24:31.900
rhythm is found all throughout the brain with various protein

24:32.500 --> 24:36.540
constituents that give rise to this rhythm. There's a really

24:36.540 --> 24:41.660
tight correspondence in frequency domain between our

24:41.660 --> 24:45.260
behaviors and the electrical properties of our brains

24:45.260 --> 24:49.420
themselves, which might suggest that, you know, our brains are

24:49.420 --> 24:53.020
helping us produce language. There's some electrical

24:53.020 --> 24:57.540
determinants, some biological brain determinants for our

24:57.540 --> 25:01.660
speech. And then, you know, we're tuned into these rhythms in

25:01.660 --> 25:05.300
our environment. Another example comes from the visual

25:05.300 --> 25:09.360
cortex. So in the back of your brain, there is a electrical

25:09.360 --> 25:13.380
rhythm called the alpha oscillation. This is occurring

25:13.380 --> 25:17.540
roughly around 10 times per second, 10 hertz. And if you

25:17.540 --> 25:20.620
measure visual cortex, you'll find this big prominent

25:20.620 --> 25:24.300
electrical wave traveling through your visual cortex. And

25:24.300 --> 25:27.660
what people have found in one example experiment is that if

25:27.660 --> 25:31.900
you flash a light really quickly, there's a certain rate at

25:31.900 --> 25:35.140
which if I flash the light really quickly, you will

25:35.140 --> 25:38.820
perceive it as a single flash, versus if it's a little bit

25:38.820 --> 25:43.260
slower, you perceive it as two separate flashes. And there's a

25:43.260 --> 25:47.460
certain time point at which it crosses over from being

25:47.460 --> 25:51.820
two flashes into getting fused into a single flash. And this

25:51.820 --> 25:57.300
is the flicker into fusion rate. And this is roughly around

25:57.300 --> 26:02.060
100 milliseconds in the average individual. And what people

26:02.060 --> 26:06.300
have found is that the rate at which your visual cortex is

26:06.300 --> 26:12.420
fluctuating is correlated with your flicker fusion rate. So the

26:12.460 --> 26:18.060
time at which you shift from a flicker into a fusion is related

26:18.060 --> 26:21.500
to the ongoing electrical fluctuations in your visual

26:21.500 --> 26:26.220
cortex. So what this means is there's basically a one to one

26:26.220 --> 26:31.980
correspondence between visual awareness, refreshes, and the

26:31.980 --> 26:36.700
electrical activity in your brain. If the flashes show up in

26:36.700 --> 26:40.460
different refreshes, then you have the experience of two

26:40.460 --> 26:44.540
separate flashes. But if both flashes end up in one electrical

26:44.540 --> 26:47.780
fluctuation in your visual cortex, then you just have the

26:47.780 --> 26:52.900
experience of a single flash fused together. So this is quite

26:52.900 --> 26:56.620
wild, right? I mean, this is basically saying that your visual

26:56.620 --> 27:00.540
awareness, the perception that you're having right now of

27:00.540 --> 27:05.660
visual information is actually flickering and updating. And we're

27:05.660 --> 27:10.380
maybe not aware of this update in our experience. And you know,

27:10.380 --> 27:12.620
I would argue that maybe it's because you're a little bit

27:12.620 --> 27:18.540
slower up at the apex, but more on that a little bit later. And

27:18.540 --> 27:24.060
this is directly related to the cognitive processing within your

27:24.060 --> 27:28.620
system, right? So to be reductive and say, Well, who cares

27:28.620 --> 27:31.100
about these electric field fluctuations, we got to dive into

27:31.100 --> 27:35.100
the neurons because the neurons are all that matters. Well, we

27:35.100 --> 27:38.860
have a very strong tight correlation between the electric

27:38.860 --> 27:44.940
fields in this large brain structure and your experience. So

27:44.940 --> 27:50.140
what evidence can we make that there is a strong correspondence

27:50.380 --> 27:54.260
more so than just correlation, right? Because just because we

27:54.260 --> 27:57.180
can measure something and just because something is correlated

27:57.460 --> 28:03.100
doesn't mean that it's really or causally related to the thing

28:03.100 --> 28:07.500
itself. So electrical activity happens, cognition happens as

28:07.500 --> 28:12.340
well, these two phenomenon or correlated to each other. And so

28:12.340 --> 28:17.100
the way that we can test this in the laboratory, and my lab

28:17.140 --> 28:21.660
does, you know, exactly this, we will deliver what's called

28:21.660 --> 28:26.020
noninvasive brain stimulation, and we can do this in humans,

28:26.940 --> 28:31.620
where we can deliver a brief magnetic pulse to the brain. And

28:31.620 --> 28:36.340
that causes a brief electric current to arise within a part

28:36.340 --> 28:41.740
of cortex. And if we apply these brief pulses at a certain

28:41.940 --> 28:48.140
spacing, right, then what we find is that we can very

28:48.140 --> 28:52.380
selectively drive these electric field fluctuations in the

28:52.380 --> 28:56.900
brain, where the repeated application of multiple pulses

28:57.140 --> 29:01.220
will start to build up and ramp up an electric field

29:01.220 --> 29:06.180
fluctuation. So here I'm including a image of you know,

29:06.180 --> 29:10.260
some data that was recently published from my group, where

29:10.260 --> 29:14.100
we essentially show just this that if you're delivering brief

29:14.140 --> 29:17.380
magnetic pulses to the brain, and you're recording the electrical

29:17.380 --> 29:20.980
activity in the brain region that you're targeting, you can see

29:20.980 --> 29:24.620
a ramp up in these electric fields. And what's really

29:24.620 --> 29:28.500
interesting is then we can actually change and shift

29:28.500 --> 29:33.420
cognition as a function of just the frequency that we're

29:33.420 --> 29:38.580
targeting in the brain. And you know, in my day job, I'm a

29:38.580 --> 29:43.100
cognitive neuroscientist and a lot of my work is delivering

29:43.100 --> 29:47.220
frequency specific brain stimulation in human participants

29:47.540 --> 29:52.380
in order to alter or change their cognition. And the idea is

29:52.380 --> 29:56.660
that this is a way of building causal evidence for these

29:56.660 --> 30:01.020
macroscopic electric fields in the brain. It's not just

30:01.020 --> 30:05.220
reducible to neurons, but by changing these electric fields,

30:05.460 --> 30:10.580
we change cognition. So this is building much stronger evidence

30:10.820 --> 30:14.820
that these electric fields are directly related to the cognitive

30:14.820 --> 30:19.580
processing within the brain. So my work and that of others is

30:19.580 --> 30:24.460
really trying to validate this highest level or one of the top

30:24.460 --> 30:29.260
levels within the biological hierarchy, the level of functional

30:29.260 --> 30:33.540
brain regions of electric field fluctuations roughly between 10

30:33.540 --> 30:38.940
Hertz and two Hertz, this low frequency range in the brain

30:39.340 --> 30:44.900
really is real. It's doing something for cognition. It is

30:44.900 --> 30:50.060
a part of the engine of the brain. It is not just the steam

30:50.060 --> 30:54.860
emanating from the brain, but it is really doing something for

30:54.860 --> 30:58.300
cognition for our experience. And I think what is really

30:58.300 --> 31:04.140
exciting about this work is that, you know, we have a very slow

31:04.180 --> 31:08.300
reality, we're thinking our thoughts, we're pondering things,

31:08.740 --> 31:12.820
our thoughts occur at the scale of multiple seconds, we're

31:12.820 --> 31:17.460
perceiving things at the scale of sub seconds, doing analyses

31:17.460 --> 31:20.500
like these and doing experiments like these really

31:20.500 --> 31:24.300
build evidence that that low frequency electrical activity in

31:24.300 --> 31:29.340
the brain is meaningfully related to cognition is meaningfully

31:29.340 --> 31:34.620
related to the processing of the brain. And it one to one

31:34.620 --> 31:39.700
relates to our experience of being a human being inside of

31:39.700 --> 31:44.140
our brains. So the next question here is, is there a way to

31:44.140 --> 31:48.900
communicate from one scale to another scale? And this is where

31:48.900 --> 31:53.980
the concept of cross frequency coupling comes in. So cross

31:53.980 --> 31:57.460
frequency coupling is saying that there's coupling between two

31:57.460 --> 32:03.020
different frequencies across those frequencies. And this was

32:03.020 --> 32:07.820
first observed in rodents with invasive recordings of the

32:07.820 --> 32:11.460
hippocampus, which is a part of the brain involved in spatial

32:11.460 --> 32:16.860
navigation. And what was found was that there are these big

32:16.860 --> 32:21.540
electric field fluctuations in the hippocampus, as rats are

32:21.540 --> 32:26.700
navigating mazes, and simultaneous to those big theta

32:26.700 --> 32:30.780
frequency electric field fluctuations, you also have

32:30.780 --> 32:36.940
neurons that are coding for individual locations in space. So

32:36.940 --> 32:40.540
these are called place cells. And so you'll have, for example,

32:40.540 --> 32:45.740
neuron A fires when you're in location A, you have neuron B

32:45.740 --> 32:50.380
that fires when you're in location B, neuron C in location

32:50.380 --> 32:54.780
C, neuron D in location D. And what you find is that in the

32:54.780 --> 33:00.180
hippocampus, there is a sequential activation neuron A,

33:00.180 --> 33:04.380
the neuron B, the neuron C, the neuron D, as the rat is sitting

33:04.380 --> 33:08.860
at location A and thinking about the future of their movement

33:09.060 --> 33:12.220
through location A and to B and to C and to D. And there's a

33:12.220 --> 33:18.100
sequential activation of these neurons firing. And the sequence

33:18.100 --> 33:23.500
of firing is occurring within a theta rhythm. So it says if the

33:23.500 --> 33:30.780
brain is going ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, there's a rhythmic

33:30.780 --> 33:35.300
activation of these place cells being activated through time.

33:35.700 --> 33:40.980
And so this is the first observation of cross frequency

33:40.980 --> 33:45.660
coupling between the scale of neurons and the scale of the

33:45.660 --> 33:52.740
hippocampus. And the neurons are inside of the hippocampus. But

33:52.980 --> 33:59.100
you can now decode a trajectory of motion, a movement of the

33:59.100 --> 34:04.340
animal from the electric field activity on its own. And

34:04.380 --> 34:07.620
granted, you know, all these neurons are coding for

34:07.620 --> 34:12.260
information and building and, you know, projecting information

34:12.260 --> 34:16.540
into these electric fields. And then the electric field is

34:16.540 --> 34:21.180
sort of an abstract representation of all that

34:21.180 --> 34:25.220
information at the lower level. So I think what's really

34:25.220 --> 34:30.620
interesting here is that you've built a trajectory of motion

34:30.620 --> 34:36.820
from locations, right? This is not a more complex location. This

34:36.820 --> 34:44.380
is a abstraction away from location into movement. Movement

34:44.380 --> 34:50.140
is like a higher concept than a location. And so we have the

34:50.140 --> 34:55.180
construction of a higher order abstract concept from lower

34:55.180 --> 35:01.500
order information. And maybe cross frequency coupling, the

35:01.500 --> 35:06.020
co occurrence of fast neuron activity nested within low

35:06.020 --> 35:09.940
frequency electric field activity, and the coupling the

35:09.940 --> 35:15.220
systematic relationship between these levels. This is evidence

35:15.500 --> 35:20.140
of some sort of mechanism, some sort of means of information

35:20.140 --> 35:26.300
transfer between nested systems one within the other. This

35:26.300 --> 35:29.660
example that I've shown you is called phase amplitude

35:29.660 --> 35:34.100
coupling, where the phase of the theta frequency basically where

35:34.100 --> 35:39.060
you are in a single cycle is related to the amplitude, the

35:39.060 --> 35:43.960
activation of these neurons. And it says if the low frequency

35:43.960 --> 35:48.820
signal is kind of sequencing the higher frequency signal. And

35:48.820 --> 35:52.820
there's been a lot of work since this original rodent work on

35:52.820 --> 35:57.380
the hippocampus finding cross frequency coupling in memory

35:57.380 --> 36:02.300
processing, working memory, long term memory, attention,

36:02.500 --> 36:05.860
decision making, there's many, many examples that we've now

36:05.860 --> 36:11.060
observed of these big, low frequency, entire brain regions,

36:11.060 --> 36:14.300
entire networks of brain regions, coupling to more

36:14.300 --> 36:19.420
microscopic scales. So the next question is, you know, okay, we

36:19.420 --> 36:23.340
can measure these correlations, but is it quote unquote, real?

36:23.660 --> 36:28.380
Do we have causal evidence for cross frequency coupling? We can

36:28.380 --> 36:30.540
use the same magnetic stimulation approach that I

36:30.540 --> 36:33.980
told you about just previously. But we can also use what's

36:33.980 --> 36:38.500
called transcranial electrical stimulation. And this is

36:38.500 --> 36:42.380
something that my lab also uses actively. And there's been many

36:42.380 --> 36:45.740
people, you know, using this tool. But essentially, you can

36:45.740 --> 36:49.900
deliver electric current to the brain that's designed to mimic

36:50.140 --> 36:53.140
these endogenous coupling patterns that you observe in the

36:53.140 --> 36:58.460
brain. So one example that I'll show for you right now is we

36:58.460 --> 37:02.620
can observe cross frequency coupling between one signal and

37:02.620 --> 37:07.080
another signal, we can extract the peak frequency of that

37:07.080 --> 37:12.220
coupling in a human participant using EEG. And then we

37:12.220 --> 37:18.060
can derive a electrical stimulation waveform based on

37:18.060 --> 37:22.780
our observation in EEG, and then deliver electrical

37:22.780 --> 37:28.820
stimulation back into the brain to then change and enhance the

37:28.820 --> 37:32.660
endogenous cross frequency coupling, and then change

37:32.660 --> 37:37.940
people's cognition. So the example I'm showing you here, you

37:37.940 --> 37:41.380
can go check out the papers if you're interested. But this was

37:41.380 --> 37:44.860
a cognitive control tasks where people had to, you know,

37:44.860 --> 37:48.820
memorize a bunch of different rules and use context. And

37:48.820 --> 37:52.140
there was sort of a multi stage decision making process that

37:52.140 --> 37:56.260
they had to engage with. And there were numerous cross

37:56.260 --> 37:59.140
frequency coupling signals emerging from the brain. There

37:59.140 --> 38:04.180
was a perception control signal and action control signal. And

38:04.180 --> 38:08.620
we differentially targeted either the perceptual control

38:08.620 --> 38:11.300
cross frequency coupling signal or that motor control

38:11.300 --> 38:15.940
signal. And we could change behavior in a very systematic

38:15.940 --> 38:20.500
way based on what frequency we were targeting, either that

38:20.500 --> 38:24.340
motor control frequency or that perception control frequency.

38:24.420 --> 38:29.740
Alright, so we have causal evidence for cross frequency

38:29.740 --> 38:33.900
coupling for these interactions between many different stages

38:33.900 --> 38:38.260
or scales in the brain. And so the question now is what does

38:38.260 --> 38:41.700
this mean for consciousness? So in the nested observer

38:41.700 --> 38:47.220
windows model, at the core of this model, is this idea of a

38:47.220 --> 38:52.780
nested hierarchy? And this is directly motivated by cross

38:52.780 --> 38:57.620
frequency coupling. And so the primary question in hierarchical

38:57.620 --> 39:01.860
consciousness is what does it mean if we were to take cross

39:01.860 --> 39:06.980
frequency coupling very, very seriously, right? Cross frequency

39:07.020 --> 39:12.380
coupling is not only real, but it is a fundamental property of

39:12.380 --> 39:16.100
what it means to be a conscious being. So what if cross

39:16.100 --> 39:20.660
frequency coupling was very, very, very much real? And what

39:20.660 --> 39:24.740
that would imply is that there is information processing

39:24.740 --> 39:30.180
occurring at a slow, big scale, and information processing

39:30.180 --> 39:34.340
happening at a faster, smaller scale, and these systems are

39:34.340 --> 39:39.100
nested within each other. So the metaphor we use to describe

39:39.100 --> 39:44.380
this is mosaic tiling. So in mosaic tiling, you have an image

39:44.380 --> 39:48.620
that is made out of mosaic tiles. These are different smaller

39:48.620 --> 39:53.180
tiles, and the collage of all these tiles together produces an

39:53.180 --> 40:00.020
image, a mosaic image. And what we suggest is what if there is a

40:00.020 --> 40:06.060
recursively nested mosaic tiling, where every image is made

40:06.100 --> 40:11.460
out of images, where those images are then mosaic tiles of

40:11.460 --> 40:17.180
even smaller images, and the pattern repeats recursively as

40:17.180 --> 40:22.220
you zoom into an image. So what this means is that your

40:22.220 --> 40:28.820
cognitive system, your experience is a collage of all of

40:28.820 --> 40:33.060
these different cognitive systems within you. And all these

40:33.060 --> 40:37.300
cognitive systems are bubbling up into your experience. And

40:37.300 --> 40:43.940
collectively, they form you as this collage of cognition. But

40:43.940 --> 40:49.220
if you were to dive into any one of these cognitive threads, you

40:49.220 --> 40:53.900
would find that that is in and of itself, a collage of more

40:53.900 --> 40:59.140
microscopic cognitive sub processes, and so on and so forth

40:59.140 --> 41:03.500
as you zoom into smaller and smaller systems. So the nested

41:03.500 --> 41:09.500
observer windows model is basically saying that you are an

41:09.500 --> 41:15.900
observer window, you are a bounded space of cognition. And

41:15.900 --> 41:21.020
within you are nested sub windows. And within those are more

41:21.020 --> 41:25.300
sub windows. And there's a recursive process of nesting

41:25.620 --> 41:30.540
motivated by the observations from modern cognitive neuroscience

41:30.740 --> 41:35.020
for a role of cross frequency coupling in cognition. So the

41:35.020 --> 41:39.260
now model in order to get to the point where we can talk about

41:39.260 --> 41:44.420
these nested systems, we need a couple other metaphors, a couple

41:44.460 --> 41:48.340
other mechanisms to kind of flesh out the model to be

41:48.340 --> 41:52.340
complete. So the first metaphor is mosaic tiling. This is what

41:52.340 --> 41:57.100
I already spelled out for you. The next metaphor is a theater.

41:57.420 --> 42:04.140
We need a boundary around a cognitive system. And we use the

42:04.140 --> 42:09.060
metaphor of a theater. And we call this an observer window. This

42:09.060 --> 42:15.780
is a spatio temporally bounded system. And within it, there is

42:15.780 --> 42:21.220
a holistic gestalt representation. There is sort of a

42:21.220 --> 42:26.940
wholeness to what it is like to be an observer window. And

42:26.940 --> 42:32.140
there's some boundary around the system that excludes the rest

42:32.460 --> 42:36.780
of reality to say that either you're in the window or you're

42:36.780 --> 42:41.100
not. And if you're in the window, you are bound together into a

42:41.100 --> 42:46.180
single observer, a single frame of reference. Now, because there

42:46.180 --> 42:53.540
is this nesting structure, what this really needs also to have

42:54.380 --> 42:59.980
is a mechanism for dialogue or communication between observer

42:59.980 --> 43:05.540
windows that are within the same scale. So it might be that you

43:05.540 --> 43:09.700
at the apex, you're at the top, you're the the head honcho

43:09.740 --> 43:13.420
observer window. As you zoom in, there's a bunch of cognitive

43:13.420 --> 43:18.780
systems coexisting. But more so those cognitive systems, they

43:18.780 --> 43:22.940
can communicate up to you to the observer window. But they also

43:22.940 --> 43:28.380
need to communicate laterally to each other. And this requires a

43:28.380 --> 43:31.780
different mechanism than just communicating up to the top

43:31.780 --> 43:35.340
observer window or down to a sub observer window. You're

43:35.340 --> 43:39.420
talking to your peers. And this we use the metaphor of

43:39.420 --> 43:43.620
dialogue. And so there are three mechanisms that we propose in

43:43.620 --> 43:47.500
the nested observer windows model. The first mechanism I

43:47.500 --> 43:50.100
already talked to you about this is cross frequency

43:50.100 --> 43:54.220
coupling. This is a means of transferring information up and

43:54.220 --> 43:58.660
down the nested hierarchy. You can have a emergence of

43:58.660 --> 44:02.780
information from the lower order into the higher order. You

44:02.780 --> 44:06.940
can also have a submergence of information from you or from a

44:06.940 --> 44:12.780
sub window down into the smaller faster windows. And this is a

44:12.780 --> 44:17.500
means of sending control signals down into your sub

44:17.500 --> 44:23.620
structures. Now the formation of an observer window, we use a

44:23.620 --> 44:28.580
mechanism called synchrony. This is a zero phase lag

44:28.580 --> 44:33.380
connection between all the components of a system. Very

44:33.380 --> 44:36.700
simply put, it means that everything within an observer

44:36.700 --> 44:42.300
window is perfectly synchronized. There is a zero lag

44:42.300 --> 44:47.140
synchronization, where all the sub components form the whole

44:47.140 --> 44:50.220
component. And this is something that we kind of

44:50.220 --> 44:56.060
intuitively assume is the case. When you call a thing a thing,

44:56.500 --> 44:59.580
you kind of assume that everything in that thing is

44:59.740 --> 45:03.940
synchronized and acting as if it was one thing. Here, we're

45:03.940 --> 45:08.900
kind of formalizing that and saying that synchrony is the

45:08.900 --> 45:12.780
foundation for creating one of these observer windows. This is

45:12.780 --> 45:17.860
very similar to wolf singers, binding by synchronization, the

45:17.860 --> 45:21.820
idea that you can create a gestalt representation, a single

45:22.100 --> 45:26.260
meaningful construct through synchrony, through

45:26.260 --> 45:29.900
synchronization. So we're really just building off of and

45:29.900 --> 45:35.660
using wolf singers mechanism here. And then finally, we have

45:35.660 --> 45:40.620
coherence. Coherence is the mechanism for dialogue or

45:40.620 --> 45:45.300
communication. This is very much akin to Pascal freezes,

45:45.500 --> 45:49.580
neuronal communication through neuronal coherence. The idea is

45:49.580 --> 45:53.700
that two systems that are fluctuating will will communicate

45:53.700 --> 45:56.900
to each other. This isn't that they're so synchronized that

45:56.900 --> 46:01.620
they fuse and become one thing. But there is a non zero phase

46:01.620 --> 46:05.540
lag between the two systems, where one is kind of talking

46:05.540 --> 46:09.820
while the other listens and vice versa, they're coordinating

46:09.860 --> 46:14.100
their processing through time, their dynamics. But they are not

46:14.100 --> 46:18.380
fully synchronizing and fusing into into one another. So we

46:18.380 --> 46:21.940
updated communication through coherence to use the word

46:21.940 --> 46:26.060
dialogue through coherence. It really is the same as Pascal

46:26.060 --> 46:30.920
freezes method or his mechanism. However, we think dialogue

46:30.920 --> 46:33.900
kind of preserves a little bit more of the autonomy of the

46:33.900 --> 46:37.700
individuals, instead of viewing these as like switchboards in a

46:37.700 --> 46:42.100
in a circuit diagram. Instead, they're kind of autonomous

46:42.100 --> 46:46.340
beings or autonomous cognitive systems that are like talking to

46:46.340 --> 46:50.620
each other, rather than fusing with some sort of direct wire

46:50.620 --> 46:54.500
connection. All right, an important caveat slash question

46:54.500 --> 47:01.060
here is, you know, we propose synchrony, coherence, cross

47:01.060 --> 47:05.900
frequency coupling as the core mechanisms in the now model.

47:06.300 --> 47:11.380
However, we want to kind of caution that we don't really

47:11.380 --> 47:16.940
think that these mechanisms are sufficient to create

47:16.940 --> 47:21.700
consciousness. We think that these are necessary mechanisms

47:21.700 --> 47:25.300
for communication across scales for the formation of an

47:25.300 --> 47:28.340
observer window for communication between observer

47:28.340 --> 47:31.940
windows. However, just because you have stuff that is

47:31.940 --> 47:36.180
synchronized, we don't think you're spontaneously just gonna

47:36.380 --> 47:39.780
have consciousness anywhere that you have an electric field.

47:41.580 --> 47:45.780
There's probably a little bit more to it than that. If you've

47:45.780 --> 47:49.580
been watching my YouTube channel, then you'll know that I am

47:49.580 --> 47:53.380
very much fascinated and interested in theories of

47:53.380 --> 47:57.220
quantum consciousness, the idea that quantum computers might be

47:57.220 --> 48:01.900
somehow core to the nature of reality and to the nature of

48:01.900 --> 48:06.340
consciousness fundamentally. So I'm kind of holding out that

48:06.340 --> 48:10.380
there are, you know, more mechanisms that we will discover

48:10.380 --> 48:14.300
to be really at the core of what it means to be a conscious

48:14.300 --> 48:20.060
being. However, in the meantime, we got to go out there and do

48:20.060 --> 48:23.580
some cognitive neuroscience. And there's a lot of tools and

48:23.580 --> 48:27.660
methods we can use from cognitive neuroscience like

48:27.660 --> 48:31.380
non-invasive brain stimulation, like the observations made

48:31.380 --> 48:35.140
with EEG or fMRI or invasive recordings, optogenetics, you

48:35.140 --> 48:37.780
know, there's a lot of great tools out there. So we think

48:37.780 --> 48:41.540
that, you know, there's a lot of work to be done just by viewing

48:41.540 --> 48:46.980
these as necessary signals related to consciousness, even if

48:46.980 --> 48:51.660
they're not sufficient to create consciousness outright in a

48:51.660 --> 48:56.220
sort of generative way. But I think it's a really honest

48:56.220 --> 49:01.100
portrayal of where the value of the theory is. There's a lot to

49:01.100 --> 49:04.500
be done in this moment right now with the tools that we have.

49:04.780 --> 49:09.900
And there's room in the future to incorporate new ideas that

49:09.900 --> 49:14.420
inevitably will be emerging from advancements in technology and

49:14.420 --> 49:17.580
in science. Alright, so let's dive a little bit more into the

49:17.580 --> 49:22.700
phenomenology. What is it like to live at the apex of a

49:22.700 --> 49:28.260
hierarchical consciousness system? So one way in which it is

49:28.260 --> 49:32.740
like to be the top of this nested observer window hierarchy is

49:32.740 --> 49:38.060
that ideas will just pop into your mind fully formed. This is a

49:38.060 --> 49:41.860
pattern of emergence. So what does it mean to receive

49:41.860 --> 49:46.820
information via cross frequency coupling? Maybe it would feel

49:47.180 --> 49:51.500
like a light bulb going off in your head. Bam, there's an idea.

49:51.620 --> 49:55.820
There's a fully formed, fully fleshed out concept right there

49:55.820 --> 50:00.340
in front of you, right? The emergence process would kind of

50:00.580 --> 50:07.020
abstract away the lower levels. You are really only aware of

50:07.020 --> 50:12.300
maybe one layer deep into your brain, maybe two layers deep

50:12.300 --> 50:16.140
into your brain. But once you get to three layers deep or even

50:16.140 --> 50:21.220
two layers deep, probably it gets a lot more murky to kind of

50:21.220 --> 50:25.300
see the origin of all this information. Another way that

50:25.300 --> 50:31.220
it's like to be at the apex is we initiate a very cartoon image

50:31.540 --> 50:35.380
of what we want to do. So let's imagine you're playing tennis

50:35.620 --> 50:38.220
and you got to run to the other side of the court, swing your

50:38.220 --> 50:43.540
racket. How aware are you of all the muscle activations of all

50:43.540 --> 50:47.860
the groups in your in your hand, in your legs? We are

50:47.860 --> 50:51.980
initiating cartoons in our minds. You know, and I think

50:51.980 --> 50:56.620
cartoons are a very apt way of kind of thinking about apex

50:56.620 --> 51:01.020
life. You know, your apex is a cartoon diagram. It exists at a

51:01.020 --> 51:07.260
very abstract level. And yet it has access to all the details.

51:08.060 --> 51:14.460
So we perceive HD reality, we perceive fast, high detail

51:14.460 --> 51:20.340
information, and we generate very complex movements. However, we

51:20.340 --> 51:23.860
experience these at a very abstract level. So one of the

51:23.860 --> 51:27.860
beautiful things about the now model is that you can kind of

51:27.980 --> 51:32.220
have your cake and eat it to in the sense that you are very

51:32.220 --> 51:38.420
slow. And yet the data within your mind is very fast. So we get

51:38.460 --> 51:43.180
all of the rich details of all the brain regions, all of the

51:43.180 --> 51:47.140
neurons, all the proteins, all that information processing

51:47.140 --> 51:51.740
that's bubbling up the hierarchy, you get access to it, you get

51:52.020 --> 51:56.500
all of that information. And it's very fast, except you are

51:56.500 --> 52:00.660
very slow. And there's no contradiction here, right? This

52:00.660 --> 52:03.380
is a way of integrating information across very

52:03.380 --> 52:07.900
different time scales. And you can think and act very slowly.

52:08.180 --> 52:12.260
And yet you can propagate that down into the lower levels.

52:12.300 --> 52:15.540
Another example of what it's like to be at the apex, we have

52:15.540 --> 52:19.140
somewhat limited control over these lower levels. And there's

52:19.140 --> 52:22.940
a few examples that I think really showcase or highlight that

52:22.940 --> 52:27.620
limitation. So one of them is optical illusions. So you know,

52:27.620 --> 52:32.420
if you have these undulating checker patterns in some image

52:32.420 --> 52:35.580
that you're looking at, you could have full conscious

52:35.580 --> 52:40.140
awareness that the sheet of paper or the the image is not

52:40.140 --> 52:46.060
moving. However, there is an incorrigible sense that there is

52:46.060 --> 52:49.180
some movement in the image, even though you know that it's not

52:49.180 --> 52:54.540
there. You cannot help but perceive the optical illusion. And

52:54.540 --> 52:59.740
this is a nice way of also showcasing the apex. You are not

52:59.740 --> 53:04.060
fully in control of the subsystems. Okay, and I think this

53:04.060 --> 53:09.020
is one of the real novel predictions of the now model is

53:09.020 --> 53:14.580
that you cannot control your body fully. You are, you know,

53:14.660 --> 53:20.300
sending commands out. But the body can't fully interpret your

53:20.300 --> 53:23.780
commands. And you're so many levels of abstraction away,

53:24.140 --> 53:28.300
that you can't even fully grasp all the sub processes going on

53:28.300 --> 53:33.900
internally. And you are truly an abstraction within the body,

53:34.660 --> 53:37.940
probably still have free will probably still have full control.

53:38.140 --> 53:42.300
But your control is limited to what you are able to know. And

53:42.300 --> 53:46.820
you're only able to know a very high level of detail. Alright,

53:46.820 --> 53:51.340
so the apex is fundamentally slow. And I think that this is

53:51.340 --> 53:55.540
kind of counterintuitive to what a lot of people imagine. And

53:55.540 --> 53:59.380
this was one of the components of the now model, that it even

53:59.380 --> 54:02.740
took us time to accept as we were kind of thinking through the

54:02.740 --> 54:09.020
implications of our own theory. And the idea here is that you,

54:09.060 --> 54:16.420
the apex are likely operating at the time scale of a second to

54:16.420 --> 54:23.340
multiple seconds. Okay. And so what's happening here is you are

54:23.340 --> 54:30.900
this fully integrated observer window. And you are observing the

54:30.940 --> 54:36.140
information content within yourself. So it says if you are

54:36.140 --> 54:41.540
looking down upon your hierarchy at all times, and you're

54:41.540 --> 54:45.780
looking down at these cognitive subsystems and perceiving them,

54:46.180 --> 54:50.280
and they're very fast. So you think to yourself, Ah, that's my

54:50.280 --> 54:52.780
thought right there. Oh, that thought is mine too. That thought

54:52.780 --> 54:55.860
is mine too. And you're like looking down on these nested

54:55.860 --> 55:00.220
observer windows and identifying them as you and the nested

55:00.220 --> 55:06.220
systems are faster than you. You are terrible at seeing

55:06.220 --> 55:11.940
yourself. You only seal the sub windows. And so you mistake the

55:11.940 --> 55:17.180
content of your mind for your mind. It is a part of you, it is a

55:17.180 --> 55:22.140
part of your mind, but it is not your mind. So we now believe

55:22.420 --> 55:28.500
that your mind is integrating over these faster cycles of

55:28.540 --> 55:33.660
these nested systems. And here's a couple examples. You climbed

55:33.660 --> 55:37.500
a mountain, you're looking out over the mountain, and your eyes

55:37.500 --> 55:41.700
are darting around picking up information. So your phobia of

55:41.700 --> 55:43.980
your retina, the center of your retina, the center of your

55:43.980 --> 55:49.860
eyeball perceives high density color vision. The periphery of

55:49.860 --> 55:54.100
your eye only perceives black and white. And it's very low

55:54.140 --> 55:59.060
information content. So when you see the mountain, you just

55:59.060 --> 56:04.300
hike to the top. Do you perceive little spotlights of your

56:04.300 --> 56:09.940
retina as data is being collected? No, your eye darts

56:09.940 --> 56:14.420
around at theta frequency, roughly six times per second,

56:14.420 --> 56:18.180
your eye is moving around. And it's gathering all these

56:18.180 --> 56:23.420
snapshots of the mountain scene. And then it assembles all of

56:23.420 --> 56:28.060
that information into a gestalt representation of the mountain

56:28.060 --> 56:35.220
scene. And our argument is that your mind is at the scale of

56:35.220 --> 56:39.500
the gestalt representation of the full scene. There are

56:39.500 --> 56:45.300
multiple processing time points where your eye gathers data

56:45.300 --> 56:47.780
here gathers data there gathers data there gathers data

56:47.780 --> 56:51.260
there and then it packages and integrates all that information.

56:51.540 --> 56:55.060
And your experience is, wow, isn't that beautiful? Look at

56:55.060 --> 56:58.700
that mountain scene. But if you zoomed into one of your nested

56:58.700 --> 57:02.020
observer windows, they would only have Oh, there's a mountain.

57:02.580 --> 57:05.780
Oh, there's some trees over there. Oh, there's the beautiful

57:05.780 --> 57:10.620
sky over there with some clouds. Each of their snapshots,

57:10.940 --> 57:16.660
their gestalt perceptions is the mountain is the trees is the

57:16.700 --> 57:22.620
sky. But you are slow. At the scale of one second, you've had

57:22.620 --> 57:27.420
six eye movements occur. And now all six of those eye movements,

57:27.420 --> 57:32.380
all that data gets packaged into your experience. And you have

57:32.380 --> 57:37.380
this wallah, this image of the whole mountain vista. Another

57:37.380 --> 57:40.540
example, as I'm talking to you, I'm sending you all these

57:40.540 --> 57:46.220
words. But think about what it's like to listen to words, to

57:46.220 --> 57:50.140
listen to someone talking. You're not really paying attention

57:50.140 --> 57:55.060
to my words. You don't actually really care or know all the

57:55.060 --> 57:59.580
details of all the sound waves I'm sending. Your experience of

57:59.580 --> 58:03.980
my words is, Oh, wow, a sentence. Oh, wow, another

58:03.980 --> 58:08.660
sentence. Oh, wow, another sentence. We argue, and we are

58:08.660 --> 58:12.540
like planning an experiment to like formally test this. We

58:12.540 --> 58:19.460
argue that you are perceiving sentences fully gestalted

58:19.460 --> 58:24.220
together. You're not really paying attention to all the

58:24.220 --> 58:27.660
sound bites. Of course, a nested system is and if you want to

58:27.660 --> 58:31.540
call that you go ahead and call that you. But you are most

58:31.540 --> 58:37.780
closely this big slow observer window. And you receive the

58:37.820 --> 58:42.740
fully packaged information content of a sentence. And if

58:42.740 --> 58:45.620
you introspect on your experience, you can pay

58:45.620 --> 58:48.660
attention to my words if you want to. But most of the time

58:48.660 --> 58:52.060
you're not, you're just like, wow, what a cool idea. Oh, that's

58:52.060 --> 58:56.260
an idea. Oh, that's an idea. You're perceiving the fully

58:56.260 --> 59:02.980
fledged idea construct of the sentence more so than perceiving

59:02.980 --> 59:06.780
words sequentially and building up a sentence. Of course,

59:06.820 --> 59:10.660
there's violations of this. There's exceptions to this. It's

59:10.660 --> 59:14.900
a nested interacting system. So there's ways of like diving in

59:14.900 --> 59:18.780
and paying attention to the details. But if you choose not

59:18.780 --> 59:23.060
to pay attention to the details, you still receive all the

59:23.060 --> 59:27.460
information, right? And that is somewhat counterintuitive and

59:27.460 --> 59:31.820
not the typical thinking on how cognition is occurring. Another

59:31.820 --> 59:36.100
implication here is that it actually is quite hard to be

59:36.100 --> 59:44.420
aware of separate sources of data in your mind. Okay, and we go

59:44.420 --> 59:46.980
into this a little bit in the paper, but I'm going to expand

59:47.220 --> 59:52.500
more on it right now. So when you introspect on your

59:52.500 --> 59:58.420
experience, you are an integrated whole. And even if

59:58.420 --> 01:00:03.220
there was let's say eight sub observer windows, and maybe you

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.900
could name them, you could say, Hey, this is, you know, Justin

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:10.740
one, Justin two, Justin three, Justin four, all these sub

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:18.100
processes within yourself. What if it's hard to distinguish who

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.700
is giving you this information, right? You are so highly

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:27.380
integrated at the top level, that you are terrible at

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.940
perceiving the individual sources of information that are

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:36.300
becoming integrated into the apex. And this is one of the

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:42.260
reasons why it's kind of eluded us that there are multiple

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:47.300
sub windows, right? Because it's kind of hard for us to learn

01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:51.500
about these different sub processes. However, this isn't

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.740
to say that it is impossible to learn about these different

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.620
sub windows inside of you. And so we also make the argument

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:03.460
that maybe one reason that meditation is so bizarre and so

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:07.740
weird and why we would need to meditate is because if you close

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:12.980
your eyes and think about your experience in your mind, it is a

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:17.220
chaotic mess inside of your mind of all these different

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:22.140
thoughts and feelings and drives and perceptions. Could the

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:26.740
complexity of our inner life be because we are a nested

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:30.220
observer window system, and all these sub windows all have

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.140
different drives and different personalities and different

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:36.220
things they're trying to do. And you just naively say, I am

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:39.540
me, I'm one person. And yet there's all these different

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.980
conflicting selves internally. And when you try to introspect

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:48.540
on yourself on your experiences, that milieu of

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:52.740
cognitive systems are all being bounded together. And so the

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:57.820
observer window nature of yourself makes it even more

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:03.060
challenging to then introspect on the various sub components or

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:07.740
sub processes that might have a unique origin internally. Alright,

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:13.300
so what evidence do we have in the brain that we are modular?

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:18.420
And what's kind of wild is that the brain is almost bizarrely

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:23.540
over modular and the intuition that you're one person almost

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:27.420
doesn't line up with the data of the brain. If you look at the

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:31.500
brain, it's got two hemispheres. And these hemispheres, if you

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.100
hold the brain in your hand, you can kind of twisted and move

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:39.580
the brain. And it's really not touching itself that much. There

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:43.620
is a huge chasm running through the center of your brain,

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:49.260
separating it into two different halves. What if this is a huge

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:54.060
process of the observer window system, where your brain is

01:02:54.060 --> 01:03:00.460
intentionally divided, right? The brain wants to create

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:05.940
cognitive dissonance. It wants competing narratives of self. And

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:10.740
by creating competing narratives, you encourage a greater

01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:15.940
diversity of thought internally. And this leads to higher

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:21.340
intelligence through simulating more possibilities of what

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:25.500
could be out there of how to view and how to act. And this

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.180
would be maybe a evolutionarily beneficial thing to

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:34.700
create internally is a high, high, high modularity. You have

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:38.460
examples like split brain patients, right? If you cut the

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:41.860
brain in half, you cut the corpus callosum. These were

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:45.340
patients that had intractable epilepsy. So they were having a

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:49.860
lot of seizures. And so they cut the brain in half to try to

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.940
reduce the amount of seizures that these people were having.

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:57.060
And there's some really bizarre findings out of these patients.

01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:02.260
Essentially, that immediately following the surgery, it appears

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:06.620
as if the individual now has two different personalities.

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.820
There's a lot of these like simple dissociations of

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.660
information coming in between different eyes or different

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:16.620
visual fields. The hands kind of being controlled by different

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:20.220
hemispheres. These are kind of like the simple things you learn

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:23.780
about in textbooks about split brain patients. But what you don't

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:27.740
learn as much about in standard textbooks is that following the

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:31.880
surgery, if you talk to people that work with these patients, it

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.980
appears as if there's two very distinct personalities co

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:41.600
habitating within the individual. All right. And

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.000
there's some pretty wild examples like one that VS

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.200
Ramachandran talks about, where people appear to display very

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:54.320
different belief systems. One hemisphere believes in God, the

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.600
other hemisphere does not. One hemisphere has like a funny sense

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.760
of humor. The other hemisphere is quite serious. You know,

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:06.600
there's a lot of internal conflict. And the stories you can

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.760
learn from people that work with these patients are quite

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.160
wild, right? And I feel like this is somewhat missed the

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:19.120
mainstream public discourse in a weird way. Partly, in my

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.920
opinion, because this is kind of fundamentally unsettling. In a

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.920
weird way, we don't want nested observer windows to be true.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:33.080
Because it's so alien, and it feels so wrong to our naive

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:36.520
intuition of being a single individual. There's something

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.760
culturally preventing us from taking nested observer windows

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:47.040
seriously in a weird way. But is that just some cultural quirk, or

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:52.720
some bias that we've kind of grown into? And can you explain

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.920
two personalities coexisting within a single individual in

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:00.520
the split brain patients? Kind of bizarre. You also have the

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.720
inverse example. For example, Krista and Tatiana Hogan. These

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.360
are twins that are conjoined at the brain. So there is a

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:14.200
connection between the thalamus of these two girls, where

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.800
their skulls are fused and their brains are connected. And the

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.600
two girls are able to communicate telepathically with

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:27.040
each other. They can think thoughts and hear each other's

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:30.640
thoughts. They can allow each other to control each other's

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.200
bodies. They get annoyed at each other when they eat foods that

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.680
they don't like, right? They can tell each other jokes and have

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.880
you know, a fun time internally. And you know, I think this is

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:47.960
really interesting to ask the question, you know, are these two

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:52.520
girls one person, or are they two separate people? Probably

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:56.840
they're two separate people. However, it's quite strange that

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:00.800
they can communicate using just their minds. It's almost as if

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:04.520
there's two apex observer windows and a means of

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:08.440
communicating between the two apexes. And we might think to

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.840
ourselves, wow, this is so alien. This is so bizarre. I have no

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:18.960
idea what it would be like to be the Hogan twins. But if the

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.360
nested observer windows model is true, then you might actually

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.880
know what it's like to be the Hogan twins more than you might

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.560
realize. Maybe you're talking to yourself all the time when you

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:33.240
talk to your sub windows. Maybe you haven't had the experience

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.920
of having a lateral apex window, communicating between the

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:41.640
apexes. However, you have the experience of having sub windows

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.280
talking to each other and having internal conflict and

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:49.280
dialogue. So maybe it's not as foreign to your experience as

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.040
you might expect. I also think there's some really important

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:57.440
work occurring in the domain of psychotherapy to really

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:03.040
conceptualize the self as a family. So Richard Schwartz

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.800
developed what's called the internal family system

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:10.480
psychotherapy. He is a person working in the mental health

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:16.120
space. And he was working with family therapy. So he would take

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.480
a family that wanted to work through some of their issues

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:24.280
into his clinic. And he developed a method of having, you

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.160
know, different pairs of the family talk to each other work

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.480
through their differences. He crafted kind of a canonical

01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:35.920
archetypal framework that most families appear to fall into.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.920
There's different familial roles that people will take on in the

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.560
family. Bizarrely, what he discovered is this family based

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:50.440
psychotherapy was highly effective in the individual. So if

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:56.680
you took a single person, and you walked them through a family

01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:02.840
based psychotherapy, you would realize or uncover that it is as

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.400
if there are different personalities internally, and

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:14.360
these forge the same canonical familial roles that you observe

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:20.680
in families. You have a family inside of your head, where

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:25.160
there's different personalities competing for space, competing

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:31.440
for time. And as you experience psychiatric illness, or cognitive

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:36.920
dissonance, it could be that there's some sort of battle debate

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:43.160
conflict between these different internal family members. And

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.960
this sounds completely bizarre. Maybe it's just a psychotherapy

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.720
that works. Hey, take it or leave it. Or it is metaphysically

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:56.440
ontologically reality, because there is a nested observer

01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:01.240
window system inside of you. And if you dive into the observer

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:07.040
windows inside of your apex, these are your family members. You

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.720
have an internal family system of different sub windows with

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.280
different desires and goals, communicating with each other

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.720
throughout your entire life. You are a cooperative enterprise of

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:26.560
multiple competing, cooperating cognitive systems, feeding into

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.280
your experience. And this is the nesting within you that

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.000
explains who you are and what you're doing. What if you could

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.520
better characterize the different personalities that coexist

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:45.320
inside of you? Could you live a healthier, more productive life?

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.600
This is the, you know, the pitch of internal family systems.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:54.240
Also, some really interesting cases, like dissociative

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.640
identity disorder or multiple personality disorder. So when I

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.560
was receiving clinical psychology training back in my postdoc,

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:07.920
I brought this up to some of my mentors, I was like, ooh, what

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.560
about multiple personality disorder? How does that, you

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:15.000
know, work in psychotherapy and in psychiatric illness? And

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.560
they told me, oh, that doesn't exist. That is made up from the

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.480
movies. There was a little bit more nuance to it. But essentially

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.880
the vibe or the impression was that multiple personality

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:32.640
disorder is not real. Okay. However, there's been a lot of

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.320
interesting reviews out recently. And I've talked to a couple

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:41.400
people who have, you know, loved ones with dissociative identity

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.560
disorder or who have worked with these patients or who are these

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.400
patients themselves. And I personally am fully convinced that

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:54.120
dissociative identity disorder is real. It really happens. But

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.880
let's wonder, you know, what is it that makes people so

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:06.480
resistive to DID being real? I think it's that metaphysically

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.880
ontologically, we don't have a way to make sense of this. It's

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.720
so bizarre to our intuition that we reject the premise that

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:19.440
this could ever be real. However, the nested observer

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.280
Windows model, of course, you know, has a way to account for

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.160
this. If the apex window experiences some really strong

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:34.320
trauma, then maybe it would dissolve. Maybe it would, you

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:40.720
know, loosen its grip slightly. And some of the sub windows

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:47.760
would take on a more viscerally real quality, right? The sub

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.520
windows are the multiple personality internal family

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:59.680
within all of us. And DID is not necessarily a complete

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:05.240
pathologicalization of, you know, reality. But there's some

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:11.320
truth in every psychiatric illness to our experience. And so

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:17.480
DID represents some component of us that maybe freaks us out.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.480
Maybe we're not coming to terms with. But if there is this

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:26.840
rich internal cognitive nested hierarchical structure, then DID

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.720
is not impossible. It has a biological explanation. And

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.720
there's elements or components of their experience that

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.480
resonate and are true within your experience as well. It's not

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:44.080
so alien as to be impossible to empathize with or to

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.200
understand. So another phenomenon of relevance to the now

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.360
model, our topos and topomancers or the act of

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:57.480
topomancy. And so this is the intentional creation of an

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.560
imaginary friend. So these are people that actively and

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.680
willfully create a imaginary friend in their mind. And they

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.280
talk to this person, they listen to this person, they hang out

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.440
with this person. And this is not unlike the phenomenon of

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.720
children having very vivid and real imaginary friends in their

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:27.120
experience. And so topomancy is the as an adult intentional

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:31.880
creation of an imaginary friend. For what purpose? Well, for

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:35.880
fun, to deal with loneliness, maybe this is some sort of

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:40.920
coping strategy for your for your life. You know, whatever

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:44.520
your motivation for doing this, there's a growing community,

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:49.680
especially on Reddit, that is developing the skills related to

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:54.800
topomancy. And I think this is fascinating. In a way, this

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.920
lines up very well with the now model. Potentially, topos are

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.840
the recognition of a sub window internally, and encouraging a

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.040
sub window to take on its own voice, to take on its own

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:13.720
reality, and you encourage independence, separately from the

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.600
apex, or with a more direct line of communication with the apex.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:21.600
So I think this is a really fascinating phenomenon and is

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:25.960
probably worth studying. So I'm talking with some people,

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.600
there's a few researchers out there, Tonya Lerman and Michael

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.920
Lifschitz, who are really diving into topos and topomancy. So I

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.800
think this is a really exciting area to kind of look at maybe

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.360
validating the now model. Alright, some other examples that

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:46.640
might be of relevance. There was some work recently, looking

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:52.560
into the octopus, for example, as a sort of exotic organism that

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:57.280
might show more of a hierarchical consciousness system than

01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:02.240
humans display. So in the octopus, there is some pretty solid

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:07.680
evidence as of late, that the tentacles are semi autonomous,

01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:12.480
they appear able to learn and act and behave somewhat

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.320
separately from the full organism. However, they can of

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:21.280
course be wrapped into the goal directed behavior of the full

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.280
octopus. And so this really like kind of in a beautiful way

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.320
exemplifies the now model, where you have semi autonomous

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:35.400
sub windows that are able to nest into the apex upon demand.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:41.320
And maybe the octopus or other organisms might give us insight

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:46.640
into the human nested observer window framework, because there

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:51.560
might be different mechanism biological structures at play,

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:56.680
which tweak and change the expression of the biological

01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:00.640
hierarchy. Maybe there's less cross frequency coupling, maybe

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:03.800
there's more autonomy at a lower level. And that would give

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:09.160
rise to a shift in what it is like to be this organism. But it

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.920
could be compared and contrasted with the human physiology. And

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.480
I think that is just a really fascinating new line of work to

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:21.680
dive into. Another philosopher neuroscientist, biologist on

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.920
this same kind of thought pattern is Michael Levin. Michael

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.600
Levin in his group have been doing some really great work

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.600
thinking about hierarchical information processing. And he

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:36.240
has these really bizarre xenobots, which are clumps of

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:41.400
cells that appear to form holistic organisms. And this is

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:45.360
super bizarre, right? There is no biological infrastructure to

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:51.440
make a xenobot. But it appears as if there is a macroscopic

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:56.280
structure that emerges from these clumps of cells. A different

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:00.400
approach as studying the octopus would be to look at the

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.880
emergence of maybe cross frequency coupling, some sort of

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.360
hierarchical consciousness system in these very simple models,

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.000
which might give us, you know, more novel insight. An important

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.080
question here, or a fun thing to think about is what is the

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:25.200
nature of consciousness in your brain? So the very safe, simple,

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:30.240
kind of naive one is what we call apex hierarchical

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.860
consciousness. This is the idea that you exist at the apex of

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:39.420
the hierarchy. And you are the only one that's conscious in your

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:44.880
brain. It's just you don't worry about those nested subsystems.

01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:49.520
They are processing your cognition. But you're the only one

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.500
who's home. You're the only one that's conscious in your body.

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.900
Alternatively, there is a emergent hierarchical

01:18:56.900 --> 01:19:01.940
consciousness, some threshold, where above this line, all of

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:05.980
these observer windows are conscious beings, your nested

01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:09.440
observer windows are conscious, they have independent

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.580
experience from you, not fully independent, right? Because

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.980
there's some interaction, but they are conscious in and of

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:20.220
themselves. And then finally, there's some sort of panpsychic

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:24.140
hierarchical consciousness possibility, where every observer

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:29.340
window is a conscious being, period, full stop. However, you

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.780
know, the observer window requires synchrony. So there's

01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:36.860
some threshold, some mechanism that needs to be at play to

01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:40.140
create an observer window to create a conscious being. So

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:42.540
it's not that it like spontaneously consciousness can

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:46.820
just be everywhere. But you know, this still kind of holds some

01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:50.100
sort of boundaries, some sort of condition for consciousness to

01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:54.720
to be present. Alright, so I just want to end with a reference

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.360
to Daniel Dennett, who sadly recently passed away. He had

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.760
this idea called the Cartesian theater. And it's the idea that

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:07.800
you know, your naive sense of consciousness is that there is a

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.440
little little man in your head that's perceiving everything,

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.880
hearing everything, smelling everything, pulling the levers

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:18.880
moving the body around, he points out the confusion in this

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.880
that okay, if there is a little conscious being inside of your

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:26.840
body, wouldn't there need to be a smaller little conscious being

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.000
inside of that person's body? And then wouldn't there be an

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.200
even smaller conscious being inside of that person's body? And

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:37.080
there's an infinite regression of smaller and smaller people

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:41.080
inside of your mind. And so this is completely preposterous when

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:44.800
you need to do away with this simple notion of a theater of

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:49.040
experience. And he called this the homunculus problem, the

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:53.760
problem of having nested infinite consciousnesses. Well, the now

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:58.440
model right is very at odds with this. And so we you know,

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:02.800
think what if this is a homunculus solution? What if

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.920
there is a Cartesian multiplex? Instead of it having a

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.320
Cartesian single theater, there's only one show that's

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:15.600
playing. What if there are many shows, a multiplex or a

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:20.360
synaplex, a, a theatrical establishment with many movies

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:24.440
going on inside of your brain, the nested observer windows model

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:29.920
says there are many experiences internally. And you maybe are a

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:33.640
bit of a moviegoer popping between the many diverse

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:38.000
experiences happening inside of you. And there is maybe this

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:44.760
near infinite fractal of smaller beings nested inside of you. And

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:48.840
in that sense, it really would be turtles all the way down. Maybe

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:52.560
there's some floor, maybe it keeps going. And I think an

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.760
important question is, you know, could there be something bigger

01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.520
than us, something larger than us going in the other direction?

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:05.040
Is there an observer window greater than the individual? And

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.800
at one point, I will have a couple episodes probably on the

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.640
concept of collective consciousness. Is there any

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:17.400
substance to the idea of a shared or collective experience? So

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:23.560
with that, wrapping up with the now model, check out the paper

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.520
for yourself. I think it's a really cool, exciting new

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.360
theory. Obviously, I do because I've, you know, poured a lot of

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:33.280
time and energy into this. I'm also want to, you know, point

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:36.720
out Jonathan Schueler is really a core contributor to these

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.480
ideas and to this model. And we're now looking at different

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:44.000
ways to test these theories in people with dissociative identity

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.040
disorder in people with tulpas in split brain patients, looking

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:52.480
at these low frequency integrations that are occurring

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:57.360
within your experience. So a lot of new research on the horizon.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.520
And I will talk to you again very soon. Goodbye.
