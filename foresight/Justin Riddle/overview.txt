Checking Justin Riddle/#17 - Nested Hierarchical Consciousness： viewing your mind as composed of minds.txt
 The video delves into the concept of observer windows in the context of consciousness and quantum mechanics. The idea is that consciousness could be an emergent property that arises from a certain level of synchrony or coherence among neural processes, which can be thought of as observer windows. The discussion then explores the possibility that this concept might also apply to larger scales, suggesting that we might be giant observer windows within the natural world.

The video also considers whether the requirement for high synchrony could be related to quantum coherence, implying that an observer window at its most fundamental level might be a quantum computer with perfect entanglement and no environmental influence. This leads to a speculative idea that there could be nested quantum computers, each potentially capable of being an observer window, and that classical communication between these quantum systems involves phase lags and physical constraints.

The video suggests that cross-frequency coupling, which is a phenomenon observed in EEG data, might not fit neatly into either classical or quantum communication models. It proposes that there could be a third form of communication yet to be understood. The narrator hints at exploring these ideas further in the next episode, specifically discussing fractal computation, and invites the audience to ponder their own reality as potentially being a composite of nested conscious beings.

In summary, the video presents a thought-provoking exploration of consciousness from both classical and quantum perspectives, encouraging viewers to consider the complexity and potential fractality of the mind and its relationship with computation and communication at various scales.

Checking Justin Riddle/#40 – Nested Observer Windows： the case for hierarchical consciousness.txt
1. The now model posits that consciousness might not be located at a single point in the brain (apex hierarchical consciousness) but rather emerges from multiple levels of processing within the brain, known as observer windows.

2. In the emergent hierarchical consciousness view, these observer windows could also be conscious entities within the brain, interacting with each other but not fully independently.

3. The panpsychist view suggests that every observer window is a conscious being, but requires synchrony to be so, avoiding an infinite regression of smaller conscious beings.

4. Daniel Dennett's "Cartesian theater" illustrates the problem of nested consciousnesses leading to an infinite regression, which the now model addresses by proposing a "multiplex" or "synaplex" of experiences occurring within the brain simultaneously.

5. The now model implies that there could be a multitude of conscious experiences happening at different levels within a person's brain, with the individual potentially experiencing these as a series of internal movies or narratives.

6. The model suggests the possibility of something larger than an individual's consciousness and raises questions about collective consciousness, which will be explored in future episodes.

7. Jonathan Schooler is a key contributor to the now model, and further research is planned to investigate these concepts in individuals with dissociative identity disorder, tulpamancy, and split brain patients, focusing on low-frequency brain integrations that contribute to consciousness.

8. The now model is a new and exciting theory in the field of consciousness studies, offering fresh perspectives and opening up new avenues for research and understanding.
