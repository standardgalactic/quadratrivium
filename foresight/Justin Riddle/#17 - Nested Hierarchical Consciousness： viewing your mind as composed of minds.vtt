00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
Welcome back to the show that tells you you are a quantum computer with free will

00:04.680 --> 00:10.320
at the apex of a hierarchy of conscious beings. My name is Justin Riddle and this

00:10.320 --> 00:15.880
is episode 17 of the quantum consciousness series. In today's episode

00:15.880 --> 00:20.640
we'll be talking about nested hierarchical consciousness, the idea that

00:20.640 --> 00:25.120
information processing is occurring at multiple different scales in your brain

00:25.120 --> 00:28.920
and this information needs to be communicated up and down the hierarchy.

00:28.920 --> 00:34.040
By the end of today's episode we'll ask the question, are you a conscious being

00:34.040 --> 00:37.800
that's composed of conscious beings that's composed of conscious beings add

00:37.800 --> 00:43.720
infinitum? This episode is available on YouTube and an audio-only version is

01:14.320 --> 01:19.360
Hey there, my name is Justin Riddle, a little background on myself. I got a PhD

01:19.360 --> 01:25.080
from UC Berkeley in psychology studying cognitive neuroscience. While at UC

01:25.080 --> 01:29.560
Berkeley I taught a course on quantum consciousness for seven years and this

01:29.560 --> 01:35.280
YouTube series is really a translation and extension of that material. Right now

01:35.280 --> 01:41.400
I do research in humans and I deliver magnetic and electrical non-invasive

01:41.400 --> 01:45.280
brain stimulation in order to get a better understanding of the role of

01:45.320 --> 01:50.480
neural oscillations in cognition and how they become impaired in psychiatric

01:50.480 --> 01:58.600
illness. So the topic for today is nested hierarchical consciousness and I'll be

01:58.600 --> 02:02.800
talking about in particular this theory called the nested observer windows

02:02.800 --> 02:08.840
model and this is a model that I developed in collaboration with Professor

02:08.840 --> 02:12.440
Jonathan Schuehler who's at the University of California Santa Barbara

02:13.160 --> 02:16.520
and we've been working on this model for many years now and at the time of this

02:16.520 --> 02:22.720
recording we're currently in the process of submitting it for publication. So to

02:22.720 --> 02:28.320
give you a big overview on what this model is and then speculating on some

02:28.320 --> 02:32.200
of the implications for quantum consciousness and quantum computers in

02:32.200 --> 02:37.000
general at the end we'll be running through the details of this model and

02:37.000 --> 02:40.640
some of the evidence from cognitive neuroscience and some of just the

02:40.760 --> 02:46.400
theoretical motivation for this model and this will really tie into the overall

02:46.400 --> 02:53.760
story of this series but this one is a much more sort of based in the cognitive

02:53.760 --> 02:59.560
neuroscience literature so I'll be doing a lot of talking about that. So here's

02:59.560 --> 03:04.720
the pitch and I'm gonna start off by reading a quote from William James and

03:05.400 --> 03:12.640
William James is really one of the like foundational philosophers, researchers

03:12.640 --> 03:18.000
doing a lot of introspection in the early days of the field of psychology and

03:18.000 --> 03:24.720
so the quote goes like this, we know what it is to get out of bed on a freezing

03:24.720 --> 03:29.280
morning in a room without a fire and how the very vital principle within us

03:29.280 --> 03:33.760
protests against the ordeal. Probably most persons have lain on certain

03:33.760 --> 03:39.160
mornings for an hour at a time, unable to brace themselves to the resolve. We

03:39.160 --> 03:43.480
think how late we shall be, how the duties of the day will suffer, we say I

03:43.480 --> 03:48.800
must get up, this is ignominous, etc. But still the warm couch feels too

03:48.800 --> 03:54.920
delicious, the cold outside too cruel, and resolution faints away and postpones

03:54.920 --> 03:59.160
itself again and again just as it seemed on the verge of bursting the

03:59.160 --> 04:03.960
resistance and passing over into the decisive act. Now how do we ever get up

04:03.960 --> 04:09.120
under such circumstances? If I may generalize from my own experience, we more

04:09.120 --> 04:14.120
often than not get up without any struggle or decision at all. We suddenly

04:14.120 --> 04:19.760
find that we have got up, a fortunate lapse of consciousness occurs, we forget

04:19.760 --> 04:24.640
both the warmth and the cold. We fall into some reverie connected with the

04:24.640 --> 04:30.640
day's life, in the course of which the idea flashes across us, holo, I must

04:30.640 --> 04:34.960
lie here no longer, an idea which at that lucky instant awakens no

04:34.960 --> 04:40.320
contradictory or paralyzing suggestion and consequently produces immediately

04:40.320 --> 04:45.680
its appropriate motor effects. It was our acute consciousness of both the warmth

04:45.680 --> 04:49.800
and the cold during the period of struggle which paralyzed our activity

04:49.800 --> 04:56.800
then and kept our idea of rising in the condition of wish and not of will. The

04:56.800 --> 05:02.480
moment these inhibitory ideas ceased, the original idea exerted its effects.

05:02.480 --> 05:08.040
William James, Principles of Psychology, Volume 2. So what's so fascinating about

05:08.040 --> 05:13.440
this is I think it violates a few different sort of intuitions that we

05:13.440 --> 05:19.120
have about our own experience being a human being. And one of those is this

05:19.120 --> 05:24.560
idea that we have this narrator in our mind. And so we've kind of been told and

05:24.560 --> 05:29.080
we kind of take it at face value that there is this narrative flow to our

05:29.080 --> 05:34.600
minds and that we're sort of witnessing this unfolding of events. We have some

05:34.600 --> 05:39.360
free will, some ability to change that unfolding of events, but we view it as a

05:39.360 --> 05:46.200
single narrative self inside of us. And what this really challenges us to think

05:46.200 --> 05:52.520
about is how when we decide to do things we are sometimes met with internal

05:52.520 --> 05:59.520
resistance. And what is it when you have a conflicting set of ideas in your mind?

05:59.520 --> 06:05.360
I would argue, and the nested observer window model argues, that there's

06:05.360 --> 06:11.240
actually this debate, this collaboration, this dialogue between many different

06:11.240 --> 06:17.400
voices in your head. And it's not really just a single narrative self, but so

06:17.400 --> 06:22.320
much of our inner life of our cognition is really characterized by inner

06:22.320 --> 06:26.080
conflict. Should I do this? Should I do that? That might be fun, but am I wasting

06:26.080 --> 06:30.520
my time? You know, there's all this debate, this internal struggle that we

06:30.520 --> 06:38.320
experience, which is really core and inherent to our lives. Another sort

06:38.360 --> 06:43.880
of intuition that we have that the nested observer window or now model sort of

06:43.880 --> 06:49.840
goes against is this idea that we have sort of a possessive or a feeling of

06:49.840 --> 06:55.640
ownership over our thoughts. We think I created this thought, I am the creative

06:55.640 --> 07:02.680
owner of my thoughts. I am generating and sort of assembling things together in my

07:02.680 --> 07:08.240
mind. And while a lot of times there are periods where we're actively thinking

07:08.240 --> 07:14.000
about something, and we really are assembling these big macro abstract

07:14.000 --> 07:20.240
ideas together, and we're forming new solutions or new concepts out of sort of

07:20.240 --> 07:27.720
more basic concepts. And all of that is going on at this very abstract level. But

07:27.720 --> 07:34.760
in addition, we get many ideas that just pop into our mind. And we sometimes don't

07:34.760 --> 07:39.280
even want ownership of our ideas. Sometimes an idea pops into your head and

07:39.280 --> 07:43.640
you wonder, why did I think that? Where did that come from? And sometimes you even

07:43.640 --> 07:48.280
suppress the unwanted thought, or you're kind of in awe, like where did this

07:48.280 --> 07:54.920
thought come from? And so in the now model, we propose that thoughts do sort of

07:54.920 --> 08:00.520
emerge into your mind fully formed. And even when you are assembling thoughts

08:00.520 --> 08:05.640
together, you're doing so at such an abstract level, that there's so much

08:05.640 --> 08:11.040
built into those concepts already. And even the basic concepts which are there

08:11.040 --> 08:16.880
for you to assemble already have this sort of coming out of nowhere popping

08:16.880 --> 08:21.920
into existence feeling to them, where there's so much that is entailed in

08:21.920 --> 08:28.440
those in those basic concepts, even in the act of assembling. And then the sort

08:28.440 --> 08:32.880
of another or like the final violation of intuition that I'll provide right now,

08:32.880 --> 08:37.840
and there'll be more throughout throughout this episode, is the idea that we have a

08:37.840 --> 08:45.960
limited interface with our own bodies, right? And so the idea is when I decide

08:45.960 --> 08:53.800
I'm gonna move around in the world, that decision to move can sometimes be met

08:53.800 --> 08:59.000
with resistance, or the movement itself might not come out like how I thought it

08:59.000 --> 09:02.520
was gonna come out. Maybe I say, oh, I'm gonna walk over there and then I trip and

09:02.520 --> 09:07.920
fall, you know, face first into the floor. That was not the plan, right? So we are

09:07.920 --> 09:16.120
enacting very abstract action plans into our body. And we're not aware of the fine

09:16.120 --> 09:21.280
motor movements, all the detailed muscle activation that needs to occur. And so

09:21.280 --> 09:25.680
we're really operating at these very high abstract levels. And so there's

09:25.680 --> 09:31.120
limited influence that we even have over our bodies. And another interesting way

09:31.120 --> 09:34.120
of thinking about this is, you know, you can consciously pay attention to

09:34.120 --> 09:37.960
breathing. But when you're not paying attention, you're still breathing. You

09:37.960 --> 09:42.960
know, it's one of those weird flexible acts where you can simultaneously take it

09:42.960 --> 09:48.520
under volitional control, or just let it go on unconsciously. So the argument is

09:48.520 --> 09:52.760
that, you know, you're at the top of this hierarchy of conscious beings, and you

09:52.760 --> 09:59.600
have limited influence on the lower levels beneath you. So that's sort of

09:59.600 --> 10:04.520
from an experiential sense why the now model is sort of challenging the status

10:04.520 --> 10:10.560
quo of how we think about ourselves. From a practical sense, when we do

10:10.560 --> 10:15.760
science, we're trying to understand for the most part the human condition. What

10:15.760 --> 10:21.160
is it like to be a mind? Who am I? What's going on? And of course, there's more

10:21.160 --> 10:24.600
like medical applications or technological applications, but in the

10:24.600 --> 10:28.960
field of psychology, we're trying to understand fundamentally, you know, who

10:28.960 --> 10:34.440
we are. And so in that field, there's many different researchers studying the

10:34.440 --> 10:43.320
phenomenon of the human mind. But some people study fMRI, EEG, these really

10:43.360 --> 10:49.440
macro scale entire regions, activating the blood flow to different regions in

10:49.440 --> 10:55.000
the brain with fMRI. These are macroscopic large regions. With EEG, we're

10:55.000 --> 11:00.160
studying these big electric fields that emerge from the brain and relating

11:00.160 --> 11:06.520
those to cognition. But then people also study neurons, and neurons are

11:06.520 --> 11:12.120
operating at the scale of a thousand times per second, right? So while fMRI, EEG

11:12.120 --> 11:17.000
is happening on the scale of seconds or sub seconds, you know, a small fraction

11:17.000 --> 11:21.800
of a second, but maybe just like one tenth of a second, neurons are

11:21.800 --> 11:28.400
activating at scales at the kilohertz range, like 1000 times per second. And

11:28.400 --> 11:32.920
then beneath that, there's proteins, and there's synaptic interactions or

11:32.920 --> 11:37.720
protein pathways that are that are, you know, processing information in their

11:37.760 --> 11:44.160
own ways. And those are happening another order of magnitude faster, let's say

11:44.160 --> 11:49.880
like the megahertz or even gigahertz range, right? A million times per second or

11:49.880 --> 11:53.600
sometimes even a billion times per second. So there's all these different

11:53.600 --> 11:57.680
scales, and you'll find people that are neuroscientists and they're interested

11:57.680 --> 12:03.000
in the human mind. But they'll study the human mind at so many different scales.

12:03.320 --> 12:08.040
And the question is, you know, we can find some relationship or correlation of

12:08.040 --> 12:13.480
these fMRI and EEG signals to our minds. We find a correlation of neural activity

12:13.480 --> 12:19.640
to our perceptions and our actions. And with proteins, once again, the presence

12:19.640 --> 12:24.440
of a protein or not, or, you know, when light comes into the eyeball, it activates

12:24.440 --> 12:28.840
a protein cascade, and that correlates with the detection of light. So that

12:28.840 --> 12:32.600
also relates to our experience. And so the question is, how are all these

12:32.640 --> 12:37.720
different processes happening at multiple different scales? And the nested

12:37.720 --> 12:43.920
observer window model proposes a unique solution where you can view all of these

12:43.920 --> 12:49.520
different levels as meaningfully processing information, and also sharing

12:49.520 --> 12:54.720
that information up and down across these very different spatial temporal scales,

12:54.720 --> 13:00.520
right? So we have centimeters and seconds, we have millimeters and kilohertz,

13:00.520 --> 13:06.520
and then we have micrometers or even angstroms in the range of megahertz and

13:06.520 --> 13:11.640
gigahertz, right? And so all of these processes seem to be contributing to

13:11.640 --> 13:17.720
our experience. But how do we study these? How do we make sense of these? And it

13:17.720 --> 13:21.520
would be really cool if you could have more interdisciplinary study where

13:21.520 --> 13:25.520
people studying neurons could talk directly with like people using fMRI,

13:25.560 --> 13:31.200
right? It would be cool to have ways in which in a principled manner, the

13:31.200 --> 13:34.880
information or the content being created at these different scales is being

13:34.880 --> 13:40.760
communicated to each other. So that's a lot of the big picture motivation for

13:40.760 --> 13:45.280
the now model. So now I'm going to propose what is the now model

13:45.280 --> 13:52.040
fundamentally. So the now model fundamentally is a way of defining

13:52.480 --> 13:58.800
information integration units, and we call them observer windows. And an

13:58.800 --> 14:04.800
observer window is at a certain spatial temporal scale, and it's integrating

14:04.800 --> 14:09.760
information, and it has sort of a rhythmic processing to that information

14:09.760 --> 14:15.000
integration, which is sort of the time scale, the integration rate at which it

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
operates. And then within that scale, you have a bunch of observer windows

14:21.000 --> 14:26.200
communicating with each other at the same level. And then you also have

14:26.200 --> 14:31.000
observer windows nested within each other, so that each observer window is

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
composed of observer windows, and then information is processed up and down

14:36.600 --> 14:42.320
these different scales. And so we propose sort of a unique way of

14:42.320 --> 14:48.600
information integration, which we call mosaic integration. And the idea here is

14:48.600 --> 14:55.640
that we're really leveraging the nested nature of this system. And the metaphor

14:55.640 --> 15:01.920
for what this looks like and the details will need to be hashed out by some

15:01.920 --> 15:08.160
computational model, I would assume. But the idea is that this feels like a

15:08.160 --> 15:13.560
mosaic image, where you can think of an image that's made up of a bunch of

15:13.560 --> 15:20.280
tiles, and each of those tiles is itself an image. But when you're at the level

15:20.280 --> 15:25.560
of a full image composed of tiles, you know, a single gestalt comes out, a

15:25.560 --> 15:30.800
single representation, a single image appears. But then you can zoom into

15:30.800 --> 15:36.160
these tiles, and you'll find that each tile has an image. And that tile is

15:36.160 --> 15:43.360
composed of more tiles. And you can zoom in infinitely, or maybe there's

15:43.360 --> 15:49.440
some limitation on how much you could zoom. But this this form of mosaic

15:49.440 --> 15:54.680
integration is the way that you're able to assemble and build more abstract

15:54.680 --> 15:59.800
representations. And a cool property of this form of integration would be that

15:59.800 --> 16:05.120
you're sort of preserving a lot of the rich detail as you move up to the

16:05.120 --> 16:09.840
higher and higher levels in the hierarchy. Alright, so we have these

16:09.840 --> 16:14.000
observer windows, they have a fixed boundary, a fixed spatial and fixed

16:14.000 --> 16:19.200
temporal boundary on where they are and what they are. And they're integrating

16:19.200 --> 16:23.960
information from their environment. And they're also nested within other

16:23.960 --> 16:29.600
observer windows and processing information up and down this hierarchy.

16:30.040 --> 16:34.040
And so there's a few implications. And so first, I'm going to talk about the

16:34.040 --> 16:38.000
implications for consciousness, where does consciousness fit into this? And then

16:38.040 --> 16:44.280
I'll go into the the details of what this information integration might look

16:44.280 --> 16:49.400
like, and the phenomenon coming out of cognitive neuroscience that that

16:49.400 --> 16:55.080
motivates thinking about this model. And then I'll end talking about how

16:55.080 --> 17:01.120
quantum mechanics might play a role in particular in one of these principles

17:01.120 --> 17:04.920
that I'm going to talk about in a second here. So the question is, where does

17:04.920 --> 17:10.400
consciousness come in? And so one idea is that consciousness is just at the top

17:10.400 --> 17:18.040
level, that you have this hierarchy of observer windows, and you, the viewer are

17:18.040 --> 17:23.920
the highest level, you are the one observer window at the top of the

17:23.920 --> 17:29.360
hierarchy. And there's all these sort of autonomous observer windows at lower

17:29.360 --> 17:33.560
levels or semi autonomous observer windows integrating information. But all

17:33.560 --> 17:37.480
of those are just worker bees. And you are the only one that's a conscious

17:37.480 --> 17:42.280
being and you're the only one that really has the the qualia, the feeling of

17:42.280 --> 17:49.040
being a self. And all these lower levels are, yeah, just unconscious, subconscious,

17:49.040 --> 17:54.000
pre conscious, proto conscious, whatever, you know, fun prefix you want to fit

17:54.000 --> 18:00.440
onto conscious. And this really feels a lot like the global workspace model, or

18:01.400 --> 18:06.480
these sort of emergentist views of consciousness, where you try to describe,

18:06.480 --> 18:10.760
you know, at the level of the whole brain, there's some sort of emergent

18:10.760 --> 18:14.880
property or some sort of being that comes out at this highest level. An

18:14.880 --> 18:19.480
alternative way of putting consciousness into the now model is that there's some

18:19.480 --> 18:27.120
sort of threshold for information complexity, or for the integration of

18:27.120 --> 18:32.880
information to be occurring. There's some threshold for what that looks like. And

18:32.880 --> 18:38.840
then only once you breach that threshold, do you have a conscious being. So here

18:38.840 --> 18:44.920
there would be some level in the brain or in the body, where you have a conscious

18:44.920 --> 18:50.200
being. And above that level are conscious beings nested within each other. But

18:50.200 --> 18:58.600
beneath that level, it's automaton, right, it's non conscious, just processors. The

18:58.600 --> 19:06.080
third and final option is sort of a form of pan psychism, pan, pan, meaning all, and

19:06.080 --> 19:10.520
psychism being, you know, a root of consciousness. So pan psychism, everything

19:10.520 --> 19:14.920
is conscious. And now in the now model, we assert that, you know, not everything

19:14.960 --> 19:21.240
can arbitrarily be called a consciousness. But in the now model, the observer

19:21.240 --> 19:31.440
windows have a biological infrastructure, a boundary that limits what could be a

19:31.440 --> 19:36.760
conscious being. But you're at the top of the hierarchy, and there's conscious

19:36.760 --> 19:42.800
beings nested beneath you. And it goes down and down and down. And all of those

19:42.800 --> 19:50.800
are conscious beings at various smaller and smaller levels. So not quite sure

19:50.800 --> 19:55.600
what the correct answer is. I personally really love this pan psychist model where

19:55.600 --> 20:00.360
all these levels are conscious beings. And we'll come back to this idea a bit

20:00.360 --> 20:04.440
later. But it really does kind of blow your mind. And so maybe I'm just drawn to

20:04.440 --> 20:09.800
it because it is such a mind blowing reality shifting type of way of viewing

20:09.800 --> 20:15.040
yourself as being composed genuinely of conscious beings. You're running the show,

20:15.080 --> 20:21.280
maybe mostly. You're at the top, probably, but there's still conscious beings

20:21.280 --> 20:28.920
beneath you. And you're sort of the CEO of this corporation of conscious beings

20:28.920 --> 20:36.760
directing what to do. But all of these entities underneath you still have a say

20:36.760 --> 20:43.840
they have an input on what gets carried out eventually. And all of your

20:43.840 --> 20:49.320
reality and perception is being filtered through these lower levels. And you're

20:49.320 --> 20:55.400
making decisions at this very abstract higher level. So it's still sort of an

20:55.400 --> 21:00.120
integrated interplay between all these different levels of conscious beings.

21:01.040 --> 21:07.640
Alright, so now I'm going to dive into the three principles of the now model. And

21:07.640 --> 21:15.880
they are synchrony. This is a zero phase lag high degree of correlation between a

21:15.880 --> 21:21.640
bunch of components. And this forms the integration unit forms the observer

21:21.640 --> 21:29.840
window. It is difficult to achieve a zero phase lag entirely correlated system

21:29.840 --> 21:36.200
with high synchrony. Everything is so coupled together that it loses individuality

21:36.200 --> 21:41.200
and it becomes a single entity, right? That is synchrony, the formation of an

21:41.200 --> 21:49.280
observer window. The second principle is coherence. And coherence is a non zero

21:49.280 --> 21:54.960
phase lag coupling between two observer windows. And this is two observer windows

21:54.960 --> 21:59.320
at the same spatial temporal level. So they're both processing information. They

21:59.320 --> 22:04.040
both have their own integration rates, you know, of how they're processing

22:04.040 --> 22:10.320
information. But they can communicate with each other. And it's a weak transient

22:10.320 --> 22:15.520
communication, they form these functional networks of observer windows

22:15.520 --> 22:22.320
communicating with each other. But it's inherently unstable and transient. And you

22:22.320 --> 22:25.720
don't lose the individuality of the of the two observer windows that are

22:25.720 --> 22:33.120
coherent. And then the final and third principle is cross frequency coupling. And

22:33.120 --> 22:38.040
this is once again a weak form of coupling between two observer windows. Except

22:38.040 --> 22:41.440
the catch here is that the observer windows are at different spatial temporal

22:41.440 --> 22:47.320
scales. So you have big, slow, rhythmically integrating observer windows. And

22:47.320 --> 22:51.960
these much smaller, faster observer windows integrating information. And

22:51.960 --> 22:56.640
they're coupled to each other. And once again, the coupling is more weak. And it

22:56.640 --> 23:00.920
happens between observer windows nested within other higher level observer

23:00.920 --> 23:05.440
windows. And this is really sort of the critical way in which information is

23:05.440 --> 23:12.040
transferred up and down a hierarchy, right up and down this this nested

23:12.040 --> 23:19.360
observer window hierarchy. And so we propose that electrical activity really

23:19.360 --> 23:26.640
serves as the lingua franca or the, you know, universal generalizable principle at

23:26.640 --> 23:35.040
play here. And so I'll talk to you today about brain regions or brain nuclei and

23:35.040 --> 23:40.000
neurons. And we, you know, speculate that proteins are also observer windows and

23:40.000 --> 23:44.400
potentially there's higher or lower observer windows also at play here, but

23:44.400 --> 23:49.880
we'll really focus on brain nuclei and neurons. And we'll be talking about

23:49.880 --> 23:55.680
electrical activity as really this universal form of communication, where

23:55.680 --> 24:00.640
even though they're comprised of very different material, and they're, you know,

24:00.640 --> 24:07.720
operating at very different scales, if information integration can occur, using a

24:07.720 --> 24:12.320
common substrate, even though it's at different levels, this sort of

24:12.320 --> 24:16.920
facilitates that communication of information. And we believe that this is a

24:16.920 --> 24:22.920
plausible solution for the protein scale, maybe some intermediary scales and

24:22.920 --> 24:28.440
potentially at even more fundamental lower scales, that electricity or

24:28.440 --> 24:36.120
electromagnetism could be a very fundamental sort of substrate for

24:36.120 --> 24:41.160
processing this information. And it's very apparent that electrical activity

24:41.160 --> 24:46.240
plays a fundamental role in the level of neurons in brain nuclei, which we'll

24:46.240 --> 24:49.840
talk about as examples. So I'm going to start off with our first principle,

24:49.840 --> 24:56.720
synchrony. And synchrony is the formation of an observer window. And so a funny

24:56.720 --> 25:01.840
example or analogy here is if you see a bunch of lights attached to the limbs of

25:01.840 --> 25:05.880
a human, and they're walking through the night, so all you can see are those lights,

25:06.280 --> 25:12.520
you'll witness the movement of a human. But if the human stands still, you just

25:12.520 --> 25:19.240
see a smattering of lights and there's no human form available. And so when we're

25:19.240 --> 25:24.680
studying the processing of information, we do really need to focus on that

25:24.680 --> 25:33.280
process, you know, the movement through time of these biological systems. And

25:33.280 --> 25:38.320
what's beautiful about synchrony is synchrony is really the creation and the

25:38.320 --> 25:44.400
formation of a single unit. And so I feel like this is almost like, like it's

25:44.400 --> 25:48.160
almost like a nuance that you accept, but you don't even realize that you've

25:48.160 --> 25:55.840
already accepted this, is that you call things by their name, you call something

25:56.080 --> 26:01.720
a thing. And in calling something a thing, you're inferring that that thing has a

26:01.720 --> 26:07.280
strong degree of structural and temporal stability. And so synchrony is really

26:07.280 --> 26:13.920
just putting a definition and a label on what that definition of a thing is, you

26:13.920 --> 26:20.120
know. And so a good example is like a protein, we just call it a protein, but

26:20.120 --> 26:24.440
really there's such a high degree of synchronization within the protein that

26:24.440 --> 26:31.720
it acts as a single protein, right? neurons act as single cells. And brain

26:31.720 --> 26:36.160
nuclei act as single brain nuclei. And so how do they do that? Well, just go

26:36.160 --> 26:41.640
through the neuron and nuclei example. But neurons have this phospholipid

26:41.640 --> 26:48.040
bilayer membrane, it acts as a capacitor for the neuron. And so it stores up this

26:48.040 --> 26:53.640
strong electrical potential inside of the neuron. And you reach a point where the

26:53.640 --> 27:00.720
neuron has such strong electrical coupling in its, you know, internally, that it

27:00.720 --> 27:06.760
behaves as if it's a single electrical functional unit. Similarly, a brain

27:06.760 --> 27:12.320
nuclei exhibits these synchronized electrical states, where the entire

27:12.320 --> 27:18.000
nuclei will undergo this single electrical potential. And you can witness

27:18.000 --> 27:23.480
these electrically vibrating fluctuations in the nuclei that you're

27:23.480 --> 27:28.160
observing. And they have these characteristic electrical rhythms that

27:28.160 --> 27:34.040
they exhibit. And these are enabled by a lot of structural properties in the

27:34.040 --> 27:39.200
neuron, or in the architecture of the neurons. Typically, it's called a

27:39.200 --> 27:43.840
phaptic coupling. Essentially, this is when a bunch of neurons are oriented

27:43.840 --> 27:49.040
together, and they undergo their own electrical potentials or action

27:49.040 --> 27:54.960
potentials or firing, as people usually call it. And a lot of these neurons are

27:54.960 --> 28:00.520
oriented so that the electric fields generated within the neurons are then

28:00.520 --> 28:06.120
propagated across a whole population. And so what you see in the wild is you see

28:06.120 --> 28:11.400
a brain nuclei will exhibit these big electric fluctuations that are

28:11.400 --> 28:17.240
basically enabled by all of these parallel fibers in these brain nuclei. And

28:17.240 --> 28:22.000
then they start to serve a functional role and it begins to act as a single

28:22.000 --> 28:27.160
functional unit, similar to these neurons behaving as single functional units. And

28:27.160 --> 28:32.600
so what's really cool is that if you are measuring the electrical potential in

28:32.600 --> 28:39.320
the brain, and let's say we're focusing on this slower frequency range where you

28:39.320 --> 28:45.440
would see brain nuclei operating, you'll have this background activity in your

28:45.440 --> 28:51.560
electrical recording. And when you found a brain nuclei that's forming

28:51.560 --> 28:56.760
some functional area, some functional unit, you'll see this bump, this rhythmic

28:56.760 --> 29:01.480
oscillation emerging from just the background noise of your recording. And

29:01.480 --> 29:07.520
you can be fairly certain that when you see these electrical bumps in your

29:07.520 --> 29:11.280
recording, after running a four-year transform and breaking it down into the

29:11.280 --> 29:15.880
frequency domain, you can be sure that there's some sort of brain nuclei

29:15.880 --> 29:21.680
processing information at this certain scale. And so the brain nuclei have

29:21.680 --> 29:28.240
clearly defined boundaries, and they have a very clearly defined rhythm at which

29:28.240 --> 29:35.480
they are operating. So what does synchrony mean practically or to cognition? And

29:35.520 --> 29:41.720
so this was an idea proposed by Wolfgang Singer called Binding Biosynchrony. And

29:41.720 --> 29:48.240
here we're using this exact concept in the now model. And the idea is that there's

29:48.240 --> 29:53.480
this difficult challenge in psychology called the binding problem. I have a

29:53.480 --> 29:57.440
gestalt representation of let's say a chair. I know what it looks like, I know

29:57.440 --> 30:01.160
what it feels like, I know how to use it, I know what the texture is like, I know

30:01.160 --> 30:06.080
what the color is like, how do I have this single representation of a chair? How

30:06.080 --> 30:10.880
does all this information get bound together? And so Wolfgang Singer proposed

30:10.880 --> 30:18.120
that synchrony forms a natural sort of neural mechanism for how you can have

30:18.120 --> 30:22.720
information coming from different sources, and then it gets bound together

30:22.720 --> 30:26.600
through this synchrony. In the now model we propose that there is a

30:26.680 --> 30:32.160
integration rate that the observer window opens, it accumulates a bunch of

30:32.160 --> 30:38.160
information, and then it binds that information into a single gestalt

30:38.160 --> 30:44.760
representation. And once you have formed it, it exists, and you experience it if

30:44.760 --> 30:50.200
you are that observer window, and then the next cycle a new representation is

30:50.200 --> 30:54.560
generated. And it could be that this is some predictive coding model where

30:54.560 --> 30:58.640
there's sort of a model of the world that gets update periodically, and so

30:58.640 --> 31:03.000
there's an update that kicks in, and so there's sort of a continuity or a

31:03.000 --> 31:07.480
stability through time, or you could view this as sort of these like discrete

31:07.480 --> 31:14.960
refreshes of information with no time between them, it's just now, now, now,

31:14.960 --> 31:19.840
now, there's just an experience now, a gestalt experience now, and another

31:19.840 --> 31:23.600
gestalt experience now, and there actually is no time between those

31:23.680 --> 31:27.800
discrete moments. So it's sort of an alternative framing for what this might

31:27.800 --> 31:37.040
feel like in our conscious experience. So an example I really love is called the

31:37.040 --> 31:42.160
flicker fusion rate, and there was a, you know, this phenomenon has been

31:42.160 --> 31:46.680
studied quite a bit, but there was a cognitive neuroscience study that came

31:46.680 --> 31:53.080
out in the past 10 years or so that was really interesting and impactful by

31:53.080 --> 31:57.520
connecting it to these electrical oscillations. So the idea is that if I

31:57.520 --> 32:03.400
present two flashes of light, very quickly, you will see them as two

32:03.400 --> 32:09.400
different flashes of light. But as the time between the flashes shrinks, you

32:09.400 --> 32:14.800
hit a point where the two flashes are really just one flash now, right? And

32:14.800 --> 32:19.320
so the flashes fuse, you have a flickering light, and then you have the

32:19.320 --> 32:24.760
fusion into a single light. The exact moment where you flip over from two

32:24.760 --> 32:30.000
flashes into a single flash is called the flicker fusion rate. That is the

32:30.000 --> 32:35.520
rate at which the lights switch from flicker into fusion. And there was this

32:35.520 --> 32:40.440
really cool study by Samaha and Postal, who were looking at the visual

32:40.440 --> 32:45.320
cortex, and the visual cortex has, it is, it can be conceptualized as a brain

32:45.320 --> 32:51.520
nuclei with a electrical fluctuation and electrical potential. And this one is

32:51.520 --> 32:56.600
often called the alpha oscillation, and it happens to be around 10 hertz, 10

32:56.600 --> 33:01.440
times per second. And what they found is that there's some variation between

33:01.440 --> 33:07.480
people at what that integration rate or what that refresh rate is in visual

33:07.480 --> 33:14.240
cortex. And so people who have a slightly faster alpha oscillation in visual

33:14.240 --> 33:20.800
cortex, they can actually still perceive the flicker at a smaller and smaller

33:20.800 --> 33:25.880
time scale. So it takes, you know, they have to be much closer for the flashes

33:25.880 --> 33:32.800
to fuse. And the idea is that every alpha oscillation is opening a window,

33:32.800 --> 33:40.240
taking in some information. But if you have a slower rhythm in the back of your

33:40.240 --> 33:45.640
brain, in the visual cortex, then both of the flashes are going to end up in the

33:45.640 --> 33:49.560
same window, and they're going to get integrated together into a fused single

33:49.560 --> 33:55.400
flash. And so this really fits nicely with the now model, where these observer

33:55.400 --> 33:59.800
windows have these integration rates. And this is predictive of the rhythmic

33:59.800 --> 34:05.480
refresh of information in this observer window. And so now we're talking about

34:05.480 --> 34:10.120
this rhythmic refresh rate of these gestalt perceptions in different brain

34:10.120 --> 34:16.440
nuclei. What does this mean for you as a conscious being? What is this rhythmic

34:16.440 --> 34:22.360
refresh rate? Well, we argue in the now model that this rhythmic refresh rate is

34:22.360 --> 34:29.600
equivalent to your perception of time. And so the temporal processing of this

34:29.600 --> 34:34.680
information has a fixed rate. If you're a brain nuclei, it'll be occurring around

34:34.680 --> 34:38.920
the scale of 10 times per second, five times per second. But if you're a neuron,

34:38.960 --> 34:43.400
it might be happening at 1000 times per second or 100 times per second, much,

34:43.400 --> 34:51.440
much, much faster, right? And so what it is like to be that observer window is to

34:51.440 --> 34:59.200
feel a flow of time at the rate at which your refreshes are occurring. And so

34:59.200 --> 35:05.080
what's really fascinating is there's a few anomalous experiences in our

35:05.080 --> 35:09.920
experience that relate to time perception. So when you're in a life

35:09.920 --> 35:14.800
threatening situation, you're driving down the freeway, a truck changes lanes into

35:14.800 --> 35:20.920
you and you are feeling like an impending doom, you will have the

35:20.920 --> 35:27.200
experience of time slowing down. What's happening? Could it be that the observer

35:27.200 --> 35:33.960
window that is you is increasing the integration rate, that frequency of

35:33.960 --> 35:40.160
gestalt representation generation is increased, you're tapping into more

35:40.160 --> 35:45.000
concrete, less abstract information, you have less time to integrate a bunch of

35:45.000 --> 35:48.640
interesting information, you have less integration time, but you can get much

35:48.640 --> 35:55.880
more refreshes, right? You can get more static frames of what is happening. And

35:55.880 --> 36:01.040
so time is experienced as a dilation, where it feels like time is moving slow.

36:01.200 --> 36:06.320
But really, you're having more experience per second because your observer

36:06.320 --> 36:12.360
window has frequency shifted into the faster range. On the flip side, we can

36:12.360 --> 36:18.920
have the opposite, where time folds inward and dissolves away and an hour

36:18.920 --> 36:23.800
passes in an instant and we lose track of time and suddenly we look up from our

36:23.800 --> 36:28.400
book or we pull out of our thoughts and 10 minutes have flown by and we're

36:28.400 --> 36:33.080
shocked that all this time has disappeared. Where did it go? So we suggest

36:33.080 --> 36:39.080
that in this example, your observer window is shifting the opposite direction,

36:39.080 --> 36:44.640
right? It's shifting towards longer integration times. More information is

36:44.640 --> 36:49.680
able to enter into this open window and gets bound into a gestalt representation,

36:49.680 --> 36:56.400
which is a large abstract integration of a lot of interesting and creative

36:56.400 --> 37:01.960
abstract ideas. So when you're daydreaming, when you're mind wandering, when

37:01.960 --> 37:09.000
you're lost in thought, you might have a sort of stretching of your temporal

37:09.000 --> 37:14.240
experience as the integration windows expand to get more and more information

37:14.240 --> 37:20.400
into a single integration and your thoughts become more abstract and yet

37:20.680 --> 37:27.720
time flies by because you have less moments of consciousness per second.

37:27.720 --> 37:34.240
However, there's more information in this abstract quality in each of those

37:34.240 --> 37:38.880
thoughts. So we're going to move on to the second principle of coherence and

37:38.880 --> 37:43.880
coherence is really best understood by contrasting it with synchrony. So

37:43.880 --> 37:50.000
synchrony, remember, is how we create an observer window. This is no easy feat.

37:50.280 --> 37:56.240
You need a lot of biological infrastructure like a capaciting membrane or

37:56.240 --> 38:03.320
all these fibers oriented to create high synchronization in the brain nuclei.

38:03.320 --> 38:10.840
So synchrony is the creation of single entities with zero lag. Everything is

38:10.840 --> 38:15.520
just one thing all of a sudden and we can form this equivalent of a conscious

38:15.520 --> 38:22.280
being with the capacity to integrate information. Coherence is like a

38:22.280 --> 38:27.560
conversation. So the analogy here is that coherence can be understood of as two

38:27.560 --> 38:31.600
people having a conversation. One person talks, the other one listens, the other

38:31.600 --> 38:36.920
person talks, the other person listens. And so there's a communication going on.

38:36.920 --> 38:43.840
And the words need to be transmitted to the other person, right? There is a

38:44.240 --> 38:50.480
non zero phase lag. There is a lag between the information going from one

38:50.480 --> 38:54.920
person to the other. And when the information is received, it's integrated

38:54.920 --> 38:58.280
in that observer window and then it, you know, some new information is sent

38:58.280 --> 39:04.360
back, right? And so when two people are having a productive conversation, they

39:04.360 --> 39:09.040
are coherent. If you were to track their audio waves, you would find that

39:09.040 --> 39:13.640
they're sort of vibing together, but they're not happening at the same time,

39:13.640 --> 39:18.080
right? It's not the same person speaking the same words simultaneously. Sometimes

39:18.080 --> 39:23.400
that can arbitrarily happen, but it's more of a predictive thing, right? So

39:23.440 --> 39:28.320
their communication has delay. And you wouldn't say, oh, that conversation is

39:28.320 --> 39:32.160
going so well, they've just fused into the same person, right? There's still two

39:32.160 --> 39:37.320
different people. The synchrony is the creation of the two separate people. And

39:37.320 --> 39:42.000
the coherence is the communication between the different people, right? So in

39:42.000 --> 39:47.600
practice, in biology, we see that when brain regions want to communicate with

39:47.600 --> 39:52.880
each other, there's something called neuronal communication through neuronal

39:52.880 --> 39:58.240
coherence. This is developed by Pascal Fries. And Pascal Fries proposed,

39:58.280 --> 40:02.800
essentially what I just told you here, you have these rhythmically oscillating

40:02.800 --> 40:07.360
different units. And when they want to transmit information to each other, they

40:07.400 --> 40:12.760
will sort of align their oscillations so that one transmits some information, the

40:12.760 --> 40:16.960
other one receives it, and the transmissions are sent back and forth,

40:16.960 --> 40:21.920
right? And so if we look into the brain and we look at some complex cognitive

40:21.920 --> 40:25.640
control tasks where multiple regions need to communicate with each other, you'll

40:25.640 --> 40:29.520
see that they'll become coherent with each other. And that information will

40:29.520 --> 40:34.320
preferentially follow these different pathways. And so what's really cool about

40:34.320 --> 40:39.840
coherence is that it's very dynamic, it's very transient. And so this really

40:39.840 --> 40:44.760
contributes to cognitive flexibility, right? So if I had information come into

40:44.760 --> 40:50.120
my brain, and it always went down the same pathways every single time, this

40:50.120 --> 40:54.840
would limit my flexibility to dynamically interact with my environment. And

40:54.840 --> 41:00.880
actually, we want our attention to route information in this pathway versus

41:00.920 --> 41:04.560
another pathway. And so when you want to pay attention to one quality, but not

41:04.560 --> 41:09.960
another, you'll see that those regions processing the qualities that you're

41:09.960 --> 41:13.920
paying attention to will become coherent with each other. And the ones that you

41:13.920 --> 41:17.720
don't want information to go to will kind of not have that strengthened

41:17.920 --> 41:22.680
coherence together. And so there's this really fascinating phenomena in the

41:22.680 --> 41:29.320
brain where so much of our processing is linked to very interesting, distinct

41:29.320 --> 41:34.120
rhythms, and probably the most pronounced in human cognition is what's

41:34.120 --> 41:38.880
called the theta rhythm. This is about five times to eight times per second,

41:38.880 --> 41:45.240
kind of five to eight range. And the theta rhythm is found in so much of our

41:45.240 --> 41:50.840
behavior and in a lot of our information coming into our brains and in a very

41:50.840 --> 41:57.240
special brain nuclei called the hippocampus. And so when I am speaking to

41:57.240 --> 42:03.040
you right now, the words that I am saying to you are actually entering your

42:03.080 --> 42:09.920
ears at a rhythm of the theta rhythm. And shockingly, this theta rhythm is

42:09.920 --> 42:13.840
found across many different cultures and languages. Doesn't matter what

42:13.840 --> 42:19.680
country you're born in, what language or ancestry you have, all languages that

42:19.680 --> 42:24.480
we've been able to find have a very pronounced eight Hertz to five Hertz

42:24.480 --> 42:31.360
theta rhythm in the speech envelope that gets transmitted. So cross culturally,

42:31.800 --> 42:35.760
people are talking to each other at the exact same rate, and it seems to have

42:36.040 --> 42:40.520
maybe an evolutionary and a biological basis, right? So if your brain and your

42:40.520 --> 42:46.160
hippocampus, this memory storage episodic memory construction region in the

42:46.160 --> 42:52.400
brain, it is vibrating in the theta rhythm. And so when you're giving people

42:52.560 --> 42:58.920
words and language, you want it to resonate into their episodic memories and

42:58.920 --> 43:03.280
you want it to be constructed into present new memories, but you also wanted

43:03.280 --> 43:11.040
to access old memories. In addition, your eyes are moving at roughly a theta

43:11.040 --> 43:16.640
rhythm. Even when you fixate on a single fixed point, your eye is actually

43:16.680 --> 43:23.240
twitching around in what's called micro saccades, small eye movements. Those

43:23.240 --> 43:27.000
micro saccades and those macro saccades as you look around a room and explore a

43:27.000 --> 43:30.960
new environment are all locked to the theta rhythm, right? So you have

43:31.560 --> 43:40.760
audition, theta, vision, theta, major memory storage in theta. And so all of

43:40.760 --> 43:44.440
these different regions in the brain are processing different information, but

43:44.480 --> 43:48.680
they're transmitting that information to each other in the theta rhythm. And

43:48.680 --> 43:53.280
there was this really cool paper by the Hanselmeyer lab that that actually

43:53.280 --> 43:59.680
presented people with snippets of audio and flashes of video. And when those

43:59.680 --> 44:05.680
snippets and flashes were presented in theta rhythm, coherently, you were

44:05.680 --> 44:13.720
actually able to assemble an episodic memory for those audio visual parents.

44:13.960 --> 44:18.200
And when they looked in the brain, they found electrical activity rhythmically

44:18.200 --> 44:23.320
vibrating in theta frequency in visual cortex and in audio cortex. And there

44:23.320 --> 44:27.520
was increased coherence when you were forming a memory and when you were

44:27.520 --> 44:33.640
successfully sort of pairing that information together. And so coherence

44:33.880 --> 44:39.640
is a way that this audio nuclei, this visual nuclei are sharing information

44:39.640 --> 44:44.240
dynamically, routing it over to the hippocampus, routing it up to higher

44:44.240 --> 44:48.560
order regions that need to process some information. And so coherence seems to

44:48.560 --> 44:53.640
be this really fundamental role for how information is routed throughout the

44:53.640 --> 44:59.880
brain. So what might this feel like? And so I think there's this idea that, you

44:59.880 --> 45:04.120
know, hey, we're just routing information around. And so it's kind of just like

45:04.120 --> 45:09.960
switchboards or circuit breakers just pumping information here and there. But

45:09.960 --> 45:16.720
I wonder and I speculate whether the experience of being an observer window

45:16.720 --> 45:22.600
within a coherent transient functional network feels like a dialogue, feels

45:22.600 --> 45:28.640
like a conversation, maybe even like a debate, and not necessarily just like

45:28.680 --> 45:34.320
the direct one to one transmission of information, right? We go back to the

45:34.320 --> 45:38.840
analogy of two individuals communicating. If you're an observer window and

45:38.840 --> 45:43.200
you're at this macro scale, you have all this neural information processing,

45:43.200 --> 45:47.640
protein information processing, all these scales beneath you working to

45:47.640 --> 45:53.840
generate all this information. Does this macro scale electrical activity that we

45:53.840 --> 45:59.680
can measure for this nuclei? Is it like the equivalent of like a fully fledged

45:59.680 --> 46:05.480
personality? And here, you know, there's a couple movies like that movie inside out

46:05.480 --> 46:09.680
by Pixar, which sort of depicts these different personalities communicating

46:09.680 --> 46:15.640
with each other in the brain. Is coherence more like a dialogue than just,

46:15.640 --> 46:20.520
you know, sending a signal through a wire or like a carrier pigeon from one

46:20.520 --> 46:25.040
place to another. Instead, it's a dynamic interplay or conversation between a

46:25.040 --> 46:30.240
bunch of personalities. And so there's this guy, Richard Schwartz, who he was

46:30.240 --> 46:35.240
studying, he was doing family therapy where he would take a dysfunctional

46:35.240 --> 46:38.680
family and they'd go through a psychotherapeutic process where they'd

46:38.680 --> 46:42.200
communicate and they'd look at different family roles that different people were

46:42.200 --> 46:47.880
playing. And he found that psychologically, this psychotherapy that he was

46:47.920 --> 46:54.800
using actually works well in an individual. An individual has an internal family

46:54.800 --> 46:59.440
system, as he calls it, a bunch of personalities coexisting within your

46:59.440 --> 47:03.280
mind and within your psyche. And these different personalities can be

47:03.280 --> 47:06.840
dysfunctional. The conversation could not be going well. There could be

47:06.840 --> 47:12.120
dysfunction in the family or there could be a coherent family unit where the

47:12.120 --> 47:15.640
personalities are flowing and communicating effectively with each

47:15.640 --> 47:22.600
other. Is coherence some signature or some direct neural mechanism for how

47:22.600 --> 47:26.680
these different personalities in your brain communicate with each other? It's

47:26.680 --> 47:32.440
not a carrier pigeon. It's a dynamic, interesting conversation between sub

47:32.440 --> 47:40.600
entities within you. So being a observer window and undergoing coherence might

47:40.600 --> 47:46.800
feel like more of a conversation than just shooting signals through wires.

47:46.920 --> 47:52.800
Third and final principle is cross frequency coupling. And oh my God, I

47:52.800 --> 47:57.160
love this principle. It is so exciting. So much of my own personal research has

47:57.160 --> 48:01.160
been moving towards looking at cross frequency coupling, because it's really

48:01.160 --> 48:05.720
this fascinating way that you can study multiple spatial temporal scales

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
interacting with each other. And so the first discovery of cross frequency

48:11.000 --> 48:15.800
coupling was in the hippocampus, the region I mentioned to you previously. And

48:15.800 --> 48:20.640
what they found was that the brain nuclei of the hippocampus was undergoing

48:20.640 --> 48:27.640
these big slow rhythmic theta oscillations. And meanwhile, high frequency

48:27.680 --> 48:33.960
neurons were also activating and going through these action potentials. And

48:33.960 --> 48:38.600
they were coding for different regions in space. So there's a rat running

48:38.600 --> 48:42.880
around a maze. And there's different cells called place cells that fire for

48:42.880 --> 48:47.040
different locations along the maze. And they found that within the theta rhythm,

48:47.240 --> 48:52.480
a sequence of these place cells were firing off. And as the place cells were

48:52.480 --> 48:58.200
activating, they were all locked to a particular phase within the theta

48:58.200 --> 49:02.200
oscillation. So every time the theta oscillation like went up, you get a bunch

49:02.320 --> 49:05.840
of place cells activating, and then it goes down and there's silence. And then

49:05.840 --> 49:08.240
it goes back up and a bunch of activations and it goes down and there's

49:08.240 --> 49:13.000
silence, right? And so this is called phase amplitude coupling, it's a form of

49:13.000 --> 49:19.040
cross frequency coupling, where the phase of the slow frequency oscillation is

49:19.040 --> 49:25.240
related to the amplitude of the higher frequency oscillation, right? And so

49:25.400 --> 49:32.080
research shows that you can actually decode trajectories of movement from

49:32.080 --> 49:37.280
these theta oscillations in the hippocampus. And when you go down to the

49:37.280 --> 49:40.920
neural level, you just see a cell fires for this place, a cell fires for that

49:40.920 --> 49:46.160
place. But from the electric fields of the hippocampus, you could figure out a

49:46.160 --> 49:52.160
trajectory of motion, right? And so it's it's basically forming some form of

49:52.160 --> 49:57.520
abstraction, right? It's sequencing, it's organizing, it's it's basically

49:57.560 --> 50:04.960
ordering the lower level information into this just stalled more abstract

50:04.960 --> 50:11.080
representation. So it's not just like binding a more complex representation

50:11.080 --> 50:15.320
like we talked about with synchrony, but it's really this form of abstraction.

50:15.640 --> 50:20.320
You're building a more abstract representation from more concrete

50:20.320 --> 50:26.800
information, right? Trajectory is more abstract than just a point. So here you

50:26.800 --> 50:31.920
have like a vector and maybe a speed. But below it, you just have a single point

50:32.080 --> 50:37.560
in in space and maybe in time. And so we can find a lot of evidence that when

50:37.560 --> 50:42.600
you're doing these higher order cognitive tasks, right? When you're

50:42.600 --> 50:48.120
undergoing some mental function, which requires abstract knowledge, you'll

50:48.120 --> 50:53.320
find this phase amplitude coupling pattern, this cross frequency coupling

50:53.320 --> 50:59.760
pattern, where you see these big slow rhythmic brain nuclei coupled to these

50:59.760 --> 51:05.280
faster rhythms. And the the real canonical one is called theta gamma

51:05.280 --> 51:10.440
coupling. And this was the example in the hippocampus that I mentioned. And you

51:10.440 --> 51:15.360
find theta gamma coupling whenever you need to generate more abstract

51:15.360 --> 51:20.600
representations, or you need to build more abstract items from more concrete

51:20.600 --> 51:26.520
items. And so this seems to be sort of a universally applied mechanism in the

51:26.520 --> 51:30.880
brain. And it's gaining a lot of traction. And we're finding more and more

51:30.880 --> 51:35.880
evidence that this is taking place. Newer rhythm, which I've been sort of

51:35.880 --> 51:39.320
pioneering and getting really interested in, is called delta beta

51:39.320 --> 51:44.960
coupling. And this is the idea of similar to the to the building of abstract

51:45.200 --> 51:50.280
ideas or representations. Delta beta coupling has been much more strongly

51:50.280 --> 51:56.920
linked to action initiation and decision making and action planning. So in a way,

51:56.920 --> 52:02.360
it's sort of like the top down equivalent to the theta gamma rhythm, where

52:02.360 --> 52:08.160
you see these big slow prefrontal decision making regions oscillating when

52:08.160 --> 52:12.080
you're trying to choose between a couple of different options. And then this

52:12.080 --> 52:16.560
really fast beta rhythm, which is linked to spinal cord activation and muscle

52:16.560 --> 52:22.080
innervation muscle activation. There's this coupling between this big slow

52:22.080 --> 52:27.240
decision making process, and then the spinal cord bodily movements that get

52:27.240 --> 52:32.800
enacted. And so just like cross frequency coupling sort of has this bottom up flow

52:32.800 --> 52:37.240
of information as you're building more abstract representations moving up the

52:37.240 --> 52:41.720
nested observer window hierarchy. There might be other frequency bands that are

52:41.720 --> 52:45.720
really dedicated to taking the information from the tire order more

52:45.760 --> 52:51.240
abstract regions, big slow observer windows down into the details where we

52:51.240 --> 52:56.280
got to translate all these big abstract action plans into move that muscle, move

52:56.280 --> 53:03.000
this muscle, you know, do this complex piano play with your fingers. But it

53:03.000 --> 53:08.360
comes from these big abstract cartoony decisions that are being made. So what

53:08.360 --> 53:13.120
does this feel like? Well, I think this one has a very clear experiential

53:13.120 --> 53:17.440
analogy, right? The idea is, and I mentioned this earlier in the episode,

53:17.440 --> 53:22.360
ideas popping into your head. This is the theta gamma experience. An idea shows

53:22.360 --> 53:29.440
up, and it's in your mind, and it's fully formed to subtract delta beta. I

53:29.440 --> 53:33.600
want to move my arm over here. I'm not thinking about I'm gonna use my flexor

53:33.600 --> 53:38.160
extensor, and I'm going to use my elbow to do this thing, right? It's all just

53:38.160 --> 53:43.040
this fluid motion that occurs. And I have very abstract ideas of what is

53:43.080 --> 53:47.080
actually happening. And somehow it gets translated. I mean, you can barely think

53:47.080 --> 53:51.560
about what you're doing, and you'll go and do it, right? A good analogy is with

53:51.560 --> 53:57.440
professional sports, professional musicians, right? They they learn these

53:57.440 --> 54:02.120
complex motor movements, but then it gets encoded into lower levels. And then

54:02.120 --> 54:06.520
they're just activating cartoons, right? There's just these cartoonified

54:06.520 --> 54:12.960
decisions being performed. And then and then it occurs. And I think another

54:12.960 --> 54:19.800
cool analogy related to this is that cross frequency coupling is limited,

54:19.840 --> 54:24.520
right? It's a weak form of coupling. You can only influence one level beneath

54:24.520 --> 54:29.840
you, one level above you, you can't get much deeper than that, right? So you hit

54:29.840 --> 54:34.800
a wall, and you can't go deeper. What does that feel like? I think a good

54:34.800 --> 54:40.680
example is optical illusions, right? These undulating visual patterns that

54:40.720 --> 54:47.400
come from black and white checkered visual effects. And so we know it's not

54:47.400 --> 54:51.680
real, we know that there's nothing actually undulating. However, we can't

54:51.680 --> 54:56.200
stop ourselves from seeing it. You don't have control over it, it's just coming

54:56.200 --> 55:01.680
up. So we don't have like ultimate perceptual control over what our eyes

55:01.680 --> 55:06.080
are doing, you know, we're only influencing one level beneath ourselves.

55:06.960 --> 55:10.760
There are weird examples like with the Necker cube. It's a cube that you can

55:10.760 --> 55:16.360
view from two different perspectives. And in that example, people are able to

55:16.360 --> 55:21.040
flip between these different ways of viewing it. Is it popping out of the

55:21.040 --> 55:25.800
screen? Is it sinking into the screen? And you can actually flip that at will.

55:26.040 --> 55:30.600
But it's challenging. It's hard to flip the Necker cube for some people. Other

55:30.600 --> 55:34.760
people find it easier. So what makes the difference between people that have an

55:34.760 --> 55:38.920
easy time flipping the Necker cube and others that don't, you know? So I think

55:38.920 --> 55:44.640
there's like, emphasizing this, you're the volitional agent at this higher level

55:44.640 --> 55:49.240
trying to have top down influence on these lower levels. And sometimes you

55:49.240 --> 55:54.000
struggle to have the influence that you want to have. Other times it takes the

55:54.000 --> 56:02.040
form of cartoonified abstraction, right? And yet it makes its way down. But

56:02.040 --> 56:06.520
you're only operating at a very higher level. All right, quick note on

56:06.520 --> 56:11.000
fractals, and then we'll hop into the quantum computer question at the end.

56:11.880 --> 56:17.040
So when we measure electrical activity in the brain, if this was all real, then

56:17.040 --> 56:22.080
we'd want to see this sort of scale free observer windows at all these different

56:22.080 --> 56:27.040
levels, cross frequency coupling going down this hierarchy, all this interesting

56:27.040 --> 56:33.360
resonance structure. And what we do find is that the background noise of the

56:33.360 --> 56:38.760
brain has this one over F power distribution, and it's called pink noise.

56:39.240 --> 56:45.640
White noise is like equal noise at all frequency bands. Pink noise is shifted

56:45.640 --> 56:51.280
towards the lower frequency end. So lower frequencies have more noise and

56:51.280 --> 56:56.280
higher frequencies have less noise. This sounds like the ocean. You can look up

56:56.280 --> 56:59.840
pink noise and listen to it for yourself. But it sounds a lot more like the

56:59.840 --> 57:04.640
ocean, whereas white noise sounds like static. And the pink noise is a little

57:04.640 --> 57:10.440
more soothing than this pure static. So when we measure the brain, we see pink

57:10.440 --> 57:16.360
noise, we hear the ocean in the electrical activity of our brains. And what

57:16.360 --> 57:22.800
this implies is that these big low frequency rhythms have a bit more of an

57:22.800 --> 57:29.040
influence over the overall signal in our in our brains and in our bodies. And

57:29.040 --> 57:33.280
this is what we would want to see if there was a scale free fractal like

57:33.480 --> 57:41.520
organization to the activity in our bodies. And so there's a lesser known

57:42.800 --> 57:48.560
principle in fractal mathematics called the Hearst exponent. So if you take the

57:48.560 --> 57:54.240
Mandelbrot set, you kind of have this like Buddha looking figure at at once

57:54.240 --> 57:59.080
one view of the Mandelbrot set. And as you zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,

57:59.080 --> 58:03.040
zoom, you keep zooming, you see all these crazy patterns, crazy, crazy, crazy

58:03.040 --> 58:07.520
patterns. Boom, you see the Buddha shape again, once you get deep enough into the

58:07.520 --> 58:12.160
Mandelbrot. Keep zooming, keep zooming, keep zooming, boom, there it is again.

58:12.600 --> 58:18.880
There is a certain rate at which you will zoom and then you see the original

58:18.880 --> 58:25.800
pattern that you started off with, right? And so there's a rate of zoom until you

58:25.800 --> 58:31.720
hit an interesting pattern. And so what we're using or what we're sort of

58:31.720 --> 58:38.800
speculating is that observer windows are kind of like fractals in that they have

58:39.280 --> 58:45.480
a certain depth that you have to zoom before you see more observer windows. We

58:45.480 --> 58:50.200
have observer windows, they're neurons, let's say, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,

58:50.200 --> 58:54.440
zoom, zoom, zoom, nothing, no observers, no observer windows, bam, proteins, these

58:54.440 --> 58:58.880
are observer windows. Keep zooming, more time passes, more observer windows,

58:58.880 --> 59:04.560
right? Zoom out from the neuron, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, bam, brain

59:04.560 --> 59:10.520
nuclei. So the idea is that observer windows are not arbitrary, they're not

59:10.520 --> 59:16.760
anywhere, there are clear boundaries on what can be an observer window and where

59:16.760 --> 59:22.600
you find the observer windows. They're not infinitely spread like at all, at all

59:22.600 --> 59:28.840
levels, but there's some sort of ratio or some sort of mathematical description

59:28.840 --> 59:34.080
for when observer windows show up in your body and in your, in your brain. And

59:34.120 --> 59:40.040
so a fun question here is how deep can we go? You know, is it turtles all the way

59:40.040 --> 59:45.320
down, right? The, the classic example of the earth is flat, there's a turtle

59:45.320 --> 59:48.680
holding it up, but who's holding up the turtle? Oh, another turtle, but who's

59:48.680 --> 59:51.520
holding that turtle up? Oh, another turtle, oh, it must be turtles all the way

59:51.520 --> 59:58.840
down, right? How deep does this observer window fractal go, right? Who knows,

59:58.840 --> 01:00:03.080
maybe you hit Planck scale and that's the last observer window, you got these

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.800
Planck scale observer windows and everything's kind of built up out of

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:12.520
that level. If we zoom out, are there observer windows at larger, more

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:20.320
macroscopic, slower scales? Maybe, maybe biology is complex and biology needed to

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.600
be evolved. And so we are the largest observer windows on the planet. And

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:29.400
maybe we are giant observer windows relative to the rest of nature and

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.280
resting to the world around us, right? Maybe there are larger observer windows.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:38.040
What would that look like? Very speculative, almost into the woo woo

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:44.720
range, but interesting and fun to think about. Okay, observer windows are

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.000
limited. They are difficult to create and they're defined by a high degree of

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.520
synchrony. How high is the synchrony requirement to be an observer window?

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.960
Well, you know, Jonathan Schuller and I are going to move forward publishing this

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:05.880
paper thinking about this, just very classical, sort of simpler terms, just

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.640
talking about electrical activity and coherence and synchrony is kind of a

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.680
matter of degree, you know, where coherence is weak coupling, synchrony is

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:17.920
strong coupling, but it needs to be strong enough that it forms that functional

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:24.920
unit, right? However, if you take a quantum computer, quantum consciousness,

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:32.920
take on all of this, what if synchrony was really quantum coherence? And here

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:36.560
the terminology gets very confusing because the word quantum coherence sounds

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.880
like the other word for coherence. But the idea here would be that really,

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:47.400
really strong coupling would be you form a single wave function, a bunch of

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:51.840
quantum bits, they're all entangled, they form a single quantum computer. And so

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:57.160
the observer window is a quantum computer. The high degree of synchrony that

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:03.200
you require is the ultimate level of synchrony. No environmental influence

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:09.880
whatsoever. Quantum mechanics has a definition where the superposition and

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:15.320
the entanglement effects reign supreme, they become dominant when there's no

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.840
environmental influence and it's like the state of ultimate synchrony, right? So

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:28.000
one way to recast the now model within the quantum consciousness paradigm is to

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.080
say that observer windows are quantum computers, right? There are quantum

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:37.880
computers, and there's quantum computers nested within quantum computers, and that

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:46.440
gets a little speculative and wild. But then these quantum computers set the

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:51.320
domain of what can be an observer window, and then all other forms of

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:55.320
compute quantum computers talking to each other is classical. Classical

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.880
communication has a phase lag, it has physical constraints on the communication.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:05.120
And so coherence is classical communication between quantum computers.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:11.840
Cross-requency coupling gets bizarre, but maybe it's some other form, yeah, of

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.960
classical communication, or maybe that is yet some third form of communication

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:22.960
that we don't really understand yet, right? Synchrony is quantum computation

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.800
fundamentally. Coherence is this digital classical, maybe forming a

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:35.320
digital computer network, and then that cross-requency coupling seems to defy

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:40.720
either of these forms. And I'll come back to this in our next episode, because

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:45.520
after this we're going to dive deeper into these notions of fractal computation,

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:51.480
and there's some fun ideas out there that I'd be remiss to not introduce you to.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:58.000
So look forward to our next episode on fractal computation, and I'll leave you

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:05.720
to ponder tonight as you fall asleep. Are you a single conscious being? Are there

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:11.560
nested conscious beings within you? Are you a rich dialogue? Is your mind a

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:18.920
corporation of workers working with you for some common goal, which is your

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:23.360
life's mission, and this is a collaborative enterprise of conscious

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:30.040
beings nested within each other? Is that your reality, or are you a holistic

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:34.360
single individual, or are you a collection of physical processes and

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:39.120
chaotic influences? Alrighty, I'll talk to you again very soon.
