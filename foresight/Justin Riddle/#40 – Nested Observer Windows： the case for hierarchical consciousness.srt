00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Welcome back to the show that tells you you are a quantum

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,120
computer with free will supervising a vast hierarchy of

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,920
cognitive systems. My name is Justin Riddle. And this is

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,180
episode 40 of the quantum consciousness series. In today's

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,560
episode, I'll be giving you an update of the nested observer

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,360
Windows model and recapping a lecture I gave at the science

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,960
of consciousness conference in April of 2024. By the end of

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,000
today's episode, we'll ask the question, what is it like to be

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,360
at the apex of a hierarchical consciousness? This episode is

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
available on YouTube and an audio only version is available on

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:15,760
So today, I'm going to be basically recapping and giving

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,400
you the same lecture that I gave at the science of consciousness

16
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,200
conference in April of 2024. But I'll be giving it a little bit

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,560
of an expanded version. You can find the original recording on

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,240
on the internet, I'll provide a link that you can go look, you

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,800
know, at the original version if you so desire. But essentially,

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,000
this is a update to a previous episode on this channel that I

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,800
gave. However, the manuscript is now published in the neuroscience

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,720
of consciousness journal. I will also give a link to that

23
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,680
paper it is open access so free to download and read for

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,760
yourself. And this is work that I've done with Jonathan

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,040
Schuehler. He's a professor at the University of California,

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,120
Santa Barbara. So all of this work is collaborative with him. So

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,440
without further ado, let's hop right into it. So the title of

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,640
the paper is hierarchical consciousness, the nested observer

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,640
windows model, or the now model for short. So to introduce this

30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,760
idea of hierarchical consciousness, because it is not,

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,840
you know, usually a typical way that people imagine that the

32
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,480
brain or the mind is organized. So I'll give you a quick

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,960
example here. So when driving, you start to mind wander, pondering

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,320
the nature of consciousness. Without warning, you suddenly

35
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,560
realize you were almost at your destination. You wonder where

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,560
the time went. Now your attention is focused on navigating

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,400
the which freeway exit to get off, and on what side street to

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,520
turn. You are acutely aware of the lack of awareness paid to

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,480
driving. But you do not notice that the wandering mind kept

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,160
wandering while you were focused on navigating the side

41
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,600
streets. When parking your car, you revisit the wandering mind.

42
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,560
There is a fresh batch of theories and models that seem to

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,080
have materialized. You diligently proceed to review those new

44
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,000
ideas, as you absentmindedly walk up the driveway. So this

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,760
example is meant to sort of showcase a couple different

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,080
ways in which we are not fully aware of all of the cognitive

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,880
processes that are ongoing within our own mind. And it appears

48
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,400
that there are many cognitive systems coexisting

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,360
simultaneously in your mind. And you usually can only pay

50
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,040
attention to one or a subset of these different cognitive

51
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,800
systems. So a very common example is driving. A lot of the

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,600
times we're flying down the freeway at 70 miles per hour. And

53
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,080
we're barely paying attention to what we're doing. But this is

54
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,240
kind of alarming, right? I mean, you could almost die at any

55
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,840
moment if you lost control of your vehicle. And yet we consume

56
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,720
our mind with fanciful ideas and and fun thought processes as

57
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,520
we are driving. And it's very second nature to just kind of

58
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,560
let your body take over the act of driving. And then at certain

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,520
moments, you need to interrupt your mind wandering and pay

60
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,760
attention to driving, you know, once again, and there's a way

61
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,220
that your mind can get your attention gets you reengaged

62
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,860
with the act of driving. And, you know, in the absence of

63
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,580
that call to pay attention, you can freely wander your mind

64
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:53,820
around. And in this example, we give kind of an additional way

65
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,380
that your mind could be operating autonomously. And that is

66
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,780
mind wandering itself. Could it be that there is a part of your

67
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,300
mind that is maybe always wandering, always engaged in

68
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,340
abstract thought. And when you pay attention to driving, let's

69
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,180
say you need to navigate some side streets as you're going to

70
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,460
your friend's house, you really need to pay attention to

71
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,460
everything that you're doing. And then you revisit the wandering

72
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,420
mind. And could it be that the wandering mind kept going when

73
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,060
you were paying attention to driving? This is something that

74
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,540
we much less often kind of attribute to what can be

75
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,780
performed autonomously in our brains in our minds. However,

76
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,380
why not? And I think if you were to introspect on your

77
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,040
conscious experience, you'd probably be able to recognize

78
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,020
many instances where there appears to be fully formed

79
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,820
ideas that are, you know, springing into your mind

80
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,260
springing into your attention. And you say, Hey, that was a

81
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,020
great idea. I just had. But where did that idea really come

82
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,820
from? Were you aware of the creation of that idea kind of

83
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,780
from the ground up? Okay, so hierarchical consciousness is a

84
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,820
very novel way of really thinking about you and your

85
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:28,100
mind. So you are at the top, you are the apex of a hierarchical

86
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,700
system. This means that there are systems nested within you.

87
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,980
And within those systems, there are further subsystems nested

88
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,460
within those. So what are some of the implications of

89
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,180
hierarchical consciousness? And what is it like to be at the apex

90
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,900
of a hierarchically consciousness system? So we often

91
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,220
kind of naively conceptualize the mind as a monologue. There's a

92
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,660
narrative stream, the story I'm telling myself as I go through

93
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,140
my day. And while there's a lot of validity to the idea of a

94
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,100
narrative monologue, there's also a lot of moments where our

95
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,060
mind is more like a dialogue, right? When you're in your

96
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,460
thoughts, and you're simulating these different ideas, you can

97
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,820
go for minutes and minutes and minutes at a time, debating

98
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,900
different positions, different ideas. And a lot of times we talk

99
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,580
to ourselves, you are talking through some idea, hearing your

100
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,340
own counterpoints to that idea. And it's as if there is a

101
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,140
dialogue of multiple competing interests within us. It says if

102
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,260
we have many different personalities, drives, views,

103
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,180
ways of conceptualizing the world around us, and they're not

104
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,860
necessarily compatible. And we're faced with a lot of

105
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:02,180
conflict, inner conflict as we navigate new situations. What

106
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,940
should we do here? What should we do there? Do we view this as

107
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,180
you know, viewpoint A or viewpoint B? And there's a

108
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:16,260
rich dialogue occurring internally. Another implication is

109
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,900
that we often kind of have this idea that we're creating our

110
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,500
thoughts. I thought this thought, this is my thought, we

111
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,580
claim ownership over our thinking. You are building and

112
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,940
constructing ideas. And once you have an idea, you proudly, you

113
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,900
know, tell the world, ah, look at my idea, I've created this

114
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,020
wonderful new product of my mind. And this is my product.

115
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,900
However, there are many examples, if we're kind of honest

116
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,700
with ourselves, where we just have an idea, and it seems to

117
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,660
spring out of nowhere. There's no experience of creating the

118
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,820
idea. It's like an epiphany moment, an idea is thrown into

119
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,860
your mind. Could this be some sort of nested substructure,

120
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,140
some cognitive system within you, that created and constructed

121
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,340
and did a lot of the hard work, and then just presented you

122
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:18,020
with an idea at the apex level. You still claim ownership over

123
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,020
that idea. However, you weren't really a part of the creation

124
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:28,220
process per se. Even more extreme, there are intrusive

125
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,740
thoughts. Sometimes we have a thought and we say, Oh, I did

126
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,500
not think that thought that was not me, my brain just generated

127
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,260
this thought and I am not responsible for that thought

128
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,500
whatsoever. This idea, this thought just occurred. But that,

129
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,340
you know, that's not me. I delete that I will willingly

130
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,300
suppress and remove that thought from my mind. And I also

131
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,140
reject ownership. I am not an owner of this thought. It was

132
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,660
something my brain generated. So this is also a very common

133
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,220
place example that, you know, if you introspect, you'll you'll

134
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,380
have many moments where you might not want to claim

135
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,020
responsibility over your own thinking. And we also have this

136
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,660
idea that we are in control of our bodies. You know, I choose

137
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,340
to move around and I'm making this hand gesture with my hands.

138
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,860
This is me controlling my body. However, I'm not really aware of

139
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,340
what my hands are actually doing. I am initiating a cartoon

140
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,380
version of what I want to happen. And then a very complex

141
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,700
intricate muscle activation pattern then arises. And so I am,

142
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,060
you know, in control of that to some degree. But I really don't

143
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,740
understand any of the details of what my body is actually doing.

144
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,500
And so on some level, you know, you're in control, but you're

145
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,500
not as in control as you might think that you are. And if you

146
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,580
really pay attention to what your body is doing, you will

147
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,860
sometimes find these sort of automated or seemingly unconscious

148
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,780
movements that your body is performing. And could it be that

149
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,620
there are nested systems within you that are potentially kind

150
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,180
of mediating your connection to the body. And when they act

151
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,220
semi autonomously from your will, when you're, you know, not

152
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,100
paying attention, there's some evidence of cognition or some

153
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,260
sort of will or form in your body's movements, even if you're

154
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,020
not fully consciously aware of what is occurring. So at the

155
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,340
core of hierarchical consciousness is the idea that

156
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,140
yes, you are a cognitive system. Yes, you are thinking. But

157
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,100
within you are thinking cognitive systems. And they are

158
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,980
providing you with this information with these

159
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,180
cognitive streams. And you are supervising a bit of a

160
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,900
corporation of subsystems within you. And this gives a very

161
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,340
rich landscape to our internal experience. There are so many

162
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,820
cognitive structures inside of you. And they all are acting in

163
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,500
these very complex nuanced ways. And this sort of increases the

164
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,180
richness, the variety of our inner life. And it gives a way of

165
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:30,180
kind of understanding biology from a from a new lens. So now I'm

166
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,860
going to dive into that kind of biological motivation. Alright,

167
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,780
so where did this hierarchical consciousness idea come from? On

168
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,860
some level, it came from introspection. But in another way,

169
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,180
there is a really strong motivation for hierarchical

170
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,260
consciousness that arises from our observations in biology and in

171
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:01,380
neuroscience. Okay, so if we ask the question, where in the

172
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,860
brain should we study consciousness, right? There are

173
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,940
many different people that are neuroscientists. And yet they

174
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,300
use very different tools, different systems that they're

175
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:18,940
studying. And so, you know, we might make this kind of pitch

176
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:27,220
of reductionism. Every system is reducible to a subsystem. Okay,

177
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,860
a brain region is made out of neurons. A neuron is made out of

178
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,820
synapses. Synapses are made out of proteins and proteins are made

179
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,500
out of atoms and atoms are made out of quarks and the forces of

180
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,940
particle physics. And so to understand a brain region, you

181
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,900
shouldn't study the brain region. It's actually just

182
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,700
neurons. You need to go study neurons. But you know, you

183
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,180
can't really study neurons because they're just too big. And

184
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,580
you know, they're not really real. Neurons are really just a

185
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,420
bunch of synapses and electrical potentials. But to

186
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,580
understand the electric potentials, you got to go study

187
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,620
the synapses. But you know, synapses are really not real

188
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,780
either. They're just made out of different proteins, different

189
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,860
receptors. And the synapse really just emerges from the mass

190
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,140
action of many, many protein receptors. So forget about the

191
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,180
synapse, we got to go study proteins. And then proteins are

192
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,500
really just emerging phenomenon of all these amino acids. And

193
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,180
those are really constrained by these, you know, more atomic

194
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:38,260
style chemical forces of organic chemistry. And then, you know,

195
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,980
it's an infinite reduction, maybe down until you hit

196
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,940
mathematics, or something like that. But then, oh, you know,

197
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,580
math is just a construct of humans and human society. So

198
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,380
really, there's this strong reductionist bias. And I would

199
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,940
make the argument that this is sort of a naive thought to say

200
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,780
that, you know, to study something, we have to go study

201
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,460
the parts. Because eventually, we're all just particle

202
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,580
physicists. And we're all going to our nearest, you know,

203
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,140
particle accelerator. And no one is doing neuroscience, right?

204
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,500
Then it's completely inappropriate to study the

205
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,740
brain at all, because we should all just be particle

206
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,300
physicists, right? So if you take reductionism to the ultimate

207
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,300
extreme, it gets a little ridiculous. So right now, the

208
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:33,340
status quo is that to study consciousness, you have to study

209
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,220
neurons. And in a weird way, this is like a an assumption that

210
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,780
people don't even admit that they have, right, there is a

211
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:47,020
strong bias to say the brain is neurons. And you have to study

212
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,020
neurons, right? But for the same reasons I just laid out with

213
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:57,100
reductionism. Why study neurons? Why not study synapses and

214
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,340
proteins? What is it that makes the neuron special? Well, you

215
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,180
could say, Well, the neuron has the capacity for action

216
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,700
potentials for these meaningful electrical potentials. It's that

217
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,340
electrical property, which is so meaningful. However, there are

218
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,300
very profound electrical properties at the level of

219
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,220
functional brain regions of entire brain nuclei. Why in the

220
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,300
world would you not be allowed to study brain nuclei? Why is it

221
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,820
inappropriate to study brain nuclei? And yet it is completely

222
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,020
appropriate to study neurons themselves, right? So moving in

223
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,340
either direction, you can construct some rationality for

224
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:45,100
that movement. However, all theories out there, you know, in

225
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,260
status quo, typical neuroscience of consciousness are these kind of

226
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,740
toy cartoon neurons. And so hierarchical consciousness is

227
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,620
really making the pitch, you know, what if all of these levels

228
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,700
were meaningfully contributing to conscious experience to the

229
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,860
information processing of the brain? You can study brain nuclei,

230
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,020
and you can study neurons, and you can study proteins. And more

231
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,460
so, what if there was some system that actually allowed for

232
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,660
information transfer between all these different levels? If you

233
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,020
could transfer information across these levels, then perhaps

234
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,420
there is genuine information processing happening at these

235
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,140
different scales. And it might be different information that is

236
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,380
being processed, right? As you move from these orders of

237
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:47,340
magnitude of difference, there could be unique channels of

238
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,140
information being processed at these different scales, and then

239
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,540
some sort of meaningful exchange across levels. And so I

240
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,300
think there's a pretty good motivation to say that this is

241
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:04,740
happening in the brain. And then the follow up question would

242
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,700
be, what does this mean for consciousness? What if there's a

243
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,620
hierarchical biological system at play? How do we shove

244
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,500
consciousness or how do we make sense of consciousness within

245
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,300
that system? Could it be that there was some sort of

246
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:26,180
cognition, esch processing occurring at all these different

247
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,060
levels? And maybe there is even consciousness at multiple

248
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:35,220
levels within the brain. Alright, so to kind of motivate a

249
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,740
little bit of this theory of the evidence for it, I'm going to

250
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,100
pivot a little bit to say, you know, what is the evidence that

251
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,900
these large scale brain nuclei are real? Because in a strange

252
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,660
way, or maybe it's not so strange, it might align with

253
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,700
like just human bias of where the status quo is at. We are much

254
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:06,300
more hesitant as a field to say that brain nuclei functional

255
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:13,300
brain regions are real. Those get the label of epiphenomenal much

256
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,740
more often than a neuron. There are very few people walking

257
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,780
around saying neurons aren't real, they're just epiphenomenal.

258
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,100
However, there's many people walking around saying functional

259
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,060
brain regions aren't real, they just, you know, are kind of a

260
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:31,380
circle we draw around the brain in one way or another. But

261
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,260
really, we should all be studying neurons. So I like to give

262
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,580
the example of a train. So if we were to imagine the brain as an

263
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,740
engine as a train, what is it that pushes the brain train

264
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:52,540
forward through time? What is the engine of the system? And status

265
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,260
quo would say that the engine is neurons, there's a bunch of

266
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,900
neurons, and they have electrical potentials, the

267
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,980
spiking activities that are occurring, they release chemicals

268
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,780
from one onto another, and then they react and activate based on

269
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:15,180
this chemical signaling. However, if you put a recording device

270
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,380
inside of the brain, you observe these large electrical

271
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:26,220
fluctuations at the scale of entire populations of neurons.

272
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,340
And what we used to think as a field is that these electrical

273
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,180
fluctuations were just kind of the steam off of the brain

274
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:41,020
train. These are epiphenomenal. They're not real signals. Well,

275
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,820
there's signals in the sense that you can measure them, but

276
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,060
they're not really doing anything, right? It's not

277
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,540
contributing to the function of the brain. However, we now

278
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,500
realize after some experimental work and after some theoretical

279
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,300
work, that there might be a bit of a circular causation here

280
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,580
where even if these electric fields at the scale of hundreds

281
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,140
of thousands to millions of neurons, even if that's

282
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:16,460
generated from the activity of smaller, you know, neurons

283
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,780
themselves, and the mass collective action of these

284
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,020
neurons, once the electric field has been generated, once it

285
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:29,700
exists, it then exists independently of the individual

286
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,780
neurons, and that electric field can then change and constrain

287
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,540
the activity of neurons. And there's a little bit of a

288
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,580
circular causation here. Neurons can cause electric fields.

289
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,380
These electric fields can then change neurons. And it's not

290
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,220
saying that one is primary, although maybe you could make

291
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,980
the argument that you wouldn't have the electric field without

292
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:00,180
the neurons. And that is, you know, likely true. However,

293
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,260
they're, you know, they both are contributing meaningful to the

294
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,460
processing of these systems. And there has been a lot of work

295
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:15,820
lately, really diving into what do neural oscillations do for the

296
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,380
brain and for cognition, and we're getting more and more

297
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,540
evidence that they appear to be meaningfully related to

298
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,500
cognition. So what I would make an argument to you, why should

299
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,820
we care about these electric fields about these neural

300
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,940
oscillations? Well, these neural oscillations are really the

301
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,860
closest correlate that we have to cognition. So I'll give you a

302
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:43,580
couple examples here. So one example is the theta oscillation

303
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,980
that you can witness in sound waves. So as I am talking to

304
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,340
you, if you were to record the words coming out of my mouth,

305
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,580
you take that sound wave recording, and you break down

306
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,380
the frequency domain, the frequency components of my

307
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,540
speech, you'll see that there's a lot of rhythmic structure to

308
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:11,820
the way that we talk to each other. And more so, if you zoom

309
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,060
into individual words that I'm saying, there are different

310
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,660
sound chunks in each of my words. And those sound chunks are

311
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,900
coming at a very rhythmic rate across all different cultures

312
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:31,740
that we've measured. People tend to speak at a very canonical

313
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,980
rate. And there's a prominent theta frequency oscillation

314
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,820
roughly between four and eight hertz across all these different

315
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,420
languages that we can record from. And that rhythm is a very

316
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,300
prominent rhythm in the sound waves. And we can find that

317
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,180
rhythm from the sound waves in the electrical activity of the

318
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,780
brain. And if we look at auditory cortex, for example, as I'm

319
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,920
talking to you, your auditory cortex is rhythmically

320
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:07,900
fluctuating in sync to the words that I am saying. So this is a

321
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:13,180
really profound electrical property within the brain. And

322
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,340
it really closely correlates to the type of information that is

323
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,140
being processed in the world around us. And is it a

324
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,700
coincidence that we all speak at a certain rhythm? And this

325
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,900
rhythm is found all throughout the brain with various protein

326
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,540
constituents that give rise to this rhythm. There's a really

327
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,660
tight correspondence in frequency domain between our

328
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,260
behaviors and the electrical properties of our brains

329
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,420
themselves, which might suggest that, you know, our brains are

330
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,020
helping us produce language. There's some electrical

331
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,540
determinants, some biological brain determinants for our

332
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,660
speech. And then, you know, we're tuned into these rhythms in

333
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,300
our environment. Another example comes from the visual

334
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,360
cortex. So in the back of your brain, there is a electrical

335
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,380
rhythm called the alpha oscillation. This is occurring

336
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,540
roughly around 10 times per second, 10 hertz. And if you

337
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,620
measure visual cortex, you'll find this big prominent

338
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,300
electrical wave traveling through your visual cortex. And

339
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,660
what people have found in one example experiment is that if

340
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,900
you flash a light really quickly, there's a certain rate at

341
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,140
which if I flash the light really quickly, you will

342
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,820
perceive it as a single flash, versus if it's a little bit

343
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,260
slower, you perceive it as two separate flashes. And there's a

344
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,460
certain time point at which it crosses over from being

345
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:51,820
two flashes into getting fused into a single flash. And this

346
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,300
is the flicker into fusion rate. And this is roughly around

347
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:02,060
100 milliseconds in the average individual. And what people

348
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,300
have found is that the rate at which your visual cortex is

349
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,420
fluctuating is correlated with your flicker fusion rate. So the

350
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:18,060
time at which you shift from a flicker into a fusion is related

351
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,500
to the ongoing electrical fluctuations in your visual

352
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,220
cortex. So what this means is there's basically a one to one

353
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,980
correspondence between visual awareness, refreshes, and the

354
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,700
electrical activity in your brain. If the flashes show up in

355
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,460
different refreshes, then you have the experience of two

356
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,540
separate flashes. But if both flashes end up in one electrical

357
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,780
fluctuation in your visual cortex, then you just have the

358
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:52,900
experience of a single flash fused together. So this is quite

359
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,620
wild, right? I mean, this is basically saying that your visual

360
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,540
awareness, the perception that you're having right now of

361
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,660
visual information is actually flickering and updating. And we're

362
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,380
maybe not aware of this update in our experience. And you know,

363
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,620
I would argue that maybe it's because you're a little bit

364
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:18,540
slower up at the apex, but more on that a little bit later. And

365
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:24,060
this is directly related to the cognitive processing within your

366
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,620
system, right? So to be reductive and say, Well, who cares

367
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,100
about these electric field fluctuations, we got to dive into

368
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,100
the neurons because the neurons are all that matters. Well, we

369
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,860
have a very strong tight correlation between the electric

370
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:44,940
fields in this large brain structure and your experience. So

371
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:50,140
what evidence can we make that there is a strong correspondence

372
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,260
more so than just correlation, right? Because just because we

373
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,180
can measure something and just because something is correlated

374
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,100
doesn't mean that it's really or causally related to the thing

375
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,500
itself. So electrical activity happens, cognition happens as

376
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,340
well, these two phenomenon or correlated to each other. And so

377
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:17,100
the way that we can test this in the laboratory, and my lab

378
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:21,660
does, you know, exactly this, we will deliver what's called

379
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,020
noninvasive brain stimulation, and we can do this in humans,

380
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,620
where we can deliver a brief magnetic pulse to the brain. And

381
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,340
that causes a brief electric current to arise within a part

382
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,740
of cortex. And if we apply these brief pulses at a certain

383
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:48,140
spacing, right, then what we find is that we can very

384
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,380
selectively drive these electric field fluctuations in the

385
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,900
brain, where the repeated application of multiple pulses

386
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,220
will start to build up and ramp up an electric field

387
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:06,180
fluctuation. So here I'm including a image of you know,

388
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,260
some data that was recently published from my group, where

389
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,100
we essentially show just this that if you're delivering brief

390
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,380
magnetic pulses to the brain, and you're recording the electrical

391
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,980
activity in the brain region that you're targeting, you can see

392
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:24,620
a ramp up in these electric fields. And what's really

393
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,500
interesting is then we can actually change and shift

394
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,420
cognition as a function of just the frequency that we're

395
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,580
targeting in the brain. And you know, in my day job, I'm a

396
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,100
cognitive neuroscientist and a lot of my work is delivering

397
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,220
frequency specific brain stimulation in human participants

398
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,380
in order to alter or change their cognition. And the idea is

399
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,660
that this is a way of building causal evidence for these

400
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,020
macroscopic electric fields in the brain. It's not just

401
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,220
reducible to neurons, but by changing these electric fields,

402
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,580
we change cognition. So this is building much stronger evidence

403
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,820
that these electric fields are directly related to the cognitive

404
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,580
processing within the brain. So my work and that of others is

405
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,460
really trying to validate this highest level or one of the top

406
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,260
levels within the biological hierarchy, the level of functional

407
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,540
brain regions of electric field fluctuations roughly between 10

408
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,940
Hertz and two Hertz, this low frequency range in the brain

409
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:44,900
really is real. It's doing something for cognition. It is

410
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:50,060
a part of the engine of the brain. It is not just the steam

411
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,860
emanating from the brain, but it is really doing something for

412
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,300
cognition for our experience. And I think what is really

413
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:04,140
exciting about this work is that, you know, we have a very slow

414
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,300
reality, we're thinking our thoughts, we're pondering things,

415
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,820
our thoughts occur at the scale of multiple seconds, we're

416
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,460
perceiving things at the scale of sub seconds, doing analyses

417
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,500
like these and doing experiments like these really

418
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,300
build evidence that that low frequency electrical activity in

419
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,340
the brain is meaningfully related to cognition is meaningfully

420
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,620
related to the processing of the brain. And it one to one

421
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,700
relates to our experience of being a human being inside of

422
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:44,140
our brains. So the next question here is, is there a way to

423
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,900
communicate from one scale to another scale? And this is where

424
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:53,980
the concept of cross frequency coupling comes in. So cross

425
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,460
frequency coupling is saying that there's coupling between two

426
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:03,020
different frequencies across those frequencies. And this was

427
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,820
first observed in rodents with invasive recordings of the

428
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:11,460
hippocampus, which is a part of the brain involved in spatial

429
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:16,860
navigation. And what was found was that there are these big

430
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:21,540
electric field fluctuations in the hippocampus, as rats are

431
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,700
navigating mazes, and simultaneous to those big theta

432
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,780
frequency electric field fluctuations, you also have

433
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:36,940
neurons that are coding for individual locations in space. So

434
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,540
these are called place cells. And so you'll have, for example,

435
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,740
neuron A fires when you're in location A, you have neuron B

436
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,380
that fires when you're in location B, neuron C in location

437
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,780
C, neuron D in location D. And what you find is that in the

438
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:00,180
hippocampus, there is a sequential activation neuron A,

439
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,380
the neuron B, the neuron C, the neuron D, as the rat is sitting

440
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,860
at location A and thinking about the future of their movement

441
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,220
through location A and to B and to C and to D. And there's a

442
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:18,100
sequential activation of these neurons firing. And the sequence

443
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,500
of firing is occurring within a theta rhythm. So it says if the

444
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:30,780
brain is going ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, there's a rhythmic

445
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,300
activation of these place cells being activated through time.

446
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,980
And so this is the first observation of cross frequency

447
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,660
coupling between the scale of neurons and the scale of the

448
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:52,740
hippocampus. And the neurons are inside of the hippocampus. But

449
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:59,100
you can now decode a trajectory of motion, a movement of the

450
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:04,340
animal from the electric field activity on its own. And

451
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,620
granted, you know, all these neurons are coding for

452
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:12,260
information and building and, you know, projecting information

453
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,540
into these electric fields. And then the electric field is

454
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,180
sort of an abstract representation of all that

455
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,220
information at the lower level. So I think what's really

456
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:30,620
interesting here is that you've built a trajectory of motion

457
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:36,820
from locations, right? This is not a more complex location. This

458
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:44,380
is a abstraction away from location into movement. Movement

459
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:50,140
is like a higher concept than a location. And so we have the

460
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:55,180
construction of a higher order abstract concept from lower

461
00:34:55,180 --> 00:35:01,500
order information. And maybe cross frequency coupling, the

462
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,020
co occurrence of fast neuron activity nested within low

463
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,940
frequency electric field activity, and the coupling the

464
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,220
systematic relationship between these levels. This is evidence

465
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,140
of some sort of mechanism, some sort of means of information

466
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:26,300
transfer between nested systems one within the other. This

467
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,660
example that I've shown you is called phase amplitude

468
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:34,100
coupling, where the phase of the theta frequency basically where

469
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,060
you are in a single cycle is related to the amplitude, the

470
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,960
activation of these neurons. And it says if the low frequency

471
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,820
signal is kind of sequencing the higher frequency signal. And

472
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,820
there's been a lot of work since this original rodent work on

473
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,380
the hippocampus finding cross frequency coupling in memory

474
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:02,300
processing, working memory, long term memory, attention,

475
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,860
decision making, there's many, many examples that we've now

476
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,060
observed of these big, low frequency, entire brain regions,

477
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,300
entire networks of brain regions, coupling to more

478
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:19,420
microscopic scales. So the next question is, you know, okay, we

479
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,340
can measure these correlations, but is it quote unquote, real?

480
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,380
Do we have causal evidence for cross frequency coupling? We can

481
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,540
use the same magnetic stimulation approach that I

482
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,980
told you about just previously. But we can also use what's

483
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,500
called transcranial electrical stimulation. And this is

484
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,380
something that my lab also uses actively. And there's been many

485
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,740
people, you know, using this tool. But essentially, you can

486
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,900
deliver electric current to the brain that's designed to mimic

487
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,140
these endogenous coupling patterns that you observe in the

488
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,460
brain. So one example that I'll show for you right now is we

489
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,620
can observe cross frequency coupling between one signal and

490
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,080
another signal, we can extract the peak frequency of that

491
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,220
coupling in a human participant using EEG. And then we

492
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:18,060
can derive a electrical stimulation waveform based on

493
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,780
our observation in EEG, and then deliver electrical

494
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:28,820
stimulation back into the brain to then change and enhance the

495
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,660
endogenous cross frequency coupling, and then change

496
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,940
people's cognition. So the example I'm showing you here, you

497
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,380
can go check out the papers if you're interested. But this was

498
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,860
a cognitive control tasks where people had to, you know,

499
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,820
memorize a bunch of different rules and use context. And

500
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,140
there was sort of a multi stage decision making process that

501
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,260
they had to engage with. And there were numerous cross

502
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,140
frequency coupling signals emerging from the brain. There

503
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,180
was a perception control signal and action control signal. And

504
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,620
we differentially targeted either the perceptual control

505
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,300
cross frequency coupling signal or that motor control

506
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,940
signal. And we could change behavior in a very systematic

507
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:20,500
way based on what frequency we were targeting, either that

508
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,340
motor control frequency or that perception control frequency.

509
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,740
Alright, so we have causal evidence for cross frequency

510
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,900
coupling for these interactions between many different stages

511
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,260
or scales in the brain. And so the question now is what does

512
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,700
this mean for consciousness? So in the nested observer

513
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:47,220
windows model, at the core of this model, is this idea of a

514
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:52,780
nested hierarchy? And this is directly motivated by cross

515
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,620
frequency coupling. And so the primary question in hierarchical

516
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,860
consciousness is what does it mean if we were to take cross

517
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,980
frequency coupling very, very seriously, right? Cross frequency

518
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:12,380
coupling is not only real, but it is a fundamental property of

519
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,100
what it means to be a conscious being. So what if cross

520
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,660
frequency coupling was very, very, very much real? And what

521
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,740
that would imply is that there is information processing

522
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:30,180
occurring at a slow, big scale, and information processing

523
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,340
happening at a faster, smaller scale, and these systems are

524
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,100
nested within each other. So the metaphor we use to describe

525
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:44,380
this is mosaic tiling. So in mosaic tiling, you have an image

526
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,620
that is made out of mosaic tiles. These are different smaller

527
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:53,180
tiles, and the collage of all these tiles together produces an

528
00:39:53,180 --> 00:40:00,020
image, a mosaic image. And what we suggest is what if there is a

529
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:06,060
recursively nested mosaic tiling, where every image is made

530
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:11,460
out of images, where those images are then mosaic tiles of

531
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,180
even smaller images, and the pattern repeats recursively as

532
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,220
you zoom into an image. So what this means is that your

533
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:28,820
cognitive system, your experience is a collage of all of

534
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,060
these different cognitive systems within you. And all these

535
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,300
cognitive systems are bubbling up into your experience. And

536
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,940
collectively, they form you as this collage of cognition. But

537
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:49,220
if you were to dive into any one of these cognitive threads, you

538
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,900
would find that that is in and of itself, a collage of more

539
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:59,140
microscopic cognitive sub processes, and so on and so forth

540
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,500
as you zoom into smaller and smaller systems. So the nested

541
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:09,500
observer windows model is basically saying that you are an

542
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:15,900
observer window, you are a bounded space of cognition. And

543
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,020
within you are nested sub windows. And within those are more

544
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,300
sub windows. And there's a recursive process of nesting

545
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:30,540
motivated by the observations from modern cognitive neuroscience

546
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,020
for a role of cross frequency coupling in cognition. So the

547
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,260
now model in order to get to the point where we can talk about

548
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,420
these nested systems, we need a couple other metaphors, a couple

549
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,340
other mechanisms to kind of flesh out the model to be

550
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,340
complete. So the first metaphor is mosaic tiling. This is what

551
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:57,100
I already spelled out for you. The next metaphor is a theater.

552
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:04,140
We need a boundary around a cognitive system. And we use the

553
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,060
metaphor of a theater. And we call this an observer window. This

554
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:15,780
is a spatio temporally bounded system. And within it, there is

555
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,220
a holistic gestalt representation. There is sort of a

556
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:26,940
wholeness to what it is like to be an observer window. And

557
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:32,140
there's some boundary around the system that excludes the rest

558
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,780
of reality to say that either you're in the window or you're

559
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:41,100
not. And if you're in the window, you are bound together into a

560
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,180
single observer, a single frame of reference. Now, because there

561
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:53,540
is this nesting structure, what this really needs also to have

562
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,980
is a mechanism for dialogue or communication between observer

563
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:05,540
windows that are within the same scale. So it might be that you

564
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,700
at the apex, you're at the top, you're the the head honcho

565
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,420
observer window. As you zoom in, there's a bunch of cognitive

566
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,780
systems coexisting. But more so those cognitive systems, they

567
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,940
can communicate up to you to the observer window. But they also

568
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,380
need to communicate laterally to each other. And this requires a

569
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,780
different mechanism than just communicating up to the top

570
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,340
observer window or down to a sub observer window. You're

571
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,420
talking to your peers. And this we use the metaphor of

572
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,620
dialogue. And so there are three mechanisms that we propose in

573
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,500
the nested observer windows model. The first mechanism I

574
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,100
already talked to you about this is cross frequency

575
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:54,220
coupling. This is a means of transferring information up and

576
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,660
down the nested hierarchy. You can have a emergence of

577
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,780
information from the lower order into the higher order. You

578
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,940
can also have a submergence of information from you or from a

579
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:12,780
sub window down into the smaller faster windows. And this is a

580
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,500
means of sending control signals down into your sub

581
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:23,620
structures. Now the formation of an observer window, we use a

582
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:28,580
mechanism called synchrony. This is a zero phase lag

583
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,380
connection between all the components of a system. Very

584
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,700
simply put, it means that everything within an observer

585
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:42,300
window is perfectly synchronized. There is a zero lag

586
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,140
synchronization, where all the sub components form the whole

587
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,220
component. And this is something that we kind of

588
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:56,060
intuitively assume is the case. When you call a thing a thing,

589
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,580
you kind of assume that everything in that thing is

590
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,940
synchronized and acting as if it was one thing. Here, we're

591
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:08,900
kind of formalizing that and saying that synchrony is the

592
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,780
foundation for creating one of these observer windows. This is

593
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,860
very similar to wolf singers, binding by synchronization, the

594
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,820
idea that you can create a gestalt representation, a single

595
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:26,260
meaningful construct through synchrony, through

596
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,900
synchronization. So we're really just building off of and

597
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:35,660
using wolf singers mechanism here. And then finally, we have

598
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:40,620
coherence. Coherence is the mechanism for dialogue or

599
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,300
communication. This is very much akin to Pascal freezes,

600
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,580
neuronal communication through neuronal coherence. The idea is

601
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,700
that two systems that are fluctuating will will communicate

602
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,900
to each other. This isn't that they're so synchronized that

603
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,620
they fuse and become one thing. But there is a non zero phase

604
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,540
lag between the two systems, where one is kind of talking

605
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:09,820
while the other listens and vice versa, they're coordinating

606
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:14,100
their processing through time, their dynamics. But they are not

607
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:18,380
fully synchronizing and fusing into into one another. So we

608
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,940
updated communication through coherence to use the word

609
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,060
dialogue through coherence. It really is the same as Pascal

610
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,920
freezes method or his mechanism. However, we think dialogue

611
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,900
kind of preserves a little bit more of the autonomy of the

612
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,700
individuals, instead of viewing these as like switchboards in a

613
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,100
in a circuit diagram. Instead, they're kind of autonomous

614
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,340
beings or autonomous cognitive systems that are like talking to

615
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:50,620
each other, rather than fusing with some sort of direct wire

616
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,500
connection. All right, an important caveat slash question

617
00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:01,060
here is, you know, we propose synchrony, coherence, cross

618
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,900
frequency coupling as the core mechanisms in the now model.

619
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,380
However, we want to kind of caution that we don't really

620
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,940
think that these mechanisms are sufficient to create

621
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,700
consciousness. We think that these are necessary mechanisms

622
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,300
for communication across scales for the formation of an

623
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,340
observer window for communication between observer

624
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,940
windows. However, just because you have stuff that is

625
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,180
synchronized, we don't think you're spontaneously just gonna

626
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,780
have consciousness anywhere that you have an electric field.

627
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,780
There's probably a little bit more to it than that. If you've

628
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,580
been watching my YouTube channel, then you'll know that I am

629
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,380
very much fascinated and interested in theories of

630
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,220
quantum consciousness, the idea that quantum computers might be

631
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,900
somehow core to the nature of reality and to the nature of

632
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,340
consciousness fundamentally. So I'm kind of holding out that

633
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,380
there are, you know, more mechanisms that we will discover

634
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,300
to be really at the core of what it means to be a conscious

635
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:20,060
being. However, in the meantime, we got to go out there and do

636
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,580
some cognitive neuroscience. And there's a lot of tools and

637
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:27,660
methods we can use from cognitive neuroscience like

638
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,380
non-invasive brain stimulation, like the observations made

639
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:35,140
with EEG or fMRI or invasive recordings, optogenetics, you

640
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,780
know, there's a lot of great tools out there. So we think

641
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:41,540
that, you know, there's a lot of work to be done just by viewing

642
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:46,980
these as necessary signals related to consciousness, even if

643
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,660
they're not sufficient to create consciousness outright in a

644
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:56,220
sort of generative way. But I think it's a really honest

645
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:01,100
portrayal of where the value of the theory is. There's a lot to

646
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,500
be done in this moment right now with the tools that we have.

647
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,900
And there's room in the future to incorporate new ideas that

648
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:14,420
inevitably will be emerging from advancements in technology and

649
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,580
in science. Alright, so let's dive a little bit more into the

650
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:22,700
phenomenology. What is it like to live at the apex of a

651
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:28,260
hierarchical consciousness system? So one way in which it is

652
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,740
like to be the top of this nested observer window hierarchy is

653
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:38,060
that ideas will just pop into your mind fully formed. This is a

654
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,860
pattern of emergence. So what does it mean to receive

655
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,820
information via cross frequency coupling? Maybe it would feel

656
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,500
like a light bulb going off in your head. Bam, there's an idea.

657
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:55,820
There's a fully formed, fully fleshed out concept right there

658
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:00,340
in front of you, right? The emergence process would kind of

659
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:07,020
abstract away the lower levels. You are really only aware of

660
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:12,300
maybe one layer deep into your brain, maybe two layers deep

661
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,140
into your brain. But once you get to three layers deep or even

662
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:21,220
two layers deep, probably it gets a lot more murky to kind of

663
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,300
see the origin of all this information. Another way that

664
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:31,220
it's like to be at the apex is we initiate a very cartoon image

665
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:35,380
of what we want to do. So let's imagine you're playing tennis

666
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,220
and you got to run to the other side of the court, swing your

667
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:43,540
racket. How aware are you of all the muscle activations of all

668
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,860
the groups in your in your hand, in your legs? We are

669
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,980
initiating cartoons in our minds. You know, and I think

670
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,620
cartoons are a very apt way of kind of thinking about apex

671
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:01,020
life. You know, your apex is a cartoon diagram. It exists at a

672
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:07,260
very abstract level. And yet it has access to all the details.

673
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:14,460
So we perceive HD reality, we perceive fast, high detail

674
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:20,340
information, and we generate very complex movements. However, we

675
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,860
experience these at a very abstract level. So one of the

676
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,860
beautiful things about the now model is that you can kind of

677
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,220
have your cake and eat it to in the sense that you are very

678
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:38,420
slow. And yet the data within your mind is very fast. So we get

679
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,180
all of the rich details of all the brain regions, all of the

680
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:47,140
neurons, all the proteins, all that information processing

681
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:51,740
that's bubbling up the hierarchy, you get access to it, you get

682
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,500
all of that information. And it's very fast, except you are

683
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,660
very slow. And there's no contradiction here, right? This

684
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,380
is a way of integrating information across very

685
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,900
different time scales. And you can think and act very slowly.

686
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,260
And yet you can propagate that down into the lower levels.

687
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,540
Another example of what it's like to be at the apex, we have

688
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,140
somewhat limited control over these lower levels. And there's

689
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,940
a few examples that I think really showcase or highlight that

690
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,620
limitation. So one of them is optical illusions. So you know,

691
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:32,420
if you have these undulating checker patterns in some image

692
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,580
that you're looking at, you could have full conscious

693
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:40,140
awareness that the sheet of paper or the the image is not

694
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:46,060
moving. However, there is an incorrigible sense that there is

695
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,180
some movement in the image, even though you know that it's not

696
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:54,540
there. You cannot help but perceive the optical illusion. And

697
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:59,740
this is a nice way of also showcasing the apex. You are not

698
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:04,060
fully in control of the subsystems. Okay, and I think this

699
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:09,020
is one of the real novel predictions of the now model is

700
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:14,580
that you cannot control your body fully. You are, you know,

701
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:20,300
sending commands out. But the body can't fully interpret your

702
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,780
commands. And you're so many levels of abstraction away,

703
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,300
that you can't even fully grasp all the sub processes going on

704
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:33,900
internally. And you are truly an abstraction within the body,

705
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,940
probably still have free will probably still have full control.

706
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,300
But your control is limited to what you are able to know. And

707
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,820
you're only able to know a very high level of detail. Alright,

708
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:51,340
so the apex is fundamentally slow. And I think that this is

709
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:55,540
kind of counterintuitive to what a lot of people imagine. And

710
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:59,380
this was one of the components of the now model, that it even

711
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,740
took us time to accept as we were kind of thinking through the

712
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:09,020
implications of our own theory. And the idea here is that you,

713
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:16,420
the apex are likely operating at the time scale of a second to

714
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:23,340
multiple seconds. Okay. And so what's happening here is you are

715
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:30,900
this fully integrated observer window. And you are observing the

716
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:36,140
information content within yourself. So it says if you are

717
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:41,540
looking down upon your hierarchy at all times, and you're

718
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,780
looking down at these cognitive subsystems and perceiving them,

719
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:50,280
and they're very fast. So you think to yourself, Ah, that's my

720
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,780
thought right there. Oh, that thought is mine too. That thought

721
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,860
is mine too. And you're like looking down on these nested

722
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:00,220
observer windows and identifying them as you and the nested

723
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:06,220
systems are faster than you. You are terrible at seeing

724
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,940
yourself. You only seal the sub windows. And so you mistake the

725
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:17,180
content of your mind for your mind. It is a part of you, it is a

726
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:22,140
part of your mind, but it is not your mind. So we now believe

727
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:28,500
that your mind is integrating over these faster cycles of

728
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:33,660
these nested systems. And here's a couple examples. You climbed

729
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,500
a mountain, you're looking out over the mountain, and your eyes

730
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,700
are darting around picking up information. So your phobia of

731
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,980
your retina, the center of your retina, the center of your

732
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:49,860
eyeball perceives high density color vision. The periphery of

733
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:54,100
your eye only perceives black and white. And it's very low

734
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:59,060
information content. So when you see the mountain, you just

735
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:04,300
hike to the top. Do you perceive little spotlights of your

736
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:09,940
retina as data is being collected? No, your eye darts

737
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:14,420
around at theta frequency, roughly six times per second,

738
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:18,180
your eye is moving around. And it's gathering all these

739
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:23,420
snapshots of the mountain scene. And then it assembles all of

740
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:28,060
that information into a gestalt representation of the mountain

741
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:35,220
scene. And our argument is that your mind is at the scale of

742
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:39,500
the gestalt representation of the full scene. There are

743
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:45,300
multiple processing time points where your eye gathers data

744
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,780
here gathers data there gathers data there gathers data

745
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,260
there and then it packages and integrates all that information.

746
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:55,060
And your experience is, wow, isn't that beautiful? Look at

747
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,700
that mountain scene. But if you zoomed into one of your nested

748
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,020
observer windows, they would only have Oh, there's a mountain.

749
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,780
Oh, there's some trees over there. Oh, there's the beautiful

750
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:10,620
sky over there with some clouds. Each of their snapshots,

751
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:16,660
their gestalt perceptions is the mountain is the trees is the

752
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:22,620
sky. But you are slow. At the scale of one second, you've had

753
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:27,420
six eye movements occur. And now all six of those eye movements,

754
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:32,380
all that data gets packaged into your experience. And you have

755
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:37,380
this wallah, this image of the whole mountain vista. Another

756
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,540
example, as I'm talking to you, I'm sending you all these

757
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:46,220
words. But think about what it's like to listen to words, to

758
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,140
listen to someone talking. You're not really paying attention

759
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:55,060
to my words. You don't actually really care or know all the

760
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:59,580
details of all the sound waves I'm sending. Your experience of

761
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:03,980
my words is, Oh, wow, a sentence. Oh, wow, another

762
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:08,660
sentence. Oh, wow, another sentence. We argue, and we are

763
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,540
like planning an experiment to like formally test this. We

764
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:19,460
argue that you are perceiving sentences fully gestalted

765
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:24,220
together. You're not really paying attention to all the

766
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,660
sound bites. Of course, a nested system is and if you want to

767
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:31,540
call that you go ahead and call that you. But you are most

768
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:37,780
closely this big slow observer window. And you receive the

769
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:42,740
fully packaged information content of a sentence. And if

770
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,620
you introspect on your experience, you can pay

771
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,660
attention to my words if you want to. But most of the time

772
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:52,060
you're not, you're just like, wow, what a cool idea. Oh, that's

773
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:56,260
an idea. Oh, that's an idea. You're perceiving the fully

774
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:02,980
fledged idea construct of the sentence more so than perceiving

775
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:06,780
words sequentially and building up a sentence. Of course,

776
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,660
there's violations of this. There's exceptions to this. It's

777
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,900
a nested interacting system. So there's ways of like diving in

778
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,780
and paying attention to the details. But if you choose not

779
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:23,060
to pay attention to the details, you still receive all the

780
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:27,460
information, right? And that is somewhat counterintuitive and

781
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:31,820
not the typical thinking on how cognition is occurring. Another

782
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:36,100
implication here is that it actually is quite hard to be

783
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:44,420
aware of separate sources of data in your mind. Okay, and we go

784
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,980
into this a little bit in the paper, but I'm going to expand

785
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:52,500
more on it right now. So when you introspect on your

786
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:58,420
experience, you are an integrated whole. And even if

787
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:03,220
there was let's say eight sub observer windows, and maybe you

788
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,900
could name them, you could say, Hey, this is, you know, Justin

789
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,740
one, Justin two, Justin three, Justin four, all these sub

790
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:18,100
processes within yourself. What if it's hard to distinguish who

791
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,700
is giving you this information, right? You are so highly

792
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:27,380
integrated at the top level, that you are terrible at

793
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:31,940
perceiving the individual sources of information that are

794
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,300
becoming integrated into the apex. And this is one of the

795
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:42,260
reasons why it's kind of eluded us that there are multiple

796
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:47,300
sub windows, right? Because it's kind of hard for us to learn

797
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:51,500
about these different sub processes. However, this isn't

798
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,740
to say that it is impossible to learn about these different

799
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:58,620
sub windows inside of you. And so we also make the argument

800
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:03,460
that maybe one reason that meditation is so bizarre and so

801
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:07,740
weird and why we would need to meditate is because if you close

802
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:12,980
your eyes and think about your experience in your mind, it is a

803
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:17,220
chaotic mess inside of your mind of all these different

804
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:22,140
thoughts and feelings and drives and perceptions. Could the

805
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:26,740
complexity of our inner life be because we are a nested

806
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:30,220
observer window system, and all these sub windows all have

807
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,140
different drives and different personalities and different

808
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:36,220
things they're trying to do. And you just naively say, I am

809
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:39,540
me, I'm one person. And yet there's all these different

810
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:43,980
conflicting selves internally. And when you try to introspect

811
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:48,540
on yourself on your experiences, that milieu of

812
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,740
cognitive systems are all being bounded together. And so the

813
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:57,820
observer window nature of yourself makes it even more

814
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:03,060
challenging to then introspect on the various sub components or

815
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:07,740
sub processes that might have a unique origin internally. Alright,

816
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:13,300
so what evidence do we have in the brain that we are modular?

817
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:18,420
And what's kind of wild is that the brain is almost bizarrely

818
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:23,540
over modular and the intuition that you're one person almost

819
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:27,420
doesn't line up with the data of the brain. If you look at the

820
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:31,500
brain, it's got two hemispheres. And these hemispheres, if you

821
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,100
hold the brain in your hand, you can kind of twisted and move

822
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:39,580
the brain. And it's really not touching itself that much. There

823
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:43,620
is a huge chasm running through the center of your brain,

824
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:49,260
separating it into two different halves. What if this is a huge

825
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:54,060
process of the observer window system, where your brain is

826
01:02:54,060 --> 01:03:00,460
intentionally divided, right? The brain wants to create

827
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:05,940
cognitive dissonance. It wants competing narratives of self. And

828
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,740
by creating competing narratives, you encourage a greater

829
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:15,940
diversity of thought internally. And this leads to higher

830
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:21,340
intelligence through simulating more possibilities of what

831
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:25,500
could be out there of how to view and how to act. And this

832
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,180
would be maybe a evolutionarily beneficial thing to

833
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:34,700
create internally is a high, high, high modularity. You have

834
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:38,460
examples like split brain patients, right? If you cut the

835
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,860
brain in half, you cut the corpus callosum. These were

836
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,340
patients that had intractable epilepsy. So they were having a

837
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:49,860
lot of seizures. And so they cut the brain in half to try to

838
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,940
reduce the amount of seizures that these people were having.

839
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:57,060
And there's some really bizarre findings out of these patients.

840
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:02,260
Essentially, that immediately following the surgery, it appears

841
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:06,620
as if the individual now has two different personalities.

842
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,820
There's a lot of these like simple dissociations of

843
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,660
information coming in between different eyes or different

844
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:16,620
visual fields. The hands kind of being controlled by different

845
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:20,220
hemispheres. These are kind of like the simple things you learn

846
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:23,780
about in textbooks about split brain patients. But what you don't

847
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:27,740
learn as much about in standard textbooks is that following the

848
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:31,880
surgery, if you talk to people that work with these patients, it

849
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,980
appears as if there's two very distinct personalities co

850
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:41,600
habitating within the individual. All right. And

851
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,000
there's some pretty wild examples like one that VS

852
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,200
Ramachandran talks about, where people appear to display very

853
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:54,320
different belief systems. One hemisphere believes in God, the

854
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,600
other hemisphere does not. One hemisphere has like a funny sense

855
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,760
of humor. The other hemisphere is quite serious. You know,

856
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,600
there's a lot of internal conflict. And the stories you can

857
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,760
learn from people that work with these patients are quite

858
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,160
wild, right? And I feel like this is somewhat missed the

859
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:19,120
mainstream public discourse in a weird way. Partly, in my

860
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,920
opinion, because this is kind of fundamentally unsettling. In a

861
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,920
weird way, we don't want nested observer windows to be true.

862
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:33,080
Because it's so alien, and it feels so wrong to our naive

863
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:36,520
intuition of being a single individual. There's something

864
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,760
culturally preventing us from taking nested observer windows

865
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:47,040
seriously in a weird way. But is that just some cultural quirk, or

866
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:52,720
some bias that we've kind of grown into? And can you explain

867
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,920
two personalities coexisting within a single individual in

868
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,520
the split brain patients? Kind of bizarre. You also have the

869
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,720
inverse example. For example, Krista and Tatiana Hogan. These

870
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:09,360
are twins that are conjoined at the brain. So there is a

871
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:14,200
connection between the thalamus of these two girls, where

872
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,800
their skulls are fused and their brains are connected. And the

873
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:23,600
two girls are able to communicate telepathically with

874
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,040
each other. They can think thoughts and hear each other's

875
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,640
thoughts. They can allow each other to control each other's

876
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,200
bodies. They get annoyed at each other when they eat foods that

877
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,680
they don't like, right? They can tell each other jokes and have

878
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,880
you know, a fun time internally. And you know, I think this is

879
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,960
really interesting to ask the question, you know, are these two

880
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:52,520
girls one person, or are they two separate people? Probably

881
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,840
they're two separate people. However, it's quite strange that

882
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,800
they can communicate using just their minds. It's almost as if

883
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,520
there's two apex observer windows and a means of

884
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:08,440
communicating between the two apexes. And we might think to

885
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,840
ourselves, wow, this is so alien. This is so bizarre. I have no

886
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:18,960
idea what it would be like to be the Hogan twins. But if the

887
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,360
nested observer windows model is true, then you might actually

888
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,880
know what it's like to be the Hogan twins more than you might

889
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,560
realize. Maybe you're talking to yourself all the time when you

890
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,240
talk to your sub windows. Maybe you haven't had the experience

891
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,920
of having a lateral apex window, communicating between the

892
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:41,640
apexes. However, you have the experience of having sub windows

893
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,280
talking to each other and having internal conflict and

894
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:49,280
dialogue. So maybe it's not as foreign to your experience as

895
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,040
you might expect. I also think there's some really important

896
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:57,440
work occurring in the domain of psychotherapy to really

897
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:03,040
conceptualize the self as a family. So Richard Schwartz

898
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,800
developed what's called the internal family system

899
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:10,480
psychotherapy. He is a person working in the mental health

900
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:16,120
space. And he was working with family therapy. So he would take

901
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,480
a family that wanted to work through some of their issues

902
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:24,280
into his clinic. And he developed a method of having, you

903
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,160
know, different pairs of the family talk to each other work

904
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,480
through their differences. He crafted kind of a canonical

905
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:35,920
archetypal framework that most families appear to fall into.

906
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,920
There's different familial roles that people will take on in the

907
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,560
family. Bizarrely, what he discovered is this family based

908
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:50,440
psychotherapy was highly effective in the individual. So if

909
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:56,680
you took a single person, and you walked them through a family

910
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:02,840
based psychotherapy, you would realize or uncover that it is as

911
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,400
if there are different personalities internally, and

912
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:14,360
these forge the same canonical familial roles that you observe

913
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:20,680
in families. You have a family inside of your head, where

914
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:25,160
there's different personalities competing for space, competing

915
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:31,440
for time. And as you experience psychiatric illness, or cognitive

916
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:36,920
dissonance, it could be that there's some sort of battle debate

917
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:43,160
conflict between these different internal family members. And

918
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,960
this sounds completely bizarre. Maybe it's just a psychotherapy

919
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,720
that works. Hey, take it or leave it. Or it is metaphysically

920
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:56,440
ontologically reality, because there is a nested observer

921
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:01,240
window system inside of you. And if you dive into the observer

922
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:07,040
windows inside of your apex, these are your family members. You

923
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:11,720
have an internal family system of different sub windows with

924
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:15,280
different desires and goals, communicating with each other

925
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:20,720
throughout your entire life. You are a cooperative enterprise of

926
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:26,560
multiple competing, cooperating cognitive systems, feeding into

927
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,280
your experience. And this is the nesting within you that

928
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,000
explains who you are and what you're doing. What if you could

929
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,520
better characterize the different personalities that coexist

930
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:45,320
inside of you? Could you live a healthier, more productive life?

931
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,600
This is the, you know, the pitch of internal family systems.

932
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,240
Also, some really interesting cases, like dissociative

933
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:58,640
identity disorder or multiple personality disorder. So when I

934
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,560
was receiving clinical psychology training back in my postdoc,

935
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,920
I brought this up to some of my mentors, I was like, ooh, what

936
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,560
about multiple personality disorder? How does that, you

937
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:15,000
know, work in psychotherapy and in psychiatric illness? And

938
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,560
they told me, oh, that doesn't exist. That is made up from the

939
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,480
movies. There was a little bit more nuance to it. But essentially

940
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,880
the vibe or the impression was that multiple personality

941
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:32,640
disorder is not real. Okay. However, there's been a lot of

942
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,320
interesting reviews out recently. And I've talked to a couple

943
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:41,400
people who have, you know, loved ones with dissociative identity

944
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,560
disorder or who have worked with these patients or who are these

945
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,400
patients themselves. And I personally am fully convinced that

946
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:54,120
dissociative identity disorder is real. It really happens. But

947
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:58,880
let's wonder, you know, what is it that makes people so

948
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:06,480
resistive to DID being real? I think it's that metaphysically

949
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,880
ontologically, we don't have a way to make sense of this. It's

950
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,720
so bizarre to our intuition that we reject the premise that

951
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,440
this could ever be real. However, the nested observer

952
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,280
Windows model, of course, you know, has a way to account for

953
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,160
this. If the apex window experiences some really strong

954
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:34,320
trauma, then maybe it would dissolve. Maybe it would, you

955
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:40,720
know, loosen its grip slightly. And some of the sub windows

956
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:47,760
would take on a more viscerally real quality, right? The sub

957
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,520
windows are the multiple personality internal family

958
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:59,680
within all of us. And DID is not necessarily a complete

959
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:05,240
pathologicalization of, you know, reality. But there's some

960
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:11,320
truth in every psychiatric illness to our experience. And so

961
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:17,480
DID represents some component of us that maybe freaks us out.

962
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:21,480
Maybe we're not coming to terms with. But if there is this

963
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:26,840
rich internal cognitive nested hierarchical structure, then DID

964
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,720
is not impossible. It has a biological explanation. And

965
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,720
there's elements or components of their experience that

966
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:39,480
resonate and are true within your experience as well. It's not

967
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:44,080
so alien as to be impossible to empathize with or to

968
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,200
understand. So another phenomenon of relevance to the now

969
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:52,360
model, our topos and topomancers or the act of

970
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:57,480
topomancy. And so this is the intentional creation of an

971
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:02,560
imaginary friend. So these are people that actively and

972
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:07,680
willfully create a imaginary friend in their mind. And they

973
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,280
talk to this person, they listen to this person, they hang out

974
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,440
with this person. And this is not unlike the phenomenon of

975
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:20,720
children having very vivid and real imaginary friends in their

976
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:27,120
experience. And so topomancy is the as an adult intentional

977
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:31,880
creation of an imaginary friend. For what purpose? Well, for

978
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:35,880
fun, to deal with loneliness, maybe this is some sort of

979
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,920
coping strategy for your for your life. You know, whatever

980
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:44,520
your motivation for doing this, there's a growing community,

981
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,680
especially on Reddit, that is developing the skills related to

982
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:54,800
topomancy. And I think this is fascinating. In a way, this

983
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,920
lines up very well with the now model. Potentially, topos are

984
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:04,840
the recognition of a sub window internally, and encouraging a

985
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:09,040
sub window to take on its own voice, to take on its own

986
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:13,720
reality, and you encourage independence, separately from the

987
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:17,600
apex, or with a more direct line of communication with the apex.

988
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:21,600
So I think this is a really fascinating phenomenon and is

989
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,960
probably worth studying. So I'm talking with some people,

990
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:29,600
there's a few researchers out there, Tonya Lerman and Michael

991
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,920
Lifschitz, who are really diving into topos and topomancy. So I

992
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,800
think this is a really exciting area to kind of look at maybe

993
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:41,360
validating the now model. Alright, some other examples that

994
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:46,640
might be of relevance. There was some work recently, looking

995
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:52,560
into the octopus, for example, as a sort of exotic organism that

996
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,280
might show more of a hierarchical consciousness system than

997
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:02,240
humans display. So in the octopus, there is some pretty solid

998
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:07,680
evidence as of late, that the tentacles are semi autonomous,

999
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:12,480
they appear able to learn and act and behave somewhat

1000
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:17,320
separately from the full organism. However, they can of

1001
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:21,280
course be wrapped into the goal directed behavior of the full

1002
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,280
octopus. And so this really like kind of in a beautiful way

1003
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,320
exemplifies the now model, where you have semi autonomous

1004
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:35,400
sub windows that are able to nest into the apex upon demand.

1005
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:41,320
And maybe the octopus or other organisms might give us insight

1006
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:46,640
into the human nested observer window framework, because there

1007
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,560
might be different mechanism biological structures at play,

1008
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:56,680
which tweak and change the expression of the biological

1009
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:00,640
hierarchy. Maybe there's less cross frequency coupling, maybe

1010
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,800
there's more autonomy at a lower level. And that would give

1011
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:09,160
rise to a shift in what it is like to be this organism. But it

1012
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:13,920
could be compared and contrasted with the human physiology. And

1013
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:17,480
I think that is just a really fascinating new line of work to

1014
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:21,680
dive into. Another philosopher neuroscientist, biologist on

1015
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:25,920
this same kind of thought pattern is Michael Levin. Michael

1016
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,600
Levin in his group have been doing some really great work

1017
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,600
thinking about hierarchical information processing. And he

1018
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:36,240
has these really bizarre xenobots, which are clumps of

1019
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:41,400
cells that appear to form holistic organisms. And this is

1020
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:45,360
super bizarre, right? There is no biological infrastructure to

1021
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:51,440
make a xenobot. But it appears as if there is a macroscopic

1022
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:56,280
structure that emerges from these clumps of cells. A different

1023
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,400
approach as studying the octopus would be to look at the

1024
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,880
emergence of maybe cross frequency coupling, some sort of

1025
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,360
hierarchical consciousness system in these very simple models,

1026
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,000
which might give us, you know, more novel insight. An important

1027
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,080
question here, or a fun thing to think about is what is the

1028
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:25,200
nature of consciousness in your brain? So the very safe, simple,

1029
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:30,240
kind of naive one is what we call apex hierarchical

1030
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:34,860
consciousness. This is the idea that you exist at the apex of

1031
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:39,420
the hierarchy. And you are the only one that's conscious in your

1032
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:44,880
brain. It's just you don't worry about those nested subsystems.

1033
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:49,520
They are processing your cognition. But you're the only one

1034
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,500
who's home. You're the only one that's conscious in your body.

1035
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,900
Alternatively, there is a emergent hierarchical

1036
01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:01,940
consciousness, some threshold, where above this line, all of

1037
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:05,980
these observer windows are conscious beings, your nested

1038
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:09,440
observer windows are conscious, they have independent

1039
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,580
experience from you, not fully independent, right? Because

1040
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:15,980
there's some interaction, but they are conscious in and of

1041
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:20,220
themselves. And then finally, there's some sort of panpsychic

1042
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:24,140
hierarchical consciousness possibility, where every observer

1043
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:29,340
window is a conscious being, period, full stop. However, you

1044
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:32,780
know, the observer window requires synchrony. So there's

1045
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:36,860
some threshold, some mechanism that needs to be at play to

1046
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:40,140
create an observer window to create a conscious being. So

1047
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,540
it's not that it like spontaneously consciousness can

1048
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:46,820
just be everywhere. But you know, this still kind of holds some

1049
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:50,100
sort of boundaries, some sort of condition for consciousness to

1050
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:54,720
to be present. Alright, so I just want to end with a reference

1051
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:59,360
to Daniel Dennett, who sadly recently passed away. He had

1052
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,760
this idea called the Cartesian theater. And it's the idea that

1053
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,800
you know, your naive sense of consciousness is that there is a

1054
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,440
little little man in your head that's perceiving everything,

1055
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,880
hearing everything, smelling everything, pulling the levers

1056
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,880
moving the body around, he points out the confusion in this

1057
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,880
that okay, if there is a little conscious being inside of your

1058
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:26,840
body, wouldn't there need to be a smaller little conscious being

1059
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:30,000
inside of that person's body? And then wouldn't there be an

1060
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,200
even smaller conscious being inside of that person's body? And

1061
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:37,080
there's an infinite regression of smaller and smaller people

1062
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:41,080
inside of your mind. And so this is completely preposterous when

1063
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:44,800
you need to do away with this simple notion of a theater of

1064
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,040
experience. And he called this the homunculus problem, the

1065
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,760
problem of having nested infinite consciousnesses. Well, the now

1066
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,440
model right is very at odds with this. And so we you know,

1067
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:02,800
think what if this is a homunculus solution? What if

1068
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,920
there is a Cartesian multiplex? Instead of it having a

1069
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,320
Cartesian single theater, there's only one show that's

1070
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:15,600
playing. What if there are many shows, a multiplex or a

1071
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:20,360
synaplex, a, a theatrical establishment with many movies

1072
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:24,440
going on inside of your brain, the nested observer windows model

1073
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:29,920
says there are many experiences internally. And you maybe are a

1074
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,640
bit of a moviegoer popping between the many diverse

1075
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:38,000
experiences happening inside of you. And there is maybe this

1076
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:44,760
near infinite fractal of smaller beings nested inside of you. And

1077
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,840
in that sense, it really would be turtles all the way down. Maybe

1078
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:52,560
there's some floor, maybe it keeps going. And I think an

1079
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,760
important question is, you know, could there be something bigger

1080
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,520
than us, something larger than us going in the other direction?

1081
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,040
Is there an observer window greater than the individual? And

1082
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,800
at one point, I will have a couple episodes probably on the

1083
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,640
concept of collective consciousness. Is there any

1084
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:17,400
substance to the idea of a shared or collective experience? So

1085
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:23,560
with that, wrapping up with the now model, check out the paper

1086
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:26,520
for yourself. I think it's a really cool, exciting new

1087
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:30,360
theory. Obviously, I do because I've, you know, poured a lot of

1088
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,280
time and energy into this. I'm also want to, you know, point

1089
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,720
out Jonathan Schueler is really a core contributor to these

1090
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:40,480
ideas and to this model. And we're now looking at different

1091
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,000
ways to test these theories in people with dissociative identity

1092
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,040
disorder in people with tulpas in split brain patients, looking

1093
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:52,480
at these low frequency integrations that are occurring

1094
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:57,360
within your experience. So a lot of new research on the horizon.

1095
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,520
And I will talk to you again very soon. Goodbye.
