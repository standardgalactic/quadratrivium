Checking SmartlyIO Engineering/A Flock of Functions： Lambda Calculus and Combinatory Logic in JavaScript ｜ Gabriel Lebec @ DevTalks.txt
1. **Lambda Calculus**: It's a formal system for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application without recursion or computation using named functions. Instead, it uses combinators like `I`, `K`, `S`, and `B` to perform computations.

2. **Combinatory Logic**: This is an older approach that relies on a finite set of combinators to express all possible functions. It requires pre-defining these named functions.

3. **Y Combinator**: A higher-order function that can simulate recursion in lambda calculus. It allows the definition of recursive functions without directly using recursion or iteration.

4. **Turing Completeness**: A system is Turing complete if it can simulate any algorithm, which includes the ability to perform recursion and conditional branching. Lambda calculus with the Y combinator is Turing complete.

5. **Functional Programming Languages**: Modern functional programming languages like Haskell, PureScript, Agda, and Elm are built on or closely related to lambda-calculi, specifically with types (e.g., System F). The runtime of these languages includes a lambda-calculus interpreter that executes the code written by programmers.

6. **Practical Utility**: While knowing lambda calculus may not be a requirement for everyday programming tasks, it provides deep insights into the nature of computation and function application, which can be beneficial for understanding and working with functional programming languages.

7. **Art for Art's Sake**: The speaker finds lambda calculus fascinating not just for its utility but also as an intellectual pursuit that is enjoyable in its own right.

8. **Y Combinator Example**: The Y combinator allows the definition of recursive functions without explicitly using recursion. For example, the fixed-point combinator `Y f = (f (lambda x. x)) (lambda x. f (x x))` can be used to define recursive functions in lambda calculus.

9. **Resources**: The presentation included additional slides and resources for those interested in exploring lambda calculus further, including the concept of the Y combinator and other related topics.
