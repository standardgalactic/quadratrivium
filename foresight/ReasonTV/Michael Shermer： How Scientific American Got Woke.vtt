00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
The second wave feminists I've talked to, they're very worried about the kind of woke

00:06.000 --> 00:10.960
gender identity movement because it's reducing women to just body parts.

00:10.960 --> 00:14.480
Like a guy can say, well, if I just get breast implants and I can have a

00:14.480 --> 00:19.200
vaginoplasty made out of a piece of my skin, and I'm in, I'm the woman, right?

00:19.200 --> 00:23.520
It's like, well, no, because women are not just, it's an ass, right?

00:23.520 --> 00:24.960
I mean, there's more to it than that.

00:24.960 --> 00:28.880
For decades, Michael Shermer has been one of the most popular and provocative

00:28.880 --> 00:33.920
explicators of science to popular audiences, having authored bestselling books such as

00:33.920 --> 00:39.840
Why People Believed Weird Things, Why Darwin Matters, The Moral Ark, and The Mind of the Market.

00:39.840 --> 00:45.360
He founded Skeptic Magazine in 1992, hosts a video podcast with leading activists and

00:45.360 --> 00:51.200
intellectuals, and for nearly 20 years authored a widely read column for Scientific American in

00:51.200 --> 00:56.240
which he debunked beliefs in UFOs and other paranormal phenomena, explained the rise of

00:56.320 --> 01:01.920
the new atheism, and showed how evolution systematically informs human behavior.

01:01.920 --> 01:07.200
Shermer's work is deeply and explicitly rooted in libertarian and enlightenment ideas

01:07.200 --> 01:11.360
about individual responsibility, free market economics, rationality,

01:11.360 --> 01:14.800
and the search for something approaching objective truth.

01:14.800 --> 01:21.280
In 2019, Scientific American cut him loose, a move he ascribes to the publication suffocating

01:21.280 --> 01:27.200
embrace of the sort of identity politics and wokeness that he says dominates academic circles

01:27.200 --> 01:30.240
and increasingly the culture at large.

01:30.240 --> 01:36.320
Les Falle Shermer, who holds a PhD in the history of science and teaches Skepticism 101 at Chapman

01:36.320 --> 01:41.600
University, started a weekly sub-stack where he hosts podcasts and the columns he would have written

01:41.600 --> 01:47.360
for Scientific American. The 67-year-old former competitive cyclist talked with Reason during

01:47.360 --> 01:52.560
Freedom Fest in annual gathering in Las Vegas about the fundamental clash between wokeness

01:52.560 --> 01:57.920
and scientific inquiry, how hard it is to overcome the cognitive biases we all have,

01:57.920 --> 02:03.360
why he thinks trans athletes should be banned from most women's sports, why we have so much

02:03.360 --> 02:08.640
trouble acknowledging moral and technological progress, and why he now identifies as a classical

02:08.640 --> 02:10.960
liberal rather than as a libertarian.

02:11.600 --> 02:17.120
Michael Shermer, thanks for talking to Reason.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.080
Nice to see you again.

02:19.120 --> 02:24.480
So you last year, last fall, you started a sub-stack publication to go along with Skeptic

02:25.360 --> 02:31.520
Magazine and whatnot, and one of the early pieces was titled Scientific American Goes Woke,

02:31.520 --> 02:39.120
and you were a longtime columnist for Scientific American, a very popular science communicator.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.160
Describe what you wrote about in Scientific American Goes Woke and why you started a sub-stack.

02:46.720 --> 02:53.840
Right. So I started Scientific American 2001, and I went almost 18 years, 214 consecutive monthly

02:53.840 --> 02:57.920
columns. I was going for Steve Gold's 300 that he did in Natural History Magazine,

02:58.640 --> 03:03.600
which would have taken me to April 2025, so I didn't quite make that. They terminated the column.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.920
There was no particular reason given other than, well, we're going different ways,

03:07.920 --> 03:13.600
and it's time for a change. They didn't say, hey, we've gone woke, and you're an old non-woke

03:13.600 --> 03:18.400
guy. But I could kind of see the writing in the wall. Last couple of columns I had written

03:19.200 --> 03:26.080
were dealing with some issues kind of related to race and sex and gender and that sort of thing,

03:26.080 --> 03:33.920
and I could feel the uncomfortableness in the editorial process, and then boom, they let it go.

03:33.920 --> 03:38.800
So I mean, I don't know for sure, but that was it. So I started the sub-stack just because

03:39.440 --> 03:45.120
I still had more writing in me. I like writing the columns, but this gives me a little more

03:45.120 --> 03:51.760
flexibility if I want to go more than 700 words, like nope, more. And also the new media, I try

03:51.760 --> 03:58.320
to keep up with, I have a podcast and what all the kids are doing these days. It's hard to know

03:58.320 --> 04:03.040
what's the right path to take, but it seemed like the sub-stack thing was a way to go. The finances

04:03.040 --> 04:09.280
for it are channeled through the skeptic society, which is kind of my day job. So the first one,

04:09.280 --> 04:16.480
Scientific American Goes Woke, I recounted my own experiences, but also I went through a bunch of

04:16.480 --> 04:22.240
articles they had published recently that were clearly what most people would identify as sort of

04:22.240 --> 04:31.440
far-left, woke progressive politics. And one of the most notorious or discussed pieces had to do

04:31.440 --> 04:37.440
with E.O. Wilson being a racist, right? Being a scientific racist. He's the, he wrote the book

04:37.440 --> 04:45.440
Sociobiology. He, you know, in a lot of ways, you know, his vision of taking evolution and seriously

04:45.440 --> 04:50.720
applying it or trying to apply to human society and whatnot had always been a fraught project,

04:50.720 --> 04:55.520
right? I mean, he was getting pictures of Waterport over him in the 70s at conferences.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.960
Yeah. But that, could you talk a little bit about that?

04:58.960 --> 04:59.360
Yeah, that was one of them.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.440
Because then you wrote about that.

05:01.440 --> 05:07.120
Yeah, in fact, they published this right after he died. So, you know, the body's not even cold

05:07.120 --> 05:12.960
yet. And already he's being accused of being a, you know, kind of race realist, race science,

05:13.520 --> 05:19.040
racist, implied racist, that kind of thing, even though he's not. So one of my other sub-stacks

05:19.040 --> 05:24.080
was a long piece, kind of dissecting the claims against Wilson show that they're absolutely

05:24.080 --> 05:28.080
false. But the worst thing about the Scientific American piece on him was that they provided

05:28.080 --> 05:32.240
no evidence at all, no quotes from him, you know, saying something about the race,

05:32.880 --> 05:38.080
racial differences in IQ, nothing like that. And in fact, there's tons of quotes from him

05:38.080 --> 05:45.280
that I included in my piece where he's like, this can absolutely not be considered evidence of

05:45.280 --> 05:50.800
racial differences between groups. And, you know, and this is no justification for discrimination

05:50.800 --> 05:55.680
of any kind. You know, I, I abhor the, you know, kind of the old race science stuff.

05:55.680 --> 06:00.240
I mean, he made it clear he doesn't go into it. So that was disturbing. They had another one on

06:01.120 --> 06:07.840
how mathematics has gone, has kind of gone racist and bigoted and, I don't know, misogynistic.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.800
And their evidence for this is that there are more male math professors than female

06:12.800 --> 06:18.160
math professors, which is not, I mean, the explanation for that could be that, well,

06:18.160 --> 06:23.040
all these old guys are just race misogynists against women. But there are other hypotheses

06:23.040 --> 06:27.600
and you would think a scientific publication would say, okay, here are the three explanations for

06:27.600 --> 06:33.280
why there is an asymmetry in the number of professors who are male versus female, right?

06:33.280 --> 06:38.240
So you have, well, maybe they're just a bunch of misogynists, okay, maybe, maybe there's a pipeline

06:38.240 --> 06:44.640
issue, right? That, that, you know, decades ago, young girls went different pathways than young

06:44.640 --> 06:48.880
boys and fewer of them ended up in STEM fields. So that by the time you get to now where they're

06:48.880 --> 06:54.320
being hired, there's just few of them to select for, because every professor I know is uber-liberal

06:54.320 --> 06:59.440
and they're all dying to hire more women in STEM fields. So it's not like behind closed doors,

06:59.440 --> 07:03.200
they're going, hey, you know, I know we said this publicly, but, you know, we just want to hire more

07:03.200 --> 07:09.040
white guys. They're not doing that, right? So, you know, what are some other hypotheses here?

07:09.040 --> 07:13.280
You know, the evolutionary psych one as well, there may be an interest difference that, you know,

07:13.280 --> 07:21.600
men migrate boys, migrate toward toys and things and stuff. Women girls migrate more toward

07:22.560 --> 07:28.640
people. And so that, that kind of sorts out later, decades later into the kind of profession

07:28.640 --> 07:35.760
you prefer to go into. So women tend to migrate more toward, you know, medical degrees and biology

07:35.760 --> 07:41.920
and psychology, social science, men more in the STEM fields. Now, which of those is the right

07:41.920 --> 07:47.200
hypothesis? Let's just set that aside. Why can't a scientific publication even say, here are the

07:47.200 --> 07:52.800
three hypotheses? Let's look at the evidence. Scientific American is either the oldest or

07:52.800 --> 07:57.200
one of the very oldest continuously published magazines in the world, certainly in the US.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.480
You know, and it went through phases in the 19th century where it's like, okay, yeah, it's talking

08:02.480 --> 08:07.760
about scientific racism, other times it's super liberal, etc. What do you think is driving the

08:07.760 --> 08:13.680
publication or, and the broader, I don't know, you know, kind of popular science community towards

08:14.400 --> 08:22.000
wokeism or, you know, a lot of attention to identity politics where that becomes a controlling kind

08:22.000 --> 08:27.040
of idea apart from anything that they're actually discussing. It's definitely new and it's really

08:27.040 --> 08:34.080
just in the last five years. I think it coincides with the general trend in culture in general of

08:34.160 --> 08:40.400
moving more in that direction. As younger people get those jobs and kind of moving up the demographic

08:40.400 --> 08:46.800
scale, they're getting more and more powerful jobs to direct things the way they want. They came of

08:46.800 --> 08:53.120
age, you know, when those subjects were really important. Now, there's not much any one of us

08:53.120 --> 08:58.880
can do like about the George Floyd incident or this thing or that thing that we see on the news

08:58.880 --> 09:05.120
constantly. But I can do something. I can say, well, look, I'm not a police chief. I'm not a

09:05.120 --> 09:11.360
mayor, but I'm an editor. So I can kind of tilt the editorial decisions more toward the kinds of

09:11.360 --> 09:16.560
political directions we want to take the country. And I'm doing my little share. And I think it

09:16.560 --> 09:22.960
makes people feel like I'm doing something, right? Like, again, what can I do about the George Floyd

09:22.960 --> 09:27.600
thing or police violence or whatever? Nothing, but I can go down in March, right? I'm going down

09:27.600 --> 09:32.080
there this afternoon, and I'm going to carry my plan. Makes me feel like I'm doing something because,

09:32.080 --> 09:38.400
you know, humans are very moral or moralistic. We like to moralize about things and express

09:38.400 --> 09:43.840
our outrage. That kind of protest does have effect, right? Yes, it can. Absolutely. You mentioned

09:43.840 --> 09:48.160
earlier on, you know, kind of being of an older vintage. We're of similar vintage. How old are

09:48.160 --> 09:55.120
you? I'm 67. Okay. So is part of this just like, you know, when we call it wokeism, you know, 20

09:55.120 --> 10:01.600
years ago, we would have called it political correctness. I think our parents were, you know,

10:01.600 --> 10:07.200
we disappointed them or we defined ourselves against them is part of the woke conversation.

10:08.080 --> 10:14.720
It's just generational warfare that is to be expected. And if not tolerated, like, you know,

10:14.720 --> 10:18.880
of course, right? I mean, this is a way, you know, and I hate to say it in this

10:19.440 --> 10:24.720
crude a term, but like, so you're a guy, you're, you're an old guy, you've been at on the mass

10:24.720 --> 10:28.800
set of Scientific American for 20 years. And it's like, we, you know, you're not retiring,

10:28.800 --> 10:32.880
you're, you're probably in better health than you were 10 years ago. And it looks like you're

10:32.880 --> 10:38.480
going to live forever. Like, how the fuck do we get rid of you? Right. So yeah, have we become our

10:38.480 --> 10:44.160
parents? There may be a little bit of that just kind of generational shifts. But, but, but that

10:44.160 --> 10:48.000
doesn't really matter. The question is, what's the right thing to do? What's the truth? What,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.440
what's the direction we want to take the country? And what do we really know about

10:52.000 --> 10:56.640
this subject or that subject? Right. So, I mean, if I may, I mean, you have in one of the

10:56.640 --> 11:03.360
sub stack columns, a fantastopies, where you say you're raising that is to figure out what is right,

11:03.360 --> 11:09.520
not to be right. That's a powerful statement. Can you kind of expand on that a little bit? Yes.

11:09.520 --> 11:14.320
Well, because, because I study belief systems for a living, and I'm aware of all the cognitive

11:14.320 --> 11:20.000
biases, I can see them in myself. And so to avoid that, you just have to kind of focus on,

11:20.560 --> 11:24.160
instead of looking for evidence confirmation bias to support what I already believe,

11:24.160 --> 11:28.080
got to look for the counter evidence, you know, what, what are the arguments against the, the

11:28.080 --> 11:33.520
belief cycle, like this issue on abortion, I'm hardcore pro choice, but I purposely solicited

11:33.520 --> 11:39.280
a pro life argument and said, please give me like the 10 best arguments you have. I want to hear them,

11:39.280 --> 11:42.320
right? Because I don't really know what they are, because I don't pay attention to that closely,

11:42.320 --> 11:49.200
right? So we ended up doing that you have to do in general. And is, are you, is wokeism for lack of

11:49.200 --> 11:55.040
a better term, but our identity politics, is it, are you worried about it? Not because, you know,

11:55.040 --> 12:01.680
you lose your scientific American column as much as this means we're not focused on trying to figure

12:01.680 --> 12:07.600
out what is right, what is true, what is correct, but rather we're kind of trying to create a narrative

12:07.600 --> 12:13.200
and maintain things that may or may not be true. Yeah, the word woke is pretty loaded now, and

12:13.200 --> 12:18.320
it's changed already. I heard John McWhorter talking about this, the linguist, you know, it used to

12:18.320 --> 12:22.800
be a cold term. I mean, you and I would have been woke, probably in the 90s, because we were libertarian

12:22.800 --> 12:27.600
in favor of individual freedom rights or whatever. And now that word is mean something completely

12:27.600 --> 12:32.400
different. So, but in general, and I don't want to pick on scientific American, I like the people

12:32.400 --> 12:36.960
I work with there and so forth. It's happening across the board, Twitter is mostly run by,

12:37.120 --> 12:41.360
you know, these kind of work progressives. And, you know, most science and nature, the two most

12:41.360 --> 12:47.600
prominent publications are running articles about this, you know, the and the Lancet had that cover

12:47.600 --> 12:53.760
story of, you know, we have long medicine is long neglected. What was it people who give birth?

12:54.320 --> 12:59.040
Right. If only we had a word for this, right, right, that kind of thing. So, you know, the

12:59.040 --> 13:03.760
line, but there is a truth. I mean, like beyond the language terminology, it is true that like

13:03.760 --> 13:09.840
women, you know, women who give birth were often times a medical discourse were kind of seen as

13:09.840 --> 13:15.360
like bystanders. Well, yes. Right. So, there is a sociology here that's worth kind of rehearsing

13:15.360 --> 13:20.640
and understanding and unpacking. Well, and I think that the second wave feminists I've talked to,

13:21.520 --> 13:28.000
like Helen Joyce, Carol Tavers, they're very just worried about the kind of woke gender identity

13:28.000 --> 13:33.520
movement because it's reducing women to just body parts. Like a guy can say, well, if I just

13:33.520 --> 13:39.600
get breast implants and I can have a vaginoplasty made out of a piece of my skin, and I'm in, I'm

13:39.600 --> 13:44.960
a woman, right? It's like, well, no, because women are not just tits and ass, right? I mean, there's

13:44.960 --> 13:52.400
more to it than that. A lot more. That's a very 70s woke. Women are more than tits and ass. That's

13:52.400 --> 13:59.440
like very progressive. Before we talk about, I want to talk about trans issues and abortion and

13:59.440 --> 14:03.600
gun control and a couple of other things. As you've written, you know, your sub stack is

14:03.600 --> 14:08.960
absolutely one of like my must reads. I appreciate it because I didn't have a subscription to

14:08.960 --> 14:13.520
Scientific American and I didn't always go there and you can go long. So, and I also want to talk

14:13.520 --> 14:17.840
about you have a great piece about independent media and why that's important, especially in

14:17.840 --> 14:23.280
today's kind of cancel culture world. But before we get there, and this goes to that question of

14:23.280 --> 14:29.280
you want to be right, you want to find out what is right but not be right, you started out, you

14:29.280 --> 14:34.480
used to call yourself a libertarian. And now you say, I'm not a libertarian anymore. I'm a classical

14:34.480 --> 14:39.840
liberal and just as a kind of framing device. How, how does that relate? What does that mean? And

14:39.840 --> 14:45.760
how is that related to your interest in finding out what is right, not being right? Yeah, well,

14:45.760 --> 14:50.720
the language does matter and the word libertarian has gotten a lot of baggage over the past quarter

14:50.720 --> 14:55.200
century or so. I mean, here we are at Freedom Fest, there's quite a wide range of people and

14:55.200 --> 15:00.800
they believe rather different things. But to the general public is like, oh, those are those people

15:00.800 --> 15:05.600
that the preppers that want to think the world's gonna end, got to get Bitcoin and gold and guns.

15:05.600 --> 15:11.280
And, you know, it's like, well, I'm not really one of those, right? And, you know, and also,

15:12.240 --> 15:16.480
you know, when you called yourself a libertarian, what, what did libertarianism do?

15:16.480 --> 15:21.760
I think more of a kind of an iron rand, you know, just everybody just be self-reliance, be

15:22.480 --> 15:30.000
self-responsible. I guess the core would be the individual as the fundamental unit

15:30.000 --> 15:38.080
of society and their autonomy and liberty to make the choices they want. Right. So,

15:38.080 --> 15:43.120
this is my concern about conservatives. They, they say that, you know, we believe in liberty and

15:43.200 --> 15:47.360
autonomy and so, but they don't, you know, they very much care at what consenting adults do in

15:47.360 --> 15:51.600
the privacy of their bedrooms because they think it's going to leak out and cause the moral corruption

15:51.600 --> 15:57.360
of the family and then the community and then the society and then the nation. And, and I think

15:57.360 --> 16:01.280
that's the wrong focus because that's kind of a collectivist argument, right? The nation is over

16:01.280 --> 16:06.960
the society. Well, it is true. I think it was Rick Santorum and Bill O'Reilly at various points

16:06.960 --> 16:10.960
talked about how you have gay marriage and then the next thing you know, men are marrying ducks.

16:10.960 --> 16:18.720
And obviously we're all engaged to waterfowl, right? So, they're not, so how, why does classical

16:18.720 --> 16:22.080
liberal, like, why do you think that's a better descriptor for you? I guess I like the word.

16:22.080 --> 16:28.880
I don't know. It has sort of a gravitas to it. I like it. And it, by the way historians talk about

16:28.880 --> 16:33.040
the founding fathers and the, though they were classical liberals and you kind of look back

16:33.040 --> 16:40.320
and know, yeah, I agree with that. I like that. Yeah. Just as a kind of a, well, a fuzzy set,

16:40.320 --> 16:46.240
as I call it, or a family resemblance of a concept, a schema that allows us to capture a bunch of stuff

16:46.800 --> 16:51.440
without firm borders where, you know, that we can overlap and we're both this, but you believe

16:51.440 --> 16:56.240
that and I believe that and that's okay. And you have a wonderful column about the Kardashian.

16:56.240 --> 17:02.160
You use family, you know, a Wittgensteinian family resemblance concept and you use the

17:02.160 --> 17:06.400
Kardashians, which is kind of a great way to think about it because there is something,

17:07.600 --> 17:11.760
I don't want to say essential, but there is kind of something essential to being a Kardashian,

17:11.760 --> 17:17.280
even if you don't have the same parents or the same genetics, right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah,

17:17.280 --> 17:23.600
exactly. So classical liberal for you, that, you know, that kind of fuzzy set or family resemblance.

17:24.480 --> 17:30.640
And for libertarian, you think over the past 25 years, it's become too kind of prepper, too extreme?

17:30.640 --> 17:35.600
It's a little too, yeah, a little fringy, but also a little hyper focused on the individual. It's not

17:35.600 --> 17:39.920
like we should be free to do absolutely anything, anytime we want. Of course, that's not true. You

17:39.920 --> 17:44.400
can't drive on the right side of the road or the left side of the road on any given day. However,

17:44.400 --> 17:50.560
you feel that day, right? We give up our freedoms all the time. And, you know, the, if you read the

17:50.640 --> 17:54.720
Federalist papers, this is what they talk about all the time. We want to give people freedom,

17:54.720 --> 17:58.320
but, you know, of course we have to have this and that. We need a standing army. So do you think

17:58.320 --> 18:04.560
libertarian has become synonymous with anarchism? Well, that's an old mistake people used to make.

18:05.520 --> 18:08.320
And sometimes you have to correct that. No, I think it's more affiliated with like,

18:08.960 --> 18:14.560
you know, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, I don't know, the kind of Second Amendment fundamentalist,

18:14.560 --> 18:20.160
you know, the gun nutters. So it's, we're going to talk about gun nuts and preppers fit into that.

18:20.160 --> 18:27.360
And also Christians, right? Evangelical Christians. Ron Paul and Rand Paul are the Baptists.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.960
Well, libertarians are kind of all over the map on religiosity, right?

18:30.960 --> 18:34.880
Yeah. I mean, you guys have been surveys on this. Some of them are religious, but others

18:34.880 --> 18:38.320
are not. No, and you have on the one hand, you have people like on Rand and then you have people

18:38.320 --> 18:43.360
like Ron Paul. And, you know, certainly over the past 20 years, Ron Paul is probably the

18:43.360 --> 18:48.000
single biggest factor when people say, I become libertarian. It's because they've encountered

18:48.000 --> 18:54.800
Ron Paul. So he's a huge, you know, tributary into libertarian, the libertarian movement.

18:55.680 --> 19:01.600
And do you think, you know, if you're, if you're kind of an evangelical Christian,

19:02.560 --> 19:07.040
can you be, obviously, everybody can call themselves libertarian, but are you,

19:07.040 --> 19:13.760
could you be in that family of people who, so what is the, I think kind of what's the,

19:13.760 --> 19:17.280
what's the litmus has or what's the Maginot line there where you're like, okay,

19:17.280 --> 19:23.040
I can't do this. I would say consistency of principles across different issues. And

19:24.000 --> 19:29.680
I'm more critical of conservatives than libertarians on that for sure. But like when,

19:29.680 --> 19:35.120
when DeSantis sick the government on Disney. Now, I'm not crazy about Disney's woke

19:35.120 --> 19:39.120
progressive politics and we're going to introduce these characters into our cartoons.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.080
Okay. Well, you know, but, but the libertarian way of dealing with that or

19:44.080 --> 19:47.840
what should have been the old conservative way of dealing with that is, well, I'm just not going to

19:47.840 --> 19:53.200
go to and give my money to Disney. I won't go to their films. I won't go to their parks and so on.

19:53.200 --> 19:57.200
But DeSantis is like, no, the conservative thing to do is we're going to slap them with,

19:57.200 --> 20:01.600
you know, with, with higher taxes and regulations. It's like, when did that become a conservative

20:01.600 --> 20:08.080
thing? Right. So I, and I do think libertarians are, okay, where's the consistency say for foreign

20:08.080 --> 20:12.480
policy? You know, don't we have a moral obligation to help people that are under

20:13.600 --> 20:17.520
suppression of civil liberties around the world? You know, sometimes we do, sometimes we

20:17.520 --> 20:21.840
where's the balance there? I don't know. I guess as a fuzzy set, I would say classical liberalism

20:21.840 --> 20:25.840
and libertarianism, they're either in the same or they're too very overlapping.

20:25.840 --> 20:29.280
Yeah. No, and you're not alone in this. And I'm curious, you know,

20:29.280 --> 20:35.280
Penn Gillette obviously famously also kind of voice similar misgivings. And it's interesting

20:35.280 --> 20:40.160
when high profile libertarians like yourself starts to say, you know what, I don't know,

20:40.160 --> 20:46.400
I kind of want to be in a different club. And again, I wonder if part of it is generational.

20:46.400 --> 20:50.400
I mean, because when you say, you know, kind of like second amendment people,

20:50.400 --> 20:56.400
do you feel like the movement is more focused on gun rights now than it was in 1990?

20:57.520 --> 21:03.520
Now it is, yes, because of all the mass public shootings and the government response to this.

21:03.520 --> 21:08.080
And that drives up gun sales. You know, ironically, Obama probably did more for

21:08.080 --> 21:13.600
gun sales than anybody, even though he actually never did much. Right, right. No, he actually,

21:13.600 --> 21:19.440
in his first term, he allowed people to carry weapons on Amtrak at a national park. So he

21:19.440 --> 21:24.400
actually was liberalizing, but people certainly fundraised against the idea that he was a gun

21:24.400 --> 21:30.000
grabber. Well, we've seen this kind of consistency, my body, my choice, in the two different issues

21:30.000 --> 21:36.320
of abortion and vaccines. And each side is like, you know, pretty hypocritical about this.

21:36.320 --> 21:44.160
Do you feel with COVID? Is that also a place where, you know, libertarian, libertarian skepticism

21:44.160 --> 21:49.520
towards state power is one thing. And then, you know, but you also want good science and

21:49.520 --> 21:53.840
good public policy. And then there was a lot within the libertarian movement, I think,

21:53.920 --> 21:59.760
there was a lot of not simply being anti-vaccine mandates, but being anti-vaccine.

21:59.760 --> 22:04.880
See here, I would say the libertarian position would be, I don't like mandates. And yeah,

22:04.880 --> 22:10.640
okay, that's just a principle, government forcing you to do something. But on the other hand, to say,

22:10.640 --> 22:18.000
well, but if the vaccines really work, and the CDC and the Fauci are saying we should all get them,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.680
if I go along with that, then the next step is going to be the mandates. And I don't want that.

22:21.680 --> 22:26.720
So I'm going to be skeptical of the science. Right. No, no, no. It's okay to just say, look,

22:26.720 --> 22:31.040
we should all do this. And by the way, most of us really should get vaccinated. They work.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.920
And there is within your conception of libertarianism, there is a public, I mean,

22:35.920 --> 22:41.520
you're not an anarchist, you believe the state has legitimacy in certain roles and that there are,

22:41.520 --> 22:47.440
and you know, I would argue maybe COVID is not that case, but that if there is a communicable

22:47.440 --> 22:52.000
disease, and there is a vaccine that prevents me from giving it to you, whether you asked for it

22:52.000 --> 22:57.200
or not, there's a role for the state to say, now you have to get vaccinated. In the same way,

22:57.200 --> 23:03.440
you have to pay taxes. Now you're really, yeah, I know we need a standing army, we need a police

23:03.440 --> 23:09.280
force and, you know, and so forth to protect our freedoms and our property rights and so on,

23:09.280 --> 23:13.280
how are you going to do that? And if you say, well, I don't, I'm not participating. I'm not

23:13.280 --> 23:21.040
paying taxes. You didn't sign that social contract. So you'll free ride. So you would say you did not,

23:21.040 --> 23:27.680
you did not change, libertarianism changed, maybe or something like that. Well, let's,

23:27.680 --> 23:34.000
let's talk about your abortion pieces, because this is also something I'm, so I'm 50, I'm about to

23:34.000 --> 23:40.560
turn 59. And when I joined Reason in 93, and I had grown up reading Reason. So, and that's how I

23:40.560 --> 23:46.640
became a libertarian. And I would say everybody I knew who was a libertarian basically said either

23:46.640 --> 23:52.720
they were pro-choice affirmatively that abortion, at least through a certain point in pregnancy,

23:53.360 --> 23:58.800
was a woman's right. And it was nobody's business and that it was not a morally bad issue. It might

23:58.800 --> 24:05.760
be morally complicated. And that even people who were pro-life would say, you know, this is not

24:05.760 --> 24:11.840
something this state should be involved in. That no longer seems to be the case among libertarians.

24:11.840 --> 24:16.560
And in, even though it still seems to be the case in the public at large, only about 20%

24:16.560 --> 24:21.120
according to Gallup or against abortion under all circumstances, that's been very consistent

24:21.120 --> 24:27.760
since Roe was decided. It's religion. Yes. I mean, Reagan was pro-choice until, as I understand it,

24:27.760 --> 24:32.400
Jerry Bowell sat him down and said, I can deliver you millions of votes, but you got to get,

24:32.880 --> 24:38.560
yeah, I'm not sure if that's, I mean, he definitely signed a, you know, a very liberal law in California

24:38.560 --> 24:43.520
as governor and then at various points recanted. And I'm not sure if the motivation for that. But

24:44.080 --> 24:49.760
you know, what you, you say, and I found this really fascinating because you said I am pro-choice

24:50.480 --> 24:55.520
and you started out definitely very, you know, pro-abortion basically through the term

24:56.480 --> 25:02.160
pregnancy. And now you are still pro-choice, but it's more complicated. Can you, can you make the

25:02.160 --> 25:09.520
case for, you know, why abortion should be allowed? Okay. Well, first of all, I'll give a nod to the

25:09.520 --> 25:16.640
pro-lifers that it is a human life that's developing, you know, from the day one, it's a potential human

25:16.640 --> 25:21.760
life. It's not a legal person and so forth. And so, you know, here is, you know, what Richard

25:21.840 --> 25:26.480
Dawkins calls the tyranny of the discontinuous mind. If you, if you're stuck in black and white,

25:26.480 --> 25:31.280
on or off, it's only two sides. There's no continuum. You're going to get very confused

25:31.280 --> 25:35.600
in your thinking about these kinds of issues, right? So you have to draw the line somewhere.

25:35.600 --> 25:41.200
You know, why is, why is a 17-year-old not allowed to whatever vote or something that an 18-year-old

25:41.200 --> 25:46.160
can on the next day? Okay. Well, it's because the law has to draw the line somewhere. Science

25:46.160 --> 25:51.440
doesn't have that kind of demarcation, right? So we do those kinds of things all the time and,

25:51.440 --> 25:59.200
and so I'm willing to say you're right, it's a life. But the female, the mother is also a life

25:59.200 --> 26:04.000
and it's also a legal person and far more advanced than the two-day-old fetus or the

26:04.000 --> 26:08.240
three-month-old fetus or whatever. So, you know, as Thomas Sowell says, there are no solutions,

26:08.240 --> 26:12.560
there's just compromises. And when you have conflicting rights, something has to give,

26:12.560 --> 26:17.520
like the trans athletes, you know, women's rights, trans rights, the conflict when men

26:17.520 --> 26:21.760
want to compete in women's division. Something has to go. You can't have both. So we just have

26:21.760 --> 26:26.640
to make a decision whose rights should we favor in this case. So in that case, I said, well,

26:26.640 --> 26:32.560
the adult woman should be given the nod. Just in principle, you know, individual autonomy and

26:32.560 --> 26:39.440
liberty and control over your own body, that's fundamental. Even while saying, but don't put

26:39.440 --> 26:44.400
yourself in that position where you have to make that choice. It's not a good choice to have to

26:44.400 --> 26:49.840
make, you know, it happens. So, okay, we should be your choice to do it if you want to. But, you

26:49.840 --> 26:56.240
know, as I tell my students, you know, two words, birth control, right, just be, you know, be prepared.

26:56.240 --> 27:01.760
Are you satisfied with the, you know, or not satisfied, but how do you feel about the Dobs

27:01.760 --> 27:06.720
decision, which gets rid of the right of abortion at the national level? So now you had invoked

27:06.720 --> 27:11.760
the Federalist Papers, just thinking about federalism. And now we have 50 states that are

27:11.760 --> 27:17.600
laboratories of democracy. It sounds good in principle, right? But because I know a lot of

27:17.600 --> 27:23.840
pro-lifers and they're all pretty much evangelical Christians. And, you know, overturning row is

27:23.840 --> 27:29.760
just the first step. They want to ban it every state. They will chase people down to the bitter end

27:29.760 --> 27:36.480
to get them to stop having abortions and there any conditions. And that scares me. And so it's,

27:36.480 --> 27:41.440
do you worry that on the flip side of that, that, you know, some states are now going,

27:41.440 --> 27:47.360
that are pro-life or pro-choice are going to, you know, where they might have had regulation of

27:47.360 --> 27:56.560
abortion in, you know, the after viability or, you know, later in the pregnancy are going to be

27:56.560 --> 28:01.520
like, okay, as a response to, you know, if we're California and we're neighboring a state that

28:01.520 --> 28:05.040
is getting rid of all, you know, life begins at the moment of conception, we're going to say

28:05.840 --> 28:11.360
abortion is allowed until the moment of birth. Yeah. Right. So there's extremists on both sides.

28:11.360 --> 28:15.040
Yeah. So the pro-choicers that say, should be okay to abort your fetus the day before you're

28:15.040 --> 28:20.000
supposed to give birth. Of course that's wrong. You know, and again, you get away from the binary

28:20.000 --> 28:24.160
thinking you then you can see a spectrum. Yeah. Okay. So let's just draw the line. I know three

28:24.160 --> 28:29.120
months in Germany is three months, maybe four months. Right. Yeah. And then, okay, so that's

28:29.200 --> 28:35.360
like the age 17 to 18. Okay. There. Right there. That's the time. Do you feel like we, I mean,

28:35.360 --> 28:39.600
and this is interesting when you're talking about kind of gradient thinking or, you know,

28:39.600 --> 28:44.720
things on a continuum, that to me, and we've talked about postmodernism versus, you know,

28:44.720 --> 28:50.160
kind of modernism or whatever in the past, but it's, you know, in the 21st century, it seems like

28:50.160 --> 28:55.680
on certain levels, we're much more comfortable with gradients and a kind of range of options.

28:55.680 --> 29:01.040
And we realize that things are kind of continuous. It's not, even though this is the digital age,

29:01.040 --> 29:05.920
it's not, you know, black and white, it's not one in zero, right? Right. But on other levels, we

29:05.920 --> 29:09.920
seem to be, you know, I mean, and the abortion question is, you know, seems to be front and

29:09.920 --> 29:15.600
center on this of like, no, it is either murder at all stages or it is not. Right. And that just

29:15.600 --> 29:21.440
seems like a terrible way to kind of be engaging reality. Exactly. Right. And again, on the consistency

29:21.520 --> 29:26.640
issue, if, you know, if conservatives are really pro-life, you know, they don't seem to be very

29:26.640 --> 29:31.520
pro-life after you're born, right? It's just a George Carlin's riff. Right. You know, after that,

29:31.520 --> 29:35.600
you're on your own, you know. Now, of course, Christians will, because he does that riff about,

29:35.600 --> 29:41.040
you know, no preschool support, no school lunches, no help for single moms and on and on and on.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.240
Of course, the conservatives will say, no, no, no, it's, we just don't want the government

29:44.240 --> 29:48.880
providing those, that's the job of religion or whatever. And then he throws in the little line

29:48.880 --> 29:54.000
until you become military age. And then we're interested in you again. Okay. So there's some

29:54.000 --> 29:59.040
truth to that humor. Right. And so again, that consistency, you know, if you really care. Why

29:59.040 --> 30:04.480
is consistency so important to you? And I mean, this is true of libertarians, right? You know,

30:04.480 --> 30:10.320
post even, you know, laps libertarians or whatever, like, you know, and when I talk to most people,

30:10.320 --> 30:13.760
like, I'm always like, well, I got, you know, is this logical? Does it make sense? Does it work

30:13.760 --> 30:17.760
all the way through? Most people are like, I don't give a shit. Like, this is what I believe here.

30:17.760 --> 30:22.320
This is what I believe here. And they don't have to be consistent. Yeah. Well, because

30:22.960 --> 30:29.440
if you have a principle that's based on some factual basis that it should be applied consistently,

30:29.440 --> 30:33.920
as consistently as possible, with the recognition, there may be a few exceptions here and there. But

30:33.920 --> 30:38.880
that's the whole point of having a principle is that you apply it evenly across the board, right?

30:39.520 --> 30:44.880
And so again, I just think, you know, people are inconsistent about that. For obvious reasons,

30:44.880 --> 30:49.200
you know, I just want what's good for me and my tribe. And, you know, it's like,

30:49.200 --> 30:55.360
it's like the issue over that the private prayer that the high school football coach gave. Right.

30:55.360 --> 31:01.680
50 yards. The private prayer on the 50 on the 50 players around him. And he's a Christian. Okay.

31:01.680 --> 31:05.520
And of course, Christian is going, yes, this is great. You know, the Supreme Court voted in his

31:05.520 --> 31:11.120
favor. Yeah, well, what if we was down there saying Alou Akbar? Yeah. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we're

31:11.120 --> 31:17.200
not going to allow that. Oh, okay. So what's the principle here? Yeah, thankfully, as this is what

31:17.200 --> 31:23.760
Satanists exist for, they're already filing to do satanic prayers on the 50 yard line. And, you

31:23.760 --> 31:28.240
know, this also like takes us away from the question of like, okay, well, it's football,

31:28.240 --> 31:33.200
like why are high schools playing football? I don't know, you know, like I was a taxpayer,

31:33.200 --> 31:37.600
I'm kind of like, I they can't even teach our kids to read. And now they're giving them brain

31:37.600 --> 31:42.960
damage or whatever. That's a separate issue. Well, let's, let's talk about trans athletes and

31:42.960 --> 31:49.040
what is a woman you wrote. Most recently, you looked at Matt Walsh's documentary, what is a

31:49.040 --> 31:54.720
woman and you know, he is a right wing troll. He, you know, wants to make fun of feminists,

31:54.720 --> 31:59.680
he wants to make fun of gender activists and things like that. But the documentary you found

31:59.680 --> 32:03.920
pretty compelling and interesting. Can you talk a bit about that? I was expecting something of a

32:04.000 --> 32:10.960
Borat like send up or a Milo Yiannopoulos kind of troll. And it wasn't that bad. I've seen him

32:10.960 --> 32:17.200
elsewhere. And yes, he's definitely in the kind of that Ben Shapiro classical conservative issues.

32:17.200 --> 32:23.520
And I disagree with him on most of his beliefs. But I, but what made the film powerful is he's

32:23.520 --> 32:28.560
not saying the things that are crazy. It's the people he's interviewing. And it's not like he,

32:29.120 --> 32:33.760
like Borat, he gets a couple of guys drunk and they start yammering away about the blacks and

32:33.760 --> 32:39.120
the Jews or whatever. Here's the underbelly of America. He's not doing anything like that.

32:39.120 --> 32:43.680
He's going to the, you know, here's a professor of gender studies. You know, what is a woman?

32:43.680 --> 32:47.680
It's right there in your title, gender women studies. You know, what is a woman? This guy

32:47.680 --> 32:52.640
can't answer the question. Okay. So what, what's going on here? I mean, these are smart people.

32:53.280 --> 32:59.040
So the problem here, I think is we're back to the postmodernism. Like I learned from you that,

32:59.040 --> 33:04.240
you know, the original postmodernism was really good. It's kind of a form of skepticism.

33:04.240 --> 33:08.960
Let's challenge the mainstream dogmas back in the 40s and 50s and see, yeah, that's good.

33:08.960 --> 33:14.160
Right. And then it kind of just run, run a muck and goes too far. And I think that's what's happened

33:14.160 --> 33:20.320
here where, and then this particular professor said, you're just trying to tag me with an essentialist

33:20.320 --> 33:25.520
definition of gender. It's like, yeah, that's right. Because to have a fuzzy set or a family

33:25.520 --> 33:30.320
resemblance, you need some agreed upon words that we're going to use of characteristics that

33:30.320 --> 33:35.120
define this thing. And that's the essence of, you know, so it's the gametes, right? Biologists

33:35.120 --> 33:40.400
say, well, a woman and a man is defined by the gametes. You either make it sperm or you make

33:40.400 --> 33:44.560
it eggs. That's it. And everything else follows from that. And if you look under the hood, there's

33:44.560 --> 33:50.240
a thousand different differences in the body that go toward sperm production and development and so

33:50.240 --> 33:55.120
on, or egg production and development of the fetus and whatnot. And it's not just whatever

33:55.120 --> 34:00.960
my inner feelings are. And that would be kind of the most extreme of postmodernism. Whatever I

34:00.960 --> 34:06.480
feel is the truth, it's my truth. And that's essentially what Walsh's film shows, that these

34:06.480 --> 34:12.480
people have gone that far. Whatever it is you say it is, that's what it is. And why do you think

34:12.480 --> 34:17.920
the trans issue, you've also written about how, you know, when these pulverized alts came out,

34:17.920 --> 34:23.440
I guess earlier this year, it was kind of stunning that if you look at older, you know, the silent

34:23.440 --> 34:32.320
generation, the percentage of people who identify as LGBT, so lesbian, gay, bi and trans, very flat,

34:32.320 --> 34:39.920
baby boomers, flat, Gen X, flat, millennials picks up a little bit. And then Gen Z, people are basically

34:39.920 --> 34:48.800
about under like 25. It is, you know, 10% of the population now says that they are LGBT up from

34:48.800 --> 34:57.440
like half of that in 2017. What's going on with the, you know, with an interest in trans,

34:57.440 --> 35:04.880
being trans? Do you think it is that people are, there are more trans people now, or is this all

35:04.880 --> 35:09.840
kind of a rhetorical gesture? And how do you deal with this? Yeah, well, we don't know for sure,

35:09.840 --> 35:16.080
because it's so new. What is the normal background rate of gender dysphoria, where you feel like

35:16.080 --> 35:21.120
from a very young age that you were born in the wrong body. Now, before recently, it was like

35:21.120 --> 35:29.360
maybe one tenth of 1%, or even less, a 20th of 1%, just vanishingly small. And now all of a sudden,

35:29.360 --> 35:35.680
you have, you know, these spikes of like 4,000% increase in this one age core, like age 14 to

35:35.680 --> 35:43.280
19, you know, that kind of thing. And so that would suggest the social contagion hypothesis

35:43.280 --> 35:49.120
that is it spreads amongst a community of people that are either in the same classroom in school,

35:49.120 --> 35:55.840
or they're on an online community. And they get a lot of social proof and positive feedback if they

35:55.840 --> 36:04.640
say I'm this, you know, by pan on whatever. And I had a student a couple of years ago, who in the

36:04.640 --> 36:10.080
middle of class, this was a small seminar, so we talked a lot. And she said, I've decided I'm a boy,

36:10.080 --> 36:14.560
this is what I feel like I'm going to be a man. And she changed her name, and everybody called her

36:14.560 --> 36:20.000
the name, including me, cut her hair, change her clothes, and so on. And then but but in the

36:20.000 --> 36:25.200
conversations that ensued, it was clear to me, she doesn't want to be a man, she wants to be trans.

36:25.840 --> 36:29.680
That's the thing to be. And the moment you announce that is like, Oh, my God, what's that?

36:29.680 --> 36:35.040
And, you know, a thousand questions from the other students. And it's like, I see. So now the other

36:35.120 --> 36:40.400
hypothesis is that societies become more liberal, tolerant, open, some more people are coming out.

36:40.400 --> 36:45.680
Right. Now that is true with the with, I think, gays and lesbians, although now we're having a

36:45.680 --> 36:51.040
backlash, say some of the lesbians and gays that, you know, where are all the lesbians now? And

36:51.040 --> 36:57.200
their concern, and I agree, this is a concern, is that what if you're a 13, 14 year old, young

36:58.240 --> 37:04.240
man or young boy, and you find yourself attracted to other boys. And somebody tells you that's

37:04.240 --> 37:09.920
because inside you're a girl, you're not actually gay. When in fact, this person's most likely

37:09.920 --> 37:15.120
going to grow up to be gay, which is now okay. That's accepted, right? Now, another thing I've

37:15.120 --> 37:21.200
been thinking about is, is it that because the LGBTQ or the gay marriage, same sex marriage,

37:21.200 --> 37:27.360
they happen so fast from 2011, when the majority of Americans finally tipped over to above 50%

37:27.360 --> 37:32.720
in support to 2015, the Supreme Court decision to make it the law of the land, that was pretty

37:32.720 --> 37:37.680
fast. That's probably the fastest rights revolution ever. So it could be the next, you know, sort of

37:37.680 --> 37:42.640
cohorts, like, well, what are we going to champion? You know, what's next, you know, there's animal

37:42.640 --> 37:50.480
rights, but there's gender rights. And so LGBTQ is one thing. So the focus has primarily been about

37:50.480 --> 37:55.920
who you are attracted to. And that used to be against the law, you can't be attracted to the

37:55.920 --> 37:59.920
same sex people, you can't have sex with that was illegal. People were fired in the government.

38:00.640 --> 38:06.080
Thousands were fired for that. And now that's okay. So they've kind of shifted it to okay, what about

38:06.080 --> 38:12.640
who you identify as a woman, that's kind of become maybe the next rights revolution and people,

38:12.640 --> 38:17.440
again, they want to be engaged in something that's meaningful in life. There's a next rights

38:17.440 --> 38:23.600
revolution there. And I'm going to go for that. In, you know, when we were younger, and I'm thinking

38:23.600 --> 38:29.360
in the 70s and whatnot, being trans and it was back then it was short for transsexual. And it

38:29.360 --> 38:34.400
always implied surgical, like gender reassignment surgery. And I'm thinking of people like the

38:34.400 --> 38:40.080
tennis player Renee Richards, who had been Richard Raskin, I believe, who joined the ladies

38:40.080 --> 38:45.520
professional tennis tour. But it was very much about, you know, physicality. I mean, obviously,

38:45.520 --> 38:49.600
there were hormone treatments and things like that. But it was like, if you were a man and you

38:49.600 --> 38:54.960
wanted to become a woman, you got the surgery. And that's what defined it. And you were saying

38:54.960 --> 39:01.200
before that like the equipment isn't necessarily the definition of being male or female. Today's

39:01.200 --> 39:07.440
trans, it seems to be much more about performing a kind of almost public sexuality. Yes, right.

39:07.440 --> 39:11.600
How does that, yeah, how does that factor into any of this? Well, again, I think that supports the

39:11.600 --> 39:16.560
social contagion hypothesis. The whole point of doing it is to make it public. Or else, why would

39:16.560 --> 39:22.960
you do it? Whereas before it was, you know, a private thing, except for the public figures

39:22.960 --> 39:28.400
like Renee Richards, you know, this is just something you do because that's what you need to do.

39:29.120 --> 39:34.000
And, you know, our mutual friend, Deirdre McCluskey, you know, was Donald McCluskey and

39:34.000 --> 39:39.200
transitioned to great cost to her personal life. This wasn't like she's getting love bombed by

39:39.200 --> 39:44.800
everybody. Quite the contrary, and did it anyway, and still does it because that's who she is. Okay,

39:45.440 --> 39:50.880
that exists. That's a real thing. But is it true that, I mean, I've been hearing stories and reading

39:50.960 --> 39:55.440
accounts, you know, like half the class or a quarter of the class of a high school class says

39:55.440 --> 40:03.360
I'm trans or bi or pan or there's something. So it also looks like being cisgender straight is about

40:03.360 --> 40:10.560
the boringest thing you could be. And you don't want to be that. And actually, a number of gay and

40:10.560 --> 40:17.600
lesbian friends of mine, you know, they like gay men, white gay men feel like they are even

40:17.600 --> 40:22.160
more square than heterosexuals, because heterosexuals are talking about kinks and poly

40:22.160 --> 40:27.360
and stuff like that. And lesbians, you know, because lesbians have always been a smaller

40:27.360 --> 40:32.000
percentage of the population. And I know people like Abigail Schreyer, who I've talked to, I know

40:32.000 --> 40:38.720
you have, who's quite controversial in a lot of things, but she argues that particularly girls

40:38.720 --> 40:44.000
who would grow up to be lesbian, their parents, I mean, this is kind of a complicated argument. But I

40:44.560 --> 40:52.080
I kind of buy into it that their parents are actually almost homophobic, and they would rather

40:52.080 --> 40:58.560
that their child be trans than to be lesbian, which seems I mean, I guess what I'm asking you

40:59.680 --> 41:05.440
is, I mean, you have witnessed and participated in like this vast kind of rights revolution over

41:05.440 --> 41:11.360
the past 50 years, where society is so much more profoundly libertarian than we could have imagined

41:11.760 --> 41:18.800
in the bicentennial. And I picked that not because of bi, but because it's like 76, right?

41:18.800 --> 41:23.920
But it's like you can, you know, you can be gay, you can be straight, you can be anything, and it

41:23.920 --> 41:29.600
does not seem to be an impediment to any kind of social success, any kind of professional

41:29.600 --> 41:34.240
success. Yeah, so that's progress, right? It really is. Yeah, right. But, you know, just from

41:34.240 --> 41:40.720
a scientist's perspective, what is the real number? Yeah. And we don't know. But I suspect that

41:40.720 --> 41:44.560
current numbers we're seeing now are greatly exaggerated. I mean, back when the Kinsey report

41:44.560 --> 41:53.040
came out, you know, he reported what 10% of the guys are gay. Right. And I mean, which in a study

41:53.040 --> 41:58.800
that was clearly poorly designed, right, or kind of like cooked data. Yeah. I mean, the real number

41:58.800 --> 42:02.960
is probably something like three to 5%. And then it's also curious to know what, why are there

42:02.960 --> 42:08.240
not as many lesbians? It looks like maybe that how many lesbians are is like half of how many gay

42:08.240 --> 42:15.760
guys are. Why is that, you know, that there could be some social aspects. How much, this is kind of

42:15.760 --> 42:21.040
a bizarre question, but we are at freedom fest, so we can talk about whatever we want. But how,

42:21.600 --> 42:27.920
how much of sexual orientation do you think is kind of baked in, you know, when you come out of

42:27.920 --> 42:34.080
the womb, you know, and how much of it is susceptible to kind of social influence?

42:34.800 --> 42:40.400
Well, I think most of it's baked in biologically, genetically, you know, in the womb, chemistry,

42:40.400 --> 42:44.880
and so on. After that, of course, it could be tweaked a little bit, but, you know, the vast

42:44.880 --> 42:52.080
majority of people that identify, you know, are cisgender, also cisgender. And yes, society could,

42:52.080 --> 42:56.000
you know, the, you know, the whole blue and pink thing, that used to be reversed like a century

42:56.000 --> 43:00.720
and a half ago, I forget, maybe like 1890s or something, you know, that the blue and pink thing

43:00.720 --> 43:07.440
was different than it is now. And by that, you mean pink was associated with men, and blue was,

43:07.440 --> 43:14.800
you know. I forget why that was, but in any case, but it's not like the colors of the toys are going

43:14.800 --> 43:19.920
to make the little boy more masculine. We've all seen the pictures of Hammingway in a dress as a

43:19.920 --> 43:24.960
kid, and it's like his latent homosexuality had nothing to do with the way he was raised,

43:25.520 --> 43:29.040
right, or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I do think the born this way, I think

43:30.160 --> 43:34.080
the other interesting thing about the current trans movement is that the gay community fought for

43:34.080 --> 43:40.960
decades for a kind of biological determinism. I wasn't born this way. It's not a lifestyle choice.

43:40.960 --> 43:46.080
Your little reparative programs are not going to work, you can't de-convert me. If I just had the

43:46.080 --> 43:52.160
right woman, then I would know, you know, how to be straight or anything like that. So, and the

43:52.160 --> 43:57.440
reason for that also is that if you're born that way, then you're a protected class, you're right

43:57.440 --> 44:02.400
stand. But now the trans movement seems to be saying, you could be anything you want, anytime

44:02.400 --> 44:07.040
you want, you can change from day to day, you can change genders, you know, you can change who

44:07.040 --> 44:13.600
you're attracted to. It's totally fluid. And that's actually scary for gays, because it's like, well,

44:13.600 --> 44:17.680
hang on, now we're going to get pushed back from the conservatives, they're going to go, oh,

44:17.680 --> 44:21.280
so you are not that born that way. In that case, we can fix you.

44:21.280 --> 44:27.200
And all of this exists when we're talking about rights or the individual's relationship to

44:27.200 --> 44:32.960
government or something is totally separate. Like, so, I mean, because regardless of why people are

44:32.960 --> 44:37.600
trans or identify as trans or gay or straight or whatever, it doesn't, that doesn't imply

44:37.600 --> 44:41.280
the government should discriminate against them in any way, shape or form.

44:41.280 --> 44:44.800
Yeah, of course, right. Trans rights are human rights. Absolutely. You should not be fired for

44:44.880 --> 44:49.440
being trans. I mean, if that's the only reason, then no, for the same reason,

44:49.440 --> 44:55.600
gays should have been fired decades ago. With trans athletes, you've written about

44:56.400 --> 45:02.000
this. And on a certain level, and particularly at the highest levels possible, when we're talking

45:02.000 --> 45:08.320
about Olympic athletes or NCAA athletes or something, it's such a small number of people,

45:08.320 --> 45:13.120
it almost seems wrong to be looking at that and then kind of generalizing backwards. Because by

45:13.120 --> 45:18.640
definition, these people are extreme outliers in performance and everything. But how do you,

45:18.640 --> 45:26.400
you know, what, what is your sense of like, what is fair for, you know, trans athletes competing

45:26.400 --> 45:34.080
against, you know, biological male or female? Well, so if you're born male, and you go through

45:34.080 --> 45:41.200
puberty, there are so many changes that are substantive. If you compare to female body

45:41.200 --> 45:47.440
development in puberty, after that's happened, and the international swimming body just made

45:47.440 --> 45:52.240
this decision based on that argument that it's too late, there's no amount of testosterone

45:52.240 --> 45:58.320
suppression you're going to take to even the playing field with the average amount of testosterone

45:58.320 --> 46:02.800
that men have versus women, if we could just lower those after puberty, it's too late. I mean,

46:02.800 --> 46:07.600
all the big changes have been made, the bones are bigger and denser, the the sinews and muscles

46:07.600 --> 46:13.280
and ligaments and tendons are all different, the VO2 uptake for your lungs, your oxygen capacity,

46:13.280 --> 46:18.960
and on and on and on, just like a thousand different differences. And now it's true, there are, again,

46:18.960 --> 46:25.360
two overlapping sets. There are some women who are much more physically strong and so on than some men,

46:25.360 --> 46:28.400
but that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about, you know, kind of the average,

46:28.400 --> 46:34.720
the two means. Although sometimes they get kicked out of a limb, you know, say track and field and

46:34.720 --> 46:39.280
things like that. Yes, well, you know, the where people have naturally dopers. Well, those were

46:39.280 --> 46:46.560
dopers, right? But I'm sorry, I'm blanking on her name now, the South African runner who's a woman,

46:47.280 --> 46:52.400
or is always identified as a woman and who's fantastic, but has elevated levels of testosterone

46:52.400 --> 46:58.320
and other things, can't compete internationally unless she reduces that. Is that fair? I mean,

46:58.320 --> 47:01.920
it might be that you need to have some kind of system. So you have to draw the line somewhere,

47:01.920 --> 47:07.280
right? You know, so I mean, so on average, there's a pretty vast differences between average

47:07.280 --> 47:11.360
testosterone levels. And it's not just testosterone. That's kind of the big one, right? So you're going

47:11.360 --> 47:16.160
to have, but you have two overlapping bell curves. So some of the higher women are going to be higher

47:16.160 --> 47:21.520
than some of the lower men. Okay. But and so then you have to make it so the outliers, well, this

47:21.520 --> 47:29.040
woman is right up against the upper limit. And well, okay, so this is the rule we made. So we got a,

47:29.040 --> 47:34.880
you know, because, should we be looking at a world beyond what, like, why do we have male and

47:34.880 --> 47:40.320
female sports competitions? Well, because if we didn't, there'd be no women in sports. You know,

47:40.320 --> 47:44.400
I mean, they just wouldn't, you are stepping in it everywhere. You're like, side show,

47:44.400 --> 47:49.360
Bob hitting breaks everywhere you go. Have you seen the doubles match in tennis where I think

47:49.360 --> 47:55.840
it's Federer and the doll on opposite sides and each of them has a top woman. I think one of them

47:56.720 --> 48:01.360
was the William Sisters and one of the other top ones. And the women can't even get a racket on

48:01.360 --> 48:05.520
the male serve. I mean, they can't, I mean, they're like diving and rolling on the grass and they

48:05.520 --> 48:10.400
can't even hit it. That's what would happen. There would be no women players at all. That would be

48:10.400 --> 48:15.680
the end of women's sports. That's just the way it is. That's reality. You know, I'm not talking

48:15.680 --> 48:20.160
about chess or something like this, but these physical sports like that, you know, when I was

48:20.160 --> 48:25.440
directing Race Across America in the 90s. Explain what that was because that's a phenomenal kind

48:25.520 --> 48:31.440
of event, which, yeah, it's worth rehearsing. Yeah. So in 1982, me and three other guys started

48:31.440 --> 48:36.400
this race called Great American Bike Race, later changed to Race Across America Ram. So this is

48:36.400 --> 48:41.760
a nonstop coast to coast race. Each rider, a cyclist has a support crew that follows them.

48:42.400 --> 48:48.880
The clock starts and stops when you're done. And so you can skip sleep or whatever. And so this

48:48.880 --> 48:53.840
was because it was the Reagan 80s. We were all worried about nuclear annihilation and we were

48:53.840 --> 48:59.040
coped out of our minds. So we were just going to ride our bikes across America. This is the rise of

48:59.040 --> 49:05.200
the Ironman Trabzon and the Adidarod dog sled race. Let's just go crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway,

49:05.200 --> 49:10.160
so by the night, of course, we had women right away enter the race and we had a women's division

49:10.160 --> 49:16.480
and a women's prize and plaques and rings and all that stuff. And but in 93 and 94, I had,

49:16.480 --> 49:21.120
when I was race director, I had two women, a Shauna Hogan and Muffy Ritz, who were better than

49:21.120 --> 49:26.880
all of the men for the first thousand miles, all the way into Colorado. And there was talk like,

49:26.880 --> 49:32.800
well, maybe a woman could win the race, right? And if I recall correctly, I think with the

49:32.800 --> 49:38.160
anthropologist Ashley Montague, at various points in the early 70s, hypothesized that women

49:39.040 --> 49:45.840
were designed by evolution to be better ultra marathoners than men. It's kind of true in

49:46.400 --> 49:51.600
the longer people race, gender falls apart. It falls, it becomes less important, but you're

49:51.600 --> 49:56.960
considered. If it's, yeah, but not say something like a high speed race. Right. Like 200 front

49:56.960 --> 50:02.480
stage is pretty long. Yeah. But women wouldn't last, you know, the first 20 minutes. So what happened

50:02.480 --> 50:06.800
in that case? So they're leading up through Colorado and then what happened? Yeah, what happened

50:06.800 --> 50:10.880
while she got caught and then, you know, finished over a day behind the winning men

50:11.840 --> 50:17.520
at the winning two or three men beat her. And it's just strength. Ultimately, it's just every

50:17.520 --> 50:22.960
little bit of difference in the bodies that it just made a difference over 10 to nine days rather

50:22.960 --> 50:28.640
than the first three days. So, you know, but I even asked the women, you know, would you like a,

50:29.200 --> 50:34.240
just have one division and you compete against them? No, no, because it's not fair. Right.

50:34.240 --> 50:37.840
Guys are just on everything stronger. So let me go back to something where we're talking about

50:38.000 --> 50:43.920
the start of this. You know, there seems to be a tendency, Ia Wilson was a, you know, a conventional

50:43.920 --> 50:48.880
liberal, you know, and towards the end of his life, you know, he's very big on things like climate

50:48.880 --> 50:54.320
change and all of that. Like he subscribed to a lot of, you know, kind of bromides of progressive

50:54.320 --> 51:01.440
liberal policy. But within the concept of socio biology and whatnot, there does seem to be a

51:01.440 --> 51:08.240
real tension on, you know, broadly on the left where it's like we, we can create the world however

51:08.240 --> 51:14.160
we want. Like we believe in evolution because we believe in science and we are not those rubes in

51:14.160 --> 51:19.280
Arkansas, you know, who are Christian, who are biblical, literalists and reject science, we believe

51:19.280 --> 51:27.120
in science. But then, you know, Wilson's theories kind of suggest that no, like if you take evolution

51:27.120 --> 51:33.600
seriously, there are going to be limits on how much you can engineer humanity. And there are going

51:33.600 --> 51:39.920
to be different groups even will select for different properties and characteristics that

51:39.920 --> 51:46.080
are going to have real world outcomes. Is that a tension within kind of the science community

51:46.080 --> 51:51.840
and either the right or the left? Well, yes, but, but Picker points out in his book, The Blank Slate,

51:51.840 --> 51:58.400
that in fact, the opposite is true that of course, biology and genetics is part of it.

51:58.960 --> 52:04.320
The environment can't operate on nothing. It has to operate on a physical system,

52:04.320 --> 52:10.560
which is the brain, which is designed by your genes, made of proteins. And so it's not possible

52:10.560 --> 52:15.840
that it can't have any effect. And so you have to understand what the effects are before you can

52:15.920 --> 52:20.720
re-engineer society to make it fair. You know, Thomas Soule wrote a book about this,

52:20.720 --> 52:26.720
this kind of conflicting worldviews and that is kind of utopian worldview where it's all blank

52:26.720 --> 52:32.640
slates and we can re-engineer society to make it perfectly equal. We'll always fail because we're

52:32.640 --> 52:37.040
not perfectly equal. You know, we have different interests, different physical characteristics

52:37.040 --> 52:42.480
and skills and so on. Well, that's just the way it is. So there you need kind of a more general

52:42.480 --> 52:46.880
principle that says wherever you fall on the bell curve of whatever it is we're measuring,

52:47.680 --> 52:53.360
you should have the opportunity to do whatever it is you want without any barriers based on

52:53.360 --> 52:57.760
these protected classes that you didn't choose, right? Kind of a Rawlsian argument. You don't know

52:57.760 --> 53:01.920
which, what your running speed is going to be or what your IQ is going to be. So we have to make

53:01.920 --> 53:06.480
it fair that there, you have access to all the different jobs and the chips fall where they may.

53:07.520 --> 53:11.760
Wilson at the end of his life, maybe the last decade or so, endorsed group

53:11.760 --> 53:20.960
selection. Now group selection is more supported by liberals in the left because it's this idea that

53:21.760 --> 53:28.080
we as a group can be the target of selection and make things happen that the individual can't.

53:28.080 --> 53:32.240
Now most evolutionary biologists, people like Dawkins and Pinker say now this is not true.

53:32.240 --> 53:38.400
There's no evidence for this and it's still the individual genome of the individual is the one

53:38.880 --> 53:42.320
that is the target of natural selection. But I just thought that was interesting toward the

53:42.320 --> 53:46.240
ends of his life. It was a more liberal kind of argument he was making. And I mean, Steven J.

53:46.240 --> 53:52.800
Gould was, I guess what I'm getting at is that you, science, I mean people and maybe it's libertarians

53:52.800 --> 53:59.040
or scientists want to believe that I am arguing from science and reality into my politics. But

53:59.040 --> 54:05.680
perhaps these are separate spheres. Not necessarily. I'm willing to leap over

54:05.680 --> 54:10.720
humans while separating is or not. We do it all the time. I mean, the way things are,

54:10.720 --> 54:16.560
we have to structure society in a way based on human nature. And again, just fairness should be

54:16.560 --> 54:22.880
our goal. Why fairness? Well, again, kind of a Rawlsian argument that you don't know where you're

54:22.880 --> 54:27.520
going to be. So we have to make it as fair as possible. And then you do whatever you want.

54:27.520 --> 54:31.680
And we're not going to have equal outcomes. This is the problem today is that the drive

54:31.680 --> 54:35.520
toward equal outcomes. No, no, it because we're never going to get equal outcomes.

54:36.240 --> 54:39.520
Just for a thousand different reasons. So just equal opportunities is the goal.

54:40.960 --> 54:46.960
But yeah, anyway, so, but yeah, so there is a tension of people like Gould and Wilson on the

54:46.960 --> 54:52.240
left about, well, what about genetics? This is just a misunderstanding. It says Pinker and I

54:52.240 --> 54:57.280
agree with him that, you know, you're just misreading this thing like it. If it's genetic,

54:57.280 --> 55:00.720
you can't change it. No, in fact, that's not true. Right.

55:01.920 --> 55:06.480
Let's talk about gun control because you've written and this is probably one of the issues

55:06.480 --> 55:12.800
where you depart most from a kind of libertarian orthodoxy. But you believe in gun control.

55:13.680 --> 55:20.800
And can you make the briefcase for that? And, you know, why do libertarian or maybe not libertarians,

55:20.800 --> 55:25.360
let's say, Second Amendment fundamentalists in your phrase, where are they wrong?

55:25.920 --> 55:30.720
Well, society is filled with collective action problems. We need to solve as a group.

55:30.720 --> 55:35.120
And to do that, you have to get, you know, a majority and then they all have to chip in

55:35.120 --> 55:40.640
like paying taxes. Again, it's just most libertarians are not anarchists and they agree, okay, we need

55:40.640 --> 55:45.280
property rights and therefore we have to have a court system to support your property rights.

55:45.280 --> 55:49.520
And we need a police force and the prison system and a military. All of a sudden,

55:49.520 --> 55:54.240
you have a big government that you got to fund with taxes. All right. How is this any different?

55:54.240 --> 56:00.240
Why is guns separate? In my opinion, it's because guns are almost totemic as a proxy

56:00.240 --> 56:06.480
for something else. This kind of focus on individual autonomy, freedom, self-defense,

56:06.480 --> 56:11.600
liberty, freedom from the government, that sort of thing. Over and above all the other

56:11.600 --> 56:16.960
concessions you've already made, you know, okay, I'm going to pay for police and fire and military

56:16.960 --> 56:23.200
and so on. And if I don't pay my taxes, they're coming to get me at some point. I'll get the

56:23.200 --> 56:27.680
letters and then, you know, and so forth. But eventually men with guns will come to your house.

56:27.680 --> 56:34.400
Yeah. Right. Why you've signed on for that, you know, so. But I think that's why they want the guns

56:34.400 --> 56:40.640
because well, I know. But yeah, but why would okay. So yeah, right. So but why would you support

56:40.640 --> 56:45.280
that? Because you've already agreed that well, we need somebody to protect my property rights

56:45.280 --> 56:49.120
through a court system that I'm willing to pay for. Well, how about the guy over there? He doesn't

56:49.120 --> 56:54.400
want to pay for it. Well, then send men with guns over there and he has guns. You know, this this

56:54.400 --> 57:01.280
lead in a way this kind of fanaticism about just arm everybody. You know, is a way of saying the

57:01.280 --> 57:06.960
United States is a failed state. And it's just everybody's on their own. And we don't really

57:06.960 --> 57:12.880
trust the police or the military to do their job. We don't trust our institutions. We give up. It's

57:12.880 --> 57:17.360
like we're living in Somalia. Well, no, we're not living in Somalia. I can see if you live there

57:17.360 --> 57:22.240
while you want a gun or something. And I do get that, you know, if I'm an African American living

57:22.240 --> 57:26.080
in inner city, and I don't trust the police, because they're not trustworthy, and they can't get

57:26.080 --> 57:31.440
there in time. And there's violence around me, I should have a gun. So again, not by an area,

57:31.440 --> 57:35.840
you know, I'm not anti gun at all. I grew up with guns. My stepfather was a hunter. So I had a BB gun

57:35.840 --> 57:40.480
and a pellet gun, then a 20 gauge shotgun, then a 12 gauge shotgun. And for 20 years, I had a hand

57:40.480 --> 57:46.960
gun at my house in Altadena. And, you know, but it's just we're facing a social problem. How do

57:46.960 --> 57:51.440
we solve it? The carnage is, you know, more people die by guns than by cars.

57:51.440 --> 57:57.120
And is that I mean, one of the things that is true, I mean, gun homicides have been going down,

57:57.120 --> 58:02.240
you know, since the mid 90s. So there's slight upticks and things like that. But the suicides,

58:02.240 --> 58:06.640
you know, I mean, that's like more than half of gun deaths, right? So that's part of what your

58:06.640 --> 58:11.920
argument is, right? Yeah, right. Yeah. Right. So how about just how about just regulation in the form

58:11.920 --> 58:18.880
of more better background checks, right? And we already have laws about, you know, men with

58:18.880 --> 58:24.720
restraining orders against their significant other. I mean, when a woman is murdered, it's like 90% of

58:24.720 --> 58:30.880
is by a significant other after they broke up or got divorced or child custody issues, something

58:30.880 --> 58:36.320
like that. You know, why have the gun there? If he already has a restraining order, he can't buy a gun,

58:36.720 --> 58:41.520
a lot of those laws are already in place, just enforce them, you know, the gun show loophole.

58:41.520 --> 58:46.160
Are you sympathetic to the argument that, yeah, I mean, this is the point, we have tons of gun

58:46.160 --> 58:51.280
laws and they don't seem to be, you know, they're in the same way that we, you know, you can't be

58:51.280 --> 58:58.320
utopian about certain things like school shootings are horrible, but they are not, they're not common

58:58.320 --> 59:02.720
enough where that's where you make all the laws. To be honest, man, I'm ready to give up on the whole

59:02.720 --> 59:06.480
thing and just say fuck it. I mean, it's just, just let everybody, everybody have their guns

59:06.480 --> 59:10.560
because there's already 400 million guns, right? 120 guns for every 100 people. So we're talking

59:10.560 --> 59:14.960
about 400 million guns in America. We're not going to get them back. You know, if the government

59:14.960 --> 59:20.800
said we're doing a buyback or a take back program, it'd be like Waco every day. Yeah, Ruby Ridd.

59:20.800 --> 59:27.120
It's fascinating too that actually as more guns are in circulation, it's in a fewer percentage

59:27.120 --> 59:34.800
of households, which, so fewer people are having, owning more guns. And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not

59:34.800 --> 59:40.640
particularly, you know, focused on the gun issue, but that seems like an interesting social change.

59:40.640 --> 59:44.480
Right. And I'm not sure what accounts for it, or if that's good or bad or different.

59:44.480 --> 59:47.920
Yeah. You know, in the examples that I use, everybody uses, you know,

59:48.480 --> 59:53.200
Austria and Australia, other countries have done these things and it worked. Yeah, but they're

59:53.200 --> 59:57.520
smaller, a genius population. They didn't have very many guns in the first place. They don't have

59:57.520 --> 01:00:03.040
the same culture that we have about guns, second amendment, all that. I don't know. I don't know

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:07.840
how, I don't know what the solution is. It seems like somebody should do something and I know how

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.320
libertarians respond to that. Yeah, the government, we don't want the government to do more. It's

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:18.720
already doing too much. Okay. But again, like back to the analogy with cars, pretty much everybody's

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:22.560
signed off in the idea, well, cars should be regulated. You know, seatbelts are good,

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:27.520
and airbags are good. And, you know, that even though the number of car deaths still hovers

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:34.160
like 35 to 40,000 a year, but, but, but if you adjust it by the miles driven, cars are much safer

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:39.040
now. Right. They used to be. And why is that government regulation? You have to have seatbelts.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.440
Oh, you're speaking heresy now. I know. I know. That government can never do anything good.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.680
I don't see how that would have happened just by private enterprise.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:54.560
Yeah. That's, I mean, that's a, it's a serious challenge to a kind of knee jerk libertarianism,

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:59.600
which I think, you know, people who still call themselves libertarians like myself,

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:03.040
I need to take up that mantle and sometimes I can and sometimes I can't. Yeah.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.000
I mean, but just one last point, collective action problem, like the motorcycle helmet thing,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.560
you know, and back when that happened, you know, libertarians, a lot of motorcycle, I'm not going

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.960
to do it. Right. Or they would wear these, you know, little nothing helmets. You know, I get that.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.120
I totally get that. But, you know, the way our medical system operates, eventually,

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.720
you know, you and I, you have to pay for these accidents and these head injuries.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:33.120
Do you, I'm assuming you grew up riding bicycles without helmets. And then when did you start,

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.400
when you were a bike racer? Yes. Well, that happened in the accident.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.480
But are they effective? Yes. The current helmets are totally effective. Yes.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:46.640
Because they're designed on, based on motorcycle helmet design. It's a, it's a compressed polystyrene

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:54.400
shell that on impact, it absorbs like 95% of the impact. And they work. The bike helmets before

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.760
that. These are the old leather strap ones. Completely worthless. Yeah. At the, at the

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.040
den show when I worked for, at the bike show, when I worked for Bell helmets, they were one of my

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:08.080
sponsors. We used to take one of those leather hair nets and have the people come by, okay,

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:12.720
put your fist inside there. Yeah. Now slam it against that brick wall. Like, no, I'm not,

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.840
are you kidding me? Yeah. Now do it with one of these helmets. No problem. Right. It's like,

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.600
that's your head, right? But was that, you know, was that innovation driven by

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:28.240
superior technology and information or was it by mandate? This is, well, by mandate because

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:35.200
enough people were died in the tour de France from head injuries that the tour itself said,

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:40.160
hey, we need to mandate helmets. So, and when I was working for Bell at the time, they were saying,

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:44.640
they already had the bell shell, which was this white geeky looking helmet. And they've had this

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.840
for like 15 years. No one was buying it. No one serious cyclists would not wear it. So I said,

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.640
you need to design it to look like a leather hair net. So it's got to be black and, you know, thin

01:02:54.640 --> 01:03:00.560
with some air, some air vents and maybe a little gold trim. It's got to look cool. And you got to

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:06.800
get pros to wear it. And the people go, all right, you know, and that helped, but it wasn't until it

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:12.640
was mandated. And again, this collective action problem, most cyclists wanted to wear helmets

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:17.680
because they know it's safer. But when some of them don't wear it, they get a slight advantage.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:22.000
It's like, well, I got to, it's like doping. I got to do it because that guy's doing it, right?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.920
And then once it's mandated, okay, no one gets to take the drug, everyone has to wear a helmet.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.080
And it's like, okay, good. I want to take you down a slight detour. Now that we're talking about the

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:34.400
tour de France and also about technology and innovation and doping and things like that.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:39.840
Greg LeMond was the first American to win the tour de France. And he's like a fascinating figure

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:46.320
who also embraced every technological innovation he could. And there was one tour de France,

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:52.320
in particular, where he beat Laurent Fignon, who eschewed technology. It was like, oh, that's

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:59.680
like American stupidity and things like that, lost by seconds over, you know, a 21 day, you know,

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:09.280
race. How important is, you know, our, is like understanding technology and innovation and

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:15.440
kind of pushing that forward? How, you know, how is the best way to make that happen or more people

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:21.680
embrace that? Well, it happens naturally, it kind of trickles down from the pro ranks to serious,

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.920
you know, weekend athletes and people have more money now and the bikes are better than they used

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.880
to be. They really do get better. Like I get a new bike every three to four years. And they,

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.960
every one of them is really better than the previous one. You know, maybe just a little bit,

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:42.080
just 1%, 2% you can feel the difference. And you know, disc brakes instead of the rim brakes,

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:47.840
they're better, electronic shifting is better. And it just kind of starts to add up. But because

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:53.360
the market, because of capitalism, you know, what would have been say a $15,000, $20,000 bike I

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:58.480
could get for like 6,500 now, because so many people are buying them because they really are

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.640
better and you see all the pros racing. Do you think this is part of the problem of our current

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.520
moment? And now I'm leaping from kind of technological innovation and bike racing or something to,

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:13.920
in general, I mean, the world is so much better than it was 50 years ago, but we don't seem to

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:18.240
want to recognize that or acknowledge that. And is that a problem? Well, you don't see it. It's

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:24.880
hard to see. Because it happens slow enough, like again, the bike thing, you know, if I was a regular

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.240
weekend warrior or whatever, and maybe I'd buy a bike every 10 years, and oh, okay, I really see it.

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.400
But when you buy him incrementally, he's like watching your kid grow. You see the pictures

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:40.080
from three years ago. Oh, wow, you got big. You don't notice it, right? And, you know, that's hard

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:46.080
to see. You know, Pinker talks about that. And Matt really does, you know, you know, just the cost

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:51.840
of how many hours a week you have to work to get your dinner or your light. You know, Matt has

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:57.360
those charts. Yeah. And it's like, oh, wow, I mean, it's just just very incrementally, very slowly

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:02.400
over decades and centuries. And, you know, from day to day, we don't see that. Because our senses

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:08.400
are geared to immediate environment, you know, the next day, the next week, that's about it. That's

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.840
all we care about. Because we're really designed to pay attention to threats. So the negativity

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:20.720
bias. So we focus on bad things rather than the good things, and also immediate threats. And the

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:25.280
way the world works, because of second law and entropy, is that, you know, good things happen

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:30.480
mostly very gradually, slowly over long periods of time. But bad things can happen. Boom. You know,

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.200
you get the stroke or the heart attack, or the company goes out of business, the stock collapses,

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:40.560
the country falls. These things happen very quickly. So we're tuned to looking for those

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.840
kind of threats. Because those are the things that took us out. Just to close out the tour to

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:52.160
France, you know, beginning with Le Monde and going through Lance Armstrong. This, to me, I

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:56.800
found it interesting that, you know, Americans didn't care about bike racing. It was like

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.520
ridiculously European and all of that. And it was kind of like soccer in the 70s and 80s. It

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:08.000
like picked up. And then Lance Armstrong, and you know, and people after Americans after him who were

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:15.840
caught doping and cheating and whatnot after protesting that they hadn't. You know, now we

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:21.040
don't care about bike racing in the same way, right? And is that, you know, has that happened

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:25.760
all over society? Where I mean, we live in an era now, things are getting better and better,

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:32.320
but our trust and confidence in institutions and in society have been declining. You know,

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:38.480
how do we deal with that kind of dynamic? Interesting analogy. Yeah, well, there are

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:44.320
Americans in the tour this year, but they're not doing that well. It definitely punctured the,

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:50.080
I mean, there was a growing interest in things like professional cycling and certainly the tour.

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:55.920
You know, and I guess, and it's even broader than, you know, just America. I mean, the revelation of,

01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:00.960
you know, profound doping, which in a way goes back to the very early beginning of the tour.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:05.600
There were doping controversies that vary from the beginning, and I'm kind of big on performance

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.160
enhancing drugs. I kind of, you know, I don't just let everybody do it. Well, or yeah, I mean,

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:15.680
but then you do have rules and the, but you know, yeah, yeah, I'm with you. And I mean, I guess if

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:22.000
it didn't trickle down to junior athletes that are up and coming and you get that again, that you

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.160
get that kind of collective action problem and like, well, I don't want to do it, but that guy's

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:30.160
doing it and I want to get to his level and so on. And that's how it happens. That's how it

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.320
happened with Lance. I mean, it's unfortunate. He was not able to articulate that very clearly

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:40.560
on Oprah's couch there that, you know, when he didn't start any of this, he just did it better

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:45.680
than everybody else was doing it. And he hired the top guy and said, you can't work for anybody

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:52.240
else to give you pile of money to an exclusive. And, and, you know, but there's, you know, when

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:56.320
he was first starting and he was getting his ass kicked and, you know, it's like, why is this

01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.400
happening? And somebody said, see that guy there and that guy there, they're doping. They're using

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:04.480
this, they're using that. They're going to that guy over there. He's the top doping. Oh, okay.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:12.560
And then, so here's the choice. I either do it or I'm out. Right. And then, you know, you don't

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.320
get to fulfill your dreams. So they do it. You know, it's a, it's a rational choice, I think.

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:21.360
And there's, I mean, I guess in, in humans, would you say in evolution, there's this, there are

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:27.280
these two tendencies. One is that we want excellence, but then we also, and we're willing to do almost

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:31.920
anything for it, but then we are very disappointed, if not in ourselves and our heroes, when they

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:38.240
actually do what we're kind of urging them to do, which is take, you know, pay any price in order

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.040
to become the best or something. Right. Yeah, I'm not sure you have to put it at such extremes,

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.680
though, because you have spectacular performances that you, where you don't need the drugs,

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.760
maybe, but again, you just have to, you have to have good enforcement. I mean, there was an interesting

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.360
thing when Rafa won the French Open this year, and then it came out like a week later that his,

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:01.920
his foot was all shot up with all kinds of drugs and stuff because he has some weird

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:06.640
problem there. And a couple of cyclists were commenting, boy, if we did that, we'd be kicked out

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:13.120
and we'd be shamed and humiliated in the front pages of the newspapers. And it is true, the doping

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.080
agencies like the, you know, that governs sports are terrible and very arbitrary and just incompetent,

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:24.480
I mean, in many ways. And I can recall Olympic swimmers, you know, losing their gold medals

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.440
because they had taken the wrong kind of cold medication or whatever. Whereas the NFL, you

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:35.440
know, their program was, you know, the doping agency has to contact the player's agent and then

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.400
set a date to test it like in three weeks. Okay, no problem. We'll clear it all out.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:47.440
Let's close up by talking about Skeptic, the Skeptic Society, Skeptic Magazine, 30 years

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:52.560
and running. You know, explain what the Skeptic Society is about.

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:57.520
Well, we're a 501c3 nonprofit. Science education is our thing, critical thinking,

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:04.080
rationality, you know, reason, that there, you know, commitment to universal realism,

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.480
there is a reality, we can know something about it, albeit not perfectly, you know, that kind of

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:16.080
enlightenment ideals of the search for objective truth through tried and true methods, you know,

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.760
that's kind of our thing. And just, we just try to tackle subjects that are important.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.240
Right. And as you see with the abortion issue, trans issue, next one on race, you know, we've

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:31.520
already done astrology, big foot, UFOs, you can only do those things so much. And it's like, okay,

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:38.080
we pretty much know what the story is there. It's amazing how the Loch Ness sponsor and

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:42.240
the Bermuda Triangle, just people don't care about those anymore.

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:45.360
No, I know they're out, but UFOs are back because of the UAP thing.

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:51.040
Absolutely. Yeah. But and although it seems like this is the end of UFOs, right, like it's obvious

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.760
that it's, you know, it's not extraterrestrial. It should be obvious to everybody, although it's

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:02.080
still pretty popular that ancient alien show is on its 18th season. I mean, it's up there with the

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:07.600
apprentice or something, right? But so I want to ask you, is this a good time to be a skeptic

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:14.080
in terms of like, does rationality and again, understanding that it's imperfect, we all have,

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:18.560
you know, our cognitive bias and all of that kind of stuff. Is there more broadly speaking,

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:24.640
are we more rational than we were 50 years ago? Or is that never the way to really think about

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:30.720
things? This is a big debate in cognitive psych circles of to what extent are we naturally gullible

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.440
and we fall for things like cults and scams, things like that, because people do fall for those

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.240
things. But the counter argument to that is, in fact, most people don't fall for cults and scams.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:46.400
The reason these scammers have to send out, you know, a million emails to get one sucker is because

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:51.440
most people are not suckers, right? And, you know, most people who join religious sex and groups

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:57.360
and self-help groups, and they go to Tony Robbins, you know, weekend, they're not joining cults. And

01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.600
if the thing turned into a cult, they probably would leave, right? So we only hear, there's an

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.880
availability here, we only hear about the ones, you know, the Jonestown and Waco and, you know,

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:13.280
sort of the crazy ones, the, you know, Heaven's Gate. But those are really rare, right? And so I've

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:19.120
been thinking about this, you know, to what extent this is called default to truth. You know, when

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.640
you tell me something, I just tend to believe you because I know you, I don't have time to fact check

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:30.320
everything you tell me. So there's kind of a social trust that most of the time works, right?

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.840
And I was just telling people about the story I read of this guy, a cyclist, who, do you know what

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:41.120
Strava is? You know, you post your rides on this app. And then on Strava, there's these King of the

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.520
Mountain KOM, every segment is timed. And, you know, there's thousands of people have done that

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:49.280
segment. And you can see what the average speed was. You try to go out there and break that guy's

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:56.160
time order. Well, so there was this guy who turns out he was like a total con man fraud,

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:01.520
you know, an impersonator. I mean, he said he had, he was a CEO of a major corporation. He had been

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:08.080
in IPO startups and he was in special forces and on and on and on. And he was a professional bike

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.440
racer on this European team. And the people wherever he was living in California, I think,

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:19.520
you know, no one bothered to check until he posted a time on a Strava KOM that somebody

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:24.720
saw and went, that's not possible. The speed was like what a top European pro would do. And this

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:29.600
guy's like 45 years old is like, wait a minute, I'm going to look into what else he's done, right?

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.720
But, but if I just heard, you know, I was in the special forces, okay, I mean, I wouldn't even know

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:40.080
how to check if you told me that. Who would I call this was, you know, Nick, really a Navy

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:45.600
seal guy? I wouldn't even know, right? So I think for the most part, we're not gullible so much as

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:52.000
the trust thing works pretty well most of the time. But evolution did not eliminate all the

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.400
psychopaths and the free riders and the liars and the deceivers and the cheaters, because that would

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:04.880
take too much energy to get rid of every last one, right? So a society can tolerate like a small

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:11.760
percentage of, of con men and liars and cheaters and thieves and so on, and still function reasonably

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:21.040
well. What's your favorite cult? Well, I guess this is going to sound crazy, the cult of Trump

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.680
at the moment. Yeah, I mean, I really think it is something like that. You know, the fit just

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:32.160
even just yesterday, just after the latest January six hearings where it's obvious to anyone with

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:37.440
eyes and ears that, you know, he knew he lost and he was just to make a grab for power and you

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:43.760
still see some of these Republican toadies. Yeah, tons of Republicans, people running for office

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:49.760
saying that the election was stolen. Right now, it could be there just opportunists saying, I got

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.320
to say whatever I think the boss wants me to say so that he gives me his endorsement so I can win

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:59.040
the election. I don't really believe it. That's possible. But what concerns me is that, you know,

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.200
like 60% of self identified Republicans say they, and they have nothing to gain. They just,

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:08.560
yeah, I think there was, I think rigged, right? I think it was rigged. That's a kind of conspiracy

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:14.240
theory and maybe even a cult that's not on the fringe. What's the, you know, what's the status

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:17.840
of skepticism? It's more important than ever. Because, you know, most of these conspiracy

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:23.760
theories that I've used to deal with, you know, the JFK or 9-11, they're pretty fringy, right?

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:29.600
And this one is, you know, right there at the top of the government. And I'm worried this could

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:33.840
threaten our democracy, right? If enough people believe this, they won't accept the outcome of

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.640
the next election. Do you worry going into the midterms by all accounts that Democrats are going

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:44.720
to lose big for a variety of historical reasons? President, when the president is unpopular in

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:50.880
his first midterm election, they, you know, he loses 25 to 35 seats, etc. Democrats are already

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.600
starting to rehearse how these elections, you know, the Supreme Court is not legitimate. The

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.160
Republicans have stripped people of voting rights all over the place. Do you worry that?

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:04.560
I do. So we're going to go from a right-wing conspiracy theory about

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:10.480
illegitimate elections to a democratic one. Yes. Well, the Dems have always had conspiracy

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.920
theories whenever they lost. If you just go back to the last 50 years in every election,

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.880
this one was slightly different because it ended up at the Capitol. But,

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:24.880
but yes, of course, they're going to, I'm worried that if a Republican genuinely wins,

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:31.200
say in 24, whoever it is, maybe DeSantis, hopefully not Trump, that the Dems won't accept it. They'll

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:36.320
just say, nah, we know they were doing this behind the scenes and the gerrymandering this and that.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.400
This was all illegal. And then what? You know, then we're in trouble. Well, although I suspect

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:48.160
skeptic magazine circulation is going to go up. I don't know. Or it's going to go out of business.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:52.480
One or the other, right? I find most people, they're not that interested in the truth. You have

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.720
to kind of remind them this is why this is important. I feel like Liz Cheney sometimes,

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:03.120
you know, standing up there going, you know, what actually happened matters, reality matters, right?

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:07.760
And I mean, what a funny thing. I mean, she's my hero. And I don't agree with her on almost

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:13.840
everything, politics, right? You know, she's pro-life. Do you hope, I mean, well, do you hope

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:18.800
people are becoming more independent minded? I mean, that would help. I like Andrew Yang's

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:23.520
idea of a third, a viable third party. Of course, he's not the first, forward party. I like this

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:29.840
idea. And I'm not a big UBI guy. But you know, I think we, the duopoly, he talks about the duopoly,

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:34.480
you know, Germany, where my wife's from, they have what, six or seven parties that are viable

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:40.960
parties. No one gets more than 50%. I mean, no one gets more than really 20, 25%. That's good.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:44.160
That sounds great. That's a good note to end on. Michael Shermer, thanks for talking.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.240
You're welcome. Thanks for having me.
