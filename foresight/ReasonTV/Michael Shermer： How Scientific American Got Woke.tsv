0	6000	The second wave feminists I've talked to, they're very worried about the kind of woke
6000	10960	gender identity movement because it's reducing women to just body parts.
10960	14480	Like a guy can say, well, if I just get breast implants and I can have a
14480	19200	vaginoplasty made out of a piece of my skin, and I'm in, I'm the woman, right?
19200	23520	It's like, well, no, because women are not just, it's an ass, right?
23520	24960	I mean, there's more to it than that.
24960	28880	For decades, Michael Shermer has been one of the most popular and provocative
28880	33920	explicators of science to popular audiences, having authored bestselling books such as
33920	39840	Why People Believed Weird Things, Why Darwin Matters, The Moral Ark, and The Mind of the Market.
39840	45360	He founded Skeptic Magazine in 1992, hosts a video podcast with leading activists and
45360	51200	intellectuals, and for nearly 20 years authored a widely read column for Scientific American in
51200	56240	which he debunked beliefs in UFOs and other paranormal phenomena, explained the rise of
56320	61920	the new atheism, and showed how evolution systematically informs human behavior.
61920	67200	Shermer's work is deeply and explicitly rooted in libertarian and enlightenment ideas
67200	71360	about individual responsibility, free market economics, rationality,
71360	74800	and the search for something approaching objective truth.
74800	81280	In 2019, Scientific American cut him loose, a move he ascribes to the publication suffocating
81280	87200	embrace of the sort of identity politics and wokeness that he says dominates academic circles
87200	90240	and increasingly the culture at large.
90240	96320	Les Falle Shermer, who holds a PhD in the history of science and teaches Skepticism 101 at Chapman
96320	101600	University, started a weekly sub-stack where he hosts podcasts and the columns he would have written
101600	107360	for Scientific American. The 67-year-old former competitive cyclist talked with Reason during
107360	112560	Freedom Fest in annual gathering in Las Vegas about the fundamental clash between wokeness
112560	117920	and scientific inquiry, how hard it is to overcome the cognitive biases we all have,
117920	123360	why he thinks trans athletes should be banned from most women's sports, why we have so much
123360	128640	trouble acknowledging moral and technological progress, and why he now identifies as a classical
128640	130960	liberal rather than as a libertarian.
131600	137120	Michael Shermer, thanks for talking to Reason.
137120	138080	Nice to see you again.
139120	144480	So you last year, last fall, you started a sub-stack publication to go along with Skeptic
145360	151520	Magazine and whatnot, and one of the early pieces was titled Scientific American Goes Woke,
151520	159120	and you were a longtime columnist for Scientific American, a very popular science communicator.
160000	166160	Describe what you wrote about in Scientific American Goes Woke and why you started a sub-stack.
166720	173840	Right. So I started Scientific American 2001, and I went almost 18 years, 214 consecutive monthly
173840	177920	columns. I was going for Steve Gold's 300 that he did in Natural History Magazine,
178640	183600	which would have taken me to April 2025, so I didn't quite make that. They terminated the column.
184160	187920	There was no particular reason given other than, well, we're going different ways,
187920	193600	and it's time for a change. They didn't say, hey, we've gone woke, and you're an old non-woke
193600	198400	guy. But I could kind of see the writing in the wall. Last couple of columns I had written
199200	206080	were dealing with some issues kind of related to race and sex and gender and that sort of thing,
206080	213920	and I could feel the uncomfortableness in the editorial process, and then boom, they let it go.
213920	218800	So I mean, I don't know for sure, but that was it. So I started the sub-stack just because
219440	225120	I still had more writing in me. I like writing the columns, but this gives me a little more
225120	231760	flexibility if I want to go more than 700 words, like nope, more. And also the new media, I try
231760	238320	to keep up with, I have a podcast and what all the kids are doing these days. It's hard to know
238320	243040	what's the right path to take, but it seemed like the sub-stack thing was a way to go. The finances
243040	249280	for it are channeled through the skeptic society, which is kind of my day job. So the first one,
249280	256480	Scientific American Goes Woke, I recounted my own experiences, but also I went through a bunch of
256480	262240	articles they had published recently that were clearly what most people would identify as sort of
262240	271440	far-left, woke progressive politics. And one of the most notorious or discussed pieces had to do
271440	277440	with E.O. Wilson being a racist, right? Being a scientific racist. He's the, he wrote the book
277440	285440	Sociobiology. He, you know, in a lot of ways, you know, his vision of taking evolution and seriously
285440	290720	applying it or trying to apply to human society and whatnot had always been a fraught project,
290720	295520	right? I mean, he was getting pictures of Waterport over him in the 70s at conferences.
295520	298960	Yeah. But that, could you talk a little bit about that?
298960	299360	Yeah, that was one of them.
299360	301440	Because then you wrote about that.
301440	307120	Yeah, in fact, they published this right after he died. So, you know, the body's not even cold
307120	312960	yet. And already he's being accused of being a, you know, kind of race realist, race science,
313520	319040	racist, implied racist, that kind of thing, even though he's not. So one of my other sub-stacks
319040	324080	was a long piece, kind of dissecting the claims against Wilson show that they're absolutely
324080	328080	false. But the worst thing about the Scientific American piece on him was that they provided
328080	332240	no evidence at all, no quotes from him, you know, saying something about the race,
332880	338080	racial differences in IQ, nothing like that. And in fact, there's tons of quotes from him
338080	345280	that I included in my piece where he's like, this can absolutely not be considered evidence of
345280	350800	racial differences between groups. And, you know, and this is no justification for discrimination
350800	355680	of any kind. You know, I, I abhor the, you know, kind of the old race science stuff.
355680	360240	I mean, he made it clear he doesn't go into it. So that was disturbing. They had another one on
361120	367840	how mathematics has gone, has kind of gone racist and bigoted and, I don't know, misogynistic.
368800	372800	And their evidence for this is that there are more male math professors than female
372800	378160	math professors, which is not, I mean, the explanation for that could be that, well,
378160	383040	all these old guys are just race misogynists against women. But there are other hypotheses
383040	387600	and you would think a scientific publication would say, okay, here are the three explanations for
387600	393280	why there is an asymmetry in the number of professors who are male versus female, right?
393280	398240	So you have, well, maybe they're just a bunch of misogynists, okay, maybe, maybe there's a pipeline
398240	404640	issue, right? That, that, you know, decades ago, young girls went different pathways than young
404640	408880	boys and fewer of them ended up in STEM fields. So that by the time you get to now where they're
408880	414320	being hired, there's just few of them to select for, because every professor I know is uber-liberal
414320	419440	and they're all dying to hire more women in STEM fields. So it's not like behind closed doors,
419440	423200	they're going, hey, you know, I know we said this publicly, but, you know, we just want to hire more
423200	429040	white guys. They're not doing that, right? So, you know, what are some other hypotheses here?
429040	433280	You know, the evolutionary psych one as well, there may be an interest difference that, you know,
433280	441600	men migrate boys, migrate toward toys and things and stuff. Women girls migrate more toward
442560	448640	people. And so that, that kind of sorts out later, decades later into the kind of profession
448640	455760	you prefer to go into. So women tend to migrate more toward, you know, medical degrees and biology
455760	461920	and psychology, social science, men more in the STEM fields. Now, which of those is the right
461920	467200	hypothesis? Let's just set that aside. Why can't a scientific publication even say, here are the
467200	472800	three hypotheses? Let's look at the evidence. Scientific American is either the oldest or
472800	477200	one of the very oldest continuously published magazines in the world, certainly in the US.
478560	482480	You know, and it went through phases in the 19th century where it's like, okay, yeah, it's talking
482480	487760	about scientific racism, other times it's super liberal, etc. What do you think is driving the
487760	493680	publication or, and the broader, I don't know, you know, kind of popular science community towards
494400	502000	wokeism or, you know, a lot of attention to identity politics where that becomes a controlling kind
502000	507040	of idea apart from anything that they're actually discussing. It's definitely new and it's really
507040	514080	just in the last five years. I think it coincides with the general trend in culture in general of
514160	520400	moving more in that direction. As younger people get those jobs and kind of moving up the demographic
520400	526800	scale, they're getting more and more powerful jobs to direct things the way they want. They came of
526800	533120	age, you know, when those subjects were really important. Now, there's not much any one of us
533120	538880	can do like about the George Floyd incident or this thing or that thing that we see on the news
538880	545120	constantly. But I can do something. I can say, well, look, I'm not a police chief. I'm not a
545120	551360	mayor, but I'm an editor. So I can kind of tilt the editorial decisions more toward the kinds of
551360	556560	political directions we want to take the country. And I'm doing my little share. And I think it
556560	562960	makes people feel like I'm doing something, right? Like, again, what can I do about the George Floyd
562960	567600	thing or police violence or whatever? Nothing, but I can go down in March, right? I'm going down
567600	572080	there this afternoon, and I'm going to carry my plan. Makes me feel like I'm doing something because,
572080	578400	you know, humans are very moral or moralistic. We like to moralize about things and express
578400	583840	our outrage. That kind of protest does have effect, right? Yes, it can. Absolutely. You mentioned
583840	588160	earlier on, you know, kind of being of an older vintage. We're of similar vintage. How old are
588160	595120	you? I'm 67. Okay. So is part of this just like, you know, when we call it wokeism, you know, 20
595120	601600	years ago, we would have called it political correctness. I think our parents were, you know,
601600	607200	we disappointed them or we defined ourselves against them is part of the woke conversation.
608080	614720	It's just generational warfare that is to be expected. And if not tolerated, like, you know,
614720	618880	of course, right? I mean, this is a way, you know, and I hate to say it in this
619440	624720	crude a term, but like, so you're a guy, you're, you're an old guy, you've been at on the mass
624720	628800	set of Scientific American for 20 years. And it's like, we, you know, you're not retiring,
628800	632880	you're, you're probably in better health than you were 10 years ago. And it looks like you're
632880	638480	going to live forever. Like, how the fuck do we get rid of you? Right. So yeah, have we become our
638480	644160	parents? There may be a little bit of that just kind of generational shifts. But, but, but that
644160	648000	doesn't really matter. The question is, what's the right thing to do? What's the truth? What,
648000	651440	what's the direction we want to take the country? And what do we really know about
652000	656640	this subject or that subject? Right. So, I mean, if I may, I mean, you have in one of the
656640	663360	sub stack columns, a fantastopies, where you say you're raising that is to figure out what is right,
663360	669520	not to be right. That's a powerful statement. Can you kind of expand on that a little bit? Yes.
669520	674320	Well, because, because I study belief systems for a living, and I'm aware of all the cognitive
674320	680000	biases, I can see them in myself. And so to avoid that, you just have to kind of focus on,
680560	684160	instead of looking for evidence confirmation bias to support what I already believe,
684160	688080	got to look for the counter evidence, you know, what, what are the arguments against the, the
688080	693520	belief cycle, like this issue on abortion, I'm hardcore pro choice, but I purposely solicited
693520	699280	a pro life argument and said, please give me like the 10 best arguments you have. I want to hear them,
699280	702320	right? Because I don't really know what they are, because I don't pay attention to that closely,
702320	709200	right? So we ended up doing that you have to do in general. And is, are you, is wokeism for lack of
709200	715040	a better term, but our identity politics, is it, are you worried about it? Not because, you know,
715040	721680	you lose your scientific American column as much as this means we're not focused on trying to figure
721680	727600	out what is right, what is true, what is correct, but rather we're kind of trying to create a narrative
727600	733200	and maintain things that may or may not be true. Yeah, the word woke is pretty loaded now, and
733200	738320	it's changed already. I heard John McWhorter talking about this, the linguist, you know, it used to
738320	742800	be a cold term. I mean, you and I would have been woke, probably in the 90s, because we were libertarian
742800	747600	in favor of individual freedom rights or whatever. And now that word is mean something completely
747600	752400	different. So, but in general, and I don't want to pick on scientific American, I like the people
752400	756960	I work with there and so forth. It's happening across the board, Twitter is mostly run by,
757120	761360	you know, these kind of work progressives. And, you know, most science and nature, the two most
761360	767600	prominent publications are running articles about this, you know, the and the Lancet had that cover
767600	773760	story of, you know, we have long medicine is long neglected. What was it people who give birth?
774320	779040	Right. If only we had a word for this, right, right, that kind of thing. So, you know, the
779040	783760	line, but there is a truth. I mean, like beyond the language terminology, it is true that like
783760	789840	women, you know, women who give birth were often times a medical discourse were kind of seen as
789840	795360	like bystanders. Well, yes. Right. So, there is a sociology here that's worth kind of rehearsing
795360	800640	and understanding and unpacking. Well, and I think that the second wave feminists I've talked to,
801520	808000	like Helen Joyce, Carol Tavers, they're very just worried about the kind of woke gender identity
808000	813520	movement because it's reducing women to just body parts. Like a guy can say, well, if I just
813520	819600	get breast implants and I can have a vaginoplasty made out of a piece of my skin, and I'm in, I'm
819600	824960	a woman, right? It's like, well, no, because women are not just tits and ass, right? I mean, there's
824960	832400	more to it than that. A lot more. That's a very 70s woke. Women are more than tits and ass. That's
832400	839440	like very progressive. Before we talk about, I want to talk about trans issues and abortion and
839440	843600	gun control and a couple of other things. As you've written, you know, your sub stack is
843600	848960	absolutely one of like my must reads. I appreciate it because I didn't have a subscription to
848960	853520	Scientific American and I didn't always go there and you can go long. So, and I also want to talk
853520	857840	about you have a great piece about independent media and why that's important, especially in
857840	863280	today's kind of cancel culture world. But before we get there, and this goes to that question of
863280	869280	you want to be right, you want to find out what is right but not be right, you started out, you
869280	874480	used to call yourself a libertarian. And now you say, I'm not a libertarian anymore. I'm a classical
874480	879840	liberal and just as a kind of framing device. How, how does that relate? What does that mean? And
879840	885760	how is that related to your interest in finding out what is right, not being right? Yeah, well,
885760	890720	the language does matter and the word libertarian has gotten a lot of baggage over the past quarter
890720	895200	century or so. I mean, here we are at Freedom Fest, there's quite a wide range of people and
895200	900800	they believe rather different things. But to the general public is like, oh, those are those people
900800	905600	that the preppers that want to think the world's gonna end, got to get Bitcoin and gold and guns.
905600	911280	And, you know, it's like, well, I'm not really one of those, right? And, you know, and also,
912240	916480	you know, when you called yourself a libertarian, what, what did libertarianism do?
916480	921760	I think more of a kind of an iron rand, you know, just everybody just be self-reliance, be
922480	930000	self-responsible. I guess the core would be the individual as the fundamental unit
930000	938080	of society and their autonomy and liberty to make the choices they want. Right. So,
938080	943120	this is my concern about conservatives. They, they say that, you know, we believe in liberty and
943200	947360	autonomy and so, but they don't, you know, they very much care at what consenting adults do in
947360	951600	the privacy of their bedrooms because they think it's going to leak out and cause the moral corruption
951600	957360	of the family and then the community and then the society and then the nation. And, and I think
957360	961280	that's the wrong focus because that's kind of a collectivist argument, right? The nation is over
961280	966960	the society. Well, it is true. I think it was Rick Santorum and Bill O'Reilly at various points
966960	970960	talked about how you have gay marriage and then the next thing you know, men are marrying ducks.
970960	978720	And obviously we're all engaged to waterfowl, right? So, they're not, so how, why does classical
978720	982080	liberal, like, why do you think that's a better descriptor for you? I guess I like the word.
982080	988880	I don't know. It has sort of a gravitas to it. I like it. And it, by the way historians talk about
988880	993040	the founding fathers and the, though they were classical liberals and you kind of look back
993040	1000320	and know, yeah, I agree with that. I like that. Yeah. Just as a kind of a, well, a fuzzy set,
1000320	1006240	as I call it, or a family resemblance of a concept, a schema that allows us to capture a bunch of stuff
1006800	1011440	without firm borders where, you know, that we can overlap and we're both this, but you believe
1011440	1016240	that and I believe that and that's okay. And you have a wonderful column about the Kardashian.
1016240	1022160	You use family, you know, a Wittgensteinian family resemblance concept and you use the
1022160	1026400	Kardashians, which is kind of a great way to think about it because there is something,
1027600	1031760	I don't want to say essential, but there is kind of something essential to being a Kardashian,
1031760	1037280	even if you don't have the same parents or the same genetics, right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah,
1037280	1043600	exactly. So classical liberal for you, that, you know, that kind of fuzzy set or family resemblance.
1044480	1050640	And for libertarian, you think over the past 25 years, it's become too kind of prepper, too extreme?
1050640	1055600	It's a little too, yeah, a little fringy, but also a little hyper focused on the individual. It's not
1055600	1059920	like we should be free to do absolutely anything, anytime we want. Of course, that's not true. You
1059920	1064400	can't drive on the right side of the road or the left side of the road on any given day. However,
1064400	1070560	you feel that day, right? We give up our freedoms all the time. And, you know, the, if you read the
1070640	1074720	Federalist papers, this is what they talk about all the time. We want to give people freedom,
1074720	1078320	but, you know, of course we have to have this and that. We need a standing army. So do you think
1078320	1084560	libertarian has become synonymous with anarchism? Well, that's an old mistake people used to make.
1085520	1088320	And sometimes you have to correct that. No, I think it's more affiliated with like,
1088960	1094560	you know, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, I don't know, the kind of Second Amendment fundamentalist,
1094560	1100160	you know, the gun nutters. So it's, we're going to talk about gun nuts and preppers fit into that.
1100160	1107360	And also Christians, right? Evangelical Christians. Ron Paul and Rand Paul are the Baptists.
1107360	1110960	Well, libertarians are kind of all over the map on religiosity, right?
1110960	1114880	Yeah. I mean, you guys have been surveys on this. Some of them are religious, but others
1114880	1118320	are not. No, and you have on the one hand, you have people like on Rand and then you have people
1118320	1123360	like Ron Paul. And, you know, certainly over the past 20 years, Ron Paul is probably the
1123360	1128000	single biggest factor when people say, I become libertarian. It's because they've encountered
1128000	1134800	Ron Paul. So he's a huge, you know, tributary into libertarian, the libertarian movement.
1135680	1141600	And do you think, you know, if you're, if you're kind of an evangelical Christian,
1142560	1147040	can you be, obviously, everybody can call themselves libertarian, but are you,
1147040	1153760	could you be in that family of people who, so what is the, I think kind of what's the,
1153760	1157280	what's the litmus has or what's the Maginot line there where you're like, okay,
1157280	1163040	I can't do this. I would say consistency of principles across different issues. And
1164000	1169680	I'm more critical of conservatives than libertarians on that for sure. But like when,
1169680	1175120	when DeSantis sick the government on Disney. Now, I'm not crazy about Disney's woke
1175120	1179120	progressive politics and we're going to introduce these characters into our cartoons.
1180080	1184080	Okay. Well, you know, but, but the libertarian way of dealing with that or
1184080	1187840	what should have been the old conservative way of dealing with that is, well, I'm just not going to
1187840	1193200	go to and give my money to Disney. I won't go to their films. I won't go to their parks and so on.
1193200	1197200	But DeSantis is like, no, the conservative thing to do is we're going to slap them with,
1197200	1201600	you know, with, with higher taxes and regulations. It's like, when did that become a conservative
1201600	1208080	thing? Right. So I, and I do think libertarians are, okay, where's the consistency say for foreign
1208080	1212480	policy? You know, don't we have a moral obligation to help people that are under
1213600	1217520	suppression of civil liberties around the world? You know, sometimes we do, sometimes we
1217520	1221840	where's the balance there? I don't know. I guess as a fuzzy set, I would say classical liberalism
1221840	1225840	and libertarianism, they're either in the same or they're too very overlapping.
1225840	1229280	Yeah. No, and you're not alone in this. And I'm curious, you know,
1229280	1235280	Penn Gillette obviously famously also kind of voice similar misgivings. And it's interesting
1235280	1240160	when high profile libertarians like yourself starts to say, you know what, I don't know,
1240160	1246400	I kind of want to be in a different club. And again, I wonder if part of it is generational.
1246400	1250400	I mean, because when you say, you know, kind of like second amendment people,
1250400	1256400	do you feel like the movement is more focused on gun rights now than it was in 1990?
1257520	1263520	Now it is, yes, because of all the mass public shootings and the government response to this.
1263520	1268080	And that drives up gun sales. You know, ironically, Obama probably did more for
1268080	1273600	gun sales than anybody, even though he actually never did much. Right, right. No, he actually,
1273600	1279440	in his first term, he allowed people to carry weapons on Amtrak at a national park. So he
1279440	1284400	actually was liberalizing, but people certainly fundraised against the idea that he was a gun
1284400	1290000	grabber. Well, we've seen this kind of consistency, my body, my choice, in the two different issues
1290000	1296320	of abortion and vaccines. And each side is like, you know, pretty hypocritical about this.
1296320	1304160	Do you feel with COVID? Is that also a place where, you know, libertarian, libertarian skepticism
1304160	1309520	towards state power is one thing. And then, you know, but you also want good science and
1309520	1313840	good public policy. And then there was a lot within the libertarian movement, I think,
1313920	1319760	there was a lot of not simply being anti-vaccine mandates, but being anti-vaccine.
1319760	1324880	See here, I would say the libertarian position would be, I don't like mandates. And yeah,
1324880	1330640	okay, that's just a principle, government forcing you to do something. But on the other hand, to say,
1330640	1338000	well, but if the vaccines really work, and the CDC and the Fauci are saying we should all get them,
1338000	1341680	if I go along with that, then the next step is going to be the mandates. And I don't want that.
1341680	1346720	So I'm going to be skeptical of the science. Right. No, no, no. It's okay to just say, look,
1346720	1351040	we should all do this. And by the way, most of us really should get vaccinated. They work.
1352000	1355920	And there is within your conception of libertarianism, there is a public, I mean,
1355920	1361520	you're not an anarchist, you believe the state has legitimacy in certain roles and that there are,
1361520	1367440	and you know, I would argue maybe COVID is not that case, but that if there is a communicable
1367440	1372000	disease, and there is a vaccine that prevents me from giving it to you, whether you asked for it
1372000	1377200	or not, there's a role for the state to say, now you have to get vaccinated. In the same way,
1377200	1383440	you have to pay taxes. Now you're really, yeah, I know we need a standing army, we need a police
1383440	1389280	force and, you know, and so forth to protect our freedoms and our property rights and so on,
1389280	1393280	how are you going to do that? And if you say, well, I don't, I'm not participating. I'm not
1393280	1401040	paying taxes. You didn't sign that social contract. So you'll free ride. So you would say you did not,
1401040	1407680	you did not change, libertarianism changed, maybe or something like that. Well, let's,
1407680	1414000	let's talk about your abortion pieces, because this is also something I'm, so I'm 50, I'm about to
1414000	1420560	turn 59. And when I joined Reason in 93, and I had grown up reading Reason. So, and that's how I
1420560	1426640	became a libertarian. And I would say everybody I knew who was a libertarian basically said either
1426640	1432720	they were pro-choice affirmatively that abortion, at least through a certain point in pregnancy,
1433360	1438800	was a woman's right. And it was nobody's business and that it was not a morally bad issue. It might
1438800	1445760	be morally complicated. And that even people who were pro-life would say, you know, this is not
1445760	1451840	something this state should be involved in. That no longer seems to be the case among libertarians.
1451840	1456560	And in, even though it still seems to be the case in the public at large, only about 20%
1456560	1461120	according to Gallup or against abortion under all circumstances, that's been very consistent
1461120	1467760	since Roe was decided. It's religion. Yes. I mean, Reagan was pro-choice until, as I understand it,
1467760	1472400	Jerry Bowell sat him down and said, I can deliver you millions of votes, but you got to get,
1472880	1478560	yeah, I'm not sure if that's, I mean, he definitely signed a, you know, a very liberal law in California
1478560	1483520	as governor and then at various points recanted. And I'm not sure if the motivation for that. But
1484080	1489760	you know, what you, you say, and I found this really fascinating because you said I am pro-choice
1490480	1495520	and you started out definitely very, you know, pro-abortion basically through the term
1496480	1502160	pregnancy. And now you are still pro-choice, but it's more complicated. Can you, can you make the
1502160	1509520	case for, you know, why abortion should be allowed? Okay. Well, first of all, I'll give a nod to the
1509520	1516640	pro-lifers that it is a human life that's developing, you know, from the day one, it's a potential human
1516640	1521760	life. It's not a legal person and so forth. And so, you know, here is, you know, what Richard
1521840	1526480	Dawkins calls the tyranny of the discontinuous mind. If you, if you're stuck in black and white,
1526480	1531280	on or off, it's only two sides. There's no continuum. You're going to get very confused
1531280	1535600	in your thinking about these kinds of issues, right? So you have to draw the line somewhere.
1535600	1541200	You know, why is, why is a 17-year-old not allowed to whatever vote or something that an 18-year-old
1541200	1546160	can on the next day? Okay. Well, it's because the law has to draw the line somewhere. Science
1546160	1551440	doesn't have that kind of demarcation, right? So we do those kinds of things all the time and,
1551440	1559200	and so I'm willing to say you're right, it's a life. But the female, the mother is also a life
1559200	1564000	and it's also a legal person and far more advanced than the two-day-old fetus or the
1564000	1568240	three-month-old fetus or whatever. So, you know, as Thomas Sowell says, there are no solutions,
1568240	1572560	there's just compromises. And when you have conflicting rights, something has to give,
1572560	1577520	like the trans athletes, you know, women's rights, trans rights, the conflict when men
1577520	1581760	want to compete in women's division. Something has to go. You can't have both. So we just have
1581760	1586640	to make a decision whose rights should we favor in this case. So in that case, I said, well,
1586640	1592560	the adult woman should be given the nod. Just in principle, you know, individual autonomy and
1592560	1599440	liberty and control over your own body, that's fundamental. Even while saying, but don't put
1599440	1604400	yourself in that position where you have to make that choice. It's not a good choice to have to
1604400	1609840	make, you know, it happens. So, okay, we should be your choice to do it if you want to. But, you
1609840	1616240	know, as I tell my students, you know, two words, birth control, right, just be, you know, be prepared.
1616240	1621760	Are you satisfied with the, you know, or not satisfied, but how do you feel about the Dobs
1621760	1626720	decision, which gets rid of the right of abortion at the national level? So now you had invoked
1626720	1631760	the Federalist Papers, just thinking about federalism. And now we have 50 states that are
1631760	1637600	laboratories of democracy. It sounds good in principle, right? But because I know a lot of
1637600	1643840	pro-lifers and they're all pretty much evangelical Christians. And, you know, overturning row is
1643840	1649760	just the first step. They want to ban it every state. They will chase people down to the bitter end
1649760	1656480	to get them to stop having abortions and there any conditions. And that scares me. And so it's,
1656480	1661440	do you worry that on the flip side of that, that, you know, some states are now going,
1661440	1667360	that are pro-life or pro-choice are going to, you know, where they might have had regulation of
1667360	1676560	abortion in, you know, the after viability or, you know, later in the pregnancy are going to be
1676560	1681520	like, okay, as a response to, you know, if we're California and we're neighboring a state that
1681520	1685040	is getting rid of all, you know, life begins at the moment of conception, we're going to say
1685840	1691360	abortion is allowed until the moment of birth. Yeah. Right. So there's extremists on both sides.
1691360	1695040	Yeah. So the pro-choicers that say, should be okay to abort your fetus the day before you're
1695040	1700000	supposed to give birth. Of course that's wrong. You know, and again, you get away from the binary
1700000	1704160	thinking you then you can see a spectrum. Yeah. Okay. So let's just draw the line. I know three
1704160	1709120	months in Germany is three months, maybe four months. Right. Yeah. And then, okay, so that's
1709200	1715360	like the age 17 to 18. Okay. There. Right there. That's the time. Do you feel like we, I mean,
1715360	1719600	and this is interesting when you're talking about kind of gradient thinking or, you know,
1719600	1724720	things on a continuum, that to me, and we've talked about postmodernism versus, you know,
1724720	1730160	kind of modernism or whatever in the past, but it's, you know, in the 21st century, it seems like
1730160	1735680	on certain levels, we're much more comfortable with gradients and a kind of range of options.
1735680	1741040	And we realize that things are kind of continuous. It's not, even though this is the digital age,
1741040	1745920	it's not, you know, black and white, it's not one in zero, right? Right. But on other levels, we
1745920	1749920	seem to be, you know, I mean, and the abortion question is, you know, seems to be front and
1749920	1755600	center on this of like, no, it is either murder at all stages or it is not. Right. And that just
1755600	1761440	seems like a terrible way to kind of be engaging reality. Exactly. Right. And again, on the consistency
1761520	1766640	issue, if, you know, if conservatives are really pro-life, you know, they don't seem to be very
1766640	1771520	pro-life after you're born, right? It's just a George Carlin's riff. Right. You know, after that,
1771520	1775600	you're on your own, you know. Now, of course, Christians will, because he does that riff about,
1775600	1781040	you know, no preschool support, no school lunches, no help for single moms and on and on and on.
1781040	1784240	Of course, the conservatives will say, no, no, no, it's, we just don't want the government
1784240	1788880	providing those, that's the job of religion or whatever. And then he throws in the little line
1788880	1794000	until you become military age. And then we're interested in you again. Okay. So there's some
1794000	1799040	truth to that humor. Right. And so again, that consistency, you know, if you really care. Why
1799040	1804480	is consistency so important to you? And I mean, this is true of libertarians, right? You know,
1804480	1810320	post even, you know, laps libertarians or whatever, like, you know, and when I talk to most people,
1810320	1813760	like, I'm always like, well, I got, you know, is this logical? Does it make sense? Does it work
1813760	1817760	all the way through? Most people are like, I don't give a shit. Like, this is what I believe here.
1817760	1822320	This is what I believe here. And they don't have to be consistent. Yeah. Well, because
1822960	1829440	if you have a principle that's based on some factual basis that it should be applied consistently,
1829440	1833920	as consistently as possible, with the recognition, there may be a few exceptions here and there. But
1833920	1838880	that's the whole point of having a principle is that you apply it evenly across the board, right?
1839520	1844880	And so again, I just think, you know, people are inconsistent about that. For obvious reasons,
1844880	1849200	you know, I just want what's good for me and my tribe. And, you know, it's like,
1849200	1855360	it's like the issue over that the private prayer that the high school football coach gave. Right.
1855360	1861680	50 yards. The private prayer on the 50 on the 50 players around him. And he's a Christian. Okay.
1861680	1865520	And of course, Christian is going, yes, this is great. You know, the Supreme Court voted in his
1865520	1871120	favor. Yeah, well, what if we was down there saying Alou Akbar? Yeah. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, we're
1871120	1877200	not going to allow that. Oh, okay. So what's the principle here? Yeah, thankfully, as this is what
1877200	1883760	Satanists exist for, they're already filing to do satanic prayers on the 50 yard line. And, you
1883760	1888240	know, this also like takes us away from the question of like, okay, well, it's football,
1888240	1893200	like why are high schools playing football? I don't know, you know, like I was a taxpayer,
1893200	1897600	I'm kind of like, I they can't even teach our kids to read. And now they're giving them brain
1897600	1902960	damage or whatever. That's a separate issue. Well, let's, let's talk about trans athletes and
1902960	1909040	what is a woman you wrote. Most recently, you looked at Matt Walsh's documentary, what is a
1909040	1914720	woman and you know, he is a right wing troll. He, you know, wants to make fun of feminists,
1914720	1919680	he wants to make fun of gender activists and things like that. But the documentary you found
1919680	1923920	pretty compelling and interesting. Can you talk a bit about that? I was expecting something of a
1924000	1930960	Borat like send up or a Milo Yiannopoulos kind of troll. And it wasn't that bad. I've seen him
1930960	1937200	elsewhere. And yes, he's definitely in the kind of that Ben Shapiro classical conservative issues.
1937200	1943520	And I disagree with him on most of his beliefs. But I, but what made the film powerful is he's
1943520	1948560	not saying the things that are crazy. It's the people he's interviewing. And it's not like he,
1949120	1953760	like Borat, he gets a couple of guys drunk and they start yammering away about the blacks and
1953760	1959120	the Jews or whatever. Here's the underbelly of America. He's not doing anything like that.
1959120	1963680	He's going to the, you know, here's a professor of gender studies. You know, what is a woman?
1963680	1967680	It's right there in your title, gender women studies. You know, what is a woman? This guy
1967680	1972640	can't answer the question. Okay. So what, what's going on here? I mean, these are smart people.
1973280	1979040	So the problem here, I think is we're back to the postmodernism. Like I learned from you that,
1979040	1984240	you know, the original postmodernism was really good. It's kind of a form of skepticism.
1984240	1988960	Let's challenge the mainstream dogmas back in the 40s and 50s and see, yeah, that's good.
1988960	1994160	Right. And then it kind of just run, run a muck and goes too far. And I think that's what's happened
1994160	2000320	here where, and then this particular professor said, you're just trying to tag me with an essentialist
2000320	2005520	definition of gender. It's like, yeah, that's right. Because to have a fuzzy set or a family
2005520	2010320	resemblance, you need some agreed upon words that we're going to use of characteristics that
2010320	2015120	define this thing. And that's the essence of, you know, so it's the gametes, right? Biologists
2015120	2020400	say, well, a woman and a man is defined by the gametes. You either make it sperm or you make
2020400	2024560	it eggs. That's it. And everything else follows from that. And if you look under the hood, there's
2024560	2030240	a thousand different differences in the body that go toward sperm production and development and so
2030240	2035120	on, or egg production and development of the fetus and whatnot. And it's not just whatever
2035120	2040960	my inner feelings are. And that would be kind of the most extreme of postmodernism. Whatever I
2040960	2046480	feel is the truth, it's my truth. And that's essentially what Walsh's film shows, that these
2046480	2052480	people have gone that far. Whatever it is you say it is, that's what it is. And why do you think
2052480	2057920	the trans issue, you've also written about how, you know, when these pulverized alts came out,
2057920	2063440	I guess earlier this year, it was kind of stunning that if you look at older, you know, the silent
2063440	2072320	generation, the percentage of people who identify as LGBT, so lesbian, gay, bi and trans, very flat,
2072320	2079920	baby boomers, flat, Gen X, flat, millennials picks up a little bit. And then Gen Z, people are basically
2079920	2088800	about under like 25. It is, you know, 10% of the population now says that they are LGBT up from
2088800	2097440	like half of that in 2017. What's going on with the, you know, with an interest in trans,
2097440	2104880	being trans? Do you think it is that people are, there are more trans people now, or is this all
2104880	2109840	kind of a rhetorical gesture? And how do you deal with this? Yeah, well, we don't know for sure,
2109840	2116080	because it's so new. What is the normal background rate of gender dysphoria, where you feel like
2116080	2121120	from a very young age that you were born in the wrong body. Now, before recently, it was like
2121120	2129360	maybe one tenth of 1%, or even less, a 20th of 1%, just vanishingly small. And now all of a sudden,
2129360	2135680	you have, you know, these spikes of like 4,000% increase in this one age core, like age 14 to
2135680	2143280	19, you know, that kind of thing. And so that would suggest the social contagion hypothesis
2143280	2149120	that is it spreads amongst a community of people that are either in the same classroom in school,
2149120	2155840	or they're on an online community. And they get a lot of social proof and positive feedback if they
2155840	2164640	say I'm this, you know, by pan on whatever. And I had a student a couple of years ago, who in the
2164640	2170080	middle of class, this was a small seminar, so we talked a lot. And she said, I've decided I'm a boy,
2170080	2174560	this is what I feel like I'm going to be a man. And she changed her name, and everybody called her
2174560	2180000	the name, including me, cut her hair, change her clothes, and so on. And then but but in the
2180000	2185200	conversations that ensued, it was clear to me, she doesn't want to be a man, she wants to be trans.
2185840	2189680	That's the thing to be. And the moment you announce that is like, Oh, my God, what's that?
2189680	2195040	And, you know, a thousand questions from the other students. And it's like, I see. So now the other
2195120	2200400	hypothesis is that societies become more liberal, tolerant, open, some more people are coming out.
2200400	2205680	Right. Now that is true with the with, I think, gays and lesbians, although now we're having a
2205680	2211040	backlash, say some of the lesbians and gays that, you know, where are all the lesbians now? And
2211040	2217200	their concern, and I agree, this is a concern, is that what if you're a 13, 14 year old, young
2218240	2224240	man or young boy, and you find yourself attracted to other boys. And somebody tells you that's
2224240	2229920	because inside you're a girl, you're not actually gay. When in fact, this person's most likely
2229920	2235120	going to grow up to be gay, which is now okay. That's accepted, right? Now, another thing I've
2235120	2241200	been thinking about is, is it that because the LGBTQ or the gay marriage, same sex marriage,
2241200	2247360	they happen so fast from 2011, when the majority of Americans finally tipped over to above 50%
2247360	2252720	in support to 2015, the Supreme Court decision to make it the law of the land, that was pretty
2252720	2257680	fast. That's probably the fastest rights revolution ever. So it could be the next, you know, sort of
2257680	2262640	cohorts, like, well, what are we going to champion? You know, what's next, you know, there's animal
2262640	2270480	rights, but there's gender rights. And so LGBTQ is one thing. So the focus has primarily been about
2270480	2275920	who you are attracted to. And that used to be against the law, you can't be attracted to the
2275920	2279920	same sex people, you can't have sex with that was illegal. People were fired in the government.
2280640	2286080	Thousands were fired for that. And now that's okay. So they've kind of shifted it to okay, what about
2286080	2292640	who you identify as a woman, that's kind of become maybe the next rights revolution and people,
2292640	2297440	again, they want to be engaged in something that's meaningful in life. There's a next rights
2297440	2303600	revolution there. And I'm going to go for that. In, you know, when we were younger, and I'm thinking
2303600	2309360	in the 70s and whatnot, being trans and it was back then it was short for transsexual. And it
2309360	2314400	always implied surgical, like gender reassignment surgery. And I'm thinking of people like the
2314400	2320080	tennis player Renee Richards, who had been Richard Raskin, I believe, who joined the ladies
2320080	2325520	professional tennis tour. But it was very much about, you know, physicality. I mean, obviously,
2325520	2329600	there were hormone treatments and things like that. But it was like, if you were a man and you
2329600	2334960	wanted to become a woman, you got the surgery. And that's what defined it. And you were saying
2334960	2341200	before that like the equipment isn't necessarily the definition of being male or female. Today's
2341200	2347440	trans, it seems to be much more about performing a kind of almost public sexuality. Yes, right.
2347440	2351600	How does that, yeah, how does that factor into any of this? Well, again, I think that supports the
2351600	2356560	social contagion hypothesis. The whole point of doing it is to make it public. Or else, why would
2356560	2362960	you do it? Whereas before it was, you know, a private thing, except for the public figures
2362960	2368400	like Renee Richards, you know, this is just something you do because that's what you need to do.
2369120	2374000	And, you know, our mutual friend, Deirdre McCluskey, you know, was Donald McCluskey and
2374000	2379200	transitioned to great cost to her personal life. This wasn't like she's getting love bombed by
2379200	2384800	everybody. Quite the contrary, and did it anyway, and still does it because that's who she is. Okay,
2385440	2390880	that exists. That's a real thing. But is it true that, I mean, I've been hearing stories and reading
2390960	2395440	accounts, you know, like half the class or a quarter of the class of a high school class says
2395440	2403360	I'm trans or bi or pan or there's something. So it also looks like being cisgender straight is about
2403360	2410560	the boringest thing you could be. And you don't want to be that. And actually, a number of gay and
2410560	2417600	lesbian friends of mine, you know, they like gay men, white gay men feel like they are even
2417600	2422160	more square than heterosexuals, because heterosexuals are talking about kinks and poly
2422160	2427360	and stuff like that. And lesbians, you know, because lesbians have always been a smaller
2427360	2432000	percentage of the population. And I know people like Abigail Schreyer, who I've talked to, I know
2432000	2438720	you have, who's quite controversial in a lot of things, but she argues that particularly girls
2438720	2444000	who would grow up to be lesbian, their parents, I mean, this is kind of a complicated argument. But I
2444560	2452080	I kind of buy into it that their parents are actually almost homophobic, and they would rather
2452080	2458560	that their child be trans than to be lesbian, which seems I mean, I guess what I'm asking you
2459680	2465440	is, I mean, you have witnessed and participated in like this vast kind of rights revolution over
2465440	2471360	the past 50 years, where society is so much more profoundly libertarian than we could have imagined
2471760	2478800	in the bicentennial. And I picked that not because of bi, but because it's like 76, right?
2478800	2483920	But it's like you can, you know, you can be gay, you can be straight, you can be anything, and it
2483920	2489600	does not seem to be an impediment to any kind of social success, any kind of professional
2489600	2494240	success. Yeah, so that's progress, right? It really is. Yeah, right. But, you know, just from
2494240	2500720	a scientist's perspective, what is the real number? Yeah. And we don't know. But I suspect that
2500720	2504560	current numbers we're seeing now are greatly exaggerated. I mean, back when the Kinsey report
2504560	2513040	came out, you know, he reported what 10% of the guys are gay. Right. And I mean, which in a study
2513040	2518800	that was clearly poorly designed, right, or kind of like cooked data. Yeah. I mean, the real number
2518800	2522960	is probably something like three to 5%. And then it's also curious to know what, why are there
2522960	2528240	not as many lesbians? It looks like maybe that how many lesbians are is like half of how many gay
2528240	2535760	guys are. Why is that, you know, that there could be some social aspects. How much, this is kind of
2535760	2541040	a bizarre question, but we are at freedom fest, so we can talk about whatever we want. But how,
2541600	2547920	how much of sexual orientation do you think is kind of baked in, you know, when you come out of
2547920	2554080	the womb, you know, and how much of it is susceptible to kind of social influence?
2554800	2560400	Well, I think most of it's baked in biologically, genetically, you know, in the womb, chemistry,
2560400	2564880	and so on. After that, of course, it could be tweaked a little bit, but, you know, the vast
2564880	2572080	majority of people that identify, you know, are cisgender, also cisgender. And yes, society could,
2572080	2576000	you know, the, you know, the whole blue and pink thing, that used to be reversed like a century
2576000	2580720	and a half ago, I forget, maybe like 1890s or something, you know, that the blue and pink thing
2580720	2587440	was different than it is now. And by that, you mean pink was associated with men, and blue was,
2587440	2594800	you know. I forget why that was, but in any case, but it's not like the colors of the toys are going
2594800	2599920	to make the little boy more masculine. We've all seen the pictures of Hammingway in a dress as a
2599920	2604960	kid, and it's like his latent homosexuality had nothing to do with the way he was raised,
2605520	2609040	right, or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I do think the born this way, I think
2610160	2614080	the other interesting thing about the current trans movement is that the gay community fought for
2614080	2620960	decades for a kind of biological determinism. I wasn't born this way. It's not a lifestyle choice.
2620960	2626080	Your little reparative programs are not going to work, you can't de-convert me. If I just had the
2626080	2632160	right woman, then I would know, you know, how to be straight or anything like that. So, and the
2632160	2637440	reason for that also is that if you're born that way, then you're a protected class, you're right
2637440	2642400	stand. But now the trans movement seems to be saying, you could be anything you want, anytime
2642400	2647040	you want, you can change from day to day, you can change genders, you know, you can change who
2647040	2653600	you're attracted to. It's totally fluid. And that's actually scary for gays, because it's like, well,
2653600	2657680	hang on, now we're going to get pushed back from the conservatives, they're going to go, oh,
2657680	2661280	so you are not that born that way. In that case, we can fix you.
2661280	2667200	And all of this exists when we're talking about rights or the individual's relationship to
2667200	2672960	government or something is totally separate. Like, so, I mean, because regardless of why people are
2672960	2677600	trans or identify as trans or gay or straight or whatever, it doesn't, that doesn't imply
2677600	2681280	the government should discriminate against them in any way, shape or form.
2681280	2684800	Yeah, of course, right. Trans rights are human rights. Absolutely. You should not be fired for
2684880	2689440	being trans. I mean, if that's the only reason, then no, for the same reason,
2689440	2695600	gays should have been fired decades ago. With trans athletes, you've written about
2696400	2702000	this. And on a certain level, and particularly at the highest levels possible, when we're talking
2702000	2708320	about Olympic athletes or NCAA athletes or something, it's such a small number of people,
2708320	2713120	it almost seems wrong to be looking at that and then kind of generalizing backwards. Because by
2713120	2718640	definition, these people are extreme outliers in performance and everything. But how do you,
2718640	2726400	you know, what, what is your sense of like, what is fair for, you know, trans athletes competing
2726400	2734080	against, you know, biological male or female? Well, so if you're born male, and you go through
2734080	2741200	puberty, there are so many changes that are substantive. If you compare to female body
2741200	2747440	development in puberty, after that's happened, and the international swimming body just made
2747440	2752240	this decision based on that argument that it's too late, there's no amount of testosterone
2752240	2758320	suppression you're going to take to even the playing field with the average amount of testosterone
2758320	2762800	that men have versus women, if we could just lower those after puberty, it's too late. I mean,
2762800	2767600	all the big changes have been made, the bones are bigger and denser, the the sinews and muscles
2767600	2773280	and ligaments and tendons are all different, the VO2 uptake for your lungs, your oxygen capacity,
2773280	2778960	and on and on and on, just like a thousand different differences. And now it's true, there are, again,
2778960	2785360	two overlapping sets. There are some women who are much more physically strong and so on than some men,
2785360	2788400	but that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about, you know, kind of the average,
2788400	2794720	the two means. Although sometimes they get kicked out of a limb, you know, say track and field and
2794720	2799280	things like that. Yes, well, you know, the where people have naturally dopers. Well, those were
2799280	2806560	dopers, right? But I'm sorry, I'm blanking on her name now, the South African runner who's a woman,
2807280	2812400	or is always identified as a woman and who's fantastic, but has elevated levels of testosterone
2812400	2818320	and other things, can't compete internationally unless she reduces that. Is that fair? I mean,
2818320	2821920	it might be that you need to have some kind of system. So you have to draw the line somewhere,
2821920	2827280	right? You know, so I mean, so on average, there's a pretty vast differences between average
2827280	2831360	testosterone levels. And it's not just testosterone. That's kind of the big one, right? So you're going
2831360	2836160	to have, but you have two overlapping bell curves. So some of the higher women are going to be higher
2836160	2841520	than some of the lower men. Okay. But and so then you have to make it so the outliers, well, this
2841520	2849040	woman is right up against the upper limit. And well, okay, so this is the rule we made. So we got a,
2849040	2854880	you know, because, should we be looking at a world beyond what, like, why do we have male and
2854880	2860320	female sports competitions? Well, because if we didn't, there'd be no women in sports. You know,
2860320	2864400	I mean, they just wouldn't, you are stepping in it everywhere. You're like, side show,
2864400	2869360	Bob hitting breaks everywhere you go. Have you seen the doubles match in tennis where I think
2869360	2875840	it's Federer and the doll on opposite sides and each of them has a top woman. I think one of them
2876720	2881360	was the William Sisters and one of the other top ones. And the women can't even get a racket on
2881360	2885520	the male serve. I mean, they can't, I mean, they're like diving and rolling on the grass and they
2885520	2890400	can't even hit it. That's what would happen. There would be no women players at all. That would be
2890400	2895680	the end of women's sports. That's just the way it is. That's reality. You know, I'm not talking
2895680	2900160	about chess or something like this, but these physical sports like that, you know, when I was
2900160	2905440	directing Race Across America in the 90s. Explain what that was because that's a phenomenal kind
2905520	2911440	of event, which, yeah, it's worth rehearsing. Yeah. So in 1982, me and three other guys started
2911440	2916400	this race called Great American Bike Race, later changed to Race Across America Ram. So this is
2916400	2921760	a nonstop coast to coast race. Each rider, a cyclist has a support crew that follows them.
2922400	2928880	The clock starts and stops when you're done. And so you can skip sleep or whatever. And so this
2928880	2933840	was because it was the Reagan 80s. We were all worried about nuclear annihilation and we were
2933840	2939040	coped out of our minds. So we were just going to ride our bikes across America. This is the rise of
2939040	2945200	the Ironman Trabzon and the Adidarod dog sled race. Let's just go crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway,
2945200	2950160	so by the night, of course, we had women right away enter the race and we had a women's division
2950160	2956480	and a women's prize and plaques and rings and all that stuff. And but in 93 and 94, I had,
2956480	2961120	when I was race director, I had two women, a Shauna Hogan and Muffy Ritz, who were better than
2961120	2966880	all of the men for the first thousand miles, all the way into Colorado. And there was talk like,
2966880	2972800	well, maybe a woman could win the race, right? And if I recall correctly, I think with the
2972800	2978160	anthropologist Ashley Montague, at various points in the early 70s, hypothesized that women
2979040	2985840	were designed by evolution to be better ultra marathoners than men. It's kind of true in
2986400	2991600	the longer people race, gender falls apart. It falls, it becomes less important, but you're
2991600	2996960	considered. If it's, yeah, but not say something like a high speed race. Right. Like 200 front
2996960	3002480	stage is pretty long. Yeah. But women wouldn't last, you know, the first 20 minutes. So what happened
3002480	3006800	in that case? So they're leading up through Colorado and then what happened? Yeah, what happened
3006800	3010880	while she got caught and then, you know, finished over a day behind the winning men
3011840	3017520	at the winning two or three men beat her. And it's just strength. Ultimately, it's just every
3017520	3022960	little bit of difference in the bodies that it just made a difference over 10 to nine days rather
3022960	3028640	than the first three days. So, you know, but I even asked the women, you know, would you like a,
3029200	3034240	just have one division and you compete against them? No, no, because it's not fair. Right.
3034240	3037840	Guys are just on everything stronger. So let me go back to something where we're talking about
3038000	3043920	the start of this. You know, there seems to be a tendency, Ia Wilson was a, you know, a conventional
3043920	3048880	liberal, you know, and towards the end of his life, you know, he's very big on things like climate
3048880	3054320	change and all of that. Like he subscribed to a lot of, you know, kind of bromides of progressive
3054320	3061440	liberal policy. But within the concept of socio biology and whatnot, there does seem to be a
3061440	3068240	real tension on, you know, broadly on the left where it's like we, we can create the world however
3068240	3074160	we want. Like we believe in evolution because we believe in science and we are not those rubes in
3074160	3079280	Arkansas, you know, who are Christian, who are biblical, literalists and reject science, we believe
3079280	3087120	in science. But then, you know, Wilson's theories kind of suggest that no, like if you take evolution
3087120	3093600	seriously, there are going to be limits on how much you can engineer humanity. And there are going
3093600	3099920	to be different groups even will select for different properties and characteristics that
3099920	3106080	are going to have real world outcomes. Is that a tension within kind of the science community
3106080	3111840	and either the right or the left? Well, yes, but, but Picker points out in his book, The Blank Slate,
3111840	3118400	that in fact, the opposite is true that of course, biology and genetics is part of it.
3118960	3124320	The environment can't operate on nothing. It has to operate on a physical system,
3124320	3130560	which is the brain, which is designed by your genes, made of proteins. And so it's not possible
3130560	3135840	that it can't have any effect. And so you have to understand what the effects are before you can
3135920	3140720	re-engineer society to make it fair. You know, Thomas Soule wrote a book about this,
3140720	3146720	this kind of conflicting worldviews and that is kind of utopian worldview where it's all blank
3146720	3152640	slates and we can re-engineer society to make it perfectly equal. We'll always fail because we're
3152640	3157040	not perfectly equal. You know, we have different interests, different physical characteristics
3157040	3162480	and skills and so on. Well, that's just the way it is. So there you need kind of a more general
3162480	3166880	principle that says wherever you fall on the bell curve of whatever it is we're measuring,
3167680	3173360	you should have the opportunity to do whatever it is you want without any barriers based on
3173360	3177760	these protected classes that you didn't choose, right? Kind of a Rawlsian argument. You don't know
3177760	3181920	which, what your running speed is going to be or what your IQ is going to be. So we have to make
3181920	3186480	it fair that there, you have access to all the different jobs and the chips fall where they may.
3187520	3191760	Wilson at the end of his life, maybe the last decade or so, endorsed group
3191760	3200960	selection. Now group selection is more supported by liberals in the left because it's this idea that
3201760	3208080	we as a group can be the target of selection and make things happen that the individual can't.
3208080	3212240	Now most evolutionary biologists, people like Dawkins and Pinker say now this is not true.
3212240	3218400	There's no evidence for this and it's still the individual genome of the individual is the one
3218880	3222320	that is the target of natural selection. But I just thought that was interesting toward the
3222320	3226240	ends of his life. It was a more liberal kind of argument he was making. And I mean, Steven J.
3226240	3232800	Gould was, I guess what I'm getting at is that you, science, I mean people and maybe it's libertarians
3232800	3239040	or scientists want to believe that I am arguing from science and reality into my politics. But
3239040	3245680	perhaps these are separate spheres. Not necessarily. I'm willing to leap over
3245680	3250720	humans while separating is or not. We do it all the time. I mean, the way things are,
3250720	3256560	we have to structure society in a way based on human nature. And again, just fairness should be
3256560	3262880	our goal. Why fairness? Well, again, kind of a Rawlsian argument that you don't know where you're
3262880	3267520	going to be. So we have to make it as fair as possible. And then you do whatever you want.
3267520	3271680	And we're not going to have equal outcomes. This is the problem today is that the drive
3271680	3275520	toward equal outcomes. No, no, it because we're never going to get equal outcomes.
3276240	3279520	Just for a thousand different reasons. So just equal opportunities is the goal.
3280960	3286960	But yeah, anyway, so, but yeah, so there is a tension of people like Gould and Wilson on the
3286960	3292240	left about, well, what about genetics? This is just a misunderstanding. It says Pinker and I
3292240	3297280	agree with him that, you know, you're just misreading this thing like it. If it's genetic,
3297280	3300720	you can't change it. No, in fact, that's not true. Right.
3301920	3306480	Let's talk about gun control because you've written and this is probably one of the issues
3306480	3312800	where you depart most from a kind of libertarian orthodoxy. But you believe in gun control.
3313680	3320800	And can you make the briefcase for that? And, you know, why do libertarian or maybe not libertarians,
3320800	3325360	let's say, Second Amendment fundamentalists in your phrase, where are they wrong?
3325920	3330720	Well, society is filled with collective action problems. We need to solve as a group.
3330720	3335120	And to do that, you have to get, you know, a majority and then they all have to chip in
3335120	3340640	like paying taxes. Again, it's just most libertarians are not anarchists and they agree, okay, we need
3340640	3345280	property rights and therefore we have to have a court system to support your property rights.
3345280	3349520	And we need a police force and the prison system and a military. All of a sudden,
3349520	3354240	you have a big government that you got to fund with taxes. All right. How is this any different?
3354240	3360240	Why is guns separate? In my opinion, it's because guns are almost totemic as a proxy
3360240	3366480	for something else. This kind of focus on individual autonomy, freedom, self-defense,
3366480	3371600	liberty, freedom from the government, that sort of thing. Over and above all the other
3371600	3376960	concessions you've already made, you know, okay, I'm going to pay for police and fire and military
3376960	3383200	and so on. And if I don't pay my taxes, they're coming to get me at some point. I'll get the
3383200	3387680	letters and then, you know, and so forth. But eventually men with guns will come to your house.
3387680	3394400	Yeah. Right. Why you've signed on for that, you know, so. But I think that's why they want the guns
3394400	3400640	because well, I know. But yeah, but why would okay. So yeah, right. So but why would you support
3400640	3405280	that? Because you've already agreed that well, we need somebody to protect my property rights
3405280	3409120	through a court system that I'm willing to pay for. Well, how about the guy over there? He doesn't
3409120	3414400	want to pay for it. Well, then send men with guns over there and he has guns. You know, this this
3414400	3421280	lead in a way this kind of fanaticism about just arm everybody. You know, is a way of saying the
3421280	3426960	United States is a failed state. And it's just everybody's on their own. And we don't really
3426960	3432880	trust the police or the military to do their job. We don't trust our institutions. We give up. It's
3432880	3437360	like we're living in Somalia. Well, no, we're not living in Somalia. I can see if you live there
3437360	3442240	while you want a gun or something. And I do get that, you know, if I'm an African American living
3442240	3446080	in inner city, and I don't trust the police, because they're not trustworthy, and they can't get
3446080	3451440	there in time. And there's violence around me, I should have a gun. So again, not by an area,
3451440	3455840	you know, I'm not anti gun at all. I grew up with guns. My stepfather was a hunter. So I had a BB gun
3455840	3460480	and a pellet gun, then a 20 gauge shotgun, then a 12 gauge shotgun. And for 20 years, I had a hand
3460480	3466960	gun at my house in Altadena. And, you know, but it's just we're facing a social problem. How do
3466960	3471440	we solve it? The carnage is, you know, more people die by guns than by cars.
3471440	3477120	And is that I mean, one of the things that is true, I mean, gun homicides have been going down,
3477120	3482240	you know, since the mid 90s. So there's slight upticks and things like that. But the suicides,
3482240	3486640	you know, I mean, that's like more than half of gun deaths, right? So that's part of what your
3486640	3491920	argument is, right? Yeah, right. Yeah. Right. So how about just how about just regulation in the form
3491920	3498880	of more better background checks, right? And we already have laws about, you know, men with
3498880	3504720	restraining orders against their significant other. I mean, when a woman is murdered, it's like 90% of
3504720	3510880	is by a significant other after they broke up or got divorced or child custody issues, something
3510880	3516320	like that. You know, why have the gun there? If he already has a restraining order, he can't buy a gun,
3516720	3521520	a lot of those laws are already in place, just enforce them, you know, the gun show loophole.
3521520	3526160	Are you sympathetic to the argument that, yeah, I mean, this is the point, we have tons of gun
3526160	3531280	laws and they don't seem to be, you know, they're in the same way that we, you know, you can't be
3531280	3538320	utopian about certain things like school shootings are horrible, but they are not, they're not common
3538320	3542720	enough where that's where you make all the laws. To be honest, man, I'm ready to give up on the whole
3542720	3546480	thing and just say fuck it. I mean, it's just, just let everybody, everybody have their guns
3546480	3550560	because there's already 400 million guns, right? 120 guns for every 100 people. So we're talking
3550560	3554960	about 400 million guns in America. We're not going to get them back. You know, if the government
3554960	3560800	said we're doing a buyback or a take back program, it'd be like Waco every day. Yeah, Ruby Ridd.
3560800	3567120	It's fascinating too that actually as more guns are in circulation, it's in a fewer percentage
3567120	3574800	of households, which, so fewer people are having, owning more guns. And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
3574800	3580640	particularly, you know, focused on the gun issue, but that seems like an interesting social change.
3580640	3584480	Right. And I'm not sure what accounts for it, or if that's good or bad or different.
3584480	3587920	Yeah. You know, in the examples that I use, everybody uses, you know,
3588480	3593200	Austria and Australia, other countries have done these things and it worked. Yeah, but they're
3593200	3597520	smaller, a genius population. They didn't have very many guns in the first place. They don't have
3597520	3603040	the same culture that we have about guns, second amendment, all that. I don't know. I don't know
3603040	3607840	how, I don't know what the solution is. It seems like somebody should do something and I know how
3607840	3612320	libertarians respond to that. Yeah, the government, we don't want the government to do more. It's
3612320	3618720	already doing too much. Okay. But again, like back to the analogy with cars, pretty much everybody's
3618720	3622560	signed off in the idea, well, cars should be regulated. You know, seatbelts are good,
3622560	3627520	and airbags are good. And, you know, that even though the number of car deaths still hovers
3627520	3634160	like 35 to 40,000 a year, but, but, but if you adjust it by the miles driven, cars are much safer
3634160	3639040	now. Right. They used to be. And why is that government regulation? You have to have seatbelts.
3639040	3643440	Oh, you're speaking heresy now. I know. I know. That government can never do anything good.
3643440	3647680	I don't see how that would have happened just by private enterprise.
3648720	3654560	Yeah. That's, I mean, that's a, it's a serious challenge to a kind of knee jerk libertarianism,
3654560	3659600	which I think, you know, people who still call themselves libertarians like myself,
3659600	3663040	I need to take up that mantle and sometimes I can and sometimes I can't. Yeah.
3664080	3668000	I mean, but just one last point, collective action problem, like the motorcycle helmet thing,
3668000	3672560	you know, and back when that happened, you know, libertarians, a lot of motorcycle, I'm not going
3672560	3676960	to do it. Right. Or they would wear these, you know, little nothing helmets. You know, I get that.
3677760	3683120	I totally get that. But, you know, the way our medical system operates, eventually,
3683120	3686720	you know, you and I, you have to pay for these accidents and these head injuries.
3686720	3693120	Do you, I'm assuming you grew up riding bicycles without helmets. And then when did you start,
3693120	3696400	when you were a bike racer? Yes. Well, that happened in the accident.
3696400	3700480	But are they effective? Yes. The current helmets are totally effective. Yes.
3700480	3706640	Because they're designed on, based on motorcycle helmet design. It's a, it's a compressed polystyrene
3707120	3714400	shell that on impact, it absorbs like 95% of the impact. And they work. The bike helmets before
3714400	3719760	that. These are the old leather strap ones. Completely worthless. Yeah. At the, at the
3719760	3723040	den show when I worked for, at the bike show, when I worked for Bell helmets, they were one of my
3723040	3728080	sponsors. We used to take one of those leather hair nets and have the people come by, okay,
3728080	3732720	put your fist inside there. Yeah. Now slam it against that brick wall. Like, no, I'm not,
3732720	3737840	are you kidding me? Yeah. Now do it with one of these helmets. No problem. Right. It's like,
3737840	3741600	that's your head, right? But was that, you know, was that innovation driven by
3742240	3748240	superior technology and information or was it by mandate? This is, well, by mandate because
3749520	3755200	enough people were died in the tour de France from head injuries that the tour itself said,
3755200	3760160	hey, we need to mandate helmets. So, and when I was working for Bell at the time, they were saying,
3760160	3764640	they already had the bell shell, which was this white geeky looking helmet. And they've had this
3764640	3769840	for like 15 years. No one was buying it. No one serious cyclists would not wear it. So I said,
3769840	3774640	you need to design it to look like a leather hair net. So it's got to be black and, you know, thin
3774640	3780560	with some air, some air vents and maybe a little gold trim. It's got to look cool. And you got to
3780560	3786800	get pros to wear it. And the people go, all right, you know, and that helped, but it wasn't until it
3786880	3792640	was mandated. And again, this collective action problem, most cyclists wanted to wear helmets
3792640	3797680	because they know it's safer. But when some of them don't wear it, they get a slight advantage.
3797680	3802000	It's like, well, I got to, it's like doping. I got to do it because that guy's doing it, right?
3802000	3805920	And then once it's mandated, okay, no one gets to take the drug, everyone has to wear a helmet.
3805920	3810080	And it's like, okay, good. I want to take you down a slight detour. Now that we're talking about the
3810080	3814400	tour de France and also about technology and innovation and doping and things like that.
3815040	3819840	Greg LeMond was the first American to win the tour de France. And he's like a fascinating figure
3819840	3826320	who also embraced every technological innovation he could. And there was one tour de France,
3826320	3832320	in particular, where he beat Laurent Fignon, who eschewed technology. It was like, oh, that's
3832320	3839680	like American stupidity and things like that, lost by seconds over, you know, a 21 day, you know,
3840400	3849280	race. How important is, you know, our, is like understanding technology and innovation and
3849280	3855440	kind of pushing that forward? How, you know, how is the best way to make that happen or more people
3855440	3861680	embrace that? Well, it happens naturally, it kind of trickles down from the pro ranks to serious,
3862320	3867920	you know, weekend athletes and people have more money now and the bikes are better than they used
3867920	3872880	to be. They really do get better. Like I get a new bike every three to four years. And they,
3872880	3876960	every one of them is really better than the previous one. You know, maybe just a little bit,
3876960	3882080	just 1%, 2% you can feel the difference. And you know, disc brakes instead of the rim brakes,
3882080	3887840	they're better, electronic shifting is better. And it just kind of starts to add up. But because
3887840	3893360	the market, because of capitalism, you know, what would have been say a $15,000, $20,000 bike I
3893360	3898480	could get for like 6,500 now, because so many people are buying them because they really are
3898480	3902640	better and you see all the pros racing. Do you think this is part of the problem of our current
3902640	3907520	moment? And now I'm leaping from kind of technological innovation and bike racing or something to,
3907520	3913920	in general, I mean, the world is so much better than it was 50 years ago, but we don't seem to
3913920	3918240	want to recognize that or acknowledge that. And is that a problem? Well, you don't see it. It's
3918240	3924880	hard to see. Because it happens slow enough, like again, the bike thing, you know, if I was a regular
3925600	3930240	weekend warrior or whatever, and maybe I'd buy a bike every 10 years, and oh, okay, I really see it.
3930240	3934400	But when you buy him incrementally, he's like watching your kid grow. You see the pictures
3934400	3940080	from three years ago. Oh, wow, you got big. You don't notice it, right? And, you know, that's hard
3940080	3946080	to see. You know, Pinker talks about that. And Matt really does, you know, you know, just the cost
3946160	3951840	of how many hours a week you have to work to get your dinner or your light. You know, Matt has
3951840	3957360	those charts. Yeah. And it's like, oh, wow, I mean, it's just just very incrementally, very slowly
3957360	3962400	over decades and centuries. And, you know, from day to day, we don't see that. Because our senses
3962400	3968400	are geared to immediate environment, you know, the next day, the next week, that's about it. That's
3968400	3973840	all we care about. Because we're really designed to pay attention to threats. So the negativity
3973840	3980720	bias. So we focus on bad things rather than the good things, and also immediate threats. And the
3980720	3985280	way the world works, because of second law and entropy, is that, you know, good things happen
3985280	3990480	mostly very gradually, slowly over long periods of time. But bad things can happen. Boom. You know,
3990480	3995200	you get the stroke or the heart attack, or the company goes out of business, the stock collapses,
3995200	4000560	the country falls. These things happen very quickly. So we're tuned to looking for those
4000560	4005840	kind of threats. Because those are the things that took us out. Just to close out the tour to
4005840	4012160	France, you know, beginning with Le Monde and going through Lance Armstrong. This, to me, I
4012160	4016800	found it interesting that, you know, Americans didn't care about bike racing. It was like
4016800	4021520	ridiculously European and all of that. And it was kind of like soccer in the 70s and 80s. It
4021520	4028000	like picked up. And then Lance Armstrong, and you know, and people after Americans after him who were
4028080	4035840	caught doping and cheating and whatnot after protesting that they hadn't. You know, now we
4035840	4041040	don't care about bike racing in the same way, right? And is that, you know, has that happened
4041040	4045760	all over society? Where I mean, we live in an era now, things are getting better and better,
4045760	4052320	but our trust and confidence in institutions and in society have been declining. You know,
4052560	4058480	how do we deal with that kind of dynamic? Interesting analogy. Yeah, well, there are
4058480	4064320	Americans in the tour this year, but they're not doing that well. It definitely punctured the,
4064320	4070080	I mean, there was a growing interest in things like professional cycling and certainly the tour.
4071120	4075920	You know, and I guess, and it's even broader than, you know, just America. I mean, the revelation of,
4076480	4080960	you know, profound doping, which in a way goes back to the very early beginning of the tour.
4080960	4085600	There were doping controversies that vary from the beginning, and I'm kind of big on performance
4085600	4090160	enhancing drugs. I kind of, you know, I don't just let everybody do it. Well, or yeah, I mean,
4090160	4095680	but then you do have rules and the, but you know, yeah, yeah, I'm with you. And I mean, I guess if
4095680	4102000	it didn't trickle down to junior athletes that are up and coming and you get that again, that you
4102000	4106160	get that kind of collective action problem and like, well, I don't want to do it, but that guy's
4106160	4110160	doing it and I want to get to his level and so on. And that's how it happens. That's how it
4110160	4114320	happened with Lance. I mean, it's unfortunate. He was not able to articulate that very clearly
4114320	4120560	on Oprah's couch there that, you know, when he didn't start any of this, he just did it better
4120560	4125680	than everybody else was doing it. And he hired the top guy and said, you can't work for anybody
4125680	4132240	else to give you pile of money to an exclusive. And, and, you know, but there's, you know, when
4132240	4136320	he was first starting and he was getting his ass kicked and, you know, it's like, why is this
4136320	4140400	happening? And somebody said, see that guy there and that guy there, they're doping. They're using
4140400	4144480	this, they're using that. They're going to that guy over there. He's the top doping. Oh, okay.
4145120	4152560	And then, so here's the choice. I either do it or I'm out. Right. And then, you know, you don't
4152560	4156320	get to fulfill your dreams. So they do it. You know, it's a, it's a rational choice, I think.
4156320	4161360	And there's, I mean, I guess in, in humans, would you say in evolution, there's this, there are
4161360	4167280	these two tendencies. One is that we want excellence, but then we also, and we're willing to do almost
4167280	4171920	anything for it, but then we are very disappointed, if not in ourselves and our heroes, when they
4171920	4178240	actually do what we're kind of urging them to do, which is take, you know, pay any price in order
4178240	4183040	to become the best or something. Right. Yeah, I'm not sure you have to put it at such extremes,
4183040	4187680	though, because you have spectacular performances that you, where you don't need the drugs,
4187680	4191760	maybe, but again, you just have to, you have to have good enforcement. I mean, there was an interesting
4191760	4197360	thing when Rafa won the French Open this year, and then it came out like a week later that his,
4197360	4201920	his foot was all shot up with all kinds of drugs and stuff because he has some weird
4201920	4206640	problem there. And a couple of cyclists were commenting, boy, if we did that, we'd be kicked out
4206640	4213120	and we'd be shamed and humiliated in the front pages of the newspapers. And it is true, the doping
4213120	4218080	agencies like the, you know, that governs sports are terrible and very arbitrary and just incompetent,
4218080	4224480	I mean, in many ways. And I can recall Olympic swimmers, you know, losing their gold medals
4224480	4229440	because they had taken the wrong kind of cold medication or whatever. Whereas the NFL, you
4229440	4235440	know, their program was, you know, the doping agency has to contact the player's agent and then
4235440	4240400	set a date to test it like in three weeks. Okay, no problem. We'll clear it all out.
4240400	4247440	Let's close up by talking about Skeptic, the Skeptic Society, Skeptic Magazine, 30 years
4247440	4252560	and running. You know, explain what the Skeptic Society is about.
4253280	4257520	Well, we're a 501c3 nonprofit. Science education is our thing, critical thinking,
4258240	4264080	rationality, you know, reason, that there, you know, commitment to universal realism,
4264080	4268480	there is a reality, we can know something about it, albeit not perfectly, you know, that kind of
4268560	4276080	enlightenment ideals of the search for objective truth through tried and true methods, you know,
4276080	4281760	that's kind of our thing. And just, we just try to tackle subjects that are important.
4281760	4286240	Right. And as you see with the abortion issue, trans issue, next one on race, you know, we've
4286240	4291520	already done astrology, big foot, UFOs, you can only do those things so much. And it's like, okay,
4291520	4298080	we pretty much know what the story is there. It's amazing how the Loch Ness sponsor and
4298080	4302240	the Bermuda Triangle, just people don't care about those anymore.
4302240	4305360	No, I know they're out, but UFOs are back because of the UAP thing.
4305360	4311040	Absolutely. Yeah. But and although it seems like this is the end of UFOs, right, like it's obvious
4311040	4315760	that it's, you know, it's not extraterrestrial. It should be obvious to everybody, although it's
4315760	4322080	still pretty popular that ancient alien show is on its 18th season. I mean, it's up there with the
4322080	4327600	apprentice or something, right? But so I want to ask you, is this a good time to be a skeptic
4328400	4334080	in terms of like, does rationality and again, understanding that it's imperfect, we all have,
4334080	4338560	you know, our cognitive bias and all of that kind of stuff. Is there more broadly speaking,
4338560	4344640	are we more rational than we were 50 years ago? Or is that never the way to really think about
4344640	4350720	things? This is a big debate in cognitive psych circles of to what extent are we naturally gullible
4350720	4355440	and we fall for things like cults and scams, things like that, because people do fall for those
4355440	4360240	things. But the counter argument to that is, in fact, most people don't fall for cults and scams.
4360240	4366400	The reason these scammers have to send out, you know, a million emails to get one sucker is because
4366400	4371440	most people are not suckers, right? And, you know, most people who join religious sex and groups
4371440	4377360	and self-help groups, and they go to Tony Robbins, you know, weekend, they're not joining cults. And
4377360	4381600	if the thing turned into a cult, they probably would leave, right? So we only hear, there's an
4381600	4386880	availability here, we only hear about the ones, you know, the Jonestown and Waco and, you know,
4386880	4393280	sort of the crazy ones, the, you know, Heaven's Gate. But those are really rare, right? And so I've
4393280	4399120	been thinking about this, you know, to what extent this is called default to truth. You know, when
4399120	4404640	you tell me something, I just tend to believe you because I know you, I don't have time to fact check
4404640	4410320	everything you tell me. So there's kind of a social trust that most of the time works, right?
4410320	4415840	And I was just telling people about the story I read of this guy, a cyclist, who, do you know what
4415840	4421120	Strava is? You know, you post your rides on this app. And then on Strava, there's these King of the
4421120	4425520	Mountain KOM, every segment is timed. And, you know, there's thousands of people have done that
4425520	4429280	segment. And you can see what the average speed was. You try to go out there and break that guy's
4429280	4436160	time order. Well, so there was this guy who turns out he was like a total con man fraud,
4436160	4441520	you know, an impersonator. I mean, he said he had, he was a CEO of a major corporation. He had been
4441520	4448080	in IPO startups and he was in special forces and on and on and on. And he was a professional bike
4448080	4453440	racer on this European team. And the people wherever he was living in California, I think,
4453520	4459520	you know, no one bothered to check until he posted a time on a Strava KOM that somebody
4459520	4464720	saw and went, that's not possible. The speed was like what a top European pro would do. And this
4464720	4469600	guy's like 45 years old is like, wait a minute, I'm going to look into what else he's done, right?
4469600	4474720	But, but if I just heard, you know, I was in the special forces, okay, I mean, I wouldn't even know
4474720	4480080	how to check if you told me that. Who would I call this was, you know, Nick, really a Navy
4480080	4485600	seal guy? I wouldn't even know, right? So I think for the most part, we're not gullible so much as
4485600	4492000	the trust thing works pretty well most of the time. But evolution did not eliminate all the
4492000	4498400	psychopaths and the free riders and the liars and the deceivers and the cheaters, because that would
4498400	4504880	take too much energy to get rid of every last one, right? So a society can tolerate like a small
4504880	4511760	percentage of, of con men and liars and cheaters and thieves and so on, and still function reasonably
4511760	4521040	well. What's your favorite cult? Well, I guess this is going to sound crazy, the cult of Trump
4521040	4525680	at the moment. Yeah, I mean, I really think it is something like that. You know, the fit just
4525680	4532160	even just yesterday, just after the latest January six hearings where it's obvious to anyone with
4532160	4537440	eyes and ears that, you know, he knew he lost and he was just to make a grab for power and you
4537440	4543760	still see some of these Republican toadies. Yeah, tons of Republicans, people running for office
4543760	4549760	saying that the election was stolen. Right now, it could be there just opportunists saying, I got
4549760	4554320	to say whatever I think the boss wants me to say so that he gives me his endorsement so I can win
4554320	4559040	the election. I don't really believe it. That's possible. But what concerns me is that, you know,
4559120	4563200	like 60% of self identified Republicans say they, and they have nothing to gain. They just,
4563920	4568560	yeah, I think there was, I think rigged, right? I think it was rigged. That's a kind of conspiracy
4568560	4574240	theory and maybe even a cult that's not on the fringe. What's the, you know, what's the status
4574240	4577840	of skepticism? It's more important than ever. Because, you know, most of these conspiracy
4577840	4583760	theories that I've used to deal with, you know, the JFK or 9-11, they're pretty fringy, right?
4583760	4589600	And this one is, you know, right there at the top of the government. And I'm worried this could
4589600	4593840	threaten our democracy, right? If enough people believe this, they won't accept the outcome of
4593840	4598640	the next election. Do you worry going into the midterms by all accounts that Democrats are going
4598640	4604720	to lose big for a variety of historical reasons? President, when the president is unpopular in
4604720	4610880	his first midterm election, they, you know, he loses 25 to 35 seats, etc. Democrats are already
4610880	4615600	starting to rehearse how these elections, you know, the Supreme Court is not legitimate. The
4616240	4620160	Republicans have stripped people of voting rights all over the place. Do you worry that?
4620160	4624560	I do. So we're going to go from a right-wing conspiracy theory about
4624560	4630480	illegitimate elections to a democratic one. Yes. Well, the Dems have always had conspiracy
4630480	4633920	theories whenever they lost. If you just go back to the last 50 years in every election,
4635040	4638880	this one was slightly different because it ended up at the Capitol. But,
4639520	4644880	but yes, of course, they're going to, I'm worried that if a Republican genuinely wins,
4645520	4651200	say in 24, whoever it is, maybe DeSantis, hopefully not Trump, that the Dems won't accept it. They'll
4651200	4656320	just say, nah, we know they were doing this behind the scenes and the gerrymandering this and that.
4656320	4662400	This was all illegal. And then what? You know, then we're in trouble. Well, although I suspect
4662400	4668160	skeptic magazine circulation is going to go up. I don't know. Or it's going to go out of business.
4668160	4672480	One or the other, right? I find most people, they're not that interested in the truth. You have
4672480	4676720	to kind of remind them this is why this is important. I feel like Liz Cheney sometimes,
4676720	4683120	you know, standing up there going, you know, what actually happened matters, reality matters, right?
4683120	4687760	And I mean, what a funny thing. I mean, she's my hero. And I don't agree with her on almost
4687760	4693840	everything, politics, right? You know, she's pro-life. Do you hope, I mean, well, do you hope
4693840	4698800	people are becoming more independent minded? I mean, that would help. I like Andrew Yang's
4698800	4703520	idea of a third, a viable third party. Of course, he's not the first, forward party. I like this
4703520	4709840	idea. And I'm not a big UBI guy. But you know, I think we, the duopoly, he talks about the duopoly,
4709840	4714480	you know, Germany, where my wife's from, they have what, six or seven parties that are viable
4714480	4720960	parties. No one gets more than 50%. I mean, no one gets more than really 20, 25%. That's good.
4720960	4724160	That sounds great. That's a good note to end on. Michael Shermer, thanks for talking.
4724160	4726240	You're welcome. Thanks for having me.
