Checking Todd Hardin, PhD/Concept Creep and the Growing Problem of Linguistic Abuse.txt
 Dr. Todd addresses the concept of "concept creep" in the English language, particularly how certain words have evolved over time to encompass a broader range of meanings or behaviors (horizontally) and how the threshold for what qualifies under these concepts has lowered (vertically). He uses the example of bullying to illustrate this point, noting that what was once understood as a clear-cut behavior involving physical or verbal threat now includes more subtle actions that could be perceived as hurtful, such as sitting next to someone's friends and causing emotional distress.

He argues that this shift in meaning can lead to miscommunication and power struggles within language, where terms are often manipulated to create a maximum emotional impact or to gain victim status. This manipulation of language can be seen in phrases like "spiritually raped," which dilutes the gravity of actual rape by expanding its definition beyond its original intended meaning.

Dr. Todd emphasizes the importance of using words precisely and advises that as Christians, we should strive for clarity and agreement on terms to maintain effective communication. He encourages viewers to challenge vague or manipulative language use by asking for definitions and understanding motivations in conversations.

He concludes with a plea to stop abusing language, noting its divine origin and purpose, and invites his audience to engage with him further through subscribing, hitting the bell icon for notifications, and suggesting topics for future videos. His message is a call to respect and preserve the integrity of language in both personal interactions and public discourse.
