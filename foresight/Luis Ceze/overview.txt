1. **Stack-based Languages and Recursion**: Stack-based languages support recursion, which is a procedure calling itself directly or indirectly. To support recursion, code must be re-entrant, meaning it can have simultaneous instantiations of a procedure. This requires the ability to maintain separate states for each instantiation, including arguments, local variables, and a return address.

2. **Procedure State**: The state for a given procedure includes all the information necessary for its execution, which is stored in a stack frame. A stack frame holds the arguments passed to the function, local variables, and temporary space, as well as the return address.

3. **Call Chain**: An example call chain shows `u` calling `who`, which in turn calls `mi` twice. Each procedure call adds a new stack frame to the stack, with its own base pointer and local variables.

4. **Stack Frame Management**:
   - When entering a procedure, its stack frame is created by adjusting the stack pointer (ESP) and setting the base pointer (EBP) to point to the bottom of the frame.
   - Before returning from a procedure, the stack frame is cleaned up, often restoring the previous values of EBP and ESP.

5. **Example Execution**:
   - Initially, we are in the `u` stack frame.
   - Calling `who` adds its stack frame to the stack.
   - Calling `mi` for the first time adds another stack frame, saving the previous EBP and ESP values.
   - `mi` can call itself recursively, adding new stack frames each time.
   - After executing a return from the last `mi` call, its stack frame is removed, restoring the previous EBP and ESP values.
   - The next return from `mi` removes another stack frame, returning to `who`.
   - Finally, after returning from `who`, only the `u` stack frame remains on the stack.

6. **Summary**: Stack-based languages manage multiple procedure invocations by creating and destroying stack frames dynamically. Each frame holds the context for a procedure call, allowing for recursion and the separation of local states. The base pointer (EBP) and stack pointer (ESP) are used to navigate and manage these frames during execution, with careful restoration of their values upon entering and returning from procedures to ensure correct program behavior.
