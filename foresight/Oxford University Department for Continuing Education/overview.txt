 The classical definition of knowledge as "justified true belief" suggests that to know something, one must have a belief that is both true and justified. However, this definition has been challenged by examples like Gettier cases, which show that even if a belief is true and justified, it might not constitute knowledge if the reasons for that belief do not align with the facts that make the belief true.

In the case of the Golf GTI, you may believe that I own one because you've seen me driving such a car. Your belief is both justified (you have evidence) and true (I do indeed own a Golf GTI). However, if the specific car you saw me driving is not mine but belongs to a friend, you do not actually know that I own a Golf GTI; you only believed you knew based on insufficient evidence.

Gettier cases demonstrate that knowledge requires more than justified true belief; it also requires that the conditions that justify your belief align with the conditions that make your belief true. This additional requirement is often referred to as "safety" or "propositional reasoning," which ensures that if your belief is true, it's because the proposition you believe is actually the case, not just coincidentally true due to luck or an accidental chain of events.

In summary, while the classical definition provides a useful framework for understanding knowledge, Gettier cases and similar arguments suggest that knowledge requires a stronger connection between belief, justification, and truth than merely meeting all three conditions. The exact nature of this additional requirement is still a topic of debate in epistemology.
