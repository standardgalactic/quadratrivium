200320	205560	Byddwn we find it, if we find it, then we're going to know more about it.
205760	208280	That's what we're doing. We've postulated it,
208480	213400	we've said this is on our list of things that exist, at least as a hypothesis.
213600	217120	Now we want to test that hypothesis and see whether it's true.
217320	221600	Metaphysics asked questions like what's there and what's its nature.
221800	226200	Now, many of these questions are questions of science.
226240	230680	Ond felly answered those on whether it exists, and what it is like.
230700	232820	These are questions for science.
232840	235940	Questions like, Coresation?
235960	239740	What is Coresation, does causation exist?
239760	243320	The relation between cause and effect.
243340	245400	That's not a question for science.
245420	248920	The scientists must assume that causation exists.
248940	251540	Philosophers ask, does it?
251560	253380	And what's the nature of causation?
253380	255380	Côr, could causation go backwards?
255380	260380	For example, could there be a cause that happens after its effect?
261380	269380	Is causation a relation between events or between objects or between facts
269380	272380	or what are the relator of the causal relation?
272380	276380	So these are all questions of metaphysics.
279380	282380	Epistemology on the other hand is the study of knowledge.

311780	315040	but what you hope to be is the one that you don't believe it is due to the latter.
315040	317080	But the study in what is the case, how it is how it is that it is and how it is
317080	319440	and what you know best to be the case, are two different questions
319500	322480	that yo u hwnf cael maen nhw gyda kin I a physigyn
322480	326140	the other to do it with epistemology.
326140	327700	Epistemology looks at what can we know!
327740	330200	Can we for example know that the sun will rise tomorrow?
330200	333140	Do you remember the motto we looked at
333140	334520	induction, when we started doing logic?
334520	337040	Can we know it
337040	344280	Well, we don't know for certain must knowledge be certain knowledge or could it be the case
344280	350640	that we know something that we don't know we know? Do you see what I mean? What is knowledge
350640	357320	like? So, actually, I should have put that here. What is knowledge? What can we know and
357320	364840	how can we know it? So, for example, if there are moral values, we don't know it by sensory
364880	373880	perception. I never see right and wrong, certainly not through my eyes or through tactile sense
373880	378800	or anything like that. So, there must be some other way. How do we know that two plus two
378800	385560	equals four? Again, you don't see that that's the case. How do you know that all swans are
385560	390040	white? I know they're not, but let's pretend for a minute. How do you know that all ravens
390040	396560	are black? That's a better one. Well, let's forget Albino ones. I know what you're like.
396560	402600	I could see you thinking that. How do we know that given that if you're going to say that
402600	406640	all ravens are white, you're talking about all ravens, even the ones that you've never
406640	413440	seen, even the ones that nobody has ever seen, even the ones on Mars. If there are ravens
413440	418840	on Mars, you're saying all ravens are black includes those ravens on Mars. Well, how can
418840	424600	you know that? Do you see what I mean? So, there are two different questions as what is
424600	430240	knowledge in the first place? Must we know that we know something or can we know something
430240	435760	that we don't know that we know? What's it got to do with justification? What's it got
435760	441720	to do with belief, et cetera? And how can we know these things? So, that's the distinction
441720	447640	between metaphysics. Metaphysics is to do with truth and what is the case and what's
447640	456000	its nature. Epistemology is to do with knowledge, justification, belief, and how we can know
456000	461120	whatever it is that we do know. So, that's the main distinction. Let me just pour myself
461120	475840	some H2O. H2O. What did I say earlier? I suddenly remembered that I heard myself saying
475840	482600	something false. Well, right. Okay, let's look at ontology, the study of what there is
482600	488200	or what exists. Okay, one question. I said earlier that there are many things that questions
488200	493320	of what is the case and what is its nature that are questions for science. But questions
493320	500480	like does God exist? In the God delusion, if any of you have read it, Richard Dawkins
500480	507440	claims that this is a scientific hypothesis like any other. Well, if that's true, it must
507440	514280	be possible to conduct experiments, observations, in order to determine the existence of God.
514280	519880	I have no idea what experiments or observations he has in mind, but I actually don't think
519880	524160	this is a question for science. I think Dawkins is wrong to think this is a straightforward
524160	533480	scientific hypothesis. I think this is a question for philosophy. Evidence, our reasons
533480	542200	for thinking God exists take the form of arguments rather than evidence or observations. For example,
542200	548160	the most obvious argument is the one I used earlier. God is a theoretical entity. He's
548160	554480	postulated to explain the existence of the universe. That's the simplest argument. It's
554480	560240	the argument that people have used from the beginning of time. Other people use different
560240	565160	arguments. For example, the moral argument. You don't need God to explain the existence
565160	572880	of the physical world, but how come there exist people like us who are capable of rationality,
572880	580400	who reason, who have free will, who make choices, and in particular make moral choices? People
580400	586520	like us who value things, who see right and wrong, good and bad, beautiful and ugly, and
586520	595800	things like that. Physics can't see right and wrong, good or bad, etc. This is not the
595800	602840	sort of thing that physics or any physical science can investigate. But you might think
602840	609000	that God is the explanation for the existence of things like that. Or you might deny that.
609000	613400	You might say, no, you don't need God to explain right and wrong. You can easily explain right
613400	622000	and wrong by peel to evolutionary biology. So altruism is a question of either kin support
622000	629040	or if I scratch your back, you'll scratch mine, etc. So if you look at Dawkins' chapter,
629040	634360	I think it's four, but I may be wrong about that. He offers four or five arguments for
634360	642440	how you can explain morality without God. So does God exist? Lots of different arguments
642440	647560	for the existence of God, lots of different rejections of those arguments, lots of different
647560	652520	comebacks on those rejections, and philosophers are going to have a job for at least a couple
652520	658440	of hundred years, I think. I think the God's illusion is far from the final word on it. But
658440	663200	there are other questions like that. That's a biggie, obviously, but there are other biggies.
663200	671000	Do moral values exist? Is there right and wrong? Does right, it's really a property of an
671000	680280	action being right or wrong? Or can we reduce the idea of being right to something some
680280	688040	people would say natural like happiness? So the utilitarians want to reduce happiness
688040	692840	to the, sorry, reduce right and wrong to the idea of the greatest happiness to the
692840	698080	greatest number. So there's no more to right or wrong than how many people you make happy
698080	703920	by an action that you do. Now what you're doing there is you're reducing one thing to
703920	708720	another thing. So here's something we don't understand right and wrong, and we think that
708720	713800	it needs an explanation, and we're tempted to postulate God for it maybe. But on the
713800	718880	other hand, if we can say, well, actually, we don't have an explanation for that, but
718880	725440	there's actually no more to that than this in particular combinations, and we do have
725440	729080	an explanation for this, or at least this is something for which we can think that there'd
729080	734880	be a much easier explanation than God. So on the grounds of Occam's razor, given two
734880	741000	explanations, both of which work, you always go for the simpler one. If you can explain
741000	747400	happiness, and you can reduce morality to happiness, then you haven't got a problem
747400	755040	with morality. You don't need to postulate God. See what I mean? So you might, I mean,
755040	761400	some people try and reduce the idea of God to, I mean, actually Dawkins again does this.
761400	766800	He thinks that God is the idea we all want for security, for a father figure, something
766800	775440	to rely on. So he's reducing God to that. The utilitarians try and reduce moral values
775440	781720	to happiness. Kant, on the other hand, isn't a reductionist. He thinks right and wrong
781720	787600	exist, that the moral law exists in and of itself, and that it's quite different from
787600	794240	anything else. So if you remember last week, for Kant, a moral action is an action that's
794240	800920	carried out because of reverence for the moral law. It can't be said to be anything else.
800920	805240	It can't be said to be something that, just as a matter of fact, produces the greatest
805240	811120	happiness or the greatest number. And reverence for the moral law, says Kant, is not something
811120	817080	you can reduce to anything else, something easier to understand. Another example of this
817080	821560	would be mental states. I thought I was going to come to mental states, but I say it's not
821560	831280	on there, so I'll put it in anyway. Do mental states exist? Well, what are mental states?
831280	837280	Well, mental states divide into two. There are the so-called propositional attitudes. So
837280	844400	attitudes to propositions, things like beliefs. You can't have a belief unless it's a belief
844400	855240	about something, can you? So I believe that Anne is wearing sort of maroon. I believe Anne's
855240	860880	wearing maroon. I believe when Anna's got a necklace on, somebody's got a lovely pink
860880	867520	jumper on just in front of Anna. Futious sort of colour. Okay, all of those beliefs have
867520	874360	a content, but there are other propositional attitudes, so I can have a desire to warn
874360	879680	towards the same content. Desire is a different attitude, but I could have the desire that
879680	887280	Anna's wearing a necklace, or I could wish that Anne is wearing, all the same names, is
887280	894240	wearing maroon. I could also intend that Anna's wearing maroon. I could set out to make
894240	899280	sure she wears maroon today, because I want to use her as an example. So these are lots
899280	905120	of different attitudes to contents, and you can get the same attitude and different contents
905120	911880	and the same content and different attitudes. So that's one type of mental state, the so-called
911880	918640	propositional attitudes. The other type is the so-called qualitative states. So when
918640	925600	I looked at this lady's lovely future-coloured cardigan, I have a certain experience. Okay,
925600	930040	there's something that it's like for me to see that cardigan. There's something that
930040	935480	it's like for me to see these chairs. There's something it's like for me to be in pain or
935480	940800	to feel a tickle or something like that. And these are qualitative states. They're states
940800	947800	that have a quality to them. So I'm sure you can do your own rough and ready distinction
947800	954720	now into states that have a certain raw feel to them and states that are attitudes to propositions.
955440	962560	Why do we think these exist? Well, how could I possibly explain your behaviour without citing
962560	968960	desires, beliefs, intentions, hopes, fears? You know, why did she suddenly get up and leave
968960	976080	the room? Answer, because she suddenly realised it was the wrong lecture. She suddenly realised
976080	980360	it was the wrong lecture. So she had a belief about what the right lecture was. She suddenly
980360	986600	came to believe that this was the wrong lecture. So she formed an intention to leave the room.
986600	992160	So in order to explain your behaviour, I postulate all sorts of beliefs and desires. But here's another
992160	1002160	little story. Woodlice. Why do woodlice congregate under rocks and things? Tell me. It's dark.
1002160	1009200	Why do woodlice congregate where it's dark? Because they want to be safe or something
1009200	1021440	like that. OK. And they believe it's safe under rocks. OK. You're a bit reluctant to attribute beliefs, are you?
1021440	1035400	Well, don't give my story away. Yep, absolutely. OK. When we first see a woodlice and certainly if
1035480	1040600	we're speaking to a child or something like that, we would use belief, desire, psychology
1040600	1046840	to explain woodlice behaviour, because that's what comes very easily to us. So woodlice believe
1046840	1052320	that it's safe under rocks and they want to be safe so they intend to go under rocks. As
1052320	1057520	a matter of fact, the correct explanation of woodlice behaviour is that they embody a
1057520	1064680	mechanism such that when it's dry around them, they move. And they move in a speed that's
1064680	1072160	determined by how dry it is around them. And as it gets damper, they come to a halt.
1072160	1075680	And incidentally, they move in whatever direction they happen to be pointed. They don't sort
1075680	1080800	of turn around and make for that rock. If they're standing in that direction, there's a rock
1080800	1084800	over there, they'll go for that one. Except they're not going for that one, are they? They're
1084800	1089960	being pushed by the dryness. Now, once you know that explanation, have I got it right?
1090360	1096480	That's right. I wasn't going to use technical terminology, but they are. Okay, so that's
1096480	1101160	the proper explanation of woodlice behaviour. Once you know about canises like this, you
1101160	1105880	can explain the behaviour of any woodlouse anywhere at all, as long as it's a normal
1105880	1112560	woodlouse, anywhere at all at any time. Once you know that, belief desires have been made
1112560	1119320	redundant, haven't they? Why should you postulate woodlice beliefs now or woodlice desires? In
1119320	1125280	fact, all their behaviour is explicable in terms of things like canises. They're not
1125280	1131040	all canises, but they're things like that. What about your behaviour? Can I explain your
1131040	1135560	behaviour? Well, a lot of your behaviour, I can explain. If I chuck my chalk at you,
1135560	1141520	that shows how old I am, doesn't it? If I chuck my chalk at you, you're going to duck.
1141520	1147920	That's not a desire or belief-driven behaviour. That's just a hardwired response to the fact
1147920	1151840	that you see something coming towards you. If you put your hands on a hot plate, do the
1151840	1156880	same thing. So a lot of your behaviour, and that's just one, if you hear an ambulance
1156880	1160880	coming, you'll move out of the way. That's a classically conditioned response. A lot of
1160880	1166200	your behaviour doesn't need to be explained by appeal to beliefs and desires, but much
1166200	1171640	of it does, and this is why we postulate beliefs and desires. This is why we say that beliefs
1171640	1178080	and desires exist, but perhaps ethologists, people who study animal behaviour, are going
1178080	1184760	to find out one day that we can explain all our behaviour in terms of brain states,
1184760	1191600	and it might be that we can, one time in the future, we'll be able to saw off the skull
1191600	1197000	of newborn babies and fit a perspect dome instead, so that we don't have to go in for
1197000	1201400	all this interpretation, which we're actually not very good at, is it, trying to find out
1201400	1205400	what we're all going to do instead? We can just look at somebody's brain and say, ah,
1205400	1210200	okay, I know what you're going to do. Perhaps we'll all wear woolly hats so we can surprise
1210200	1216120	people or something like that. But do you see, if we could explain all our behaviour
1216120	1222880	without appealing to beliefs and desires, we'd no more have reason to think you had a mind
1222880	1230600	than we do to think woodlice do. So, again, the question, do mental states exist, is a
1230600	1237680	huge question. Lots of people try and reduce mental states to physical states, and then
1237680	1243040	explain physical states, it's much easier to explain physical states than mental states,
1243040	1248520	but if you don't want to be a reductionist, if you want to say you cannot reduce mental
1248520	1253600	states to physical states, and there are all sorts of reasons to think you can't, then
1253600	1257160	you're going to have to postulate mental states, you're going to have to postulate
1257160	1264600	contents and qualia, and the minute you do, you're going to have problems with functionalism,
1264600	1271360	with physics being able ever to understand mental states, and my goodness, you might
1271360	1277680	end up having to postulate God or something again, or maybe not, we don't know. So, again,
1277680	1282680	the question is, what is this? Does it exist at all? If it does exist, can we reduce it
1282680	1288000	to something else? If we can't reduce it to something else, what is its nature? Here's
1288000	1293280	another one, what about possibilities? Okay, I might have been wearing jeans, mightn't I?
1293280	1300400	Okay, that's a possibility. And what's more, it's a possibility that's actual, isn't it?
1300400	1309360	It's an actual possibility. Well, what is a possibility? What's the nature of a possibility?
1309360	1316360	It's not something that actually exists, is it? Okay, so maybe we've got to postulate
1316360	1320080	a different sort of existence now. There are things that actually exist, and there are
1320080	1325420	things that possibly exist, and there are things that don't even possibly exist. So,
1325420	1332600	there are square circles that don't even possibly exist. Unicorns might they exist
1332600	1339080	or not? Marianne's wearing jeans certainly is an existing possibility. Do you see what
1339080	1344720	I mean? You're now getting layers of existence, different levels of existence. Well, and that
1344720	1353160	little kitten on the floor down there, is it fat? You're looked. You understood what
1353160	1358280	my words were. Don't you need to postulate a little kitten down there in order to give
1358280	1364600	meaning to my words? Some people have thought that. If you do, then that little kitten exists,
1364600	1374080	it doesn't exist like Ann does, so you need again another layer of existence. Well, some
1374080	1380320	people have said that it's not really existence. Let's call it persistence instead. But the
1380320	1385800	thing is you've got to say, if you say that every, in order for you to understand the
1385800	1391400	meaning of that little kitten is fat, there needs to be a concept of a kitten or a kitten
1391400	1396400	or something. There's a kitten that gives meaning to the words, but it's not an existing
1396400	1401640	kitten like the kitten that some of you may have at home. So, it's a persisting kitten
1401640	1408680	or an imaginary kitten is another way of thinking about it. But do imaginary kittens exist? Well,
1408680	1416480	do they? In imagination, there you are. There's another way of thinking of it. So, it's existence,
1416480	1420040	different types of existence. There's existence in the real world and there's existence in
1420040	1425560	your imagination. There's existence in novels. I mean, when it comes up, this little kitten
1425560	1429240	down here, it could be black ginger or anything, couldn't it? I haven't told you anything about
1429240	1435360	what it's like. But we all know that Sherlock Holmes wore a deastalker, didn't we? Did he?
1435360	1439840	Something like that, wasn't it? Okay, so they've got, again, different levels of existence.
1439840	1447600	We all know that unicorns have horns. Well, there aren't any unicorns. Well, how can unicorns
1447600	1455640	have horns if there aren't any? Do you see? Anyway, so, do possibilities exist is a really
1455640	1459920	difficult one. That's the sort of thing that leads people to postulate the existence of
1459920	1464440	possible worlds. And I think I've mentioned possible worlds to you before. Lots of people
1464440	1469280	postulate possible worlds, but they're not realists about possible worlds. Mathematicians,
1469280	1475400	logicians, physicists, many of them, all those disciplines postulate possible worlds. Not
1475400	1480000	all people in those disciplines do. But if you postulate possible worlds, you can see
1480000	1487200	possible worlds as reducing to possible situations in this world, or you can see possible worlds
1487200	1494880	as real. And David Lewis, very famous philosopher, postulated the reality of possible worlds.
1494880	1499080	And he said, well, I've never really heard a very good argument against them. A look
1499080	1507560	of blank astonishment doesn't count as an argument. What about physical objects? Well,
1507560	1514040	you might say, well, obviously they exist. How can I deny that that exists? Okay, well,
1514040	1519200	let's do a Cartesian thought experiment. In fact, let's do the Cartesian thought experiment
1519200	1532160	when I have some water. Descartes was interested in the fact that we know that some of our beliefs
1532160	1538600	are false. But in the very nature of things, we don't know which those beliefs are. You
1538600	1542640	see what I mean? Would you like to tell me for sure that all your beliefs are true?
1542640	1559440	Right? Okay, what about you? No, it isn't. No, no, a lot of your beliefs are false. I guarantee.
1559440	1570760	If you believe it, you believe that it's true, that doesn't make it true. Does it? No. You believe
1570840	1576440	it's true exactly. But this is the problem with beliefs. Every belief you have, you believe
1576440	1582600	it's true because that's what a belief is. To have the attitude of belief towards a particular
1582600	1589880	content is to assent to, as philosophers would say, that content. So in believing that this
1589880	1597720	chair is blue, there's the content, that chair is blue, and I assent to it. I say that is true.
1597720	1603480	That's what a belief is. But, of course, I may be wrong. I may be colourblind or something like that.
1607480	1611880	Well, given the circumstances in this case, I probably would say I know. But the fact is,
1611880	1616440	let's not bother about that. I was just offering that as a... But you have beliefs about a lot
1616440	1621480	of things. The question is, you know that many of those beliefs are false, but you don't know
1621480	1627480	which they are. And in the very nature of things, anything that you believe, you believe to be
1627480	1632840	true because that's what truth is. You cannot have a belief that you don't believe to be true.
1633400	1638440	But you do know that not all your beliefs are true. Well, Descartes became very
1638440	1643000	interested in this, and he said, well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take myself away from
1643000	1647960	the world. In the world, we have to assume that our beliefs are true because we have to act on them.
1648920	1652840	So in believing that chair is blue, if I'm looking for something to match it, I'll go and look for
1652840	1658600	something blue. We have to act on our beliefs. He's going to put himself away and think, okay,
1658600	1665160	how do I know that my beliefs are true? What is it that justifies me in believing that my beliefs
1665160	1676440	are true? And he thought, the method I'm going to use to do this is to treat as if false any belief
1676440	1683240	I can entertain the slightest doubt about. So if the belief that I believe to be true could be
1683240	1689560	false, I'm going to put it on one side as if it really is false. And by that means hope to find
1689560	1697000	something that I can that is absolutely certain. And from that, maybe I can build up the rest of
1697000	1701320	my knowledge. So it's a bit like, you know, some of the apples in your baskets are rotten, but you
1701320	1705640	don't know which they are. So you take each one out and any that's a little bruised, you put on
1705640	1710760	one side as being maybe that's rotten. And you hope to be left with only the good apples in the
1710760	1716040	basket. So Descartes wanted to look at his beliefs and say, if there's any about which I can entertain
1716040	1721880	the slightest doubt, I'm going to treat it as if false. Okay, so he's not saying that his beliefs
1721880	1728440	are false. He's saying it's as if they're false for this. So first, he went down three levels of doubt.
1728440	1742280	The first one was the argument from illusion. Okay, the argument from illusion tells us that,
1743720	1748680	well, our senses have deceived us. I expect all of you have been deceived by your senses. Sometimes
1748680	1752440	you've got home that wonderful skirt that you thought would go so well with that blouse and
1752440	1757640	you've got the colour wrong. The lights in this shop were the wrong colour or something like that.
1757640	1762760	We've all been deceived by our senses at some time. Well, if we've all been deceived by our senses
1762760	1768040	at some time, should we take all the beliefs that we base on our senses and put them in the
1768040	1775000	doubting basket, treat them as if they're false? Should we? If our senses has deceived us, should
1775000	1781800	we treat all our sensory beliefs as false? Okay, put your hands up if you think yes.
1781800	1790600	Okay, put your hand up if you think no. Okay, now tell me why you think no.
1798200	1799720	Why must there be that possibility?
1805880	1811400	Well, hang on, we've got two lots of can'ts nose here. What we're suggesting is that your senses
1811400	1817720	have sometimes deceived you. Does that mean you can never be sure that your senses are not deceiving
1817720	1826920	you now? No, you can't be sure. So sometimes we do trust our senses, don't we? I mean, as a matter
1826920	1836440	of fact, how do you know that your senses have deceived you? Well, hang on, you experiment,
1836440	1842440	you prove it. How? How do you do this? Through your senses. Can you give me an example? Possibly not.
1847400	1854520	Woo, yes. Yes, good one. Okay. So your belief that it was heavy, although that's actually not
1854520	1860920	a sensory belief, probably, is it? Well, yes, because you put so much anticipated. No, no, but it's
1861480	1866840	when your belief that the frying pan was heavy, you can't really look at a frying pan and tell it's
1866840	1872200	going to be heavier. Maybe you can, maybe you can. Let me give you Descartes own example, because I
1872200	1879960	think it's a good one. Descartes said, if you put a stick in water and it looks bent, okay, you've got
1879960	1885800	reason for thinking that the stick is bent. You take it out of water, woo, it's straight. You've got
1885800	1890120	reason for thinking the stick's straight. Well, okay, there are two possibilities, maybe. When you
1890120	1897480	put the stick in water, it bends it, or maybe it just appears bent. So how do you test this? You put
1897480	1903480	your hands in the water, you feel the stick when it's underwater and low, it's straight. Okay, so
1903480	1909000	you've now got two reasons for thinking the stick's straight and only one. But the thing is, you
1909000	1916920	couldn't even know that your senses were deceiving you unless you rely on your senses. So all we got
1916920	1923480	to hear from the argument from illusion is that we know that not all our sensory beliefs are true,
1924200	1929720	not all our sensory beliefs are true. Sometimes, usually in
1932280	1940520	unusual psychooptimal conditions, or maybe not unusual, but not perfect psycho physical conditions,
1940600	1947400	our sensory beliefs deceive us. But you can't go from the universal possibility of illusion
1947960	1955080	to the possibility of universal illusion. Would you like me to say that again? No? Oh, I like saying
1955080	1962120	that. Would you like me to say it again? Thank you. Thank you. You cannot go from the universal
1962120	1971160	possibility of illusion to the possibility of universal illusion. Are you with me? Okay, so all
1971160	1978120	those who said no, you're right. We do know that our senses sometimes deceive us, but that doesn't
1978120	1984600	tell us that we can put all our sensory beliefs into the doubting basket, because we would never
1984600	1990760	know that our senses deceive us unless we rely on our senses. So that's the first argument. The
1990760	1999560	second argument that Descartes went to was the argument from the demon, the demon argument,
1999560	2006600	rather than the argument from the demon. The demon, sorry, the demon, anyone who knows what
2006600	2011800	they're talking about will know that I'm talking rubbish. The second one was the dream, the argument
2011800	2018840	from dreaming. Okay, so you're sitting here, you're in the fire, the lights are on, everything's fine,
2018920	2023080	you're looking at your hands in front of you. How can you doubt that? Your senses aren't deceiving
2023080	2027960	you now, are they? But on the other hand, says Descartes, haven't you ever been in the situation
2027960	2033720	where everything has seemed to you to be a certain way, and then you've suddenly woken up
2034280	2040600	and found it wasn't that way at all? So it looks as if all the sensory evidence is in, and yet
2041880	2046360	you're still wrong, your belief is false. So you believe that the hand is in front of you.
2046360	2052200	It's exactly with you as it would be if your hand was in front of you, but your hand's not in
2052200	2058360	front of you. As a matter of fact, you're dreaming. Okay, does that mean we should put all our sensory
2058360	2066360	beliefs in the doubting basket? Put your hands up if you think yes. Put your hand up if you think no.
2068280	2070120	You're beginning to get this now, aren't you? Why not?
2070120	2076120	Man in white or beigey sort of jumper.
2082440	2084680	Sorry, I've picked on you and you don't have to.
2089880	2095080	Okay, would anyone else like to answer? Why can we not put all our sensory beliefs in the
2095080	2101480	doubting basket now? Because we wake up, and what does that tell us?
2105160	2111080	That we're not always asleep exactly, that sometimes our beliefs are true. Sometimes when I've
2111080	2115400	got my hand in front of me like that and I'm thinking my hand's in front of me, I am awake,
2115400	2122040	and the reason I know that is because if I didn't wake up, I couldn't know I was dreaming. So it's
2122040	2128200	exactly the same structure of arguments as in the first one. But where has we got rid of all
2128200	2135000	sensory beliefs that have formed in suboptimal psychophysical conditions here? Here, we've got
2135000	2140680	rid of a lot more, haven't we? Why? Do you want to? No, I was going to say that, but how do you know
2140680	2145240	you've woken up? That might be part of the dream we're talking about. Well, it's a contrast, isn't it?
2145320	2150840	Well, there are people who don't have that occasionally. I understand that it's very rare, but there are people who go
2151720	2156360	through this cycle of thinking they've woken up and then they wake up again themselves.
2156840	2163000	Right, but in order to know that they are like that, they must have woken up.
2167480	2173960	Well, okay, but with you, I'm quite sure you've had lucid dreams where you've had the dream and
2173960	2178360	suddenly you've woken up and you've thought, wow, you know, who could have believed that I was dreaming.
2181320	2185560	Sometimes you can know your dream, but it's the lucid dream that's good for this one.
2186520	2189960	But what have we lost here? What's in the doubting basket now?
2192840	2198040	No, instantly, there's another thing I want you to notice that lots of people think, I mean, it's
2198040	2204920	hell, sheer hell being a philosopher as a party. Because when people find out you're a philosopher,
2204920	2211320	they're going for little games like, oh, good, tell me that this exists. Does this exist? Why not?
2211320	2215640	And you say something and they say, oh, no, it doesn't, you know, tell me how, tell me how.
2215640	2221160	And they're playing a sort of skeptics game that's extremely irritating. I hope none of you ever play it.
2221880	2230440	Descartes found reasons for doubting, everything. He didn't just doubt. He took beliefs he believed to be true,
2231160	2236840	and he looked for a reason to doubt them. And it's only when he found a reason to doubt them
2236840	2245480	that he put them on one side. So he wasn't just doubting. He wasn't playing the skeptics game.
2245480	2251000	He was actually looking for reasons to doubt. So what are we lost here? What's in the doubting
2251000	2262600	basket once you've got the argument from dreaming? Well, no, because when you are, you know that
2262600	2270920	sometimes your belief there's a hand in front of you is correct, is true. So you don't lose
2271000	2274600	that you do sometimes see your hand in front of you. But what do you lose?
2278600	2285320	No. No, no, we're looking for certainty. We're wanting to know what isn't certain as a result
2285320	2290760	of this. Some things are left certain. I mean, it's left certain, for example. Well, okay,
2290760	2300760	I'm asking you that. What is left certain? That when you are awake, your beliefs, your sensory beliefs
2300760	2308040	if they're formed in optimal psychophysical conditions are true. You still got no reason to
2308040	2318360	doubt that. It's just that you can say that unless I know I'm awake, I cannot know for sure
2319080	2324760	that there is a hand in front of me. Okay, do I know that I'm really awake? Answer no, I don't,
2324760	2332360	because I could be having a lucid dream. But I do know that hands exist and that I can see them
2332360	2338280	and that chairs exist and that I can see them. Or if you don't like that, because I can, in our
2338280	2344440	dreams, we sometimes put together things in strange ways. I can know that blue exists and that
2346200	2351560	so you can go to simple things, horses, horns, whiteness, things like that. The simple things
2351560	2357720	from which we build up complex things. I know that they exist. So we're losing something of the
2357720	2363240	world here, but we haven't lost the whole world yet. There's still an awful lot that we know. I don't
2363240	2371400	know anything to be true now, but I do have reason to believe that it is true. It is true sometimes,
2371400	2377800	i.e. when I'm awake and I have these reasons to believe things. But then we get down to the demon argument.
2377960	2386600	And at the demon argument, Descartes says, okay, well, I'm assuming, aren't I, that
2389000	2394360	these experiences that I have as of my hands and of blwness and so on, I'm assuming that these
2394360	2401720	experiences are actually caused by something outside myself and that the experience that I have
2401720	2410840	is a guide to the nature of the cause of these experiences. So my experience of blwness as of
2410840	2417480	a blue chair is causing me to think that that experience is being caused by a chair that's
2417480	2430680	blue. And you've got a problem here because in order to know that A causes B, you've got to be here,
2430680	2437960	haven't you? You've got to see a correlation between A and B. In the same way to know that A
2437960	2444440	resembles B, you've got to be able to see both A and B. But are we ever in this position with
2445480	2455000	respect to our experiences and the causes of our experience? Never. We're always here,
2455080	2461720	aren't we? Didn't leave enough room for my arrow. We experience the world, if you like,
2461720	2468680	through our experiences. We can never get outside our experiences to see what the world is like,
2468680	2476200	to see what's causing these experiences. So it could be that our experiences are caused by
2476200	2483320	something completely other than we take them to be caused by. So here's the demon. Sorry, I know it
2483400	2490200	looks like a cat, but it's a demon. The demon opens up a gap between our experiences themselves
2490200	2495240	and the causes of those experiences, and it actually says, how do we even know these experiences
2495240	2502040	are caused? Why aren't they just experiences? One following the other, following the other,
2502040	2506840	following the other. And there's nothing out there at all. And actually Descartes at that point
2506840	2512600	says, I can't do this. I'm going to put the demon there because I find it impossible to believe
2512600	2519480	there's nothing other than my experiences. But I can think that there's some cause of my
2519480	2525400	experiences, which is completely other than I take it to be. And some people have tried putting
2525400	2531240	evil scientists in here, but that doesn't work because an evil scientist isn't magic.
2532440	2537480	What you're trying to do, the demon is just there because it's impossible to imagine that your
2537480	2543960	experiences don't have causes at all. So you're putting something there so that there is a cause,
2543960	2560120	but the cause is completely other than you take it to be. He didn't panic for that reason. No,
2560120	2564680	he just literally couldn't wrap his mind around the idea that there's nothing outside causing
2564760	2571800	your experiences. You try it. It's really very difficult to get yourself to the point where
2571800	2580920	you understand that there might be no physical world at all. Your experiences could be exactly
2580920	2591000	as they are, even though nothing else exists. So all there is is Ann's experiences as of
2591640	2595320	Marianne giving a lecture in philosophy. There's no Marianne, there's no philosophy,
2595320	2600920	there's no lecture, there's no blue chair. But it does seem to me very similar to what people have
2601880	2607560	of is this experience all a half. It's a frightening experience. It's nothing beyond that.
2609560	2614760	But it's nothing to do with God. Oh, no. I said that sometimes white people want to have a God.
2615480	2620360	Yes. I didn't actually say about God. I just said people worry that there is nothing after death.
2621000	2627560	Okay, but this is a different thing because it's not worrying about that sort of thing.
2628040	2632840	But it is a worrying thought. I mean, we want our beliefs about the external world to be true,
2632840	2638200	don't we? And yet what's happening is that we're discovering that what Descartes said was that
2638920	2646280	actually, once you've done this thought experiment, you realise that there's the world
2646280	2657960	and there's your picture of the world. Okay, all your beliefs that you've formed about the world
2657960	2664920	and you go through the world updating your beliefs all the time. But once you've retreated
2664920	2674280	into your picture of your picture of the world, which should be here, but I ran out of room,
2674840	2682520	the world actually becomes unnecessary because if all there was was this,
2683720	2688920	you couldn't ever get outside to see whether this is there or not. So once you've pushed yourself
2688920	2697160	back into a reflective position, you see that the world that you picture is quite different
2697160	2703000	from your picture of the world and that your picture of the world could be exactly as it is,
2703000	2709640	even though the world was completely different. And that's the Cartesian thought experiment.
2709640	2717480	That's hyperbolical doubt. At this point, you've started the question of how can we know? I mean,
2717480	2723480	we do take ourselves to know that there's an external world, a physical world out there.
2723480	2732040	But what possible justification could we have for this, given that all we can do is go and look
2732040	2740680	for more experiences? And our experiences are exactly what we are asking. Are they caused by
2740680	2746920	something? And if so, what? I can't step outside my experience. Of course, no scientific experiment
2746920	2753240	is going to tell you the answer between, are my experiences caused by an external world,
2753240	2759400	or are they caused by an evil demon? There's no, I can't go down and say, oh, is it a chair?
2759480	2762200	Oh, yes. Here we are. It's a chair. Why can't I do that?
2765480	2770440	All I'm doing is giving myself more experiences, aren't I? I'm now having a tactile experience
2770440	2774920	as well as a visual experience, and there's an auditory one there as well. But I mean,
2774920	2783640	there are only more experiences, aren't they? Who are you? Hang on. I'm having another experience
2783720	2789640	at this moment. It's an auditory one. It's as of someone.
2793240	2798280	They do, but no, no, hang on. You haven't got yourself into hyperbolical doubt, has she?
2798920	2801000	Why hasn't she got into hyperbolical doubt?
2801000	2807480	She's not looking at her picture of her picture of the world.
2809000	2815240	Yes, she still thinks that I should think that she exists.
2818840	2825080	I have very good reason to think I'm having experiences as of a female wearing maroon sitting
2825080	2830280	in front of me who's speaking to me, but these are just more of my experiences, aren't I?
2830360	2835800	I can no more get outside my experiences to check whether Ann's really there and whether
2835800	2840520	she's really telling me what I think she's telling me than I can to see whether the chair is there.
2840520	2846120	All I've got is more experiences. So all I've got is more of this
2849160	2855880	here, and I still haven't got this, which is what I need. So there's no point in looking for
2855880	2863880	corroboration, which is why there can't be any scientific way of testing which hypothesis is true.
2863880	2871880	So here I have my experience in the external world. Of those, I can be certain. I'm absolutely sure
2871880	2879880	now that I'm having experiences as of a lecture theatre, etc. What I want to know is are those
2879880	2886600	experiences causing me to form beliefs that are true, i.e. there is a lecture theatre. Now notice
2886600	2891960	the difference between I believe there's a lecture theatre and there is a lecture theatre.
2893400	2899560	The latter is metaphysics, isn't it? The former is histomology. I can be certain of the former.
2899560	2906280	I can be certain of my own beliefs, but I can't be certain that these beliefs are true, can I?
2906280	2915080	And it's at this level of hyperbolical doubt, at the third level of doubt that you start to wonder
2915880	2922360	do physical objects exist at all. Interestingly, Descartes thought that you could show that they
2922360	2928760	did. Descartes wasn't a sceptic. Lots of people think he was, but in fact he wasn't. He did this sceptical
2929560	2937960	thought experiment in order to pre-empt scepticism. He ended up believing in the existence of a physical
2937960	2941320	world, but he thought it was necessary to believe in God first.
2948040	2953480	That's right. Cogito ergo sum. And the reason he did that, can anyone think why he did that,
2953560	2959480	thinking of what I told you so far? What's that? That's right. Once you've got yourself back
2959480	2966040	into your picture of your picture of the world and your inability to determine the existence of
2966040	2971160	the world that you picture, the only thing of which you can be certain is that you're thinking,
2971960	2979160	isn't it? So here's my belief. The content of my belief is
2979640	2984280	the chair is blue.
2989080	2995400	I've got the attitude of belief towards that. I've now got another attitude, which is that of
2995400	3004120	doubt towards that belief. Do you see what I mean? You can't doubt your own beliefs without seeing
3004120	3009880	that you have these beliefs. And that's what Descartes says. He said, the very act of doubting
3010520	3020440	makes me see that I believe. And if I believe, I exist. I don't know what I am like, but I exist
3020440	3028840	because I exist as a thinking thing, as a thing that thinks. So I think, therefore I am, is because
3028840	3035320	that, once you've been in hyperbolical doubt, that is the only certainty you have. You actually
3035320	3039400	have a few more about what you think, but you don't need to. I think, therefore, I exist
3040360	3046040	encapsulates it rather neatly, I think. But you see, you cannot doubt your own beliefs without
3046040	3051160	seeing that you do believe something or other. All you don't know is whether that belief is true.
3051720	3063320	Could I come back to the argument from illusions and just sort of question around,
3065320	3070760	we're saying, talking about our sense data and so on shows that they're wonderful.
3071960	3078200	However, sometimes those are what? Sometimes those are true or can be believed.
3079160	3086200	But if you, I mean, looking at evidence, for example, from physics about the nature of the
3086200	3093160	universe, about sort of wave particle forms, about what the nature of the matter is, all that kind
3093160	3099800	of stuff, what we're seeing is an extremely distorted view of reality. Looking at the evidence
3099800	3106520	from psychology, our perception is a highly flawed, all our senses are highly flawed, our brains
3106520	3113400	are constantly filling in stuff that's around the edges and doing all kinds of fiddling about with
3114280	3122760	what actually might or might not be out there. So, actually, we know pretty much what we are
3122760	3133240	experiencing. Much of it is an illusion. I'm afraid that, in what you're saying, you'll make it clear
3133320	3135960	that you haven't got into hyperbolical doubt either.
3138200	3139160	Well, in that case,
3151320	3156840	well, we can, but we can agree with all that and accept. I mean, all Day Cuts asking is,
3156840	3163640	can we be certain that our experiences are being caused by anything? Secondly, can we be
3163640	3168840	certain that our experiences are a good guide to what there is? Now, what you're saying is that the
3168840	3175800	second, we know empirically that the answer to the second question is no. But, of course,
3175800	3179400	for him, the most important question is the first one, not the second one.
3179400	3183240	Is there evidence coming out about the nature of consciousness in the cell,
3184120	3194040	which the implication is that what we may perceive as being ourself is actually, again, quite illusory?
3195800	3201960	Yes, sure. But this is more grist to Descartes mill. It's either irrelevant,
3202040	3209480	excuse me, or it's grist to Descartes mill. I mean, you can add these in, if you like,
3209480	3214840	to the argument from illusion. But the argument from illusion is only the first step of Descartes
3214840	3221240	argument. And the step that really matters is this one. And that's the one that takes us
3221240	3227400	to hyperbolical doubt. And that's very definitely a philosophical or metaphysical question,
3227400	3231400	not an empirical one. There's no way science can show us.
3236600	3241480	Well, there still is, but the empiricism is nothing more than me testing out one experience
3241480	3246600	against another, which is a bit like testing out one newspaper against another. It's not going
3246600	3272600	to get you very far. Well, doubting is a form of thinking. No, you can't bring in other people.
3276920	3283160	No, you can't. You can't bring in other people at all. The doubting is not what you're certain of
3284360	3291240	by doubting is that you believe. Because in order to doubt, the thing that you doubt is a belief of
3291240	3300520	your own. Well, exactly. A belief is a thought. It's a type of thought. So you're doubting that
3300520	3307320	you're thinking and you try and doubt whether you're thinking and you will become completely
3307320	3315400	certain that you're thinking. And so Descartes says, isn't it strange because I would have thought
3315400	3321800	that the world was far more present to me than my own thoughts. In fact, my own thoughts have
3321800	3327960	always seemed to be rather shadowy things that I'm not really certain of at all. I can't hold
3327960	3333560	them or see them or touch them or so on. But having done this, I now see that my thoughts are far
3333560	3342600	more certain to me than the external world, which could be nothing. So he thinks he's gone from
3342600	3348040	something or he's found something really surprising once you move from the perspective of
3350280	3357800	picturing your world. So I'm thinking of the world that I picture, not my picture of the world.
3357800	3362360	Usually the only time I'm thinking of my picture of the world is when something's gone wrong.
3363480	3370120	I thought I hung my coat here. I believed I hung my coat here. I now have reason to believe it isn't
3370120	3376440	there. What's gone wrong? So I've been pushed back into my picture of my picture of the world
3376440	3382840	in order to question whether my belief is true or false. But of course, usually I come back almost
3382840	3388920	immediately. Oh, there it is. And so I immediately move back into my picture of the world, looking at
3388920	3396200	the world. But what Descartes did is he forced himself to stay here, where what he was reflecting
3396200	3402600	on was his picture of the world rather than the world that he pictured. So he's looking at his
3402600	3408200	beliefs and thinking, are they true? Are they false? Are they justified? Are they not? Instead of
3408200	3414200	looking at the chair and thinking, is it blue? Is it hard? Is it okay? Do you see why people are out
3414200	3424760	here, not in here? Ann isn't a belief. My belief about Ann is a belief. But Ann is here. And Marianne's
3424760	3435640	belief about Ann is what I am certain of. But I'm certain of it until I doubt it. And the minute
3435640	3441960	I doubt it, I can be certain of that belief, but I can't be certain that it's true. So whatever
3441960	3455720	Ann says is just more of my experiences. Ann, say, that's right. I believe that Ann says it's blue,
3455720	3463000	and I know that my belief that Ann says it's true does not make it true that Ann says it's true.
3463960	3469400	And you too will be able to do this when you become philosophers. Do you see what I mean?
3469400	3474520	Once you understand what you're saying, it becomes easy to say it, although now I can't say it again.
3475720	3479800	But I'll have to get the flow of it back. Do you see why people are outside?
3479880	3488440	When my daughter was little, she used to think we had two houses, and she thought we had one that
3488440	3492360	was down the end of the road that came from preschool, and one that came down the road from
3492360	3498120	school. My cat thinks we have two houses. I'm just wondering if it, but she would have had no doubt
3498120	3503480	about that belief. Was it when she began to doubt the belief, and then obviously then realised
3504280	3509560	it's not quite that much, because we've only got the one house. Is that almost the doubting belief
3509560	3515800	makes it real? I don't know. Well, there's a very interesting, between three and five,
3516600	3523240	children actually acquire the context, the concept of a belief. And until that point,
3523240	3529800	there's evidence to think that they don't properly form beliefs of their own. But there's an experiment
3529880	3536440	that goes, Maxie the puppet, whoever it is who's looking after Maxie, I can't remember,
3537240	3542760	puts a chocolate in a box, and then Maxie goes out to play, and the children are watching this,
3542760	3548680	and Maxie's mum comes in, takes the chocolate from the box and puts it into a cupboard or something
3548680	3554200	like that. Then Maxie comes in from playing, and the children are asked, where is Maxie going to
3554200	3560120	look for the chocolate? Now, all the three-year-olds say in the cupboard, because that's where they
3560120	3565400	believe the chocolate is. They know the chocolate is in the cupboard, so that's where they think Maxie
3565400	3572600	will look. The five-year-olds will all say she'll look in the drawer, because they've understood
3572600	3579240	the difference between appearance and reality. The world can appear to you to be other than the
3579240	3585880	way the world is, and what your daughter did, she linked up her two beliefs and saw, oh, that house
3585880	3596040	is that house. Hold was she? Yeah, she probably wasn't really having beliefs at that point.
3597720	3601800	The thought is you don't really have a belief until you have the concept of belief, because once
3601800	3605720	it's only when you've got the concept of belief that you have the difference between appearance
3605800	3613000	and reality, and you see that beliefs can be either true or false, so you can grasp the concept of
3613000	3619320	conditions of truth and falsehood, and at that point you can really actually believe something,
3619320	3624680	whereas up until then it's just that you're just responding to a world, because the world is,
3624680	3629640	you don't make any distinction between the world's being one way and it's appearing one way.
3630200	3638120	You don't see that those can come apart, no, no, except I mean we'd call it one
3638120	3643800	when we're speaking loosely, but no. Okay, right, let's move on a bit, because
3645080	3651000	I mean we've been doing a lot of epistemology here under the heading of metaphysics, but of course
3651000	3657160	actually there's the metaphysics of epistemology just to confuse you, because of course if you
3657160	3662360	want to know the truth about knowledge then you're doing the metaphysics of knowledge and
3662360	3668280	therefore the metaphysics of epistemology, so we were looking at ontology before we got onto
3669400	3676440	scepticism, so we asked ourselves whether these things exist, but we can then go on and ask well
3676440	3683240	what are they like, you know, if we believe that God exists is he all these things, how can he be
3683320	3689160	all these things, because surely there's contradiction here isn't there, if he's omnipotent he can do
3689160	3694840	anything at all, if he's omniscient he knows everything at all, and if he's benevolent or good
3694840	3703240	then how can he see the suffering in the world and not do something about it, so can God be all
3703240	3709800	those things, what about moral values, if they exist are they absolute or relative, do we all
3709800	3715640	have our own moral values or is there a moral law that's objective and that exists for all of us,
3717000	3721880	are there different possible worlds or only different possible states of this world
3722520	3727880	and what's the difference between those two, and what about physical objects, are they independent
3727880	3739000	of us or bundles of our ideas, Barkley, Bishop Barkley thoughts that scepticism was so threatening
3739000	3744680	the idea that we couldn't be sure we had knowledge of the external world, that what he thought is we
3744680	3751160	had to build the external world from what we could be sure about, so the only thing we can be sure
3751160	3758360	about is our own experiences, so what is the external world other than bundles of our own
3758360	3764360	experiences, now this may sound daft, you know, I mean there's more to Anne than my experience if I
3764360	3771640	touch her she'll say ow or excuse me or something like that, but actually there again what have I got
3771640	3779560	other than my own experiences, auditory experiences etc, so what Barkley was saying was actually if
3779560	3785640	you think of all your experiences and all your counterfactual experiences, in other words if I
3785640	3791720	came into this room at midnight that blue chair would still be there, do you see that's a counterfactual
3791720	3799400	experience, I would still see that blue chair, there is no more to an object than our experiences
3799400	3806280	or counterfactual experiences and actually you try and convince me that you have any reason to
3806280	3813000	believe that the physical world exists, that doesn't appeal to either an experience of yours
3813000	3827640	or a counterfactual experience of yours and you'll fail, counterfactual, it is, if I came into
3827640	3833080	this room last night at midnight that's that's not true, I didn't come into this room at midnight I
3833080	3838760	was past the sleeping bed, but had I come into this room at midnight last night I would have seen
3838760	3844840	that blue chair and that's part of my reason for thinking that that blue chair exists independently
3844840	3854120	of me is that it was here all the time, it would still be here if I came back tomorrow, but it might
3854120	3859880	well exactly and so what Barkley is saying is is that there is no reason I can give for believing
3859880	3866600	that that chair exists that doesn't depend on either an actual experience of mine, here it exists
3866680	3870280	you know and you're having experiences of this chair now as well if you exist
3871960	3877240	or counterfactual ones if I came in tonight it would still be here, I would still see it
3880280	3886120	that's true but I would still okay but that's
3888600	3892600	if I had come in last night it would have been there yeah but I should be able to answer that
3892600	3901160	and I can't because I'm tired, what about Boozies? If somebody had moved it I wouldn't have seen it
3901160	3906200	okay I might not be able to follow it but it's certainly true that I have reason to believe that
3906200	3912760	this chair would have been here simply because it's tied to the floor, I mean that's not conclusive
3912760	3919400	and that's not a very good response to what you're saying, I've no reason to think it won't be and
3919400	3925960	my what's more important to you try this as a thought experiment for yourself try and give
3925960	3932120	yourself reason to believe that something that you believe exists exists okay so you believe
3932120	3937880	this exists what are your reasons for believing it exists and see if you can find one that doesn't
3937880	3945320	depend upon your own experiences either your actual experiences I can see it feel it touch it hear it
3945320	3951640	or your counterfactual experiences if I was there then if I did this then if
3952440	3959800	do you see what I mean then I would so you won't be able to do it Barkley was much cleverer than
3959800	3964280	people think people tend to think that he thought of the external world as a ghostly sort of thing
3964280	3969880	but he's just offering another explanation for our experiences and the fact that we go from
3969880	3975560	these experiences to thinking there's an external world we do that immediately what why do we do
3975560	3983480	this okay so so this is that's metaphysics then moving to epistemology what is knowledge
3985400	3990840	okay do we have knowledge we've looked at that in some depth already do we have knowledge
3990840	3996200	Descartes would say we can't claim to have knowledge of the external world unless we can get over his
3996200	4002120	thought experiment which he thinks we can um what is knowledge though some people believe that
4002120	4008440	it's okay well let me ask you this what what is knowledge we've been talking about knowledge for
4008440	4022920	the last hour and a half or something but what is it that's very optimistic of him launching out
4022920	4035800	like that good for you go on see for you what do you mean my gathered
4041480	4046200	but we have knowledge of things that don't involve senses don't we two plus two equals four is not
4046280	4054760	sensory knowledge so what is knowledge we collect it and put it in our brains how do you put
4054760	4067480	something in your brain well actually you don't um i'm not sure you intentionally acquire knowledge
4067480	4071240	anyway most of the time the knowledge you acquire isn't acquired intentionally it just
4072200	4078680	um sorry what did somebody else say it's certainly acquired but what is it we acquire
4080680	4084200	memories involved but there's a difference between memory and knowledge isn't there
4085480	4089960	i mean in order to remember something that something has to have happened
4090680	4102680	um memory is important but memory is different from knowledge it's not the same thing memory is
4102680	4108520	essentially time related whereas knowledge isn't essentially time related it can be time related
4108520	4119880	but it's not essentially so in the way that memory is yeah well and i mean there are different
4119880	4124040	sorts of knowledge aren't there as well i mean i know how to ride a bike well i remember
4124600	4127320	do i remember it well it's not propositional knowledge
4130760	4136280	okay let me tell you what one answer the classical answer to the question of what knowledge is is
4136280	4142680	that it's justified true belief okay if you're going to have knowledge you must have a belief
4143640	4152520	that belief must be justified and that belief must be true so um you believe or you you know
4152520	4157880	that i'm wearing an aubergine dress don't you you will know that they have very good colour
4157880	4165080	concepts here you have a belief that i'm wearing an aubergine dress do you yep okay is that belief
4165160	4173000	justified how you can see it yeah okay you're justified in believing that and and let me tell
4173000	4179400	you that it's true okay so you know i'm wearing an aubergine dress so that's the idea that so if a
4179400	4185160	student comes to me and says well i day card said such and such and i say why do you think that
4185160	4194680	and he says uh i don't know and i say okay well what follows from that belief and he says um
4195720	4202440	i don't know uh and i said well why do you think that and he says uh don't know
4203240	4209160	he doesn't know it does it does he you may have a belief about that um but it's and it what's more
4209160	4213880	it may be a true belief but it's not justified therefore it doesn't count as knowledge he doesn't
4213880	4220120	know it at all um if you don't have a belief about something you certainly can't know it
4220120	4223640	but the other one and the one that most people get more worried about is that
4223640	4231560	you cannot know something false if you cannot know that i'm wearing a yellow dress for example
4231560	4239240	you can believe that you know something false but your belief that you know it is itself
4239240	4248600	false are you with me so if you actually know something that thing must be true so maxi comes
4248600	4255960	in from playing and she does she know that the chocolate is in the drawer no she believes
4255960	4259720	she knows the chocolate is in the drawer but what she doesn't know is that her mum took it out
4259720	4266040	and put it somewhere else so she has what she thinks is knowledge but it's not knowledge because
4266040	4270920	it's not true she's got the belief she's justified in the belief but the belief isn't true therefore
4270920	4276520	it cannot be counted as knowledge so you've got to again make that distinction between what you believe
4276520	4282680	to be the case and what actually is the case because you can believe you know something that's
4282680	4289400	false but you cannot actually know something false this is the the crux of william morris's
4289960	4297000	dictum only have in your house those things which you believe to be beautiful
4297880	4305160	or which you know to be useful yes i'm not sure it's the crux of that but it certainly comes into it
4305800	4313080	yes absolutely um yeah okay so um but here's a little problem for you getty a came up with
4313080	4319480	this little problem it's called and it's been called ever since getty a problems um you have seen
4319480	4331080	me driving a um a golf gti around oxford um you've come to believe that i own a golf gti as a
4331080	4335800	matter of fact there is a golf gti that i own but it's in my garage and the one that you've seen
4335800	4345320	me driving around belongs to a friend okay do you know that i own a golf gti i believe
4345880	4352600	no sorry you believe that you know but do you know no you don't know why not
4355240	4359400	well it is justified no you've seen me driving around in it you're perfectly justified
4359640	4362760	it is true i've got one in the garage
4366840	4368920	no you don't know that you don't know but you don't know
4371880	4372920	that's not the point
4372920	4379080	why not
4391320	4397480	but we do usually claim about claim to have knowledge without having certainty don't we
4398040	4404360	i mean you've seen me driving this car often um so you know you you think you're justified in
4404360	4409240	claiming to know that i now i'll tell you what's happened here is the conditions that make your
4409240	4415800	belief true i.e. the car that's sitting in my garage that you've never seen me in come apart from
4415800	4422600	the conditions that justify your belief the golf gti you've seen me driving around in and it's only
4422600	4428760	if the conditions that make true your belief are the same as the conditions that justify your belief
4428760	4435160	that you can have knowledge uh that what you have counts as knowledge so what gti a showed is that
4435160	4441880	it cannot be the case that knowledge is justified true belief justified true belief may be necessary
4441880	4448600	for knowledge but it's not sufficient you need some other claim that makes it impossible for the
4448600	4452600	truth's conditions
