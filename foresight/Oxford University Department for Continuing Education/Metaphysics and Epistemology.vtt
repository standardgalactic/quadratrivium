Byddwn we find it, if we find it, then we're going to know more about it.

03:25.760 --> 03:28.280
That's what we're doing. We've postulated it,

03:28.480 --> 03:33.400
we've said this is on our list of things that exist, at least as a hypothesis.

03:33.600 --> 03:37.120
Now we want to test that hypothesis and see whether it's true.

03:37.320 --> 03:41.600
Metaphysics asked questions like what's there and what's its nature.

03:41.800 --> 03:46.200
Now, many of these questions are questions of science.

03:46.240 --> 03:50.680
Ond felly answered those on whether it exists, and what it is like.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.820
These are questions for science.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.940
Questions like, Coresation?

03:55.960 --> 03:59.740
What is Coresation, does causation exist?

03:59.760 --> 04:03.320
The relation between cause and effect.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.400
That's not a question for science.

04:05.420 --> 04:08.920
The scientists must assume that causation exists.

04:08.940 --> 04:11.540
Philosophers ask, does it?

04:11.560 --> 04:13.380
And what's the nature of causation?

04:13.380 --> 04:15.380
Côr, could causation go backwards?

04:15.380 --> 04:20.380
For example, could there be a cause that happens after its effect?

04:21.380 --> 04:29.380
Is causation a relation between events or between objects or between facts

04:29.380 --> 04:32.380
or what are the relator of the causal relation?

04:32.380 --> 04:36.380
So these are all questions of metaphysics.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.380
Epistemology on the other hand is the study of knowledge.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.080
But the study in what is the case, how it is how it is that it is and how it is

05:17.080 --> 05:19.440
and what you know best to be the case, are two different questions

05:22.480 --> 05:26.140
the other to do it with epistemology.

05:26.140 --> 05:27.700
Epistemology looks at what can we know!

05:27.740 --> 05:30.200
Can we for example know that the sun will rise tomorrow?

05:30.200 --> 05:33.140
Do you remember the motto we looked at

05:33.140 --> 05:34.520
induction, when we started doing logic?

05:34.520 --> 05:37.040
Can we know it

05:37.040 --> 05:44.280
Well, we don't know for certain must knowledge be certain knowledge or could it be the case

05:44.280 --> 05:50.640
that we know something that we don't know we know? Do you see what I mean? What is knowledge

05:50.640 --> 05:57.320
like? So, actually, I should have put that here. What is knowledge? What can we know and

05:57.320 --> 06:04.840
how can we know it? So, for example, if there are moral values, we don't know it by sensory

06:04.880 --> 06:13.880
perception. I never see right and wrong, certainly not through my eyes or through tactile sense

06:13.880 --> 06:18.800
or anything like that. So, there must be some other way. How do we know that two plus two

06:18.800 --> 06:25.560
equals four? Again, you don't see that that's the case. How do you know that all swans are

06:25.560 --> 06:30.040
white? I know they're not, but let's pretend for a minute. How do you know that all ravens

06:30.040 --> 06:36.560
are black? That's a better one. Well, let's forget Albino ones. I know what you're like.

06:36.560 --> 06:42.600
I could see you thinking that. How do we know that given that if you're going to say that

06:42.600 --> 06:46.640
all ravens are white, you're talking about all ravens, even the ones that you've never

06:46.640 --> 06:53.440
seen, even the ones that nobody has ever seen, even the ones on Mars. If there are ravens

06:53.440 --> 06:58.840
on Mars, you're saying all ravens are black includes those ravens on Mars. Well, how can

06:58.840 --> 07:04.600
you know that? Do you see what I mean? So, there are two different questions as what is

07:04.600 --> 07:10.240
knowledge in the first place? Must we know that we know something or can we know something

07:10.240 --> 07:15.760
that we don't know that we know? What's it got to do with justification? What's it got

07:15.760 --> 07:21.720
to do with belief, et cetera? And how can we know these things? So, that's the distinction

07:21.720 --> 07:27.640
between metaphysics. Metaphysics is to do with truth and what is the case and what's

07:27.640 --> 07:36.000
its nature. Epistemology is to do with knowledge, justification, belief, and how we can know

07:36.000 --> 07:41.120
whatever it is that we do know. So, that's the main distinction. Let me just pour myself

07:41.120 --> 07:55.840
some H2O. H2O. What did I say earlier? I suddenly remembered that I heard myself saying

07:55.840 --> 08:02.600
something false. Well, right. Okay, let's look at ontology, the study of what there is

08:02.600 --> 08:08.200
or what exists. Okay, one question. I said earlier that there are many things that questions

08:08.200 --> 08:13.320
of what is the case and what is its nature that are questions for science. But questions

08:13.320 --> 08:20.480
like does God exist? In the God delusion, if any of you have read it, Richard Dawkins

08:20.480 --> 08:27.440
claims that this is a scientific hypothesis like any other. Well, if that's true, it must

08:27.440 --> 08:34.280
be possible to conduct experiments, observations, in order to determine the existence of God.

08:34.280 --> 08:39.880
I have no idea what experiments or observations he has in mind, but I actually don't think

08:39.880 --> 08:44.160
this is a question for science. I think Dawkins is wrong to think this is a straightforward

08:44.160 --> 08:53.480
scientific hypothesis. I think this is a question for philosophy. Evidence, our reasons

08:53.480 --> 09:02.200
for thinking God exists take the form of arguments rather than evidence or observations. For example,

09:02.200 --> 09:08.160
the most obvious argument is the one I used earlier. God is a theoretical entity. He's

09:08.160 --> 09:14.480
postulated to explain the existence of the universe. That's the simplest argument. It's

09:14.480 --> 09:20.240
the argument that people have used from the beginning of time. Other people use different

09:20.240 --> 09:25.160
arguments. For example, the moral argument. You don't need God to explain the existence

09:25.160 --> 09:32.880
of the physical world, but how come there exist people like us who are capable of rationality,

09:32.880 --> 09:40.400
who reason, who have free will, who make choices, and in particular make moral choices? People

09:40.400 --> 09:46.520
like us who value things, who see right and wrong, good and bad, beautiful and ugly, and

09:46.520 --> 09:55.800
things like that. Physics can't see right and wrong, good or bad, etc. This is not the

09:55.800 --> 10:02.840
sort of thing that physics or any physical science can investigate. But you might think

10:02.840 --> 10:09.000
that God is the explanation for the existence of things like that. Or you might deny that.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.400
You might say, no, you don't need God to explain right and wrong. You can easily explain right

10:13.400 --> 10:22.000
and wrong by peel to evolutionary biology. So altruism is a question of either kin support

10:22.000 --> 10:29.040
or if I scratch your back, you'll scratch mine, etc. So if you look at Dawkins' chapter,

10:29.040 --> 10:34.360
I think it's four, but I may be wrong about that. He offers four or five arguments for

10:34.360 --> 10:42.440
how you can explain morality without God. So does God exist? Lots of different arguments

10:42.440 --> 10:47.560
for the existence of God, lots of different rejections of those arguments, lots of different

10:47.560 --> 10:52.520
comebacks on those rejections, and philosophers are going to have a job for at least a couple

10:52.520 --> 10:58.440
of hundred years, I think. I think the God's illusion is far from the final word on it. But

10:58.440 --> 11:03.200
there are other questions like that. That's a biggie, obviously, but there are other biggies.

11:03.200 --> 11:11.000
Do moral values exist? Is there right and wrong? Does right, it's really a property of an

11:11.000 --> 11:20.280
action being right or wrong? Or can we reduce the idea of being right to something some

11:20.280 --> 11:28.040
people would say natural like happiness? So the utilitarians want to reduce happiness

11:28.040 --> 11:32.840
to the, sorry, reduce right and wrong to the idea of the greatest happiness to the

11:32.840 --> 11:38.080
greatest number. So there's no more to right or wrong than how many people you make happy

11:38.080 --> 11:43.920
by an action that you do. Now what you're doing there is you're reducing one thing to

11:43.920 --> 11:48.720
another thing. So here's something we don't understand right and wrong, and we think that

11:48.720 --> 11:53.800
it needs an explanation, and we're tempted to postulate God for it maybe. But on the

11:53.800 --> 11:58.880
other hand, if we can say, well, actually, we don't have an explanation for that, but

11:58.880 --> 12:05.440
there's actually no more to that than this in particular combinations, and we do have

12:05.440 --> 12:09.080
an explanation for this, or at least this is something for which we can think that there'd

12:09.080 --> 12:14.880
be a much easier explanation than God. So on the grounds of Occam's razor, given two

12:14.880 --> 12:21.000
explanations, both of which work, you always go for the simpler one. If you can explain

12:21.000 --> 12:27.400
happiness, and you can reduce morality to happiness, then you haven't got a problem

12:27.400 --> 12:35.040
with morality. You don't need to postulate God. See what I mean? So you might, I mean,

12:35.040 --> 12:41.400
some people try and reduce the idea of God to, I mean, actually Dawkins again does this.

12:41.400 --> 12:46.800
He thinks that God is the idea we all want for security, for a father figure, something

12:46.800 --> 12:55.440
to rely on. So he's reducing God to that. The utilitarians try and reduce moral values

12:55.440 --> 13:01.720
to happiness. Kant, on the other hand, isn't a reductionist. He thinks right and wrong

13:01.720 --> 13:07.600
exist, that the moral law exists in and of itself, and that it's quite different from

13:07.600 --> 13:14.240
anything else. So if you remember last week, for Kant, a moral action is an action that's

13:14.240 --> 13:20.920
carried out because of reverence for the moral law. It can't be said to be anything else.

13:20.920 --> 13:25.240
It can't be said to be something that, just as a matter of fact, produces the greatest

13:25.240 --> 13:31.120
happiness or the greatest number. And reverence for the moral law, says Kant, is not something

13:31.120 --> 13:37.080
you can reduce to anything else, something easier to understand. Another example of this

13:37.080 --> 13:41.560
would be mental states. I thought I was going to come to mental states, but I say it's not

13:41.560 --> 13:51.280
on there, so I'll put it in anyway. Do mental states exist? Well, what are mental states?

13:51.280 --> 13:57.280
Well, mental states divide into two. There are the so-called propositional attitudes. So

13:57.280 --> 14:04.400
attitudes to propositions, things like beliefs. You can't have a belief unless it's a belief

14:04.400 --> 14:15.240
about something, can you? So I believe that Anne is wearing sort of maroon. I believe Anne's

14:15.240 --> 14:20.880
wearing maroon. I believe when Anna's got a necklace on, somebody's got a lovely pink

14:20.880 --> 14:27.520
jumper on just in front of Anna. Futious sort of colour. Okay, all of those beliefs have

14:27.520 --> 14:34.360
a content, but there are other propositional attitudes, so I can have a desire to warn

14:34.360 --> 14:39.680
towards the same content. Desire is a different attitude, but I could have the desire that

14:39.680 --> 14:47.280
Anna's wearing a necklace, or I could wish that Anne is wearing, all the same names, is

14:47.280 --> 14:54.240
wearing maroon. I could also intend that Anna's wearing maroon. I could set out to make

14:54.240 --> 14:59.280
sure she wears maroon today, because I want to use her as an example. So these are lots

14:59.280 --> 15:05.120
of different attitudes to contents, and you can get the same attitude and different contents

15:05.120 --> 15:11.880
and the same content and different attitudes. So that's one type of mental state, the so-called

15:11.880 --> 15:18.640
propositional attitudes. The other type is the so-called qualitative states. So when

15:18.640 --> 15:25.600
I looked at this lady's lovely future-coloured cardigan, I have a certain experience. Okay,

15:25.600 --> 15:30.040
there's something that it's like for me to see that cardigan. There's something that

15:30.040 --> 15:35.480
it's like for me to see these chairs. There's something it's like for me to be in pain or

15:35.480 --> 15:40.800
to feel a tickle or something like that. And these are qualitative states. They're states

15:40.800 --> 15:47.800
that have a quality to them. So I'm sure you can do your own rough and ready distinction

15:47.800 --> 15:54.720
now into states that have a certain raw feel to them and states that are attitudes to propositions.

15:55.440 --> 16:02.560
Why do we think these exist? Well, how could I possibly explain your behaviour without citing

16:02.560 --> 16:08.960
desires, beliefs, intentions, hopes, fears? You know, why did she suddenly get up and leave

16:08.960 --> 16:16.080
the room? Answer, because she suddenly realised it was the wrong lecture. She suddenly realised

16:16.080 --> 16:20.360
it was the wrong lecture. So she had a belief about what the right lecture was. She suddenly

16:20.360 --> 16:26.600
came to believe that this was the wrong lecture. So she formed an intention to leave the room.

16:26.600 --> 16:32.160
So in order to explain your behaviour, I postulate all sorts of beliefs and desires. But here's another

16:32.160 --> 16:42.160
little story. Woodlice. Why do woodlice congregate under rocks and things? Tell me. It's dark.

16:42.160 --> 16:49.200
Why do woodlice congregate where it's dark? Because they want to be safe or something

16:49.200 --> 17:01.440
like that. OK. And they believe it's safe under rocks. OK. You're a bit reluctant to attribute beliefs, are you?

17:01.440 --> 17:15.400
Well, don't give my story away. Yep, absolutely. OK. When we first see a woodlice and certainly if

17:15.480 --> 17:20.600
we're speaking to a child or something like that, we would use belief, desire, psychology

17:20.600 --> 17:26.840
to explain woodlice behaviour, because that's what comes very easily to us. So woodlice believe

17:26.840 --> 17:32.320
that it's safe under rocks and they want to be safe so they intend to go under rocks. As

17:32.320 --> 17:37.520
a matter of fact, the correct explanation of woodlice behaviour is that they embody a

17:37.520 --> 17:44.680
mechanism such that when it's dry around them, they move. And they move in a speed that's

17:44.680 --> 17:52.160
determined by how dry it is around them. And as it gets damper, they come to a halt.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.680
And incidentally, they move in whatever direction they happen to be pointed. They don't sort

17:55.680 --> 18:00.800
of turn around and make for that rock. If they're standing in that direction, there's a rock

18:00.800 --> 18:04.800
over there, they'll go for that one. Except they're not going for that one, are they? They're

18:04.800 --> 18:09.960
being pushed by the dryness. Now, once you know that explanation, have I got it right?

18:10.360 --> 18:16.480
That's right. I wasn't going to use technical terminology, but they are. Okay, so that's

18:16.480 --> 18:21.160
the proper explanation of woodlice behaviour. Once you know about canises like this, you

18:21.160 --> 18:25.880
can explain the behaviour of any woodlouse anywhere at all, as long as it's a normal

18:25.880 --> 18:32.560
woodlouse, anywhere at all at any time. Once you know that, belief desires have been made

18:32.560 --> 18:39.320
redundant, haven't they? Why should you postulate woodlice beliefs now or woodlice desires? In

18:39.320 --> 18:45.280
fact, all their behaviour is explicable in terms of things like canises. They're not

18:45.280 --> 18:51.040
all canises, but they're things like that. What about your behaviour? Can I explain your

18:51.040 --> 18:55.560
behaviour? Well, a lot of your behaviour, I can explain. If I chuck my chalk at you,

18:55.560 --> 19:01.520
that shows how old I am, doesn't it? If I chuck my chalk at you, you're going to duck.

19:01.520 --> 19:07.920
That's not a desire or belief-driven behaviour. That's just a hardwired response to the fact

19:07.920 --> 19:11.840
that you see something coming towards you. If you put your hands on a hot plate, do the

19:11.840 --> 19:16.880
same thing. So a lot of your behaviour, and that's just one, if you hear an ambulance

19:16.880 --> 19:20.880
coming, you'll move out of the way. That's a classically conditioned response. A lot of

19:20.880 --> 19:26.200
your behaviour doesn't need to be explained by appeal to beliefs and desires, but much

19:26.200 --> 19:31.640
of it does, and this is why we postulate beliefs and desires. This is why we say that beliefs

19:31.640 --> 19:38.080
and desires exist, but perhaps ethologists, people who study animal behaviour, are going

19:38.080 --> 19:44.760
to find out one day that we can explain all our behaviour in terms of brain states,

19:44.760 --> 19:51.600
and it might be that we can, one time in the future, we'll be able to saw off the skull

19:51.600 --> 19:57.000
of newborn babies and fit a perspect dome instead, so that we don't have to go in for

19:57.000 --> 20:01.400
all this interpretation, which we're actually not very good at, is it, trying to find out

20:01.400 --> 20:05.400
what we're all going to do instead? We can just look at somebody's brain and say, ah,

20:05.400 --> 20:10.200
okay, I know what you're going to do. Perhaps we'll all wear woolly hats so we can surprise

20:10.200 --> 20:16.120
people or something like that. But do you see, if we could explain all our behaviour

20:16.120 --> 20:22.880
without appealing to beliefs and desires, we'd no more have reason to think you had a mind

20:22.880 --> 20:30.600
than we do to think woodlice do. So, again, the question, do mental states exist, is a

20:30.600 --> 20:37.680
huge question. Lots of people try and reduce mental states to physical states, and then

20:37.680 --> 20:43.040
explain physical states, it's much easier to explain physical states than mental states,

20:43.040 --> 20:48.520
but if you don't want to be a reductionist, if you want to say you cannot reduce mental

20:48.520 --> 20:53.600
states to physical states, and there are all sorts of reasons to think you can't, then

20:53.600 --> 20:57.160
you're going to have to postulate mental states, you're going to have to postulate

20:57.160 --> 21:04.600
contents and qualia, and the minute you do, you're going to have problems with functionalism,

21:04.600 --> 21:11.360
with physics being able ever to understand mental states, and my goodness, you might

21:11.360 --> 21:17.680
end up having to postulate God or something again, or maybe not, we don't know. So, again,

21:17.680 --> 21:22.680
the question is, what is this? Does it exist at all? If it does exist, can we reduce it

21:22.680 --> 21:28.000
to something else? If we can't reduce it to something else, what is its nature? Here's

21:28.000 --> 21:33.280
another one, what about possibilities? Okay, I might have been wearing jeans, mightn't I?

21:33.280 --> 21:40.400
Okay, that's a possibility. And what's more, it's a possibility that's actual, isn't it?

21:40.400 --> 21:49.360
It's an actual possibility. Well, what is a possibility? What's the nature of a possibility?

21:49.360 --> 21:56.360
It's not something that actually exists, is it? Okay, so maybe we've got to postulate

21:56.360 --> 22:00.080
a different sort of existence now. There are things that actually exist, and there are

22:00.080 --> 22:05.420
things that possibly exist, and there are things that don't even possibly exist. So,

22:05.420 --> 22:12.600
there are square circles that don't even possibly exist. Unicorns might they exist

22:12.600 --> 22:19.080
or not? Marianne's wearing jeans certainly is an existing possibility. Do you see what

22:19.080 --> 22:24.720
I mean? You're now getting layers of existence, different levels of existence. Well, and that

22:24.720 --> 22:33.160
little kitten on the floor down there, is it fat? You're looked. You understood what

22:33.160 --> 22:38.280
my words were. Don't you need to postulate a little kitten down there in order to give

22:38.280 --> 22:44.600
meaning to my words? Some people have thought that. If you do, then that little kitten exists,

22:44.600 --> 22:54.080
it doesn't exist like Ann does, so you need again another layer of existence. Well, some

22:54.080 --> 23:00.320
people have said that it's not really existence. Let's call it persistence instead. But the

23:00.320 --> 23:05.800
thing is you've got to say, if you say that every, in order for you to understand the

23:05.800 --> 23:11.400
meaning of that little kitten is fat, there needs to be a concept of a kitten or a kitten

23:11.400 --> 23:16.400
or something. There's a kitten that gives meaning to the words, but it's not an existing

23:16.400 --> 23:21.640
kitten like the kitten that some of you may have at home. So, it's a persisting kitten

23:21.640 --> 23:28.680
or an imaginary kitten is another way of thinking about it. But do imaginary kittens exist? Well,

23:28.680 --> 23:36.480
do they? In imagination, there you are. There's another way of thinking of it. So, it's existence,

23:36.480 --> 23:40.040
different types of existence. There's existence in the real world and there's existence in

23:40.040 --> 23:45.560
your imagination. There's existence in novels. I mean, when it comes up, this little kitten

23:45.560 --> 23:49.240
down here, it could be black ginger or anything, couldn't it? I haven't told you anything about

23:49.240 --> 23:55.360
what it's like. But we all know that Sherlock Holmes wore a deastalker, didn't we? Did he?

23:55.360 --> 23:59.840
Something like that, wasn't it? Okay, so they've got, again, different levels of existence.

23:59.840 --> 24:07.600
We all know that unicorns have horns. Well, there aren't any unicorns. Well, how can unicorns

24:07.600 --> 24:15.640
have horns if there aren't any? Do you see? Anyway, so, do possibilities exist is a really

24:15.640 --> 24:19.920
difficult one. That's the sort of thing that leads people to postulate the existence of

24:19.920 --> 24:24.440
possible worlds. And I think I've mentioned possible worlds to you before. Lots of people

24:24.440 --> 24:29.280
postulate possible worlds, but they're not realists about possible worlds. Mathematicians,

24:29.280 --> 24:35.400
logicians, physicists, many of them, all those disciplines postulate possible worlds. Not

24:35.400 --> 24:40.000
all people in those disciplines do. But if you postulate possible worlds, you can see

24:40.000 --> 24:47.200
possible worlds as reducing to possible situations in this world, or you can see possible worlds

24:47.200 --> 24:54.880
as real. And David Lewis, very famous philosopher, postulated the reality of possible worlds.

24:54.880 --> 24:59.080
And he said, well, I've never really heard a very good argument against them. A look

24:59.080 --> 25:07.560
of blank astonishment doesn't count as an argument. What about physical objects? Well,

25:07.560 --> 25:14.040
you might say, well, obviously they exist. How can I deny that that exists? Okay, well,

25:14.040 --> 25:19.200
let's do a Cartesian thought experiment. In fact, let's do the Cartesian thought experiment

25:19.200 --> 25:32.160
when I have some water. Descartes was interested in the fact that we know that some of our beliefs

25:32.160 --> 25:38.600
are false. But in the very nature of things, we don't know which those beliefs are. You

25:38.600 --> 25:42.640
see what I mean? Would you like to tell me for sure that all your beliefs are true?

25:42.640 --> 25:59.440
Right? Okay, what about you? No, it isn't. No, no, a lot of your beliefs are false. I guarantee.

25:59.440 --> 26:10.760
If you believe it, you believe that it's true, that doesn't make it true. Does it? No. You believe

26:10.840 --> 26:16.440
it's true exactly. But this is the problem with beliefs. Every belief you have, you believe

26:16.440 --> 26:22.600
it's true because that's what a belief is. To have the attitude of belief towards a particular

26:22.600 --> 26:29.880
content is to assent to, as philosophers would say, that content. So in believing that this

26:29.880 --> 26:37.720
chair is blue, there's the content, that chair is blue, and I assent to it. I say that is true.

26:37.720 --> 26:43.480
That's what a belief is. But, of course, I may be wrong. I may be colourblind or something like that.

26:47.480 --> 26:51.880
Well, given the circumstances in this case, I probably would say I know. But the fact is,

26:51.880 --> 26:56.440
let's not bother about that. I was just offering that as a... But you have beliefs about a lot

26:56.440 --> 27:01.480
of things. The question is, you know that many of those beliefs are false, but you don't know

27:01.480 --> 27:07.480
which they are. And in the very nature of things, anything that you believe, you believe to be

27:07.480 --> 27:12.840
true because that's what truth is. You cannot have a belief that you don't believe to be true.

27:13.400 --> 27:18.440
But you do know that not all your beliefs are true. Well, Descartes became very

27:18.440 --> 27:23.000
interested in this, and he said, well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take myself away from

27:23.000 --> 27:27.960
the world. In the world, we have to assume that our beliefs are true because we have to act on them.

27:28.920 --> 27:32.840
So in believing that chair is blue, if I'm looking for something to match it, I'll go and look for

27:32.840 --> 27:38.600
something blue. We have to act on our beliefs. He's going to put himself away and think, okay,

27:38.600 --> 27:45.160
how do I know that my beliefs are true? What is it that justifies me in believing that my beliefs

27:45.160 --> 27:56.440
are true? And he thought, the method I'm going to use to do this is to treat as if false any belief

27:56.440 --> 28:03.240
I can entertain the slightest doubt about. So if the belief that I believe to be true could be

28:03.240 --> 28:09.560
false, I'm going to put it on one side as if it really is false. And by that means hope to find

28:09.560 --> 28:17.000
something that I can that is absolutely certain. And from that, maybe I can build up the rest of

28:17.000 --> 28:21.320
my knowledge. So it's a bit like, you know, some of the apples in your baskets are rotten, but you

28:21.320 --> 28:25.640
don't know which they are. So you take each one out and any that's a little bruised, you put on

28:25.640 --> 28:30.760
one side as being maybe that's rotten. And you hope to be left with only the good apples in the

28:30.760 --> 28:36.040
basket. So Descartes wanted to look at his beliefs and say, if there's any about which I can entertain

28:36.040 --> 28:41.880
the slightest doubt, I'm going to treat it as if false. Okay, so he's not saying that his beliefs

28:41.880 --> 28:48.440
are false. He's saying it's as if they're false for this. So first, he went down three levels of doubt.

28:48.440 --> 29:02.280
The first one was the argument from illusion. Okay, the argument from illusion tells us that,

29:03.720 --> 29:08.680
well, our senses have deceived us. I expect all of you have been deceived by your senses. Sometimes

29:08.680 --> 29:12.440
you've got home that wonderful skirt that you thought would go so well with that blouse and

29:12.440 --> 29:17.640
you've got the colour wrong. The lights in this shop were the wrong colour or something like that.

29:17.640 --> 29:22.760
We've all been deceived by our senses at some time. Well, if we've all been deceived by our senses

29:22.760 --> 29:28.040
at some time, should we take all the beliefs that we base on our senses and put them in the

29:28.040 --> 29:35.000
doubting basket, treat them as if they're false? Should we? If our senses has deceived us, should

29:35.000 --> 29:41.800
we treat all our sensory beliefs as false? Okay, put your hands up if you think yes.

29:41.800 --> 29:50.600
Okay, put your hand up if you think no. Okay, now tell me why you think no.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.720
Why must there be that possibility?

30:05.880 --> 30:11.400
Well, hang on, we've got two lots of can'ts nose here. What we're suggesting is that your senses

30:11.400 --> 30:17.720
have sometimes deceived you. Does that mean you can never be sure that your senses are not deceiving

30:17.720 --> 30:26.920
you now? No, you can't be sure. So sometimes we do trust our senses, don't we? I mean, as a matter

30:26.920 --> 30:36.440
of fact, how do you know that your senses have deceived you? Well, hang on, you experiment,

30:36.440 --> 30:42.440
you prove it. How? How do you do this? Through your senses. Can you give me an example? Possibly not.

30:47.400 --> 30:54.520
Woo, yes. Yes, good one. Okay. So your belief that it was heavy, although that's actually not

30:54.520 --> 31:00.920
a sensory belief, probably, is it? Well, yes, because you put so much anticipated. No, no, but it's

31:01.480 --> 31:06.840
when your belief that the frying pan was heavy, you can't really look at a frying pan and tell it's

31:06.840 --> 31:12.200
going to be heavier. Maybe you can, maybe you can. Let me give you Descartes own example, because I

31:12.200 --> 31:19.960
think it's a good one. Descartes said, if you put a stick in water and it looks bent, okay, you've got

31:19.960 --> 31:25.800
reason for thinking that the stick is bent. You take it out of water, woo, it's straight. You've got

31:25.800 --> 31:30.120
reason for thinking the stick's straight. Well, okay, there are two possibilities, maybe. When you

31:30.120 --> 31:37.480
put the stick in water, it bends it, or maybe it just appears bent. So how do you test this? You put

31:37.480 --> 31:43.480
your hands in the water, you feel the stick when it's underwater and low, it's straight. Okay, so

31:43.480 --> 31:49.000
you've now got two reasons for thinking the stick's straight and only one. But the thing is, you

31:49.000 --> 31:56.920
couldn't even know that your senses were deceiving you unless you rely on your senses. So all we got

31:56.920 --> 32:03.480
to hear from the argument from illusion is that we know that not all our sensory beliefs are true,

32:04.200 --> 32:09.720
not all our sensory beliefs are true. Sometimes, usually in

32:12.280 --> 32:20.520
unusual psychooptimal conditions, or maybe not unusual, but not perfect psycho physical conditions,

32:20.600 --> 32:27.400
our sensory beliefs deceive us. But you can't go from the universal possibility of illusion

32:27.960 --> 32:35.080
to the possibility of universal illusion. Would you like me to say that again? No? Oh, I like saying

32:35.080 --> 32:42.120
that. Would you like me to say it again? Thank you. Thank you. You cannot go from the universal

32:42.120 --> 32:51.160
possibility of illusion to the possibility of universal illusion. Are you with me? Okay, so all

32:51.160 --> 32:58.120
those who said no, you're right. We do know that our senses sometimes deceive us, but that doesn't

32:58.120 --> 33:04.600
tell us that we can put all our sensory beliefs into the doubting basket, because we would never

33:04.600 --> 33:10.760
know that our senses deceive us unless we rely on our senses. So that's the first argument. The

33:10.760 --> 33:19.560
second argument that Descartes went to was the argument from the demon, the demon argument,

33:19.560 --> 33:26.600
rather than the argument from the demon. The demon, sorry, the demon, anyone who knows what

33:26.600 --> 33:31.800
they're talking about will know that I'm talking rubbish. The second one was the dream, the argument

33:31.800 --> 33:38.840
from dreaming. Okay, so you're sitting here, you're in the fire, the lights are on, everything's fine,

33:38.920 --> 33:43.080
you're looking at your hands in front of you. How can you doubt that? Your senses aren't deceiving

33:43.080 --> 33:47.960
you now, are they? But on the other hand, says Descartes, haven't you ever been in the situation

33:47.960 --> 33:53.720
where everything has seemed to you to be a certain way, and then you've suddenly woken up

33:54.280 --> 34:00.600
and found it wasn't that way at all? So it looks as if all the sensory evidence is in, and yet

34:01.880 --> 34:06.360
you're still wrong, your belief is false. So you believe that the hand is in front of you.

34:06.360 --> 34:12.200
It's exactly with you as it would be if your hand was in front of you, but your hand's not in

34:12.200 --> 34:18.360
front of you. As a matter of fact, you're dreaming. Okay, does that mean we should put all our sensory

34:18.360 --> 34:26.360
beliefs in the doubting basket? Put your hands up if you think yes. Put your hand up if you think no.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.120
You're beginning to get this now, aren't you? Why not?

34:30.120 --> 34:36.120
Man in white or beigey sort of jumper.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.680
Sorry, I've picked on you and you don't have to.

34:49.880 --> 34:55.080
Okay, would anyone else like to answer? Why can we not put all our sensory beliefs in the

34:55.080 --> 35:01.480
doubting basket now? Because we wake up, and what does that tell us?

35:05.160 --> 35:11.080
That we're not always asleep exactly, that sometimes our beliefs are true. Sometimes when I've

35:11.080 --> 35:15.400
got my hand in front of me like that and I'm thinking my hand's in front of me, I am awake,

35:15.400 --> 35:22.040
and the reason I know that is because if I didn't wake up, I couldn't know I was dreaming. So it's

35:22.040 --> 35:28.200
exactly the same structure of arguments as in the first one. But where has we got rid of all

35:28.200 --> 35:35.000
sensory beliefs that have formed in suboptimal psychophysical conditions here? Here, we've got

35:35.000 --> 35:40.680
rid of a lot more, haven't we? Why? Do you want to? No, I was going to say that, but how do you know

35:40.680 --> 35:45.240
you've woken up? That might be part of the dream we're talking about. Well, it's a contrast, isn't it?

35:45.320 --> 35:50.840
Well, there are people who don't have that occasionally. I understand that it's very rare, but there are people who go

35:51.720 --> 35:56.360
through this cycle of thinking they've woken up and then they wake up again themselves.

35:56.840 --> 36:03.000
Right, but in order to know that they are like that, they must have woken up.

36:07.480 --> 36:13.960
Well, okay, but with you, I'm quite sure you've had lucid dreams where you've had the dream and

36:13.960 --> 36:18.360
suddenly you've woken up and you've thought, wow, you know, who could have believed that I was dreaming.

36:21.320 --> 36:25.560
Sometimes you can know your dream, but it's the lucid dream that's good for this one.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.960
But what have we lost here? What's in the doubting basket now?

36:32.840 --> 36:38.040
No, instantly, there's another thing I want you to notice that lots of people think, I mean, it's

36:38.040 --> 36:44.920
hell, sheer hell being a philosopher as a party. Because when people find out you're a philosopher,

36:44.920 --> 36:51.320
they're going for little games like, oh, good, tell me that this exists. Does this exist? Why not?

36:51.320 --> 36:55.640
And you say something and they say, oh, no, it doesn't, you know, tell me how, tell me how.

36:55.640 --> 37:01.160
And they're playing a sort of skeptics game that's extremely irritating. I hope none of you ever play it.

37:01.880 --> 37:10.440
Descartes found reasons for doubting, everything. He didn't just doubt. He took beliefs he believed to be true,

37:11.160 --> 37:16.840
and he looked for a reason to doubt them. And it's only when he found a reason to doubt them

37:16.840 --> 37:25.480
that he put them on one side. So he wasn't just doubting. He wasn't playing the skeptics game.

37:25.480 --> 37:31.000
He was actually looking for reasons to doubt. So what are we lost here? What's in the doubting

37:31.000 --> 37:42.600
basket once you've got the argument from dreaming? Well, no, because when you are, you know that

37:42.600 --> 37:50.920
sometimes your belief there's a hand in front of you is correct, is true. So you don't lose

37:51.000 --> 37:54.600
that you do sometimes see your hand in front of you. But what do you lose?

37:58.600 --> 38:05.320
No. No, no, we're looking for certainty. We're wanting to know what isn't certain as a result

38:05.320 --> 38:10.760
of this. Some things are left certain. I mean, it's left certain, for example. Well, okay,

38:10.760 --> 38:20.760
I'm asking you that. What is left certain? That when you are awake, your beliefs, your sensory beliefs

38:20.760 --> 38:28.040
if they're formed in optimal psychophysical conditions are true. You still got no reason to

38:28.040 --> 38:38.360
doubt that. It's just that you can say that unless I know I'm awake, I cannot know for sure

38:39.080 --> 38:44.760
that there is a hand in front of me. Okay, do I know that I'm really awake? Answer no, I don't,

38:44.760 --> 38:52.360
because I could be having a lucid dream. But I do know that hands exist and that I can see them

38:52.360 --> 38:58.280
and that chairs exist and that I can see them. Or if you don't like that, because I can, in our

38:58.280 --> 39:04.440
dreams, we sometimes put together things in strange ways. I can know that blue exists and that

39:06.200 --> 39:11.560
so you can go to simple things, horses, horns, whiteness, things like that. The simple things

39:11.560 --> 39:17.720
from which we build up complex things. I know that they exist. So we're losing something of the

39:17.720 --> 39:23.240
world here, but we haven't lost the whole world yet. There's still an awful lot that we know. I don't

39:23.240 --> 39:31.400
know anything to be true now, but I do have reason to believe that it is true. It is true sometimes,

39:31.400 --> 39:37.800
i.e. when I'm awake and I have these reasons to believe things. But then we get down to the demon argument.

39:37.960 --> 39:46.600
And at the demon argument, Descartes says, okay, well, I'm assuming, aren't I, that

39:49.000 --> 39:54.360
these experiences that I have as of my hands and of blwness and so on, I'm assuming that these

39:54.360 --> 40:01.720
experiences are actually caused by something outside myself and that the experience that I have

40:01.720 --> 40:10.840
is a guide to the nature of the cause of these experiences. So my experience of blwness as of

40:10.840 --> 40:17.480
a blue chair is causing me to think that that experience is being caused by a chair that's

40:17.480 --> 40:30.680
blue. And you've got a problem here because in order to know that A causes B, you've got to be here,

40:30.680 --> 40:37.960
haven't you? You've got to see a correlation between A and B. In the same way to know that A

40:37.960 --> 40:44.440
resembles B, you've got to be able to see both A and B. But are we ever in this position with

40:45.480 --> 40:55.000
respect to our experiences and the causes of our experience? Never. We're always here,

40:55.080 --> 41:01.720
aren't we? Didn't leave enough room for my arrow. We experience the world, if you like,

41:01.720 --> 41:08.680
through our experiences. We can never get outside our experiences to see what the world is like,

41:08.680 --> 41:16.200
to see what's causing these experiences. So it could be that our experiences are caused by

41:16.200 --> 41:23.320
something completely other than we take them to be caused by. So here's the demon. Sorry, I know it

41:23.400 --> 41:30.200
looks like a cat, but it's a demon. The demon opens up a gap between our experiences themselves

41:30.200 --> 41:35.240
and the causes of those experiences, and it actually says, how do we even know these experiences

41:35.240 --> 41:42.040
are caused? Why aren't they just experiences? One following the other, following the other,

41:42.040 --> 41:46.840
following the other. And there's nothing out there at all. And actually Descartes at that point

41:46.840 --> 41:52.600
says, I can't do this. I'm going to put the demon there because I find it impossible to believe

41:52.600 --> 41:59.480
there's nothing other than my experiences. But I can think that there's some cause of my

41:59.480 --> 42:05.400
experiences, which is completely other than I take it to be. And some people have tried putting

42:05.400 --> 42:11.240
evil scientists in here, but that doesn't work because an evil scientist isn't magic.

42:12.440 --> 42:17.480
What you're trying to do, the demon is just there because it's impossible to imagine that your

42:17.480 --> 42:23.960
experiences don't have causes at all. So you're putting something there so that there is a cause,

42:23.960 --> 42:40.120
but the cause is completely other than you take it to be. He didn't panic for that reason. No,

42:40.120 --> 42:44.680
he just literally couldn't wrap his mind around the idea that there's nothing outside causing

42:44.760 --> 42:51.800
your experiences. You try it. It's really very difficult to get yourself to the point where

42:51.800 --> 43:00.920
you understand that there might be no physical world at all. Your experiences could be exactly

43:00.920 --> 43:11.000
as they are, even though nothing else exists. So all there is is Ann's experiences as of

43:11.640 --> 43:15.320
Marianne giving a lecture in philosophy. There's no Marianne, there's no philosophy,

43:15.320 --> 43:20.920
there's no lecture, there's no blue chair. But it does seem to me very similar to what people have

43:21.880 --> 43:27.560
of is this experience all a half. It's a frightening experience. It's nothing beyond that.

43:29.560 --> 43:34.760
But it's nothing to do with God. Oh, no. I said that sometimes white people want to have a God.

43:35.480 --> 43:40.360
Yes. I didn't actually say about God. I just said people worry that there is nothing after death.

43:41.000 --> 43:47.560
Okay, but this is a different thing because it's not worrying about that sort of thing.

43:48.040 --> 43:52.840
But it is a worrying thought. I mean, we want our beliefs about the external world to be true,

43:52.840 --> 43:58.200
don't we? And yet what's happening is that we're discovering that what Descartes said was that

43:58.920 --> 44:06.280
actually, once you've done this thought experiment, you realise that there's the world

44:06.280 --> 44:17.960
and there's your picture of the world. Okay, all your beliefs that you've formed about the world

44:17.960 --> 44:24.920
and you go through the world updating your beliefs all the time. But once you've retreated

44:24.920 --> 44:34.280
into your picture of your picture of the world, which should be here, but I ran out of room,

44:34.840 --> 44:42.520
the world actually becomes unnecessary because if all there was was this,

44:43.720 --> 44:48.920
you couldn't ever get outside to see whether this is there or not. So once you've pushed yourself

44:48.920 --> 44:57.160
back into a reflective position, you see that the world that you picture is quite different

44:57.160 --> 45:03.000
from your picture of the world and that your picture of the world could be exactly as it is,

45:03.000 --> 45:09.640
even though the world was completely different. And that's the Cartesian thought experiment.

45:09.640 --> 45:17.480
That's hyperbolical doubt. At this point, you've started the question of how can we know? I mean,

45:17.480 --> 45:23.480
we do take ourselves to know that there's an external world, a physical world out there.

45:23.480 --> 45:32.040
But what possible justification could we have for this, given that all we can do is go and look

45:32.040 --> 45:40.680
for more experiences? And our experiences are exactly what we are asking. Are they caused by

45:40.680 --> 45:46.920
something? And if so, what? I can't step outside my experience. Of course, no scientific experiment

45:46.920 --> 45:53.240
is going to tell you the answer between, are my experiences caused by an external world,

45:53.240 --> 45:59.400
or are they caused by an evil demon? There's no, I can't go down and say, oh, is it a chair?

45:59.480 --> 46:02.200
Oh, yes. Here we are. It's a chair. Why can't I do that?

46:05.480 --> 46:10.440
All I'm doing is giving myself more experiences, aren't I? I'm now having a tactile experience

46:10.440 --> 46:14.920
as well as a visual experience, and there's an auditory one there as well. But I mean,

46:14.920 --> 46:23.640
there are only more experiences, aren't they? Who are you? Hang on. I'm having another experience

46:23.720 --> 46:29.640
at this moment. It's an auditory one. It's as of someone.

46:33.240 --> 46:38.280
They do, but no, no, hang on. You haven't got yourself into hyperbolical doubt, has she?

46:38.920 --> 46:41.000
Why hasn't she got into hyperbolical doubt?

46:41.000 --> 46:47.480
She's not looking at her picture of her picture of the world.

46:49.000 --> 46:55.240
Yes, she still thinks that I should think that she exists.

46:58.840 --> 47:05.080
I have very good reason to think I'm having experiences as of a female wearing maroon sitting

47:05.080 --> 47:10.280
in front of me who's speaking to me, but these are just more of my experiences, aren't I?

47:10.360 --> 47:15.800
I can no more get outside my experiences to check whether Ann's really there and whether

47:15.800 --> 47:20.520
she's really telling me what I think she's telling me than I can to see whether the chair is there.

47:20.520 --> 47:26.120
All I've got is more experiences. So all I've got is more of this

47:29.160 --> 47:35.880
here, and I still haven't got this, which is what I need. So there's no point in looking for

47:35.880 --> 47:43.880
corroboration, which is why there can't be any scientific way of testing which hypothesis is true.

47:43.880 --> 47:51.880
So here I have my experience in the external world. Of those, I can be certain. I'm absolutely sure

47:51.880 --> 47:59.880
now that I'm having experiences as of a lecture theatre, etc. What I want to know is are those

47:59.880 --> 48:06.600
experiences causing me to form beliefs that are true, i.e. there is a lecture theatre. Now notice

48:06.600 --> 48:11.960
the difference between I believe there's a lecture theatre and there is a lecture theatre.

48:13.400 --> 48:19.560
The latter is metaphysics, isn't it? The former is histomology. I can be certain of the former.

48:19.560 --> 48:26.280
I can be certain of my own beliefs, but I can't be certain that these beliefs are true, can I?

48:26.280 --> 48:35.080
And it's at this level of hyperbolical doubt, at the third level of doubt that you start to wonder

48:35.880 --> 48:42.360
do physical objects exist at all. Interestingly, Descartes thought that you could show that they

48:42.360 --> 48:48.760
did. Descartes wasn't a sceptic. Lots of people think he was, but in fact he wasn't. He did this sceptical

48:49.560 --> 48:57.960
thought experiment in order to pre-empt scepticism. He ended up believing in the existence of a physical

48:57.960 --> 49:01.320
world, but he thought it was necessary to believe in God first.

49:08.040 --> 49:13.480
That's right. Cogito ergo sum. And the reason he did that, can anyone think why he did that,

49:13.560 --> 49:19.480
thinking of what I told you so far? What's that? That's right. Once you've got yourself back

49:19.480 --> 49:26.040
into your picture of your picture of the world and your inability to determine the existence of

49:26.040 --> 49:31.160
the world that you picture, the only thing of which you can be certain is that you're thinking,

49:31.960 --> 49:39.160
isn't it? So here's my belief. The content of my belief is

49:39.640 --> 49:44.280
the chair is blue.

49:49.080 --> 49:55.400
I've got the attitude of belief towards that. I've now got another attitude, which is that of

49:55.400 --> 50:04.120
doubt towards that belief. Do you see what I mean? You can't doubt your own beliefs without seeing

50:04.120 --> 50:09.880
that you have these beliefs. And that's what Descartes says. He said, the very act of doubting

50:10.520 --> 50:20.440
makes me see that I believe. And if I believe, I exist. I don't know what I am like, but I exist

50:20.440 --> 50:28.840
because I exist as a thinking thing, as a thing that thinks. So I think, therefore I am, is because

50:28.840 --> 50:35.320
that, once you've been in hyperbolical doubt, that is the only certainty you have. You actually

50:35.320 --> 50:39.400
have a few more about what you think, but you don't need to. I think, therefore, I exist

50:40.360 --> 50:46.040
encapsulates it rather neatly, I think. But you see, you cannot doubt your own beliefs without

50:46.040 --> 50:51.160
seeing that you do believe something or other. All you don't know is whether that belief is true.

50:51.720 --> 51:03.320
Could I come back to the argument from illusions and just sort of question around,

51:05.320 --> 51:10.760
we're saying, talking about our sense data and so on shows that they're wonderful.

51:11.960 --> 51:18.200
However, sometimes those are what? Sometimes those are true or can be believed.

51:19.160 --> 51:26.200
But if you, I mean, looking at evidence, for example, from physics about the nature of the

51:26.200 --> 51:33.160
universe, about sort of wave particle forms, about what the nature of the matter is, all that kind

51:33.160 --> 51:39.800
of stuff, what we're seeing is an extremely distorted view of reality. Looking at the evidence

51:39.800 --> 51:46.520
from psychology, our perception is a highly flawed, all our senses are highly flawed, our brains

51:46.520 --> 51:53.400
are constantly filling in stuff that's around the edges and doing all kinds of fiddling about with

51:54.280 --> 52:02.760
what actually might or might not be out there. So, actually, we know pretty much what we are

52:02.760 --> 52:13.240
experiencing. Much of it is an illusion. I'm afraid that, in what you're saying, you'll make it clear

52:13.320 --> 52:15.960
that you haven't got into hyperbolical doubt either.

52:18.200 --> 52:19.160
Well, in that case,

52:31.320 --> 52:36.840
well, we can, but we can agree with all that and accept. I mean, all Day Cuts asking is,

52:36.840 --> 52:43.640
can we be certain that our experiences are being caused by anything? Secondly, can we be

52:43.640 --> 52:48.840
certain that our experiences are a good guide to what there is? Now, what you're saying is that the

52:48.840 --> 52:55.800
second, we know empirically that the answer to the second question is no. But, of course,

52:55.800 --> 52:59.400
for him, the most important question is the first one, not the second one.

52:59.400 --> 53:03.240
Is there evidence coming out about the nature of consciousness in the cell,

53:04.120 --> 53:14.040
which the implication is that what we may perceive as being ourself is actually, again, quite illusory?

53:15.800 --> 53:21.960
Yes, sure. But this is more grist to Descartes mill. It's either irrelevant,

53:22.040 --> 53:29.480
excuse me, or it's grist to Descartes mill. I mean, you can add these in, if you like,

53:29.480 --> 53:34.840
to the argument from illusion. But the argument from illusion is only the first step of Descartes

53:34.840 --> 53:41.240
argument. And the step that really matters is this one. And that's the one that takes us

53:41.240 --> 53:47.400
to hyperbolical doubt. And that's very definitely a philosophical or metaphysical question,

53:47.400 --> 53:51.400
not an empirical one. There's no way science can show us.

53:56.600 --> 54:01.480
Well, there still is, but the empiricism is nothing more than me testing out one experience

54:01.480 --> 54:06.600
against another, which is a bit like testing out one newspaper against another. It's not going

54:06.600 --> 54:32.600
to get you very far. Well, doubting is a form of thinking. No, you can't bring in other people.

54:36.920 --> 54:43.160
No, you can't. You can't bring in other people at all. The doubting is not what you're certain of

54:44.360 --> 54:51.240
by doubting is that you believe. Because in order to doubt, the thing that you doubt is a belief of

54:51.240 --> 55:00.520
your own. Well, exactly. A belief is a thought. It's a type of thought. So you're doubting that

55:00.520 --> 55:07.320
you're thinking and you try and doubt whether you're thinking and you will become completely

55:07.320 --> 55:15.400
certain that you're thinking. And so Descartes says, isn't it strange because I would have thought

55:15.400 --> 55:21.800
that the world was far more present to me than my own thoughts. In fact, my own thoughts have

55:21.800 --> 55:27.960
always seemed to be rather shadowy things that I'm not really certain of at all. I can't hold

55:27.960 --> 55:33.560
them or see them or touch them or so on. But having done this, I now see that my thoughts are far

55:33.560 --> 55:42.600
more certain to me than the external world, which could be nothing. So he thinks he's gone from

55:42.600 --> 55:48.040
something or he's found something really surprising once you move from the perspective of

55:50.280 --> 55:57.800
picturing your world. So I'm thinking of the world that I picture, not my picture of the world.

55:57.800 --> 56:02.360
Usually the only time I'm thinking of my picture of the world is when something's gone wrong.

56:03.480 --> 56:10.120
I thought I hung my coat here. I believed I hung my coat here. I now have reason to believe it isn't

56:10.120 --> 56:16.440
there. What's gone wrong? So I've been pushed back into my picture of my picture of the world

56:16.440 --> 56:22.840
in order to question whether my belief is true or false. But of course, usually I come back almost

56:22.840 --> 56:28.920
immediately. Oh, there it is. And so I immediately move back into my picture of the world, looking at

56:28.920 --> 56:36.200
the world. But what Descartes did is he forced himself to stay here, where what he was reflecting

56:36.200 --> 56:42.600
on was his picture of the world rather than the world that he pictured. So he's looking at his

56:42.600 --> 56:48.200
beliefs and thinking, are they true? Are they false? Are they justified? Are they not? Instead of

56:48.200 --> 56:54.200
looking at the chair and thinking, is it blue? Is it hard? Is it okay? Do you see why people are out

56:54.200 --> 57:04.760
here, not in here? Ann isn't a belief. My belief about Ann is a belief. But Ann is here. And Marianne's

57:04.760 --> 57:15.640
belief about Ann is what I am certain of. But I'm certain of it until I doubt it. And the minute

57:15.640 --> 57:21.960
I doubt it, I can be certain of that belief, but I can't be certain that it's true. So whatever

57:21.960 --> 57:35.720
Ann says is just more of my experiences. Ann, say, that's right. I believe that Ann says it's blue,

57:35.720 --> 57:43.000
and I know that my belief that Ann says it's true does not make it true that Ann says it's true.

57:43.960 --> 57:49.400
And you too will be able to do this when you become philosophers. Do you see what I mean?

57:49.400 --> 57:54.520
Once you understand what you're saying, it becomes easy to say it, although now I can't say it again.

57:55.720 --> 57:59.800
But I'll have to get the flow of it back. Do you see why people are outside?

57:59.880 --> 58:08.440
When my daughter was little, she used to think we had two houses, and she thought we had one that

58:08.440 --> 58:12.360
was down the end of the road that came from preschool, and one that came down the road from

58:12.360 --> 58:18.120
school. My cat thinks we have two houses. I'm just wondering if it, but she would have had no doubt

58:18.120 --> 58:23.480
about that belief. Was it when she began to doubt the belief, and then obviously then realised

58:24.280 --> 58:29.560
it's not quite that much, because we've only got the one house. Is that almost the doubting belief

58:29.560 --> 58:35.800
makes it real? I don't know. Well, there's a very interesting, between three and five,

58:36.600 --> 58:43.240
children actually acquire the context, the concept of a belief. And until that point,

58:43.240 --> 58:49.800
there's evidence to think that they don't properly form beliefs of their own. But there's an experiment

58:49.880 --> 58:56.440
that goes, Maxie the puppet, whoever it is who's looking after Maxie, I can't remember,

58:57.240 --> 59:02.760
puts a chocolate in a box, and then Maxie goes out to play, and the children are watching this,

59:02.760 --> 59:08.680
and Maxie's mum comes in, takes the chocolate from the box and puts it into a cupboard or something

59:08.680 --> 59:14.200
like that. Then Maxie comes in from playing, and the children are asked, where is Maxie going to

59:14.200 --> 59:20.120
look for the chocolate? Now, all the three-year-olds say in the cupboard, because that's where they

59:20.120 --> 59:25.400
believe the chocolate is. They know the chocolate is in the cupboard, so that's where they think Maxie

59:25.400 --> 59:32.600
will look. The five-year-olds will all say she'll look in the drawer, because they've understood

59:32.600 --> 59:39.240
the difference between appearance and reality. The world can appear to you to be other than the

59:39.240 --> 59:45.880
way the world is, and what your daughter did, she linked up her two beliefs and saw, oh, that house

59:45.880 --> 59:56.040
is that house. Hold was she? Yeah, she probably wasn't really having beliefs at that point.

59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.800
The thought is you don't really have a belief until you have the concept of belief, because once

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.720
it's only when you've got the concept of belief that you have the difference between appearance

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:13.000
and reality, and you see that beliefs can be either true or false, so you can grasp the concept of

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.320
conditions of truth and falsehood, and at that point you can really actually believe something,

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:24.680
whereas up until then it's just that you're just responding to a world, because the world is,

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:29.640
you don't make any distinction between the world's being one way and it's appearing one way.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:38.120
You don't see that those can come apart, no, no, except I mean we'd call it one

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:43.800
when we're speaking loosely, but no. Okay, right, let's move on a bit, because

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:51.000
I mean we've been doing a lot of epistemology here under the heading of metaphysics, but of course

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.160
actually there's the metaphysics of epistemology just to confuse you, because of course if you

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:02.360
want to know the truth about knowledge then you're doing the metaphysics of knowledge and

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:08.280
therefore the metaphysics of epistemology, so we were looking at ontology before we got onto

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:16.440
scepticism, so we asked ourselves whether these things exist, but we can then go on and ask well

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:23.240
what are they like, you know, if we believe that God exists is he all these things, how can he be

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:29.160
all these things, because surely there's contradiction here isn't there, if he's omnipotent he can do

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:34.840
anything at all, if he's omniscient he knows everything at all, and if he's benevolent or good

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:43.240
then how can he see the suffering in the world and not do something about it, so can God be all

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:49.800
those things, what about moral values, if they exist are they absolute or relative, do we all

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:55.640
have our own moral values or is there a moral law that's objective and that exists for all of us,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.880
are there different possible worlds or only different possible states of this world

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.880
and what's the difference between those two, and what about physical objects, are they independent

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:19.000
of us or bundles of our ideas, Barkley, Bishop Barkley thoughts that scepticism was so threatening

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.680
the idea that we couldn't be sure we had knowledge of the external world, that what he thought is we

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:31.160
had to build the external world from what we could be sure about, so the only thing we can be sure

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:38.360
about is our own experiences, so what is the external world other than bundles of our own

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:44.360
experiences, now this may sound daft, you know, I mean there's more to Anne than my experience if I

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:51.640
touch her she'll say ow or excuse me or something like that, but actually there again what have I got

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:59.560
other than my own experiences, auditory experiences etc, so what Barkley was saying was actually if

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:05.640
you think of all your experiences and all your counterfactual experiences, in other words if I

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:11.720
came into this room at midnight that blue chair would still be there, do you see that's a counterfactual

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:19.400
experience, I would still see that blue chair, there is no more to an object than our experiences

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:26.280
or counterfactual experiences and actually you try and convince me that you have any reason to

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:33.000
believe that the physical world exists, that doesn't appeal to either an experience of yours

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:47.640
or a counterfactual experience of yours and you'll fail, counterfactual, it is, if I came into

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:53.080
this room last night at midnight that's that's not true, I didn't come into this room at midnight I

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.760
was past the sleeping bed, but had I come into this room at midnight last night I would have seen

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:04.840
that blue chair and that's part of my reason for thinking that that blue chair exists independently

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:14.120
of me is that it was here all the time, it would still be here if I came back tomorrow, but it might

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:19.880
well exactly and so what Barkley is saying is is that there is no reason I can give for believing

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:26.600
that that chair exists that doesn't depend on either an actual experience of mine, here it exists

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.280
you know and you're having experiences of this chair now as well if you exist

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.240
or counterfactual ones if I came in tonight it would still be here, I would still see it

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:46.120
that's true but I would still okay but that's

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.600
if I had come in last night it would have been there yeah but I should be able to answer that

01:04:52.600 --> 01:05:01.160
and I can't because I'm tired, what about Boozies? If somebody had moved it I wouldn't have seen it

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:06.200
okay I might not be able to follow it but it's certainly true that I have reason to believe that

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:12.760
this chair would have been here simply because it's tied to the floor, I mean that's not conclusive

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:19.400
and that's not a very good response to what you're saying, I've no reason to think it won't be and

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:25.960
my what's more important to you try this as a thought experiment for yourself try and give

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:32.120
yourself reason to believe that something that you believe exists exists okay so you believe

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:37.880
this exists what are your reasons for believing it exists and see if you can find one that doesn't

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:45.320
depend upon your own experiences either your actual experiences I can see it feel it touch it hear it

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:51.640
or your counterfactual experiences if I was there then if I did this then if

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:59.800
do you see what I mean then I would so you won't be able to do it Barkley was much cleverer than

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:04.280
people think people tend to think that he thought of the external world as a ghostly sort of thing

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:09.880
but he's just offering another explanation for our experiences and the fact that we go from

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:15.560
these experiences to thinking there's an external world we do that immediately what why do we do

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:23.480
this okay so so this is that's metaphysics then moving to epistemology what is knowledge

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:30.840
okay do we have knowledge we've looked at that in some depth already do we have knowledge

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:36.200
Descartes would say we can't claim to have knowledge of the external world unless we can get over his

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:42.120
thought experiment which he thinks we can um what is knowledge though some people believe that

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:48.440
it's okay well let me ask you this what what is knowledge we've been talking about knowledge for

01:06:48.440 --> 01:07:02.920
the last hour and a half or something but what is it that's very optimistic of him launching out

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:15.800
like that good for you go on see for you what do you mean my gathered

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:26.200
but we have knowledge of things that don't involve senses don't we two plus two equals four is not

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:34.760
sensory knowledge so what is knowledge we collect it and put it in our brains how do you put

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:47.480
something in your brain well actually you don't um i'm not sure you intentionally acquire knowledge

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.240
anyway most of the time the knowledge you acquire isn't acquired intentionally it just

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:58.680
um sorry what did somebody else say it's certainly acquired but what is it we acquire

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:04.200
memories involved but there's a difference between memory and knowledge isn't there

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:09.960
i mean in order to remember something that something has to have happened

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:22.680
um memory is important but memory is different from knowledge it's not the same thing memory is

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:28.520
essentially time related whereas knowledge isn't essentially time related it can be time related

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:39.880
but it's not essentially so in the way that memory is yeah well and i mean there are different

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:44.040
sorts of knowledge aren't there as well i mean i know how to ride a bike well i remember

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.320
do i remember it well it's not propositional knowledge

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:56.280
okay let me tell you what one answer the classical answer to the question of what knowledge is is

01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:02.680
that it's justified true belief okay if you're going to have knowledge you must have a belief

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:12.520
that belief must be justified and that belief must be true so um you believe or you you know

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.880
that i'm wearing an aubergine dress don't you you will know that they have very good colour

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:25.080
concepts here you have a belief that i'm wearing an aubergine dress do you yep okay is that belief

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:33.000
justified how you can see it yeah okay you're justified in believing that and and let me tell

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.400
you that it's true okay so you know i'm wearing an aubergine dress so that's the idea that so if a

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:45.160
student comes to me and says well i day card said such and such and i say why do you think that

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:54.680
and he says uh i don't know and i say okay well what follows from that belief and he says um

01:09:55.720 --> 01:10:02.440
i don't know uh and i said well why do you think that and he says uh don't know

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:09.160
he doesn't know it does it does he you may have a belief about that um but it's and it what's more

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.880
it may be a true belief but it's not justified therefore it doesn't count as knowledge he doesn't

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:20.120
know it at all um if you don't have a belief about something you certainly can't know it

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.640
but the other one and the one that most people get more worried about is that

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:31.560
you cannot know something false if you cannot know that i'm wearing a yellow dress for example

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:39.240
you can believe that you know something false but your belief that you know it is itself

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:48.600
false are you with me so if you actually know something that thing must be true so maxi comes

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:55.960
in from playing and she does she know that the chocolate is in the drawer no she believes

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.720
she knows the chocolate is in the drawer but what she doesn't know is that her mum took it out

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:06.040
and put it somewhere else so she has what she thinks is knowledge but it's not knowledge because

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.920
it's not true she's got the belief she's justified in the belief but the belief isn't true therefore

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:16.520
it cannot be counted as knowledge so you've got to again make that distinction between what you believe

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:22.680
to be the case and what actually is the case because you can believe you know something that's

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:29.400
false but you cannot actually know something false this is the the crux of william morris's

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:37.000
dictum only have in your house those things which you believe to be beautiful

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:45.160
or which you know to be useful yes i'm not sure it's the crux of that but it certainly comes into it

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:53.080
yes absolutely um yeah okay so um but here's a little problem for you getty a came up with

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:59.480
this little problem it's called and it's been called ever since getty a problems um you have seen

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:11.080
me driving a um a golf gti around oxford um you've come to believe that i own a golf gti as a

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:15.800
matter of fact there is a golf gti that i own but it's in my garage and the one that you've seen

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:25.320
me driving around belongs to a friend okay do you know that i own a golf gti i believe

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:32.600
no sorry you believe that you know but do you know no you don't know why not

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.400
well it is justified no you've seen me driving around in it you're perfectly justified

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.760
it is true i've got one in the garage

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.920
no you don't know that you don't know but you don't know

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.920
that's not the point

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:59.080
why not

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:17.480
but we do usually claim about claim to have knowledge without having certainty don't we

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:24.360
i mean you've seen me driving this car often um so you know you you think you're justified in

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.240
claiming to know that i now i'll tell you what's happened here is the conditions that make your

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:35.800
belief true i.e. the car that's sitting in my garage that you've never seen me in come apart from

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:42.600
the conditions that justify your belief the golf gti you've seen me driving around in and it's only

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:48.760
if the conditions that make true your belief are the same as the conditions that justify your belief

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:55.160
that you can have knowledge uh that what you have counts as knowledge so what gti a showed is that

01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:01.880
it cannot be the case that knowledge is justified true belief justified true belief may be necessary

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:08.600
for knowledge but it's not sufficient you need some other claim that makes it impossible for the

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.600
truth's conditions
