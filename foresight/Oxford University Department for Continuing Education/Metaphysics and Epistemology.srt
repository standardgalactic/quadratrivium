8
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,940
For example, I told you that hieroclitus postulated atoms

more than 500 years BC.

10
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,940
He didn't know what they were like except that, by definition,

11
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,160
they were the unsplittables,

12
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,900
because an atom was as far as you can go.

13
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,960
An atom of water is as far as you can go.

14
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,840
Sorry, I'll have the water down here, please.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,120
I want them to drink it.

00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,120
That's all right thanks. Just stick it down on the floor there.

00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,440

Um but at some point you'll get down to something such that if you go below that

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,040
it won't be water.

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,680

Byddwn we find it, if we find it, then we're going to know more about it.

48
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,280
That's what we're doing. We've postulated it,

49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,400
we've said this is on our list of things that exist, at least as a hypothesis.

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,120
Now we want to test that hypothesis and see whether it's true.

51
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,600
Metaphysics asked questions like what's there and what's its nature.

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,200
Now, many of these questions are questions of science.

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,680
Ond felly answered those on whether it exists, and what it is like.

54
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,820
These are questions for science.

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,940
Questions like, Coresation?

56
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,740
What is Coresation, does causation exist?

57
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,320
The relation between cause and effect.

58
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,400
That's not a question for science.

59
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,920
The scientists must assume that causation exists.

60
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,540
Philosophers ask, does it?

61
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,380
And what's the nature of causation?

62
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,380
Côr, could causation go backwards?

63
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,380
For example, could there be a cause that happens after its effect?

64
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:29,380
Is causation a relation between events or between objects or between facts

65
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,380
or what are the relator of the causal relation?

66
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,380
So these are all questions of metaphysics.

67
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,380
Epistemology on the other hand is the study of knowledge.

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,080
But the study in what is the case, how it is how it is that it is and how it is

77
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,440

the other to do it with epistemology.

80
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,700
Epistemology looks at what can we know!

81
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,200
Can we for example know that the sun will rise tomorrow?

82
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,140
Do you remember the motto we looked at

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,520
induction, when we started doing logic?

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,040
Can we know it

85
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,280
Well, we don't know for certain must knowledge be certain knowledge or could it be the case

86
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,640
that we know something that we don't know we know? Do you see what I mean? What is knowledge

87
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,320
like? So, actually, I should have put that here. What is knowledge? What can we know and

88
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:04,840
how can we know it? So, for example, if there are moral values, we don't know it by sensory

89
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:13,880
perception. I never see right and wrong, certainly not through my eyes or through tactile sense

90
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,800
or anything like that. So, there must be some other way. How do we know that two plus two

91
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,560
equals four? Again, you don't see that that's the case. How do you know that all swans are

92
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,040
white? I know they're not, but let's pretend for a minute. How do you know that all ravens

93
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:36,560
are black? That's a better one. Well, let's forget Albino ones. I know what you're like.

94
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,600
I could see you thinking that. How do we know that given that if you're going to say that

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,640
all ravens are white, you're talking about all ravens, even the ones that you've never

96
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,440
seen, even the ones that nobody has ever seen, even the ones on Mars. If there are ravens

97
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,840
on Mars, you're saying all ravens are black includes those ravens on Mars. Well, how can

98
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:04,600
you know that? Do you see what I mean? So, there are two different questions as what is

99
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,240
knowledge in the first place? Must we know that we know something or can we know something

100
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,760
that we don't know that we know? What's it got to do with justification? What's it got

101
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,720
to do with belief, et cetera? And how can we know these things? So, that's the distinction

102
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,640
between metaphysics. Metaphysics is to do with truth and what is the case and what's

103
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:36,000
its nature. Epistemology is to do with knowledge, justification, belief, and how we can know

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,120
whatever it is that we do know. So, that's the main distinction. Let me just pour myself

105
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:55,840
some H2O. H2O. What did I say earlier? I suddenly remembered that I heard myself saying

106
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,600
something false. Well, right. Okay, let's look at ontology, the study of what there is

107
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:08,200
or what exists. Okay, one question. I said earlier that there are many things that questions

108
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,320
of what is the case and what is its nature that are questions for science. But questions

109
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:20,480
like does God exist? In the God delusion, if any of you have read it, Richard Dawkins

110
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:27,440
claims that this is a scientific hypothesis like any other. Well, if that's true, it must

111
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,280
be possible to conduct experiments, observations, in order to determine the existence of God.

112
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,880
I have no idea what experiments or observations he has in mind, but I actually don't think

113
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,160
this is a question for science. I think Dawkins is wrong to think this is a straightforward

114
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:53,480
scientific hypothesis. I think this is a question for philosophy. Evidence, our reasons

115
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:02,200
for thinking God exists take the form of arguments rather than evidence or observations. For example,

116
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,160
the most obvious argument is the one I used earlier. God is a theoretical entity. He's

117
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,480
postulated to explain the existence of the universe. That's the simplest argument. It's

118
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,240
the argument that people have used from the beginning of time. Other people use different

119
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,160
arguments. For example, the moral argument. You don't need God to explain the existence

120
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:32,880
of the physical world, but how come there exist people like us who are capable of rationality,

121
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,400
who reason, who have free will, who make choices, and in particular make moral choices? People

122
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,520
like us who value things, who see right and wrong, good and bad, beautiful and ugly, and

123
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:55,800
things like that. Physics can't see right and wrong, good or bad, etc. This is not the

124
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,840
sort of thing that physics or any physical science can investigate. But you might think

125
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:09,000
that God is the explanation for the existence of things like that. Or you might deny that.

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,400
You might say, no, you don't need God to explain right and wrong. You can easily explain right

127
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:22,000
and wrong by peel to evolutionary biology. So altruism is a question of either kin support

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,040
or if I scratch your back, you'll scratch mine, etc. So if you look at Dawkins' chapter,

129
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,360
I think it's four, but I may be wrong about that. He offers four or five arguments for

130
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:42,440
how you can explain morality without God. So does God exist? Lots of different arguments

131
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,560
for the existence of God, lots of different rejections of those arguments, lots of different

132
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,520
comebacks on those rejections, and philosophers are going to have a job for at least a couple

133
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,440
of hundred years, I think. I think the God's illusion is far from the final word on it. But

134
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,200
there are other questions like that. That's a biggie, obviously, but there are other biggies.

135
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:11,000
Do moral values exist? Is there right and wrong? Does right, it's really a property of an

136
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:20,280
action being right or wrong? Or can we reduce the idea of being right to something some

137
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:28,040
people would say natural like happiness? So the utilitarians want to reduce happiness

138
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,840
to the, sorry, reduce right and wrong to the idea of the greatest happiness to the

139
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,080
greatest number. So there's no more to right or wrong than how many people you make happy

140
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,920
by an action that you do. Now what you're doing there is you're reducing one thing to

141
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,720
another thing. So here's something we don't understand right and wrong, and we think that

142
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,800
it needs an explanation, and we're tempted to postulate God for it maybe. But on the

143
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,880
other hand, if we can say, well, actually, we don't have an explanation for that, but

144
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,440
there's actually no more to that than this in particular combinations, and we do have

145
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,080
an explanation for this, or at least this is something for which we can think that there'd

146
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,880
be a much easier explanation than God. So on the grounds of Occam's razor, given two

147
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,000
explanations, both of which work, you always go for the simpler one. If you can explain

148
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,400
happiness, and you can reduce morality to happiness, then you haven't got a problem

149
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:35,040
with morality. You don't need to postulate God. See what I mean? So you might, I mean,

150
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,400
some people try and reduce the idea of God to, I mean, actually Dawkins again does this.

151
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,800
He thinks that God is the idea we all want for security, for a father figure, something

152
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:55,440
to rely on. So he's reducing God to that. The utilitarians try and reduce moral values

153
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,720
to happiness. Kant, on the other hand, isn't a reductionist. He thinks right and wrong

154
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,600
exist, that the moral law exists in and of itself, and that it's quite different from

155
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,240
anything else. So if you remember last week, for Kant, a moral action is an action that's

156
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,920
carried out because of reverence for the moral law. It can't be said to be anything else.

157
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,240
It can't be said to be something that, just as a matter of fact, produces the greatest

158
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,120
happiness or the greatest number. And reverence for the moral law, says Kant, is not something

159
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,080
you can reduce to anything else, something easier to understand. Another example of this

160
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,560
would be mental states. I thought I was going to come to mental states, but I say it's not

161
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:51,280
on there, so I'll put it in anyway. Do mental states exist? Well, what are mental states?

162
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Well, mental states divide into two. There are the so-called propositional attitudes. So

163
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,400
attitudes to propositions, things like beliefs. You can't have a belief unless it's a belief

164
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:15,240
about something, can you? So I believe that Anne is wearing sort of maroon. I believe Anne's

165
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,880
wearing maroon. I believe when Anna's got a necklace on, somebody's got a lovely pink

166
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,520
jumper on just in front of Anna. Futious sort of colour. Okay, all of those beliefs have

167
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:34,360
a content, but there are other propositional attitudes, so I can have a desire to warn

168
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,680
towards the same content. Desire is a different attitude, but I could have the desire that

169
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:47,280
Anna's wearing a necklace, or I could wish that Anne is wearing, all the same names, is

170
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:54,240
wearing maroon. I could also intend that Anna's wearing maroon. I could set out to make

171
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,280
sure she wears maroon today, because I want to use her as an example. So these are lots

172
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,120
of different attitudes to contents, and you can get the same attitude and different contents

173
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,880
and the same content and different attitudes. So that's one type of mental state, the so-called

174
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,640
propositional attitudes. The other type is the so-called qualitative states. So when

175
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:25,600
I looked at this lady's lovely future-coloured cardigan, I have a certain experience. Okay,

176
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,040
there's something that it's like for me to see that cardigan. There's something that

177
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,480
it's like for me to see these chairs. There's something it's like for me to be in pain or

178
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,800
to feel a tickle or something like that. And these are qualitative states. They're states

179
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,800
that have a quality to them. So I'm sure you can do your own rough and ready distinction

180
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,720
now into states that have a certain raw feel to them and states that are attitudes to propositions.

181
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,560
Why do we think these exist? Well, how could I possibly explain your behaviour without citing

182
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,960
desires, beliefs, intentions, hopes, fears? You know, why did she suddenly get up and leave

183
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:16,080
the room? Answer, because she suddenly realised it was the wrong lecture. She suddenly realised

184
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,360
it was the wrong lecture. So she had a belief about what the right lecture was. She suddenly

185
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,600
came to believe that this was the wrong lecture. So she formed an intention to leave the room.

186
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,160
So in order to explain your behaviour, I postulate all sorts of beliefs and desires. But here's another

187
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:42,160
little story. Woodlice. Why do woodlice congregate under rocks and things? Tell me. It's dark.

188
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,200
Why do woodlice congregate where it's dark? Because they want to be safe or something

189
00:16:49,200 --> 00:17:01,440
like that. OK. And they believe it's safe under rocks. OK. You're a bit reluctant to attribute beliefs, are you?

190
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:15,400
Well, don't give my story away. Yep, absolutely. OK. When we first see a woodlice and certainly if

191
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,600
we're speaking to a child or something like that, we would use belief, desire, psychology

192
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,840
to explain woodlice behaviour, because that's what comes very easily to us. So woodlice believe

193
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,320
that it's safe under rocks and they want to be safe so they intend to go under rocks. As

194
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,520
a matter of fact, the correct explanation of woodlice behaviour is that they embody a

195
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,680
mechanism such that when it's dry around them, they move. And they move in a speed that's

196
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:52,160
determined by how dry it is around them. And as it gets damper, they come to a halt.

197
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,680
And incidentally, they move in whatever direction they happen to be pointed. They don't sort

198
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,800
of turn around and make for that rock. If they're standing in that direction, there's a rock

199
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,800
over there, they'll go for that one. Except they're not going for that one, are they? They're

200
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,960
being pushed by the dryness. Now, once you know that explanation, have I got it right?

201
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,480
That's right. I wasn't going to use technical terminology, but they are. Okay, so that's

202
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,160
the proper explanation of woodlice behaviour. Once you know about canises like this, you

203
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,880
can explain the behaviour of any woodlouse anywhere at all, as long as it's a normal

204
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:32,560
woodlouse, anywhere at all at any time. Once you know that, belief desires have been made

205
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:39,320
redundant, haven't they? Why should you postulate woodlice beliefs now or woodlice desires? In

206
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,280
fact, all their behaviour is explicable in terms of things like canises. They're not

207
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,040
all canises, but they're things like that. What about your behaviour? Can I explain your

208
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,560
behaviour? Well, a lot of your behaviour, I can explain. If I chuck my chalk at you,

209
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,520
that shows how old I am, doesn't it? If I chuck my chalk at you, you're going to duck.

210
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,920
That's not a desire or belief-driven behaviour. That's just a hardwired response to the fact

211
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,840
that you see something coming towards you. If you put your hands on a hot plate, do the

212
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,880
same thing. So a lot of your behaviour, and that's just one, if you hear an ambulance

213
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,880
coming, you'll move out of the way. That's a classically conditioned response. A lot of

214
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,200
your behaviour doesn't need to be explained by appeal to beliefs and desires, but much

215
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,640
of it does, and this is why we postulate beliefs and desires. This is why we say that beliefs

216
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:38,080
and desires exist, but perhaps ethologists, people who study animal behaviour, are going

217
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,760
to find out one day that we can explain all our behaviour in terms of brain states,

218
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:51,600
and it might be that we can, one time in the future, we'll be able to saw off the skull

219
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,000
of newborn babies and fit a perspect dome instead, so that we don't have to go in for

220
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,400
all this interpretation, which we're actually not very good at, is it, trying to find out

221
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,400
what we're all going to do instead? We can just look at somebody's brain and say, ah,

222
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,200
okay, I know what you're going to do. Perhaps we'll all wear woolly hats so we can surprise

223
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,120
people or something like that. But do you see, if we could explain all our behaviour

224
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,880
without appealing to beliefs and desires, we'd no more have reason to think you had a mind

225
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,600
than we do to think woodlice do. So, again, the question, do mental states exist, is a

226
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,680
huge question. Lots of people try and reduce mental states to physical states, and then

227
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:43,040
explain physical states, it's much easier to explain physical states than mental states,

228
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,520
but if you don't want to be a reductionist, if you want to say you cannot reduce mental

229
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,600
states to physical states, and there are all sorts of reasons to think you can't, then

230
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,160
you're going to have to postulate mental states, you're going to have to postulate

231
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:04,600
contents and qualia, and the minute you do, you're going to have problems with functionalism,

232
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,360
with physics being able ever to understand mental states, and my goodness, you might

233
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,680
end up having to postulate God or something again, or maybe not, we don't know. So, again,

234
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,680
the question is, what is this? Does it exist at all? If it does exist, can we reduce it

235
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,000
to something else? If we can't reduce it to something else, what is its nature? Here's

236
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,280
another one, what about possibilities? Okay, I might have been wearing jeans, mightn't I?

237
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:40,400
Okay, that's a possibility. And what's more, it's a possibility that's actual, isn't it?

238
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:49,360
It's an actual possibility. Well, what is a possibility? What's the nature of a possibility?

239
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,360
It's not something that actually exists, is it? Okay, so maybe we've got to postulate

240
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,080
a different sort of existence now. There are things that actually exist, and there are

241
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,420
things that possibly exist, and there are things that don't even possibly exist. So,

242
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:12,600
there are square circles that don't even possibly exist. Unicorns might they exist

243
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,080
or not? Marianne's wearing jeans certainly is an existing possibility. Do you see what

244
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,720
I mean? You're now getting layers of existence, different levels of existence. Well, and that

245
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:33,160
little kitten on the floor down there, is it fat? You're looked. You understood what

246
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,280
my words were. Don't you need to postulate a little kitten down there in order to give

247
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,600
meaning to my words? Some people have thought that. If you do, then that little kitten exists,

248
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:54,080
it doesn't exist like Ann does, so you need again another layer of existence. Well, some

249
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,320
people have said that it's not really existence. Let's call it persistence instead. But the

250
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,800
thing is you've got to say, if you say that every, in order for you to understand the

251
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:11,400
meaning of that little kitten is fat, there needs to be a concept of a kitten or a kitten

252
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,400
or something. There's a kitten that gives meaning to the words, but it's not an existing

253
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,640
kitten like the kitten that some of you may have at home. So, it's a persisting kitten

254
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,680
or an imaginary kitten is another way of thinking about it. But do imaginary kittens exist? Well,

255
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:36,480
do they? In imagination, there you are. There's another way of thinking of it. So, it's existence,

256
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,040
different types of existence. There's existence in the real world and there's existence in

257
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:45,560
your imagination. There's existence in novels. I mean, when it comes up, this little kitten

258
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,240
down here, it could be black ginger or anything, couldn't it? I haven't told you anything about

259
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:55,360
what it's like. But we all know that Sherlock Holmes wore a deastalker, didn't we? Did he?

260
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,840
Something like that, wasn't it? Okay, so they've got, again, different levels of existence.

261
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:07,600
We all know that unicorns have horns. Well, there aren't any unicorns. Well, how can unicorns

262
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:15,640
have horns if there aren't any? Do you see? Anyway, so, do possibilities exist is a really

263
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,920
difficult one. That's the sort of thing that leads people to postulate the existence of

264
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,440
possible worlds. And I think I've mentioned possible worlds to you before. Lots of people

265
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,280
postulate possible worlds, but they're not realists about possible worlds. Mathematicians,

266
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,400
logicians, physicists, many of them, all those disciplines postulate possible worlds. Not

267
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,000
all people in those disciplines do. But if you postulate possible worlds, you can see

268
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,200
possible worlds as reducing to possible situations in this world, or you can see possible worlds

269
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,880
as real. And David Lewis, very famous philosopher, postulated the reality of possible worlds.

270
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,080
And he said, well, I've never really heard a very good argument against them. A look

271
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:07,560
of blank astonishment doesn't count as an argument. What about physical objects? Well,

272
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:14,040
you might say, well, obviously they exist. How can I deny that that exists? Okay, well,

273
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:19,200
let's do a Cartesian thought experiment. In fact, let's do the Cartesian thought experiment

274
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:32,160
when I have some water. Descartes was interested in the fact that we know that some of our beliefs

275
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,600
are false. But in the very nature of things, we don't know which those beliefs are. You

276
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,640
see what I mean? Would you like to tell me for sure that all your beliefs are true?

277
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:59,440
Right? Okay, what about you? No, it isn't. No, no, a lot of your beliefs are false. I guarantee.

278
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:10,760
If you believe it, you believe that it's true, that doesn't make it true. Does it? No. You believe

279
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,440
it's true exactly. But this is the problem with beliefs. Every belief you have, you believe

280
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,600
it's true because that's what a belief is. To have the attitude of belief towards a particular

281
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:29,880
content is to assent to, as philosophers would say, that content. So in believing that this

282
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:37,720
chair is blue, there's the content, that chair is blue, and I assent to it. I say that is true.

283
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,480
That's what a belief is. But, of course, I may be wrong. I may be colourblind or something like that.

284
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,880
Well, given the circumstances in this case, I probably would say I know. But the fact is,

285
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,440
let's not bother about that. I was just offering that as a... But you have beliefs about a lot

286
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,480
of things. The question is, you know that many of those beliefs are false, but you don't know

287
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,480
which they are. And in the very nature of things, anything that you believe, you believe to be

288
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,840
true because that's what truth is. You cannot have a belief that you don't believe to be true.

289
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,440
But you do know that not all your beliefs are true. Well, Descartes became very

290
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,000
interested in this, and he said, well, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take myself away from

291
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,960
the world. In the world, we have to assume that our beliefs are true because we have to act on them.

292
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,840
So in believing that chair is blue, if I'm looking for something to match it, I'll go and look for

293
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,600
something blue. We have to act on our beliefs. He's going to put himself away and think, okay,

294
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:45,160
how do I know that my beliefs are true? What is it that justifies me in believing that my beliefs

295
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:56,440
are true? And he thought, the method I'm going to use to do this is to treat as if false any belief

296
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:03,240
I can entertain the slightest doubt about. So if the belief that I believe to be true could be

297
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,560
false, I'm going to put it on one side as if it really is false. And by that means hope to find

298
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:17,000
something that I can that is absolutely certain. And from that, maybe I can build up the rest of

299
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,320
my knowledge. So it's a bit like, you know, some of the apples in your baskets are rotten, but you

300
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,640
don't know which they are. So you take each one out and any that's a little bruised, you put on

301
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,760
one side as being maybe that's rotten. And you hope to be left with only the good apples in the

302
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,040
basket. So Descartes wanted to look at his beliefs and say, if there's any about which I can entertain

303
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,880
the slightest doubt, I'm going to treat it as if false. Okay, so he's not saying that his beliefs

304
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,440
are false. He's saying it's as if they're false for this. So first, he went down three levels of doubt.

305
00:28:48,440 --> 00:29:02,280
The first one was the argument from illusion. Okay, the argument from illusion tells us that,

306
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,680
well, our senses have deceived us. I expect all of you have been deceived by your senses. Sometimes

307
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,440
you've got home that wonderful skirt that you thought would go so well with that blouse and

308
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,640
you've got the colour wrong. The lights in this shop were the wrong colour or something like that.

309
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,760
We've all been deceived by our senses at some time. Well, if we've all been deceived by our senses

310
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,040
at some time, should we take all the beliefs that we base on our senses and put them in the

311
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:35,000
doubting basket, treat them as if they're false? Should we? If our senses has deceived us, should

312
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,800
we treat all our sensory beliefs as false? Okay, put your hands up if you think yes.

313
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:50,600
Okay, put your hand up if you think no. Okay, now tell me why you think no.

314
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,720
Why must there be that possibility?

315
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,400
Well, hang on, we've got two lots of can'ts nose here. What we're suggesting is that your senses

316
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:17,720
have sometimes deceived you. Does that mean you can never be sure that your senses are not deceiving

317
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:26,920
you now? No, you can't be sure. So sometimes we do trust our senses, don't we? I mean, as a matter

318
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:36,440
of fact, how do you know that your senses have deceived you? Well, hang on, you experiment,

319
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,440
you prove it. How? How do you do this? Through your senses. Can you give me an example? Possibly not.

320
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:54,520
Woo, yes. Yes, good one. Okay. So your belief that it was heavy, although that's actually not

321
00:30:54,520 --> 00:31:00,920
a sensory belief, probably, is it? Well, yes, because you put so much anticipated. No, no, but it's

322
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,840
when your belief that the frying pan was heavy, you can't really look at a frying pan and tell it's

323
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,200
going to be heavier. Maybe you can, maybe you can. Let me give you Descartes own example, because I

324
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:19,960
think it's a good one. Descartes said, if you put a stick in water and it looks bent, okay, you've got

325
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,800
reason for thinking that the stick is bent. You take it out of water, woo, it's straight. You've got

326
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,120
reason for thinking the stick's straight. Well, okay, there are two possibilities, maybe. When you

327
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:37,480
put the stick in water, it bends it, or maybe it just appears bent. So how do you test this? You put

328
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,480
your hands in the water, you feel the stick when it's underwater and low, it's straight. Okay, so

329
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,000
you've now got two reasons for thinking the stick's straight and only one. But the thing is, you

330
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,920
couldn't even know that your senses were deceiving you unless you rely on your senses. So all we got

331
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:03,480
to hear from the argument from illusion is that we know that not all our sensory beliefs are true,

332
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,720
not all our sensory beliefs are true. Sometimes, usually in

333
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:20,520
unusual psychooptimal conditions, or maybe not unusual, but not perfect psycho physical conditions,

334
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:27,400
our sensory beliefs deceive us. But you can't go from the universal possibility of illusion

335
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,080
to the possibility of universal illusion. Would you like me to say that again? No? Oh, I like saying

336
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:42,120
that. Would you like me to say it again? Thank you. Thank you. You cannot go from the universal

337
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:51,160
possibility of illusion to the possibility of universal illusion. Are you with me? Okay, so all

338
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:58,120
those who said no, you're right. We do know that our senses sometimes deceive us, but that doesn't

339
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,600
tell us that we can put all our sensory beliefs into the doubting basket, because we would never

340
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,760
know that our senses deceive us unless we rely on our senses. So that's the first argument. The

341
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:19,560
second argument that Descartes went to was the argument from the demon, the demon argument,

342
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:26,600
rather than the argument from the demon. The demon, sorry, the demon, anyone who knows what

343
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,800
they're talking about will know that I'm talking rubbish. The second one was the dream, the argument

344
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:38,840
from dreaming. Okay, so you're sitting here, you're in the fire, the lights are on, everything's fine,

345
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,080
you're looking at your hands in front of you. How can you doubt that? Your senses aren't deceiving

346
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,960
you now, are they? But on the other hand, says Descartes, haven't you ever been in the situation

347
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,720
where everything has seemed to you to be a certain way, and then you've suddenly woken up

348
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:00,600
and found it wasn't that way at all? So it looks as if all the sensory evidence is in, and yet

349
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,360
you're still wrong, your belief is false. So you believe that the hand is in front of you.

350
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,200
It's exactly with you as it would be if your hand was in front of you, but your hand's not in

351
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,360
front of you. As a matter of fact, you're dreaming. Okay, does that mean we should put all our sensory

352
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:26,360
beliefs in the doubting basket? Put your hands up if you think yes. Put your hand up if you think no.

353
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,120
You're beginning to get this now, aren't you? Why not?

354
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Man in white or beigey sort of jumper.

355
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,680
Sorry, I've picked on you and you don't have to.

356
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:55,080
Okay, would anyone else like to answer? Why can we not put all our sensory beliefs in the

357
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:01,480
doubting basket now? Because we wake up, and what does that tell us?

358
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,080
That we're not always asleep exactly, that sometimes our beliefs are true. Sometimes when I've

359
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,400
got my hand in front of me like that and I'm thinking my hand's in front of me, I am awake,

360
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:22,040
and the reason I know that is because if I didn't wake up, I couldn't know I was dreaming. So it's

361
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:28,200
exactly the same structure of arguments as in the first one. But where has we got rid of all

362
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:35,000
sensory beliefs that have formed in suboptimal psychophysical conditions here? Here, we've got

363
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,680
rid of a lot more, haven't we? Why? Do you want to? No, I was going to say that, but how do you know

364
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,240
you've woken up? That might be part of the dream we're talking about. Well, it's a contrast, isn't it?

365
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,840
Well, there are people who don't have that occasionally. I understand that it's very rare, but there are people who go

366
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,360
through this cycle of thinking they've woken up and then they wake up again themselves.

367
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:03,000
Right, but in order to know that they are like that, they must have woken up.

368
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,960
Well, okay, but with you, I'm quite sure you've had lucid dreams where you've had the dream and

369
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,360
suddenly you've woken up and you've thought, wow, you know, who could have believed that I was dreaming.

370
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,560
Sometimes you can know your dream, but it's the lucid dream that's good for this one.

371
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,960
But what have we lost here? What's in the doubting basket now?

372
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:38,040
No, instantly, there's another thing I want you to notice that lots of people think, I mean, it's

373
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,920
hell, sheer hell being a philosopher as a party. Because when people find out you're a philosopher,

374
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:51,320
they're going for little games like, oh, good, tell me that this exists. Does this exist? Why not?

375
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,640
And you say something and they say, oh, no, it doesn't, you know, tell me how, tell me how.

376
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,160
And they're playing a sort of skeptics game that's extremely irritating. I hope none of you ever play it.

377
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:10,440
Descartes found reasons for doubting, everything. He didn't just doubt. He took beliefs he believed to be true,

378
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,840
and he looked for a reason to doubt them. And it's only when he found a reason to doubt them

379
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:25,480
that he put them on one side. So he wasn't just doubting. He wasn't playing the skeptics game.

380
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:31,000
He was actually looking for reasons to doubt. So what are we lost here? What's in the doubting

381
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:42,600
basket once you've got the argument from dreaming? Well, no, because when you are, you know that

382
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:50,920
sometimes your belief there's a hand in front of you is correct, is true. So you don't lose

383
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,600
that you do sometimes see your hand in front of you. But what do you lose?

384
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,320
No. No, no, we're looking for certainty. We're wanting to know what isn't certain as a result

385
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,760
of this. Some things are left certain. I mean, it's left certain, for example. Well, okay,

386
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:20,760
I'm asking you that. What is left certain? That when you are awake, your beliefs, your sensory beliefs

387
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:28,040
if they're formed in optimal psychophysical conditions are true. You still got no reason to

388
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:38,360
doubt that. It's just that you can say that unless I know I'm awake, I cannot know for sure

389
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,760
that there is a hand in front of me. Okay, do I know that I'm really awake? Answer no, I don't,

390
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:52,360
because I could be having a lucid dream. But I do know that hands exist and that I can see them

391
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,280
and that chairs exist and that I can see them. Or if you don't like that, because I can, in our

392
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,440
dreams, we sometimes put together things in strange ways. I can know that blue exists and that

393
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,560
so you can go to simple things, horses, horns, whiteness, things like that. The simple things

394
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:17,720
from which we build up complex things. I know that they exist. So we're losing something of the

395
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:23,240
world here, but we haven't lost the whole world yet. There's still an awful lot that we know. I don't

396
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:31,400
know anything to be true now, but I do have reason to believe that it is true. It is true sometimes,

397
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,800
i.e. when I'm awake and I have these reasons to believe things. But then we get down to the demon argument.

398
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:46,600
And at the demon argument, Descartes says, okay, well, I'm assuming, aren't I, that

399
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,360
these experiences that I have as of my hands and of blwness and so on, I'm assuming that these

400
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:01,720
experiences are actually caused by something outside myself and that the experience that I have

401
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:10,840
is a guide to the nature of the cause of these experiences. So my experience of blwness as of

402
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:17,480
a blue chair is causing me to think that that experience is being caused by a chair that's

403
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:30,680
blue. And you've got a problem here because in order to know that A causes B, you've got to be here,

404
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:37,960
haven't you? You've got to see a correlation between A and B. In the same way to know that A

405
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:44,440
resembles B, you've got to be able to see both A and B. But are we ever in this position with

406
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:55,000
respect to our experiences and the causes of our experience? Never. We're always here,

407
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:01,720
aren't we? Didn't leave enough room for my arrow. We experience the world, if you like,

408
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:08,680
through our experiences. We can never get outside our experiences to see what the world is like,

409
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:16,200
to see what's causing these experiences. So it could be that our experiences are caused by

410
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,320
something completely other than we take them to be caused by. So here's the demon. Sorry, I know it

411
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:30,200
looks like a cat, but it's a demon. The demon opens up a gap between our experiences themselves

412
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,240
and the causes of those experiences, and it actually says, how do we even know these experiences

413
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:42,040
are caused? Why aren't they just experiences? One following the other, following the other,

414
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,840
following the other. And there's nothing out there at all. And actually Descartes at that point

415
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,600
says, I can't do this. I'm going to put the demon there because I find it impossible to believe

416
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:59,480
there's nothing other than my experiences. But I can think that there's some cause of my

417
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,400
experiences, which is completely other than I take it to be. And some people have tried putting

418
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,240
evil scientists in here, but that doesn't work because an evil scientist isn't magic.

419
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,480
What you're trying to do, the demon is just there because it's impossible to imagine that your

420
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,960
experiences don't have causes at all. So you're putting something there so that there is a cause,

421
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:40,120
but the cause is completely other than you take it to be. He didn't panic for that reason. No,

422
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,680
he just literally couldn't wrap his mind around the idea that there's nothing outside causing

423
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:51,800
your experiences. You try it. It's really very difficult to get yourself to the point where

424
00:42:51,800 --> 00:43:00,920
you understand that there might be no physical world at all. Your experiences could be exactly

425
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:11,000
as they are, even though nothing else exists. So all there is is Ann's experiences as of

426
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,320
Marianne giving a lecture in philosophy. There's no Marianne, there's no philosophy,

427
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,920
there's no lecture, there's no blue chair. But it does seem to me very similar to what people have

428
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,560
of is this experience all a half. It's a frightening experience. It's nothing beyond that.

429
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:34,760
But it's nothing to do with God. Oh, no. I said that sometimes white people want to have a God.

430
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,360
Yes. I didn't actually say about God. I just said people worry that there is nothing after death.

431
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,560
Okay, but this is a different thing because it's not worrying about that sort of thing.

432
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,840
But it is a worrying thought. I mean, we want our beliefs about the external world to be true,

433
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:58,200
don't we? And yet what's happening is that we're discovering that what Descartes said was that

434
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:06,280
actually, once you've done this thought experiment, you realise that there's the world

435
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:17,960
and there's your picture of the world. Okay, all your beliefs that you've formed about the world

436
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,920
and you go through the world updating your beliefs all the time. But once you've retreated

437
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:34,280
into your picture of your picture of the world, which should be here, but I ran out of room,

438
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:42,520
the world actually becomes unnecessary because if all there was was this,

439
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,920
you couldn't ever get outside to see whether this is there or not. So once you've pushed yourself

440
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:57,160
back into a reflective position, you see that the world that you picture is quite different

441
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:03,000
from your picture of the world and that your picture of the world could be exactly as it is,

442
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,640
even though the world was completely different. And that's the Cartesian thought experiment.

443
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:17,480
That's hyperbolical doubt. At this point, you've started the question of how can we know? I mean,

444
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:23,480
we do take ourselves to know that there's an external world, a physical world out there.

445
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:32,040
But what possible justification could we have for this, given that all we can do is go and look

446
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:40,680
for more experiences? And our experiences are exactly what we are asking. Are they caused by

447
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:46,920
something? And if so, what? I can't step outside my experience. Of course, no scientific experiment

448
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:53,240
is going to tell you the answer between, are my experiences caused by an external world,

449
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:59,400
or are they caused by an evil demon? There's no, I can't go down and say, oh, is it a chair?

450
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,200
Oh, yes. Here we are. It's a chair. Why can't I do that?

451
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,440
All I'm doing is giving myself more experiences, aren't I? I'm now having a tactile experience

452
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,920
as well as a visual experience, and there's an auditory one there as well. But I mean,

453
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:23,640
there are only more experiences, aren't they? Who are you? Hang on. I'm having another experience

454
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,640
at this moment. It's an auditory one. It's as of someone.

455
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,280
They do, but no, no, hang on. You haven't got yourself into hyperbolical doubt, has she?

456
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,000
Why hasn't she got into hyperbolical doubt?

457
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,480
She's not looking at her picture of her picture of the world.

458
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,240
Yes, she still thinks that I should think that she exists.

459
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:05,080
I have very good reason to think I'm having experiences as of a female wearing maroon sitting

460
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:10,280
in front of me who's speaking to me, but these are just more of my experiences, aren't I?

461
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:15,800
I can no more get outside my experiences to check whether Ann's really there and whether

462
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,520
she's really telling me what I think she's telling me than I can to see whether the chair is there.

463
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,120
All I've got is more experiences. So all I've got is more of this

464
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:35,880
here, and I still haven't got this, which is what I need. So there's no point in looking for

465
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:43,880
corroboration, which is why there can't be any scientific way of testing which hypothesis is true.

466
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:51,880
So here I have my experience in the external world. Of those, I can be certain. I'm absolutely sure

467
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:59,880
now that I'm having experiences as of a lecture theatre, etc. What I want to know is are those

468
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:06,600
experiences causing me to form beliefs that are true, i.e. there is a lecture theatre. Now notice

469
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,960
the difference between I believe there's a lecture theatre and there is a lecture theatre.

470
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:19,560
The latter is metaphysics, isn't it? The former is histomology. I can be certain of the former.

471
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:26,280
I can be certain of my own beliefs, but I can't be certain that these beliefs are true, can I?

472
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:35,080
And it's at this level of hyperbolical doubt, at the third level of doubt that you start to wonder

473
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:42,360
do physical objects exist at all. Interestingly, Descartes thought that you could show that they

474
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:48,760
did. Descartes wasn't a sceptic. Lots of people think he was, but in fact he wasn't. He did this sceptical

475
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:57,960
thought experiment in order to pre-empt scepticism. He ended up believing in the existence of a physical

476
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,320
world, but he thought it was necessary to believe in God first.

477
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,480
That's right. Cogito ergo sum. And the reason he did that, can anyone think why he did that,

478
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:19,480
thinking of what I told you so far? What's that? That's right. Once you've got yourself back

479
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:26,040
into your picture of your picture of the world and your inability to determine the existence of

480
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,160
the world that you picture, the only thing of which you can be certain is that you're thinking,

481
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:39,160
isn't it? So here's my belief. The content of my belief is

482
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,280
the chair is blue.

483
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:55,400
I've got the attitude of belief towards that. I've now got another attitude, which is that of

484
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:04,120
doubt towards that belief. Do you see what I mean? You can't doubt your own beliefs without seeing

485
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,880
that you have these beliefs. And that's what Descartes says. He said, the very act of doubting

486
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:20,440
makes me see that I believe. And if I believe, I exist. I don't know what I am like, but I exist

487
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:28,840
because I exist as a thinking thing, as a thing that thinks. So I think, therefore I am, is because

488
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:35,320
that, once you've been in hyperbolical doubt, that is the only certainty you have. You actually

489
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,400
have a few more about what you think, but you don't need to. I think, therefore, I exist

490
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:46,040
encapsulates it rather neatly, I think. But you see, you cannot doubt your own beliefs without

491
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:51,160
seeing that you do believe something or other. All you don't know is whether that belief is true.

492
00:50:51,720 --> 00:51:03,320
Could I come back to the argument from illusions and just sort of question around,

493
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:10,760
we're saying, talking about our sense data and so on shows that they're wonderful.

494
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:18,200
However, sometimes those are what? Sometimes those are true or can be believed.

495
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:26,200
But if you, I mean, looking at evidence, for example, from physics about the nature of the

496
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:33,160
universe, about sort of wave particle forms, about what the nature of the matter is, all that kind

497
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:39,800
of stuff, what we're seeing is an extremely distorted view of reality. Looking at the evidence

498
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:46,520
from psychology, our perception is a highly flawed, all our senses are highly flawed, our brains

499
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:53,400
are constantly filling in stuff that's around the edges and doing all kinds of fiddling about with

500
00:51:54,280 --> 00:52:02,760
what actually might or might not be out there. So, actually, we know pretty much what we are

501
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:13,240
experiencing. Much of it is an illusion. I'm afraid that, in what you're saying, you'll make it clear

502
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,960
that you haven't got into hyperbolical doubt either.

503
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,160
Well, in that case,

504
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:36,840
well, we can, but we can agree with all that and accept. I mean, all Day Cuts asking is,

505
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:43,640
can we be certain that our experiences are being caused by anything? Secondly, can we be

506
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,840
certain that our experiences are a good guide to what there is? Now, what you're saying is that the

507
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:55,800
second, we know empirically that the answer to the second question is no. But, of course,

508
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,400
for him, the most important question is the first one, not the second one.

509
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,240
Is there evidence coming out about the nature of consciousness in the cell,

510
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:14,040
which the implication is that what we may perceive as being ourself is actually, again, quite illusory?

511
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:21,960
Yes, sure. But this is more grist to Descartes mill. It's either irrelevant,

512
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:29,480
excuse me, or it's grist to Descartes mill. I mean, you can add these in, if you like,

513
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,840
to the argument from illusion. But the argument from illusion is only the first step of Descartes

514
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:41,240
argument. And the step that really matters is this one. And that's the one that takes us

515
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:47,400
to hyperbolical doubt. And that's very definitely a philosophical or metaphysical question,

516
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,400
not an empirical one. There's no way science can show us.

517
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,480
Well, there still is, but the empiricism is nothing more than me testing out one experience

518
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,600
against another, which is a bit like testing out one newspaper against another. It's not going

519
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:32,600
to get you very far. Well, doubting is a form of thinking. No, you can't bring in other people.

520
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:43,160
No, you can't. You can't bring in other people at all. The doubting is not what you're certain of

521
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:51,240
by doubting is that you believe. Because in order to doubt, the thing that you doubt is a belief of

522
00:54:51,240 --> 00:55:00,520
your own. Well, exactly. A belief is a thought. It's a type of thought. So you're doubting that

523
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:07,320
you're thinking and you try and doubt whether you're thinking and you will become completely

524
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:15,400
certain that you're thinking. And so Descartes says, isn't it strange because I would have thought

525
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:21,800
that the world was far more present to me than my own thoughts. In fact, my own thoughts have

526
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,960
always seemed to be rather shadowy things that I'm not really certain of at all. I can't hold

527
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:33,560
them or see them or touch them or so on. But having done this, I now see that my thoughts are far

528
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:42,600
more certain to me than the external world, which could be nothing. So he thinks he's gone from

529
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:48,040
something or he's found something really surprising once you move from the perspective of

530
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:57,800
picturing your world. So I'm thinking of the world that I picture, not my picture of the world.

531
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,360
Usually the only time I'm thinking of my picture of the world is when something's gone wrong.

532
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:10,120
I thought I hung my coat here. I believed I hung my coat here. I now have reason to believe it isn't

533
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:16,440
there. What's gone wrong? So I've been pushed back into my picture of my picture of the world

534
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:22,840
in order to question whether my belief is true or false. But of course, usually I come back almost

535
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:28,920
immediately. Oh, there it is. And so I immediately move back into my picture of the world, looking at

536
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:36,200
the world. But what Descartes did is he forced himself to stay here, where what he was reflecting

537
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:42,600
on was his picture of the world rather than the world that he pictured. So he's looking at his

538
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:48,200
beliefs and thinking, are they true? Are they false? Are they justified? Are they not? Instead of

539
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:54,200
looking at the chair and thinking, is it blue? Is it hard? Is it okay? Do you see why people are out

540
00:56:54,200 --> 00:57:04,760
here, not in here? Ann isn't a belief. My belief about Ann is a belief. But Ann is here. And Marianne's

541
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:15,640
belief about Ann is what I am certain of. But I'm certain of it until I doubt it. And the minute

542
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:21,960
I doubt it, I can be certain of that belief, but I can't be certain that it's true. So whatever

543
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:35,720
Ann says is just more of my experiences. Ann, say, that's right. I believe that Ann says it's blue,

544
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:43,000
and I know that my belief that Ann says it's true does not make it true that Ann says it's true.

545
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:49,400
And you too will be able to do this when you become philosophers. Do you see what I mean?

546
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,520
Once you understand what you're saying, it becomes easy to say it, although now I can't say it again.

547
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,800
But I'll have to get the flow of it back. Do you see why people are outside?

548
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:08,440
When my daughter was little, she used to think we had two houses, and she thought we had one that

549
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,360
was down the end of the road that came from preschool, and one that came down the road from

550
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:18,120
school. My cat thinks we have two houses. I'm just wondering if it, but she would have had no doubt

551
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:23,480
about that belief. Was it when she began to doubt the belief, and then obviously then realised

552
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:29,560
it's not quite that much, because we've only got the one house. Is that almost the doubting belief

553
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:35,800
makes it real? I don't know. Well, there's a very interesting, between three and five,

554
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:43,240
children actually acquire the context, the concept of a belief. And until that point,

555
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:49,800
there's evidence to think that they don't properly form beliefs of their own. But there's an experiment

556
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:56,440
that goes, Maxie the puppet, whoever it is who's looking after Maxie, I can't remember,

557
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:02,760
puts a chocolate in a box, and then Maxie goes out to play, and the children are watching this,

558
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,680
and Maxie's mum comes in, takes the chocolate from the box and puts it into a cupboard or something

559
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:14,200
like that. Then Maxie comes in from playing, and the children are asked, where is Maxie going to

560
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:20,120
look for the chocolate? Now, all the three-year-olds say in the cupboard, because that's where they

561
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:25,400
believe the chocolate is. They know the chocolate is in the cupboard, so that's where they think Maxie

562
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:32,600
will look. The five-year-olds will all say she'll look in the drawer, because they've understood

563
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:39,240
the difference between appearance and reality. The world can appear to you to be other than the

564
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:45,880
way the world is, and what your daughter did, she linked up her two beliefs and saw, oh, that house

565
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:56,040
is that house. Hold was she? Yeah, she probably wasn't really having beliefs at that point.

566
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,800
The thought is you don't really have a belief until you have the concept of belief, because once

567
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,720
it's only when you've got the concept of belief that you have the difference between appearance

568
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:13,000
and reality, and you see that beliefs can be either true or false, so you can grasp the concept of

569
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,320
conditions of truth and falsehood, and at that point you can really actually believe something,

570
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,680
whereas up until then it's just that you're just responding to a world, because the world is,

571
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:29,640
you don't make any distinction between the world's being one way and it's appearing one way.

572
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:38,120
You don't see that those can come apart, no, no, except I mean we'd call it one

573
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:43,800
when we're speaking loosely, but no. Okay, right, let's move on a bit, because

574
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:51,000
I mean we've been doing a lot of epistemology here under the heading of metaphysics, but of course

575
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,160
actually there's the metaphysics of epistemology just to confuse you, because of course if you

576
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:02,360
want to know the truth about knowledge then you're doing the metaphysics of knowledge and

577
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:08,280
therefore the metaphysics of epistemology, so we were looking at ontology before we got onto

578
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:16,440
scepticism, so we asked ourselves whether these things exist, but we can then go on and ask well

579
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:23,240
what are they like, you know, if we believe that God exists is he all these things, how can he be

580
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:29,160
all these things, because surely there's contradiction here isn't there, if he's omnipotent he can do

581
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:34,840
anything at all, if he's omniscient he knows everything at all, and if he's benevolent or good

582
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:43,240
then how can he see the suffering in the world and not do something about it, so can God be all

583
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:49,800
those things, what about moral values, if they exist are they absolute or relative, do we all

584
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:55,640
have our own moral values or is there a moral law that's objective and that exists for all of us,

585
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,880
are there different possible worlds or only different possible states of this world

586
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,880
and what's the difference between those two, and what about physical objects, are they independent

587
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:19,000
of us or bundles of our ideas, Barkley, Bishop Barkley thoughts that scepticism was so threatening

588
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,680
the idea that we couldn't be sure we had knowledge of the external world, that what he thought is we

589
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:31,160
had to build the external world from what we could be sure about, so the only thing we can be sure

590
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:38,360
about is our own experiences, so what is the external world other than bundles of our own

591
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:44,360
experiences, now this may sound daft, you know, I mean there's more to Anne than my experience if I

592
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:51,640
touch her she'll say ow or excuse me or something like that, but actually there again what have I got

593
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:59,560
other than my own experiences, auditory experiences etc, so what Barkley was saying was actually if

594
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:05,640
you think of all your experiences and all your counterfactual experiences, in other words if I

595
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:11,720
came into this room at midnight that blue chair would still be there, do you see that's a counterfactual

596
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:19,400
experience, I would still see that blue chair, there is no more to an object than our experiences

597
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:26,280
or counterfactual experiences and actually you try and convince me that you have any reason to

598
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:33,000
believe that the physical world exists, that doesn't appeal to either an experience of yours

599
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:47,640
or a counterfactual experience of yours and you'll fail, counterfactual, it is, if I came into

600
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:53,080
this room last night at midnight that's that's not true, I didn't come into this room at midnight I

601
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:58,760
was past the sleeping bed, but had I come into this room at midnight last night I would have seen

602
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:04,840
that blue chair and that's part of my reason for thinking that that blue chair exists independently

603
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:14,120
of me is that it was here all the time, it would still be here if I came back tomorrow, but it might

604
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:19,880
well exactly and so what Barkley is saying is is that there is no reason I can give for believing

605
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:26,600
that that chair exists that doesn't depend on either an actual experience of mine, here it exists

606
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:30,280
you know and you're having experiences of this chair now as well if you exist

607
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:37,240
or counterfactual ones if I came in tonight it would still be here, I would still see it

608
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:46,120
that's true but I would still okay but that's

609
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,600
if I had come in last night it would have been there yeah but I should be able to answer that

610
01:04:52,600 --> 01:05:01,160
and I can't because I'm tired, what about Boozies? If somebody had moved it I wouldn't have seen it

611
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:06,200
okay I might not be able to follow it but it's certainly true that I have reason to believe that

612
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:12,760
this chair would have been here simply because it's tied to the floor, I mean that's not conclusive

613
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:19,400
and that's not a very good response to what you're saying, I've no reason to think it won't be and

614
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:25,960
my what's more important to you try this as a thought experiment for yourself try and give

615
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:32,120
yourself reason to believe that something that you believe exists exists okay so you believe

616
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:37,880
this exists what are your reasons for believing it exists and see if you can find one that doesn't

617
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:45,320
depend upon your own experiences either your actual experiences I can see it feel it touch it hear it

618
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:51,640
or your counterfactual experiences if I was there then if I did this then if

619
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:59,800
do you see what I mean then I would so you won't be able to do it Barkley was much cleverer than

620
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:04,280
people think people tend to think that he thought of the external world as a ghostly sort of thing

621
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:09,880
but he's just offering another explanation for our experiences and the fact that we go from

622
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:15,560
these experiences to thinking there's an external world we do that immediately what why do we do

623
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:23,480
this okay so so this is that's metaphysics then moving to epistemology what is knowledge

624
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:30,840
okay do we have knowledge we've looked at that in some depth already do we have knowledge

625
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:36,200
Descartes would say we can't claim to have knowledge of the external world unless we can get over his

626
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:42,120
thought experiment which he thinks we can um what is knowledge though some people believe that

627
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:48,440
it's okay well let me ask you this what what is knowledge we've been talking about knowledge for

628
01:06:48,440 --> 01:07:02,920
the last hour and a half or something but what is it that's very optimistic of him launching out

629
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:15,800
like that good for you go on see for you what do you mean my gathered

630
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,200
but we have knowledge of things that don't involve senses don't we two plus two equals four is not

631
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:34,760
sensory knowledge so what is knowledge we collect it and put it in our brains how do you put

632
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:47,480
something in your brain well actually you don't um i'm not sure you intentionally acquire knowledge

633
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,240
anyway most of the time the knowledge you acquire isn't acquired intentionally it just

634
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:58,680
um sorry what did somebody else say it's certainly acquired but what is it we acquire

635
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,200
memories involved but there's a difference between memory and knowledge isn't there

636
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:09,960
i mean in order to remember something that something has to have happened

637
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:22,680
um memory is important but memory is different from knowledge it's not the same thing memory is

638
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:28,520
essentially time related whereas knowledge isn't essentially time related it can be time related

639
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:39,880
but it's not essentially so in the way that memory is yeah well and i mean there are different

640
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,040
sorts of knowledge aren't there as well i mean i know how to ride a bike well i remember

641
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,320
do i remember it well it's not propositional knowledge

642
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:56,280
okay let me tell you what one answer the classical answer to the question of what knowledge is is

643
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:02,680
that it's justified true belief okay if you're going to have knowledge you must have a belief

644
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:12,520
that belief must be justified and that belief must be true so um you believe or you you know

645
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:17,880
that i'm wearing an aubergine dress don't you you will know that they have very good colour

646
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:25,080
concepts here you have a belief that i'm wearing an aubergine dress do you yep okay is that belief

647
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:33,000
justified how you can see it yeah okay you're justified in believing that and and let me tell

648
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,400
you that it's true okay so you know i'm wearing an aubergine dress so that's the idea that so if a

649
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:45,160
student comes to me and says well i day card said such and such and i say why do you think that

650
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:54,680
and he says uh i don't know and i say okay well what follows from that belief and he says um

651
01:09:55,720 --> 01:10:02,440
i don't know uh and i said well why do you think that and he says uh don't know

652
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:09,160
he doesn't know it does it does he you may have a belief about that um but it's and it what's more

653
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:13,880
it may be a true belief but it's not justified therefore it doesn't count as knowledge he doesn't

654
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:20,120
know it at all um if you don't have a belief about something you certainly can't know it

655
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,640
but the other one and the one that most people get more worried about is that

656
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:31,560
you cannot know something false if you cannot know that i'm wearing a yellow dress for example

657
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:39,240
you can believe that you know something false but your belief that you know it is itself

658
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:48,600
false are you with me so if you actually know something that thing must be true so maxi comes

659
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:55,960
in from playing and she does she know that the chocolate is in the drawer no she believes

660
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,720
she knows the chocolate is in the drawer but what she doesn't know is that her mum took it out

661
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:06,040
and put it somewhere else so she has what she thinks is knowledge but it's not knowledge because

662
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:10,920
it's not true she's got the belief she's justified in the belief but the belief isn't true therefore

663
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:16,520
it cannot be counted as knowledge so you've got to again make that distinction between what you believe

664
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:22,680
to be the case and what actually is the case because you can believe you know something that's

665
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:29,400
false but you cannot actually know something false this is the the crux of william morris's

666
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:37,000
dictum only have in your house those things which you believe to be beautiful

667
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:45,160
or which you know to be useful yes i'm not sure it's the crux of that but it certainly comes into it

668
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:53,080
yes absolutely um yeah okay so um but here's a little problem for you getty a came up with

669
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:59,480
this little problem it's called and it's been called ever since getty a problems um you have seen

670
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:11,080
me driving a um a golf gti around oxford um you've come to believe that i own a golf gti as a

671
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:15,800
matter of fact there is a golf gti that i own but it's in my garage and the one that you've seen

672
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:25,320
me driving around belongs to a friend okay do you know that i own a golf gti i believe

673
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:32,600
no sorry you believe that you know but do you know no you don't know why not

674
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,400
well it is justified no you've seen me driving around in it you're perfectly justified

675
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,760
it is true i've got one in the garage

676
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,920
no you don't know that you don't know but you don't know

677
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,920
that's not the point

678
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:59,080
why not

679
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:17,480
but we do usually claim about claim to have knowledge without having certainty don't we

680
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:24,360
i mean you've seen me driving this car often um so you know you you think you're justified in

681
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:29,240
claiming to know that i now i'll tell you what's happened here is the conditions that make your

682
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:35,800
belief true i.e. the car that's sitting in my garage that you've never seen me in come apart from

683
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:42,600
the conditions that justify your belief the golf gti you've seen me driving around in and it's only

684
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:48,760
if the conditions that make true your belief are the same as the conditions that justify your belief

685
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:55,160
that you can have knowledge uh that what you have counts as knowledge so what gti a showed is that

686
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:01,880
it cannot be the case that knowledge is justified true belief justified true belief may be necessary

687
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:08,600
for knowledge but it's not sufficient you need some other claim that makes it impossible for the

688
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:12,600
truth's conditions
