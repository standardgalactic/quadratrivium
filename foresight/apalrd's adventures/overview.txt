1. **Understanding Terminal Server Limits**: In a terminal server environment where multiple users share resources, it's important to limit each user's CPU and memory usage to ensure that the system remains responsive for all users.

2. **Using Control Groups (cgroups)**: To implement these limits, the concept of cgroups is used. Cgroups allow you to allocate resources like CPU time and system memory to different users or processes on a Linux system.

3. **Setting Up cgroups**: The process involves creating a configuration file within the `Etsy system D system` directory, where you define the CPU and memory limits for each user. For example, setting a user's CPU limit to 200% allows them to use two CPU threads, and their memory limit to 2 gigabytes.

4. **Fixing Policy Kit**: If you encounter an error related to the color manager (e.g., "Color Manager: The device '/org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/ColorManager' is not a X screen"), you need to create a policy file within the `Etsy pull kit one local authority 50 local dot D` directory to handle this exception for all users.

5. **Resource Limits**: By applying these cgroup limits, you can effectively manage the resource usage of each user session on the terminal server, preventing any single user from consuming all available resources and impacting others.

6. **Client Support**: RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) clients are widely supported across various operating systems, including iOS, Android, Android TV, and Samsung Tizen Smart TVs, making it a versatile solution for remote access scenarios.

7. **Data Security**: A key benefit of using terminal servers is that sensitive data remains centralized on the server, reducing the risk of data breaches from user-supplied devices.

8. **Feedback and Future Content**: The video encourages viewers to provide feedback or suggest other topics related to terminal servers for future content exploration.
