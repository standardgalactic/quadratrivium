Checking Zuby/The West is In Decline - Carl Benjamin ï½œ Real Talk With Zuby Ep. 295.txt
 In this conversation, Carl Benjamin (Sargon of Akkad) discusses the ethical implications of assisted suicide in the UK and the broader issues within liberal morality. He argues that consent is an important but not exhaustive component of morality, using the relationship with one's parents as an example of a moral bond that doesn't involve consent. He suggests that liberalism has become so dominant in the English-speaking world that it resembles a form of "Anglo Sharia," and he advocates for putting liberalism in its proper place within a more balanced framework of morality and civilizational identity.

Carl emphasizes the importance of recognizing the right of peoples to have their own countries, citing examples like the Palestinians, Israelis, and Kurds, and extends this principle to the Europeans. He believes that when people understand themselves within a broader civilizational context, it becomes easier to get along and find common ground.
