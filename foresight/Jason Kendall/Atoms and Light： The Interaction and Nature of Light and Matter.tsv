0	9360	Hello and welcome, this is Jason Kendall to one of my introductory astronomy lectures
9360	12780	and this time we're talking again about the nature of light.
12780	17760	Light is that thing that allows us to see things from here to there, there to here.
17760	22880	We don't emit light out of our eyes unlike certain kind of superheroes who beams of light
22880	23880	come out of their eyes.
23880	28080	No, light, it comes to us from sources.
28080	33040	Those sources might be hot objects that are so hot that they glow, or they're so hot
33040	39920	that they atoms in them emit light as they jump between orbits in their atomic shells.
39920	45360	There's lots of ways for light to be emitted, but let's just see what light is as a thing.
45360	49080	And as we've always seen from like the album cover of Pink Floyd, I look like we're looking
49080	55240	out here, when light passes into a from one medium to another, it changes direction and
55240	60440	depending on the medium, it has a frequency dependence for the speed of light inside that
60440	61440	new medium.
61440	64760	But the speed of light that we're going to care about comes up really shortly.
64760	66480	In any event, what is light?
66480	72680	Well light is electromagnetic radiation and electromagnetic radiation is a way of saying
72680	77200	that energy is being transported through space without there being a physical connection
77200	78200	between the two things.
78200	80720	There's no actual physical link.
80720	84320	So electromagnetic radiation is a transfer of energy.
84320	87840	Examples where the other two examples where energy gets transferred are conduction, where
87840	92680	you heat something up and the vibrations of the molecules and atoms inside of that
92680	97560	object that you're heating up, they vibrate against each other and eventually all the
97560	98560	atoms move very fast.
98560	103560	And if you happen to be heating up a skillet or a pan on sort of an open fire or a heating
103560	106560	element, then eventually the handle gets hot too.
106560	108600	So that's called conduction.
108600	114040	Conduction is the vibration and the collisions of atoms inside a solid object or any object
114040	117760	where the atoms and molecules inside of it are close enough together that their vibrations
117760	118760	can impact each other.
118760	120760	So that's physical contact.
120760	125360	Another way that physical contact can occur is through conduction.
125360	130000	Convection is where you take a hot body of some sort, a hot bubble of gas or liquid or
130000	134640	what have you, or even a hot solid, and you move it from here to there by some physical
134640	135640	process.
135640	137320	The heat then is transferred.
137320	140800	The energy is transferred because now you've got something with a greater amount of energy
140800	145760	and you take it from here and you put it there, presumably to a place of lower energy
145760	146760	or lower heat.
146760	150200	Or you could place it to a place where higher energy, but then it would gain more energy.
150200	154000	So that's not really the flow that we think of in terms of convection.
154000	156320	So a good example is a boiling pot.
156320	160640	You heat the pot, the bottom of the pot gets hot, makes a bubble of hot water.
160640	165200	That water then rises in the pot, releases it in steam or heat into the surrounding,
165200	168760	into the kitchen, and then that cooler liquid then sinks back down.
168760	170400	It makes a boiling pot.
170400	175840	So there's actually a flow of water, a flow of water inside the pot as it goes.
175840	176840	So that's convection.
176840	180560	It also happens with air, that's how we get storms because there's convective cells in
180560	184400	storms and so we've seen that happen all over the earth with the creation of hurricanes
184400	185840	and so forth.
185840	193320	But with electromagnetic radiation, radiative transfer of energy does not require the physical
193320	194720	contact.
194720	197680	Convection means you transfer objects that are physically moving through each other.
197680	203040	This bubble that's high moves through a region until it gets to a region where it's cool.
203040	207640	Conduction is where electrons bounce against other electrons right next to each other.
207640	212320	But if it's radiative transfer, electrons and protons don't go on and touch you and
212320	213320	move along.
213320	214680	No, it's light.
214680	219640	Light actually transfers its energy from here to there.
219640	224360	So there is no physical contact that the photon does.
224360	226720	It's just the thing that it transmits energy.
226720	231840	And so light is something, but let's get to it in just a little bit.
231840	233320	That's a very complex question.
233320	234760	But light's everywhere.
234760	239080	The reason you could see me now is because light's bouncing off of me, getting recorded
239080	241920	by the camera.
241920	246800	The camera then holds it as an electromagnetic impulse and then I transfer it to the computer.
246800	250380	After I transfer the computer, I play around with it on the computer, manipulating the
250380	254360	electric and magnetic fields on the computer and then I upload it using electromagnetic
254360	255680	fields to YouTube.
255680	259840	And after I have transferred to YouTube, you then turn on your computer and using more
259840	263400	electromagnetic energy, that creates light that comes out of the screen, which you then
263400	264400	see.
264400	265400	Interesting.
265400	266920	But what is this light thing?
266920	273320	This thing that is transmitting energy from me through the magic of YouTube to you?
273320	277680	Anyway, there are characteristics to light that we should discuss before we say what
277680	280760	light is because we can't discuss what it is without discussing its characteristics.
280760	283000	And one of them is its wave motion.
283000	288880	The light has a wave property, meaning that there's wavelength to light.
288880	291920	And light's wavelength is a very important thing.
291920	293520	So what do we mean by wavelength?
293520	301560	Wave lengths, if we take some sort of medium, and we have a regular disturbance in it, we
301560	304920	get waves that go up and down, like water waves.
304920	308000	Water waves are a perfect example of wave activity.
308000	313360	In water waves, we see the distance between the crests and water waves, and those distances
313360	315160	are the wavelength.
315160	320240	So the wavelength is the distance between crests or troughs in a wave, as it traverses.
320240	324440	And so it's a cyclic pattern, it's just not one wave, there are many waves in a train
324440	325720	of waves.
325720	329840	And the train of waves has a speed with which they move through the medium, say the water
329840	332760	waves move at whatever speed they do through water.
332760	339080	And that speed is important because the speed of the wave is equal to the frequency, or
339080	343840	how many waves go by you per second, times the wavelength of it.
343840	351960	So if you have a high frequency, then if you have wavelengths of the same type, same length,
351960	356800	and one of them is high frequency, then of course the waves are moving faster by you.
356800	362440	If the same frequency is occurring, but one of the wavelengths is much shorter than the
362440	372520	other, then the smaller wavelength at the same frequency has a much slower wave speed.
372520	374160	Now we're going to see something interesting about the nature.
374160	381120	We call the period of the wave is what the time is between individual cycles.
381120	387680	So in terms of the speed of light, the speed of light is a constant in vacuum.
387680	389240	It only has one speed.
389240	391680	There is no other speed to light.
391680	396960	Maybe there is not existing, meaning there is no light, or it's going this speed, which
396960	397960	is very interesting.
397960	402200	There's no acceleration or deceleration to light.
402200	407800	Light just simply goes at this speed, the speed of light, which is just shy of 300,000
407800	412320	kilometers per second, or just shy of 186,000 miles per second.
412320	421640	But specifically, it's 299,792.458 kilometers per second, which is a very fast speed.
422600	426000	That means it gets to the moon and back in two seconds.
426000	430920	That's why those pings in the Apollo missions, where they have that little ping sound, because
430920	433840	it's rude to talk over people and you actually want to know, so you send the ping, they say,
433840	437440	I'm done with transmission, because it takes a second for the light transmission to get
437440	438880	from the earth to the moon.
438880	442440	And that's why they had the ping sound at the end of the Apollo mission transmissions
442440	445840	when they were talking back and forth between the moon and Houston.
445840	446840	So what does that mean?
446840	454680	If you have the speed of light being a constant, then the product of the frequency times the
454680	457960	wavelength gives you the speed.
457960	464120	All right, so if the speed's always the same, then if you have a long wavelength, you have
464120	466440	a short frequency.
466440	472080	And if you have a short wavelength, you have a high frequency.
472080	474120	And so they're inversely related.
474120	477240	Because the speed of light is a constant.
477240	482480	So once again, if you have a very small wavelength, lambda, which is typically what we use for
482480	487400	wavelength, then you must have a very, very, very high frequency in order to maintain that
487400	488400	speed.
488400	492800	And if you have a very low frequency, then you must have a very long wavelength, and
492800	494400	those are radio waves.
494400	495600	The other one are gamma rays.
495600	500200	So light goes in all sorts of flavors, but it all travels at exactly the same speed.
500200	502480	All right, so how do we know what the speed of light is?
502480	506600	Well, the speed of light, as we discussed in a previous lecture, was first investigated
506600	508280	or at least investigated in many ways.
508280	514360	But Oli Romer looked about it by looking at the timing, the timing, the transits of Iowa
514360	518760	across Jupiter over a long period of time, over many months, and actually noticing that
518760	521640	the times that it was expected to be were wrong.
521640	525960	But another more direct way to do it is with Fissot, who actually used mirrors on tops
525960	530600	of mountains, and actually bounced light all the way across and through a rotating tooth
530600	531600	wheel.
531600	535200	The tooth wheel spun and spun and spun, and as the light passed through the wheel and
535200	544240	bounced off the mirror and came back, it had to make that trip while the wheel was rotating,
544240	549520	and the light had to come back through the same tooth it left or else it would be blurred.
549520	555920	So Fissot made it a pulsing beam, and that pulsed beam had to have the same speed as
555920	559280	the light going through it or else it would get blocked.
559280	564880	And so you either get blocked light or you would let it through, and how you determined
564880	571120	the speed of light was how fast was the gear, how fast was the rotary wheel turning, what's
571120	577760	the length of space between the teeth, and so you could say, well, how long did it take
577760	582840	for light to go all the way down and back such that you don't get a distortion, you
582840	586760	don't get a blurred view, and that's one way of determining it, how fast the wheel is rotating
586760	589240	and the size that it's rotating through.
589240	594800	In any event, the wave nature of light was determined because you can actually say, well,
594800	600720	what are some features of wave light, is that light diffracts around boundaries, just like
600720	601960	water waves do.
601960	606760	So when water hits a boundary like a jetty, it curves around that jetty, it doesn't actually
606760	611800	stop, it doesn't go around it, when it goes past it, it doesn't not go around it.
611800	615200	You don't see waves not propagating.
615200	622400	Waves have a way of actually spreading out, and so they don't stay trained on one place,
622400	628400	they just spread out until they thin out across their breath, if it's a water wave, but in
628400	631480	terms of like a jetty going around, as soon as it passes the jetty, it starts to spread
631480	633400	back out around the jetty.
633400	637880	In any event, you can have multiple, you can have interferences of waves where waves can
637880	643960	constructively interfere and destructively interfere, and if the waves constructively
643960	650780	interfere, that means the two waves merge together, and if their peaks match at a given
650780	654200	place in space, then they add together.
654200	660560	If their peaks are counter, if one wave's peak matches another, the same wavelength's
660560	663520	waves trough, then they cancel out.
663520	668880	So you can either have what's called interfering constructively, meaning they add together,
668880	672600	or they can destructively interfere and subtract from each other.
673040	678480	The waves superimpose and add to each other, and the trough acts like a negative number,
678480	684440	and the peak acts like a positive number, so if it's a wave height of two, and the other
684440	689040	wave height is two, and they happen to be at the same place, that the peaks are at the
689040	693440	same place at the same time, then the wave height is not four, but if the trough is at
693440	698200	the same place as a peak, then the wave height is zero and it's flat.
698200	702080	So you can't have waves passing through each other and not make a noise.
702080	704760	It's kind of a weird thought, but it can happen.
704760	708760	So constructive and destructive wave interference can be seen pretty easily.
708760	714600	If you look at it trough two stones in a puddle of water, you can see two outbound ripples.
714600	717520	It helps to have some nice sunshine, so you can actually point out the troughs in the
717520	722840	water and the peaks in the water, and it's pretty easy to see as you dry it out at home,
722840	723840	because it's like, what the heck?
723840	726840	Everybody's got puddles of water around them, maybe something deep, and you can see the
726840	731720	reflection of water on it and see the constructive and destructive interference.
731720	737320	Another thing to look at is back in 1901 or so, or the early part of the 20th century.
737320	744800	Young did a, what is it, famous double slit experiment where he put a slit inside a barrier
744800	751640	to make an image of a slit as a single, as a single sort of, as a single source, and then
751640	756800	allowed that image of that slit then to spread out, because light spreads out from a source,
756800	760600	diffractively, to impact on two other slits.
760600	768560	And those two other slits then, they each act as sources, but those sources, then the,
768560	776400	what we see on the far side, are a constructive and destructive interference pattern on the,
776400	777680	on the far side of it.
777680	781440	So you have a source, a continuous source, going through a slit, that slit then goes
781440	786520	through a double slit, and that double slit then makes constructive and destructive interference
786520	792340	patterns, which can only occur if light is doing a, is light has wave properties.
792340	797760	So Young's experiment actually proved that light actually did have wave properties.
797760	800080	So what are some effects of wave properties?
800080	802960	Well, let's say you were moving towards or away from something.
802960	806380	We've always heard of the nature of the, the nature of wave properties.
806380	810640	So let's say you're going to see a Doppler effect, and Doppler effects occur, because
810640	814720	let's say you see a car driving towards you, and it's honking its horn, the pitch will
814720	818040	be slightly increased as the car is driving towards you.
818040	821480	And if it's driving away from you, the pitch will be slightly decreased.
821480	825640	And I had the benefit of going to the Indy 500 a long time ago with my good friend and
825640	827560	best man for my wedding, Ralph Hater.
827560	829840	And Ralph got tickets for us to go see it.
829840	835080	And you could really hear the effect of the Doppler effect as the cars went, flew by you.
835080	836080	You know, okay.
836080	840080	So just to say it, when cars in the Indy 500 are driving, they're these little things,
840080	841080	and they're extremely loud.
841080	842240	They go, oh, right.
842240	843240	They're driving like that.
843240	844760	They're really fast.
844760	845760	Really fast.
845760	850120	Now that sound, is what you hear if you're inside the car.
850120	853220	Now what do you hear when you're seeing them go by in the track?
853220	857920	What you hear is, that's what you hear.
857920	861400	Now inside the car, it's, because that's the sound of the engine.
861400	862960	They're really whining.
862960	870220	But outside you hear, as it approaches you, and then as it goes by you and the pitch changes.
870220	874420	So the wavelength of the sound changes to the observer.
874420	876940	So I'm the observer, sitting on the stands in the fourth row above, the little finish
876940	878740	line going, yay, there's the cars.
878740	882540	And I hear this sound, and everybody who's ever watched these kind of things has seen
882540	883540	and heard this sound.
883540	885100	It's a really cool sound.
885100	890140	In any event, that's the Doppler effect, which is the change in wavelength or frequency
890140	896940	as a result of a movement of the source towards you or away from you.
896940	899660	So the Doppler effect is just that.
899660	904820	You have the true wavelength, which is all inside the car, the sound of the engine.
904820	910060	But then there is the perceived wavelength or the apparent wavelength, which depends
910060	913420	on the relative motion of the source.
913420	918540	So the faster something goes by you or towards you or away from you, the greater the Doppler
918540	919660	effect is.
919660	923700	So that's all dependent upon both the speed with which it's moving and the speed with
923700	927020	which the wave travels, the sound wave.
927460	931780	So for light, we have a slightly different thing, but it works the same way because light
931780	933100	has a wavelength.
933100	937940	So if it has a wavelength, then we can see if there's a Doppler shift and there is.
937940	944780	So light has a wavelength, and there's a certain wavelength at which the light is emitted,
944780	947740	and there's a certain wavelength at which the light is received.
947740	957540	So if I were to actually take a red light, maybe it's 6,500 nanometers in wavelength,
957540	960140	maybe that's the wavelength I'm looking at.
960140	964660	And that wavelength source of light, which by the way would be a cloud of hydrogen gas,
964660	969820	if that wavelength of light is traveling towards me, or actually, let's say it's moving away,
969820	975300	if it's going away from me at, say, 90% the speed of light or maybe 80% just to keep it
975340	976100	easy.
976100	983140	If the light was going away from us at 80% the speed of light, then the total wavelength
983140	989540	change would actually change the wavelength to almost twice its wavelength, almost twice.
989540	997180	So it would be well into the infrared, roughly about 1200 nanometers, as opposed to about
997180	998540	600 nanometers.
998540	1001900	So it would be well into the infrared, and you wouldn't be able to see it.
1001940	1006140	So if something's emitting, if it's a hydrogen class gas, and it's rushing away from you,
1006140	1010740	whatever reasons, hot hydrogen rushing away from you at 80% the speed of light, normally,
1010740	1012580	if we're still, you could see it.
1012580	1016540	But if it's rushing away from you that fast, then the light gets redshifted down to the
1016540	1018380	infrared, and you have to use infrared to see it.
1018380	1021340	That would be important when we're talking about the big bang, but in any event, Doppler
1021340	1027140	shift is important in light because if the source is moving, then there is a Doppler shift.
1027140	1032100	And that occurs in every direction, you can have a slightly change of a version away from
1032100	1033100	it.
1033100	1039380	If you're looking at it from the side, there's a part of the motion that's towards you changes
1039380	1040380	it.
1040380	1045220	So effectively, the light bunches up in the direction of it that it's going, changing
1045220	1050540	the frequency to a higher frequency, and gets stretched out away from the source, as if
1050540	1052220	from things behind it.
1052220	1056620	In any event, there are four wavelengths of light, like it shifts up.
1056620	1061420	But the important thing about the Doppler shift with respect to, let's say, that cloud
1061420	1066380	of hydrogen gas I was talking about, is that all the wavelengths get shifted by the exact
1066380	1069420	same proportion.
1069420	1076500	So the spacing between the wavelengths, that is not dependent on the speed.
1076500	1079060	So the pattern stays the same.
1079060	1083100	It just gets shifted by the same amount, either blue shifted, meaning if it's going to shorter
1083100	1086620	wavelength, or redshifted, it's going to a longer wavelength.
1086620	1092060	And if something's receding at, like, say, 1% the speed of light, if it's receding, then
1092060	1093580	it'll be slightly redshifted.
1093580	1099500	If it's if it's running towards you, approaching at a much faster rate, maybe twice, 2% the
1099500	1101780	speed of light, then it'll be much greater.
1101780	1109220	But on every case, all of the emission is simply just shifted by that same amount to
1109220	1110380	the left or to the right.
1110380	1112420	By the same amount.
1112420	1115220	And they don't get stretched out or pulled out in any direction.
1115220	1116220	All right.
1116220	1118100	Where can we measure this?
1118100	1120700	I just said gas cloud, hydrogen, rushing away.
1120700	1122700	Well, you know, what if it's rotating?
1122700	1125340	Let's say you've got some rotating glowing object.
1125340	1130460	If it's rotating and glowing, then the side that's rotating, maybe a big, hot, glowing
1130460	1131460	ball.
1131460	1132460	That's kind of weird.
1132460	1134780	Big, hot, glowing ball rotating really fast.
1134780	1137980	When it's rotating really fast, the side that's approaching you would be blue shifted.
1137980	1141500	And the side that's retreating away from you would be redshifted.
1141500	1146260	And so you can have a Doppler shift on a big, hot, rotating ball of gas, maybe a superfast
1146260	1152180	rotating star or something, or even a moderately rotating star can do, can show a Doppler shift.
1152180	1156780	In fact, the sun shows a slight Doppler shift from at physical wavelengths, but you got
1156780	1158820	to be really sensitive to see it.
1158820	1163260	If you have two stars that are orbiting each other and they're part of a binary system,
1163260	1168660	then those two stars then also show this Doppler shift because, hey, maybe one of them is approaching
1168660	1169740	and one of them is receding.
1169740	1174260	So all of the spectral features of the star that's approaching you get shifted to the
1174260	1178380	blue, and all the star features of the spectral features of the star that's receding away
1178380	1182060	from you get shifted to the red, and then they swap back and forth as one's retreating
1182060	1185300	and one's retreating, and the other's retreating and the other's receding.
1185300	1187060	So that's another thing.
1187060	1188380	Look for binaries that do this.
1188380	1192540	And finally, as the earth goes around the sun.
1192540	1196860	What's even very interesting is that there's a slight Doppler shift as the earth goes around
1196860	1199220	the sun with respect to all of the stars in the sky.
1199220	1201980	So that's a very small amount, and that has to be taken into account if you're being very
1201980	1204460	sensitive with respect to spectroscopy.
1204460	1209620	So the earth's motion around the sun can cause a Doppler shift in stars.
1209620	1212460	All right, so is it real?
1212460	1213460	What's real speed?
1213460	1214460	So what's the real speed?
1214460	1217100	I mean, I know I'm going fast with respect to you, but what's the real speed?
1217100	1218100	What's my real speed?
1218100	1219740	Well, there is no real speed.
1219740	1221340	There's only relative speed.
1221340	1224820	The Doppler shift only carries about relative speed.
1224820	1230460	There is no absolute speed, meaning, okay, if I could find my reference frame such that
1230460	1234980	I'm going the absolute speed, then everything is going to be fine.
1234980	1237100	That sounds like something you might hear about in a comic book, maybe.
1237100	1240740	It's like, oh, I'm going the absolute speed, kind of a flash thing or something.
1240740	1243540	So you're going at absolute speed, but there is no absolute speed.
1243540	1247460	That's an odd thought, but there is one absolute speed, the speed of light, but that's the
1247460	1250460	speed that the light's going, and it only goes that speed.
1250460	1252820	So that's kind of a weird thing.
1252820	1264220	So there's really no such thing as a true speed, meaning the speed with respect to the
1264220	1268180	space and time, because all space and time is relative.
1268180	1272660	So you have to measure Doppler shift with respect to your speed with respect to the
1272660	1277540	source or the observer, and if one's moving, the other one could be moving in exactly the
1277540	1278540	same way.
1278540	1284780	In the same sense that the Doppler shift would occur if in the Indy 500, everybody in the
1284780	1290620	Indy 500 stands were simply moving by the car, and the car was standing still.
1290620	1294420	The Doppler shift would still occur for the people in the stands.
1294420	1299420	That would be very jarring to realize that the car is standing still in the entire city
1299420	1305020	of Indianapolis is moving, but it would have the same effect in terms of the Doppler effect.
1305020	1306020	All right.
1306020	1308740	So we're moving by the wave nature of light, and what do we get out of it?
1308740	1312860	And one of the nice things that we see is that you get pretty rainbows, and pretty rainbows
1312860	1319500	are part of the wave nature of light, because as light enters a prism, the speed of light
1319500	1327500	changes, and in a prism, in glass, the speed of light is a function of wavelength and frequency.
1327500	1333660	So the blue light is bent more than the red light, and so there is a frequency dependence,
1333660	1339220	and so the light spreads out as it passes from air into glass, and then from glass back
1339220	1344220	into air, the change in medium, actually, because it goes through the glass, it actually
1344220	1346180	gets spread out by the glass.
1346180	1350660	Anyway, our most important thing is the pretty rainbows that are caused by water droplets
1350660	1356580	in the air, or by pretty prisms hanging in your window, is that the visible spectrum,
1356580	1361260	the visible spectrum, that which we can see is called the visible electromagnetic spectrum,
1361380	1365940	and the visible electromagnetic spectrum is roughly between about 4,000 angstroms and
1365940	1372380	about 7,000 angstroms, or 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers, and it spans from the violet
1372380	1374700	all the way through the deep, deep red.
1374700	1379460	And if it's shorter wavelength than violet, we call it ultraviolet, and if it's longer
1379460	1384700	wavelength than red, we call it infrared, and their frequencies are very high, they're
1384700	1388900	on the order of 10 to the 14th cycles per second.
1388940	1393620	But the wavelengths, let's look at it with the wavelengths for just a second, 400 to 700
1393620	1394900	nanometers.
1394900	1399620	We already know that there's wave properties that about light, and since light has wave
1399620	1401620	properties, it does diffraction.
1401620	1405340	So why don't we see diffraction everywhere?
1405340	1409740	Why isn't everything fuzzy, because waves of light are, which should make things fuzzy?
1409740	1415220	I mean, we have eyes, and as light enters our eyes, it's an aperture, and the aperture
1415220	1420500	then means that inside your eye, the light must spread out, so why isn't everything
1420500	1421500	all fuzzy?
1421500	1427340	Well, because the wavelength is very small with respect to the aperture of your iris
1427340	1428340	of your eyeball.
1428340	1432220	So your iris of your eyeball is a couple of millimeters, right, it's a few millimeters.
1432220	1435220	That's really big compared to nanometers.
1435220	1441420	So there's an order of tens of thousands of them, so if you're looking at 700 nanometers
1441420	1447820	or 500 nanometers, let's keep it simple, and that's many thousands of times smaller
1447820	1450260	than the aperture size of your iris.
1450260	1456140	And so waves don't really notice the diffraction, so the diffraction effects are not very noticeable.
1456140	1459740	However, if you wish to see them, take this little experiment, take two of your fingers
1459740	1464420	together like this, and just barely close them, so there's just a tiny bit of light
1464420	1468820	between them, hold them close together, so there's just a little bit of light, and bring
1468820	1472640	it close to your eye and look at some bright light source, and you'll see in between your
1472640	1477300	fingers dark and light bands, that's some diffraction patterns happening because of
1477300	1481420	the diffraction around the edges of your fingers, so it's really kind of pretty, you can see
1481420	1483380	that with just your fingers.
1483380	1488780	Alright, so the fun thing is that the light comes in frequencies and wavelengths, and
1488780	1493820	packets of light called photons do that, and that's what we call light.
1493820	1501060	Now, here's the funny thing, because individual packets of light called photons have individual
1501060	1506260	frequencies, then there's really no such thing as color.
1506260	1511140	Color is a construct, it's a biological construct in your brain.
1511140	1512780	What does that mean?
1512780	1519980	Well it means that there are cells in your eye which are receptive to certain ranges
1519980	1525460	of color, and if they're receptive to say maybe 50 nanometers from say 500 nanometers
1525460	1533260	to 550 nanometers, maybe that's the sensitivity of that cell in your retina, in your eye,
1533260	1538700	and the rods and cones in your eye are receptive to many wavelength bands, and so if you can
1538700	1542500	see many, many colors, and you are gifted to see many colors, then you have lots of
1542500	1545260	different sensors, and they're very fine, and they can see lots of different things,
1545260	1550740	and you have lots of ways that the very narrow bands of frequencies to which these cells
1550740	1553260	are sensitive.
1553260	1558900	So your brain then takes this information as the cells are fired off by the light, and
1558900	1562420	they say, oh I can see this, I get a photon, I get a photon, I get a photon, but then your
1562420	1567940	brain then says, ooh, that's the cell that makes purple, that's the cell that makes green,
1567940	1571260	that's the cell that makes red, and where'd you get those words from?
1571260	1576820	Those words came from what everybody called that thing that we call red, and that redness
1576820	1581620	is what we culturally call red, isn't that interesting?
1581620	1589020	So color is in your brain, you construct it because you add photons inside of a filtered
1589020	1595460	frequency receptor, and that receptor is called a cell, and the cells can see lots of different
1595460	1600500	bands, and it's the difference in brightness between your yellow receptors and your blue
1600540	1604620	receptors, or your blue receptors and your red receptors that tells you what the color
1604620	1605620	is.
1605620	1609500	If your red receptors are really firing off and your blue receptors are not, then you'll
1609500	1610660	call it red.
1610660	1614100	If your green receptors are firing off and neither of the other two are, then you'll call
1614100	1615260	it green.
1615260	1618860	That's how color works, and we call that thing green.
1618860	1622660	Now people who are colorblind, their blue receptors and green receptors are fired equally,
1622660	1626140	so you can't tell the difference, and that's kind of a sad thing for them because they
1626140	1627580	go, what the heck is that?
1627580	1629300	I don't see green, I don't see blue.
1629300	1632980	I just see kind of a gray, and that's what people who've got with their colorblindness,
1632980	1635340	they can't tell the difference between the colors.
1635340	1637060	All right, so that's pretty good.
1637060	1638740	We'll see you next time.
1638740	1646700	Hi, this is Jason Kendall, and welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.
1646700	1648460	We're still talking about light.
1648460	1651340	Light, what the heck is that stuff, light?
1651340	1657980	Light is, well, the thing that we see things with, so we want to know exactly how light
1658420	1659580	does what it does.
1659580	1664020	Last time we reviewed the concept of the speed of light, we reviewed the concept of Doppler
1664020	1668740	shift, we reviewed the concept of what the electromagnetic spectrum is and how it varies
1668740	1673100	with wavelength and what visible light is, we didn't say what it was, and how it's
1673100	1674100	creative.
1674100	1675300	It's kind of weird.
1675300	1679580	We know that it has these wave properties and it acts like a wave, but what makes it
1679580	1681780	act like a wave, and exactly what is it?
1681780	1686140	Well, to understand that, we need to know how light is created.
1686140	1688940	So let's take an example.
1688940	1691820	How does matter create light?
1691820	1695580	Hmm, that's an interesting question.
1695580	1699780	Let's start and go back and say, well, we've talked about Maxwell's laws and the nature
1699780	1704580	of electromagnetic interactions, but we also talked about the nature of fundamental particles,
1704580	1710700	like electrons and protons, and electron and proton has a charge, like an electric charge.
1710700	1716540	A proton is how the electric charge is distributed inside it, it has quarks inside it, but really
1716540	1720940	from the outside far enough away, meaning about 10 to the minus 10th meters, it looks
1720940	1724660	like a point charge with a plus sign, and that's pluses by convention.
1724660	1725660	We just call it a plus.
1725660	1726660	It could be a minus, it could be a plus.
1726660	1727660	It doesn't really matter.
1727660	1729620	It's just what we call it.
1729620	1734100	But then the electron has the exact opposite charge, the same exact amount, but exactly
1734100	1738140	this different, exactly opposite sign.
1738140	1746500	So two like charges, plus plus, will repel each other, and two opposite charges will
1746500	1748700	attract each other, and that's the nature of it.
1748700	1753660	But what do we mean by charges, and why do they retell each other, and what's going on?
1753660	1759980	Well, let's think about this concept, an incredibly important concept to all of physics, and in
1759980	1764220	fact, the incredibly important concept to the element of what we call electromagnetism
1764220	1767300	is the idea of an electric field.
1767300	1776260	An electric field is the influence in space by an electric charge to everything around
1776260	1778620	it, and it doesn't have a limit.
1778620	1780060	It just keeps going.
1780060	1781060	There's no limit.
1781060	1785820	It's just its intensity drops off as the distance squared, but there's no real like limit where
1785820	1790460	it says, well, now I'm done, and it stops, and it's the end of the line.
1790460	1799060	So really, this picture of an atom that is out there, or a plus charge that sits there,
1799060	1803180	and that plus charge just has these, what we call field lines.
1803180	1811020	And if you place something, say another plus charge at a location on a field line, the total
1811020	1817580	number or density of field lines at that location determines how much it's getting pushed away.
1817580	1823940	So the field says, give me a test charge, I'll tell you what force I'm going to exert
1823940	1827980	on another due to the charge at the source.
1827980	1836140	So I placed a little test charge at the field line, and we can place another test charge,
1836140	1840740	maybe one's plus, one's minus, but if it's plus, it gets pushed away, and if it's minus,
1840740	1842980	it gets attracted towards it.
1842980	1850180	So the field lines also determine the direction of motion that the test charge will go.
1850180	1854020	And from a plus charge, we can think of it as being outbound, and a minus charge, you
1854020	1858860	can be considered inbound, and by convention, it doesn't really matter what direction, but
1858860	1860340	we can just do it that way.
1860340	1865900	So a plus charge, if you place another plus charge on a field in an electric field next
1865900	1871820	to a plus charge, and the test charge is very tiny, so incredibly tiny or positive to be
1871820	1875940	tiny, that it actually is the thing that's moved and not the source because they're pushing
1875940	1876940	against it.
1876940	1880740	Remember Newton's equal and opposite forces, one of them just has to be a big enough charge
1880740	1882740	that it doesn't get affected by the other charges much.
1882740	1886100	So the test charge can be infinitesimally small.
1886100	1890220	And then it just gets rocketed out on those field lines, and it goes very, very far away.
1890220	1894540	But if you place it closer, then the field lines are denser, and that means it gets a
1894540	1896340	harder push.
1896340	1899540	And if it's an electric, if it's a negative charge, then it'll be attracted in the same
1899540	1900540	way.
1900820	1905660	Not as much if it's far, and the closer you put it, the more attraction it shall be.
1905660	1911980	So it gains energy as they fall towards each other because they're pulling on each other,
1911980	1915980	and the closer they are, the harder they pull each other because the force of attraction
1915980	1924020	is increased as their distance is made small, and the force of attraction or repulsion is
1924020	1926700	decreased as they're farther and farther apart.
1926700	1934180	And so at some point, they can be so far apart that the electrostatic or electromagnetic
1934180	1940500	force between them, the electrostatic force between them, can be minuscule and not taken
1940500	1941500	into account.
1941500	1945980	However, if you have loose charges around there, they really true, the electric force
1945980	1950460	is very strong, and it's going to really try to actually make it so that they charges
1950460	1951460	get neutral.
1951460	1955580	In any event, opposites attract, light charges repel.
1955580	1956980	And if you've got one, you've got the other.
1956980	1958420	So that's really what we're talking about.
1958420	1963060	So plus charges repel against plus charges, and minus charges repel against minus charges.
1963060	1968220	Protons have a plus charge, electrons have a negative charge, they have exactly the same
1968220	1973020	amount of charge, they're just opposite and equal magnitude.
1973020	1977540	The electron has a much smaller mass, the proton has a much larger mass than the electron.
1977540	1981900	So the proton tends to stay still where the electron tends to whizz about.
1981900	1988820	All right, so distant charges feel the effect of other charges.
1988820	1993420	So all charges feel the effect of the other charges through the electric field that they
1993420	1994660	generate.
1994660	2001300	So really space is permeated by the electric field due to charges.
2001300	2006300	And if they're all standing still, all these electric fields don't move, they're just kind
2006300	2007300	of sitting there.
2007300	2010340	If everybody's held in place, they're all pinned down, let's say all the charges in
2010340	2012220	the universe are pinned to one place.
2012220	2014460	To wherever they're at, doesn't matter where they're at, they're just pinned.
2014460	2017980	Then everything will be pushing on it, but then they're pinned down so they can't move,
2017980	2022460	but they're pushing with the electric field, or they're pulling depending on their charges
2022460	2026620	or the signs of their charges, and that tells us how they're going to move.
2026620	2029940	All right, now let's do something very strange.
2029940	2032740	We then jiggle one of them.
2032740	2041260	If we jiggle them, then the field must change, and how does the field change?
2041260	2045060	The field may change in a regular way.
2045060	2052100	Let's say you instead somehow take an electron and put it between, let's say you staple it
2052100	2057140	between two springs, and if it's between two springs, it might go up and down between
2057140	2061420	the two springs, or it's stapled between two boards on two springs, and so it can go up
2061420	2062420	and down.
2062420	2066340	And as long as you don't touch it, it's not going to vibrate, just like anything that's
2066340	2068740	held by two strings between two boards, right?
2068740	2073100	But if you come along and flick it, then the electron will bounce up and down, right?
2073100	2076940	Now if the electron has an electric field that's associated with it, and the electric
2076940	2081740	field is inbound by convention, and the field lines are drawing towards it, so let's use
2081740	2082740	a proton.
2082740	2084740	So this outbound, I like the outbound errors.
2084740	2089420	So a proton is stapled, and it's held between these two springs, between the two boards,
2089420	2090420	and you kick it.
2090420	2091420	Now it's going up and down.
2091420	2096140	And if it's just going up and down, bouncing up and down like this, what do we notice?
2096140	2102860	The field doesn't stay fixed in space, the field follows the proton.
2102860	2108940	So the proton was here, and the field radiates out from wherever the proton is at that moment.
2108940	2113740	So then the way, some of the field lines, aren't fixed in space.
2113740	2114740	They're moving.
2114740	2116140	They have to be moving up and down.
2116140	2117140	Wait a second.
2117140	2120940	If you make something move up and down, then you've got a wave.
2120940	2123780	Now what happens to that?
2123780	2130300	Well then there's a disturbance in, or disturbance, or a wave motion of up and down of the proton.
2130300	2132980	So now the electric field is going up and down.
2132980	2138500	Now how long does it take for something very far away, a distant charge to feel it?
2138500	2139500	Huh.
2139500	2146700	Well, those changes in the electric field propagate at a particular speed, the speed
2146700	2148640	of light.
2148640	2152720	So really, what is light?
2152720	2158240	Light is a disturbance in the electric field of a charge particle that makes a disturbance.
2158240	2161540	It vibrates, it moves, it accelerates, it changes.
2161540	2167560	And as it changes, the electric field disturbs and that disturbance propagates along.
2167560	2171440	That disturbance is called a photon.
2171440	2172520	That's light.
2172520	2173720	Light is that disturbance.
2173720	2178960	Now why doesn't it propagate forever, like these vibrating strings that we see, or like
2178960	2181560	you can pluck a string and have a standing wave?
2181560	2187040	Well photons propagate from here to there in the same way that if you take a jump rope
2187040	2191800	and you flick the jump rope, when you flick the jump rope, it bounces.
2191800	2197360	And if the jump rope bounces, then you see the pulse go up down the jump rope and the
2197360	2199560	pulse comes back from the jump rope.
2199560	2202240	Now you can make it so there's a nice regular pattern to it.
2202240	2205360	You can do double dutch by having two of the jump ropes go around.
2205360	2209840	You can make it have a nice even string where you have wave patterns in the rope.
2209840	2213440	But really, if you flick the rope, then the disturbance goes down the rope and back the
2213440	2214600	rope.
2214600	2221040	And that disturbance in the electric field line, as it propagates due to the previous
2221040	2224880	motion of the proton, is what the photon is.
2224880	2227520	It's a disturbance in that electromagnetic field.
2227520	2229240	That's really something.
2229240	2234720	So a photon is a disturbed magnetic field that was disturbed, say some time ago, by
2234720	2239040	a very distant thing, and then that distant thing that propagation of that electric field
2239040	2241160	from there to here gets to us eventually.
2241160	2242720	Isn't that weird?
2242720	2247760	If that's what light is, if that's what light is, and that's probably a very close analogy
2247760	2256280	to what we call it from deep studies of what the nature of space and time are, then light,
2256280	2262160	when you look at some distant galaxy, maybe millions of light years away, there was some
2262160	2269000	electron that shook, just a tiny electron or a tiny proton, a very, very, very lightweight
2269000	2276000	object shook, created a disturbance by its shaking that made a disturbance in its electric
2276000	2277000	field.
2277000	2281480	And that electric field disturbance propagated out through space on the electric field of
2281480	2287360	the proton, and eventually reached your eye three million light years away.
2287360	2291280	Wow, that's interesting.
2291280	2297920	So it propagates through space radiatively, carrying the energy of the disturbance that
2297920	2305800	created it across space, vast to areas of space, as a packet of a disturbance, as a wave
2305800	2311720	packet, a disturbed wave packet in the electric field lines as it propagates through space.
2311720	2316720	That's an interesting picture of a photon, and that's what we call that, so that packet
2316720	2320840	of waves, that disturbance is called a photon.
2320840	2325080	And electrons don't vibrate forever, protons don't vibrate forever, they take a certain
2325080	2329120	amount of time and then they stop vibrating, and when it's done vibrating, then guess what?
2329120	2333320	That's the end of the wave packet train, and there it goes, the photons on its way.
2333360	2340720	Alright, now that's essentially a very meat and potatoes sort of elementary way of talking
2340720	2342600	about photons.
2342600	2347560	Photons have a certain amount of energy, that amount of energy is related to the frequency
2347560	2352520	or the wavelength, whichever you like to use, in order to say how much energy the photon
2352520	2353520	has.
2353520	2357040	So the wavelength of the photon determines its energy.
2357040	2363000	The short wavelength photons have high energy, the long wavelength photons have low energy.
2363000	2366000	The light has long wavelengths, it's low energy.
2366000	2372240	Gamma ray light has short wavelengths, so it has high energy.
2372240	2376680	Next because it's a wave motion, and if you do something really interesting, if you take,
2376680	2380240	because we learn this through electromagnetism, if you go take an electrostatics class, you
2380240	2384880	learn about Faraday's Law, you learn about the nature of the Beelzebub Art Law, you learn
2384880	2388960	all these interesting things where if you take a current, take a current of electrons,
2388960	2394800	which is now an electric flow, a flow of charges, in a circle, make a circular charge
2394800	2400600	flow, you create a magnetic field, and a magnetic field flows through the charge.
2400600	2404160	So if you want to start your car, you use what's called a selenoid, and a selenoid is
2404160	2407480	a many, many, many turns of an electric coil.
2407480	2411080	You then put a charge back and forth, you change an electric current back and forth
2411080	2417800	through that selenoid, and it moves a piston that then starts the engine running, and that
2417800	2423120	forces gasoline into the engine, and then starts the engine up.
2423120	2427120	So you can take an electric force from the battery and do an alternating current through
2427120	2431600	it that then shakes the selenoid, and shakes it, and it creates an alternating magnetic
2431600	2435000	field and starts a car.
2435000	2441000	So an electric field, going in a circular motion, creates a magnetic field.
2441000	2446240	Likewise, if you take a magnetic field, a fixed magnet, a fixed magnet that has a magnetic
2446240	2452280	field, like an iron magnet or a bar magnet, and then you spin it, it will create an electric
2452280	2453520	field.
2453520	2458080	That's part of the way that we get electricity out of hydroelectric dams.
2458080	2463720	You create fixed, large bar magnets that then as the water goes over the waterfall, it turns
2463720	2473120	turbines, and the turbines then spin magnets which wrap around coils of wire, and those
2473120	2479160	wires then have an electric current that is created out of them by the twisting, by
2479160	2480880	the spinning magnetic field.
2480880	2482200	Wow.
2482200	2487000	So there's a link between the electric, the motion of an electric field, and the creation
2487000	2491080	of a magnetic field, and the motion of a magnetic field, and the creation of an electric field.
2491080	2496520	We've just learned that when you vibrate an atom, you create an electric field.
2496520	2500560	You always have an electric field, but if you vibrate an atom, then it creates a disturbance
2500560	2503840	in the electric field that disturbance is called a photon.
2503840	2509000	But if you have it, but remember you're accelerating it, and you then have, if you have any kind
2509000	2514600	of motion that can be determined to be cyclic with respect to an electric field, then there
2514600	2517960	is a perpendicular magnetic field to that.
2517960	2524880	So it is predicted that the photon has a magnetic field that runs perpendicular to the electric
2524880	2527120	field in the direction of propagation.
2527120	2531320	And as the magnetic, as the photon propagates maybe with a direction, with a wavelength
2531320	2534800	like that going in that direction, it will also have a magnetic field that goes this
2534800	2537680	way as it propagates in that direction.
2537680	2542520	So electromagnetic fields, magnetic fields are linked to electric fields.
2542520	2549040	For the earth, that is another example, the earth has a liquid metal iron core, and as
2549040	2554920	the earth spins, that magnetic, that liquid iron core has a strong magnetic property because
2554920	2558600	of ferromagnetism, and that creates an electric field, which then creates a magnetic field,
2558600	2563840	and we have a dynamo effect, and thus the earth has a protective magnetic field around
2563840	2564840	it.
2564840	2566520	Really quite interesting.
2566520	2570880	So magnetic fields are created by the movement of current, and the movement of current creates
2570880	2573440	magnetic fields, and they're linked.
2573440	2578320	Alright, and that's the nature of a photon is that oscillating electric fields create
2578320	2582800	magnetic fields, and the same thing, oscillating magnetic fields creates an electric field.
2582800	2586640	And as that propagates through time, we call that a photon as well.
2586640	2591040	So the wave packet of a photon isn't just an electric field, there's also a magnetic
2591040	2594240	field component to it as well.
2594240	2598280	So the direction that we call that magnetic field is called polarization.
2598280	2603520	So the photon might be oriented up and down, the electric field, the vibration might be
2603520	2607480	like this because of how we shook the proton, it might be going like this.
2607480	2611320	And so the orientation, the polarization of the light might be in that direction, might
2611320	2612600	be up and down.
2612600	2616280	This is also a reason why when you wish to have good sunglasses for the summertime, and
2616280	2621000	you wish to see the road while you're driving, you use polarized sunglasses, because when
2621000	2625320	light reflects off the road, it reflects off of a flat surface, and when it reflects off
2625320	2630920	of a flat surface, it bounces off that flat surface, and all the vertical components of
2630920	2636960	the polarization are gone from the scattered or randomly oriented light in its polarizations
2636960	2639680	to only having the ones that are parallel to the road.
2639680	2643240	So all you need to do to have good glasses to drive with, which are called polarizing
2643240	2649240	sunglasses, is to have something that blocks out the light that goes like this.
2649240	2651760	And how can you do that?
2651760	2654520	Not too difficult, you think of a picket fence.
2654520	2659800	Picket fences, you can throw a Frisbee through on its edge, because the slats are vertical,
2659800	2664080	and so there's a hole that's vertical between the slats, and you can't throw a Frisbee between
2664080	2665600	the slats of a picket fence.
2665840	2670640	However, you can throw it on the angle, throw it on the side through the picket fence, but
2670640	2673400	not flat through the picket fence.
2673400	2680680	Well, if you wanted to take that principle aside, so polarizing sunglasses are simply
2680680	2687520	very small slats that are printed inside the glass that then block the light, and how can
2687520	2688520	you see it through it?
2688520	2695400	Because the size of the slats is on the order of the size of the wavelength of light, and
2695400	2701000	so the polarized light that's coming up and down, that's going side to side, is blocked
2701000	2703120	because all the slats are vertical.
2703120	2708240	So you get to see only the vertically oriented light, which is minimized because of the reflective
2708240	2710080	property of the asphalt.
2710080	2717000	So light comes as polarized as well as being electromagnetic, and it has an orientation
2717000	2720040	to the electric field, an orientation to the magnetic field 90 degrees to the electric
2720040	2724360	field, it has a direction of motion at the speed of light that we talked about.
2724360	2726320	So what is light?
2726320	2733000	Light gets emitted in copious quantities by hot objects, by electric fields that are being
2733000	2742080	made by vibrating electrons and protons inside of atoms and molecules, inside of dense objects
2742080	2748880	or inside of hot objects or inside of things that are simply energy, and we see that energy
2748880	2750720	coming off of them.
2750720	2755560	So the light's really there, and it's all sorts of different frequencies, and it's
2755560	2761320	all sorts of different wavelengths from very, very high energy to very low energy, and
2761320	2766680	how it propagates from one medium to another, whether it can penetrate a wall or penetrate
2766680	2771760	only air, or whether it gets absorbed by water, or whether it gets absorbed by nothing and
2771760	2775840	passes through everything, is all dependent on the properties of the material through
2775840	2777480	which it passes.
2777480	2783000	So light is everywhere, it bounces around the room, knocking about, and as it hits
2783000	2784760	a wall, it reflects off.
2784760	2786880	How does it reflect off a wall?
2786880	2790760	It goes a little bit in, and it shakes the electron inside of there, and the electron
2790760	2795400	says, no, I don't think I'll need that sandwich today, and shakes back, and the photon comes
2795400	2796440	back out.
2796440	2800840	So really what happens in a reflection is it goes in and gets turned around.
2800840	2805760	You can think of it as getting trapped in a turn style, the light gets pulled in and
2805760	2807160	swung around.
2807160	2812520	It doesn't actually, it gets absorbed very briefly, and then re-radiated back out the
2812520	2814760	same direction it came.
2814760	2818600	And these kind of ray tracings were done by Newton a long time ago, so we have predictions,
2818600	2823080	and in fact quantum electrodynamics actually accurately predicts by some really interesting
2823080	2827160	arguments that I'll leave to Richard Feynman if you go look up at his videos about this,
2827160	2829560	exactly how that works, which is really fascinating.
2829560	2831480	You can look that stuff up.
2831480	2835160	This is not really for an introductory level thing, but you look up at quantum electrodynamics
2835160	2841880	and it'll tell you exactly how the nature of the phase shift of the frequency of light
2841880	2850040	interacts with the phasing, with how the electrons move inside of a material.
2850040	2857080	So it's a very, I won't be able to do it justice in a short video, so I'll just leave it to
2857080	2858080	others who have done that.
2858080	2860920	I'll go to Richard Feynman videos, go look his stuff up, it'll be fantastic, you'll love
2860920	2861920	it.
2862160	2868160	But be that as it may, the study of how light actually interacts with material is an incredibly
2868160	2871200	important element to all of astronomy and all of physics.
2871200	2877600	In fact, it's central because one of our more key ways to understanding the nature of materials
2877600	2880480	in physics is actually through spectroscopy.
2880480	2884080	All right, so let's finish with the electromagnetic spectrum.
2884080	2889840	The electromagnetic spectrum is all the possible wavelengths of light.
2889840	2895200	There are many different wavelength regions from radio to infrared to microwave to visible
2895200	2900480	to ultraviolet to x-ray to gamma ray and they span an enormous number of wavelengths and
2900480	2901480	frequencies.
2901480	2906520	The total number of wavelengths that we call infrared is as I think about almost a thousand
2906520	2911400	times bigger than what we call visible light and radio light is pretty much everything
2911400	2915280	shorter and longer than like a centimeter or so.
2915280	2920800	That light is shorter than 300 nanometers and goes down to a few tens of nanometers
2920800	2926920	when we get into soft x-rays and soft x-rays go up to angstrom level, go up to single angstrom
2926920	2932720	sizes and even harder when you talk to gamma rays which are on the size scale of 10 to
2932720	2935320	the minus 12 meters in terms of wavelength.
2935320	2941200	So the higher the energy of the light, the shorter the wavelength and the higher the
2941200	2948360	frequency and there's no real theoretical limit to the lower limit to the wavelength
2948360	2953480	of light but there is kind of a theoretical upper limit to the total energy of light that
2953480	2958000	can occur in terms of energy because at a certain point the light becomes so energetic
2958000	2962160	that it can actually fall apart and become other particles like it actually can just
2962160	2966600	turn into matter if the energy is great enough and that's a study for nuclear physics.
2966600	2971080	So the electromagnetic spectrum is simply all the different forms of light in all their
2971080	2975240	different wavelengths but the total amount of light and different kinds of light that
2975240	2980280	exist in the electromagnetic spectrum is vast and the best way to, the best analogy
2980280	2988600	for it is look at the keys on a grand piano and if we could only look at the sky in visible
2988600	2994000	light like we had for centuries all the way up through the early 1960s when we finally
2994000	2998280	got the technology to look at radio light and when we finally launched satellites actually
2998280	3005040	to look at ultraviolet and gamma ray and x-ray and infrared the analogy is almost completely
3005040	3010440	accurate that looking at the light, looking at the universe with only one in the visible
3010440	3018200	range is like playing a piano concerto by only listening to one middle C, one note middle
3018200	3021360	C on the piano and that's what it's like.
3021360	3025560	So imagine hearing a gorgeous symphony and somebody, some crazy composer says well this
3025560	3030640	is a symphony, this is so and so symphony but I've removed all of the notes except for
3030640	3036640	middle C and so you might hear this 25 minute cacop, you might hear this wonderful piano
3036640	3043080	concerto that lasts for half an hour and all you ever hear is when they play middle C.
3043080	3045280	That's what it's like.
3045280	3050840	Almost you're missing the whole thing if you don't see in these other wavelengths of light.
3050840	3056920	So the electromagnetic spectrum looks at so many things and we get to see so many more
3056920	3063160	things, so many different processes that occur as a result of it and what are those processes?
3063160	3069240	That's what we'll talk about next time.
3069240	3073560	Hello this is Jason Kendall welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.
3073560	3074560	Great to have you back.
3074560	3080520	We're now going to start diving deeply into technical aspects of astronomy and how they
3080520	3083240	relate to the physics of astrophysics.
3083240	3086520	So to this time we're going to be talking about the nature of stellar brightness and
3086520	3089520	luminosity and luminosity distances.
3089520	3094280	So let's start with the concept of what we mean when we say the words how bright is the
3094280	3095680	star.
3095680	3098560	Usually when I take people outside to go to a telescope they're going to say wow look
3098560	3099560	at that bright star.
3099560	3103400	What they won't say look how bright that star is, they'll say look how big that star is.
3103400	3108040	And people mean big but they really mean bright and so what do we actually mean by the word
3108040	3109040	bright?
3109080	3112600	And so brightness is a thing that we actually try to quantify.
3112600	3118920	Brightness is an amount of energy we receive in terms of photons per second and given what
3118920	3125240	brightness is and so that can over in a detector such as an eye or a camera or something like
3125240	3126240	that.
3126240	3131880	So when we talk about that we're really talking about the nature of brightness is a perception.
3131880	3135600	But really if we want to know about the nature of the object itself we need to talk about
3135640	3136640	luminosity.
3136640	3143000	And luminosity is the intrinsic amount of energy the object such as a star is putting
3143000	3147440	out every second over whatever wavelength band we wish to care about.
3147440	3150360	So how bright is a luminous a source?
3150360	3151360	How bright is it?
3151360	3156560	Well that's the number of photons that arrive at a detector and so that's what we call the
3156560	3158000	apparent brightness.
3158000	3164200	And frequently in the literature we call that B. Capital big B is the apparent brightness.
3164200	3169680	And what we measure that in is some really odd units but strictly speaking everything
3169680	3176320	that we ever measure brightness in is essentially either photons per second in a surface area
3176320	3179960	or energy per second in a surface area.
3179960	3182840	Photons per second we already know what the energy of the photons is so we can just deal
3182840	3183840	with that.
3183840	3187600	So our real question is we want to know the energy that we're receiving per second over
3187600	3191040	a surface area and that's what we call the apparent brightness.
3191040	3194080	The thing we're trying to hunt for though is what we call the luminosity.
3194080	3196160	That's how bright something really is.
3196160	3200000	So we're getting these two words brightness and luminosity a little mixed up but we're
3200000	3202480	going to resolve that shortly.
3202480	3208720	Luminosity is the entire luminous output of the star when we say luminous output that's
3208720	3210720	where it comes from luminous means light.
3210720	3217840	So luminous output is the total amount of energy output by a star in the form of light
3217840	3218840	per second.
3218840	3223480	Now we can measure that in energy per second or more commonly we use the word watts such
3223480	3229040	as light bulbs, light bulbs have a 100 watt light bulb or a 500 watt light bulb etc etc.
3229040	3232160	The sun's a lot brighter than the average light bulb.
3232160	3237080	So the energy we met, the units we measure luminosity in are energy per second and that's
3237080	3242240	what the production amount of energy is happening by that object.
3242240	3246080	So these two things are of course related because brightness is how bright you see it
3246080	3251040	to be and luminosity is what it's actually putting out and how bright it appears to you
3251040	3256760	is actually the depends on the luminosity divided by 4 pi times the distance to the
3256760	3261840	object squared because let's assume that the light is being spread out uniformly across
3261840	3264920	a sphere such as like a bulb light.
3264920	3269840	So if it's a bulb light we expect it to be going across a sphere and so it spreads out
3269840	3274760	evenly and so the brightness drops off as the distance squared to the object.
3274760	3279600	So luminosity gets dimmed by the distance squared so that's where we get the units of
3279600	3285040	energy per second per square meter or watts per square meter if we're using SI standard
3285040	3286040	units.
3286040	3288960	And when we're talking about that that's where that 4 pi comes in from it's not just
3288960	3294120	the distance squared it's the 4 pi because it gets spread out over a surface area and
3294120	3295640	it drops as it goes.
3295640	3301400	So if something's twice as far it's 4 times as dim, if it's 3 times as far it's 9 times
3301400	3307600	as dim, if it's 5 times as far it's 25 times as dim, if it's 11 times as far it's 121
3307600	3309760	times as dim and so on.
3309760	3314080	So the 4 pi comes from the fact that we're assuming it spreads out evenly over the surface
3314080	3315680	of a sphere.
3315680	3317180	So what do we mean?
3317180	3324880	Does the star look bright simply because it is intrinsically very luminous or is it faint
3324880	3326120	but nearby?
3326120	3330640	So we have to measure the distances to things so distances become a very important thing.
3330640	3335840	Luminosity is not distance dependent is a distance independent property it's a property
3335840	3340640	of the object itself whereas brightness is dependent upon our perception of it.
3340640	3345120	So we need to be able to know how to measure brightness and that science is the thing we
3345120	3348760	call photometry and we express it.
3348760	3354320	Photometry is really the measuring of photons, photometry, the measuring of photons.
3354320	3358640	So we're counting the total number of photons we receive and there's a couple of ways we
3358640	3362560	talk about it we can express it in terms of the old familiar thing that we learned from
3362560	3368340	Parkus a long time ago in stellar magnitudes or we can express it in absolute fluxes meaning
3368340	3373120	the energy that we receive in detector per second on top of the surface area.
3373120	3376400	And in astronomy we use both of them interchangeably.
3376400	3381520	So the magnitude system is something that you'll hear very commonly if you go outside
3381520	3385040	with a bunch of amateurs, astronomers say oh up in the sky that's a 5th magnitude star
3385040	3386040	hour.
3386040	3389160	This is a great night we can see down to 6th magnitude and you'll hear things like that
3389160	3393880	or wow the brightest star in the sky is a 0th magnitude star and you'll hear such things.
3393880	3397960	Well the tradition of magnitudes dates a very long time ago.
3397960	3404440	It comes from Parkus which was a Greek philosopher and he actually of Nicaea and he lived roughly
3404440	3407160	about roughly roughly in the 2nd century B.C.
3407160	3414320	He lived about 70 years, about 190 B.C. to 120 and he classified stars and ranked them
3414320	3415400	into magnitudes.
3415400	3420240	He said the first magnitude star is the brightest, the second magnitude star is the second brightest
3420240	3425280	and the other ones are dimmer than that so he ranked them into three groups.
3425280	3431320	Later on Ptolemy of the Almagast who gave us the Ptolemaic system of the cosmos which
3431320	3435680	is the sun centered, Ptolemy came along and made it more qualitative and added them into
3435680	3439400	six separate buckets so that the magnitudes could be divided into the first magnitude
3439400	3446280	degree all the way down to the sixth brightest stars, sixth magnitude being the sixth brightest
3446280	3447440	type of stars.
3447440	3452440	So these were all relative brightnesses and they were done by eye.
3452440	3457160	There's no detectors, there's no photometric detectors, no cameras in 100 B.C.
3457160	3459200	So that was kind of a tricky thing.
3459200	3461440	So you had to say well this one's a little bit brighter than that one, this one's brighter
3461440	3463200	than that one, that one's brighter than this one, this one's brighter than that one.
3463200	3468000	So they ranked them in terms of their parent brightness and that was called their magnitude
3468000	3475040	system and magnitude simply meant to them it looked bigger because magnitude means size.
3475040	3479760	So my goodness, it's actually not a size thing, stars are so far away that we can't
3479760	3484560	actually perceive their size from Earth very easily, only a few stars have actually been
3484560	3486200	measured in such a way.
3486200	3490760	But the point is that magnitude means size but here we're using it as a word for brightness
3490760	3494640	and magnitudes are a measure of relative brightnesses between stars.
3495440	3500560	Now the modern magnitude system was developed in 1856 by Norman Pogson and Norman Pogson
3500560	3507520	at Oxford who was considered to be, he's also from, he went to India, I believe he was from
3507520	3513440	India originally and he developed what we call the modern system magnitudes and he codified
3513440	3517400	this ancient idea of Hipparchus into a separate set of definitions.
3517400	3525880	He said, well every five steps of the stars, every five magnitudes is a set of 100 brightness
3525880	3526880	in times.
3526880	3530920	Now he actually was able to quantify this because it's very close to the truth in terms
3530920	3532720	of the old idea.
3532720	3537880	So Hipparchus' idea, modified by Ptolemy, was actually very close to the eye and the
3537880	3543040	eye acts logarithmically in terms of their brightnesses that we can measure and so he
3543040	3546760	said that if a difference in five magnitudes is 100 times brightness.
3546760	3552120	And so he also said the standard star of brightness was Vega which is 0th magnitude.
3552120	3557880	So for example a 9th magnitude star is 100 times brighter than a 4th magnitude star and
3557880	3563480	a 0th magnitude star is 100 times brighter than a 5th magnitude star and so forth and
3563480	3564480	so on.
3564480	3569240	So the faintest stars that we can possibly discover with any aspect aren't really necessarily
3569240	3572800	stars, they're probably galaxies or quasars, that's about 30th magnitude and those have
3572800	3575920	been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope.
3575920	3580440	Ground based equipment, the best ground based equipment by amateurs is roughly 15, 16, maybe
3580440	3582640	18th or 19th magnitude on the ground.
3582640	3584480	So you can get some pretty faint stuff.
3584480	3588240	Remember every difference of five is 100 times.
3588240	3593800	So zero magnitude is 100 times brighter than five which is 100 times brighter than 10 which
3593800	3597440	is 100 times brighter than 15 which is 100 times brighter than 20.
3597440	3603640	So a difference between 0th magnitude and 20th magnitude is 100 times 100 times 100
3604440	3608760	or 10 to the 8th, that's 100 million times brighter.
3608760	3614000	A 0th magnitude star such as Sirius in the sky is 100 million times brighter than a 20th
3614000	3618080	magnitude star and there are 20th magnitude stars that have been observed in the Milky
3618080	3620880	Way, they're just really dim and really far.
3620880	3626920	Alright, so Poxton's definition can be codified numerically by saying the ratio of the brightness
3626920	3632960	is equals 100 to the difference in magnitudes divided by five and so the difference in five
3633000	3638440	magnitudes gives us 100 times brightness and that allows us to define the magnitude system
3638440	3642720	but still it's a relative magnitude system, it's always relative.
3642720	3646520	What's nice though is that it actually allows us to codify, if we can get the brightness
3646520	3651600	in energy per second on a surface area we get the brightness of one star and then we
3651600	3655640	can actually translate brightnesses between each other.
3655640	3660400	This also allows us to roughly guess by eye the brightness of something and then allow
3660560	3665760	us to get very close to what we actually get with some sort of formal detector.
3665760	3672260	Nicely enough, the standard star is Vega and Vega is prominent to most people in the sky
3672260	3678160	and the standard for Vega is a little tweaky because Vega is a variable star but in terms
3678160	3682880	of things Vega was defined in many magnitude systems to be zero and so you can basically
3682880	3687280	start from Vega and go everywhere and you compare and compare and compare, oh how am
3687440	3690560	I to compare to Vega, I'm brighter, I'm dimmer, I'm brighter, I'm dimmer.
3690560	3696040	Vega is useful because it goes across the zenith for most of, for many North American
3696040	3701360	and Northern European and Northern Hemisphere observers, doesn't go across the zenith for
3701360	3705000	people in the South Hemisphere so they got to use secondary standards of some kind because
3705000	3709640	the entire system has been centered around Northern Hemisphere so we can codify that
3709640	3715760	and so basically we can say the star compared to Vega's brightness could be 100 to the stellar
3715800	3720680	magnitude divided by five and that allows us to actually compare a star's brightness
3720680	3723840	with respect to Vega and give us a numeric value.
3723840	3730200	If somehow you can get the energy received per second at Vega, from Vega as you can perceive
3730200	3733520	the energy per second on top of the surface area, that gives you that thing.
3733520	3739160	Now you can do that both ways because your detector detects in energy per second, that's
3739160	3742960	how it detects so you're going to translate this into magnitude so magnitudes tend to
3742960	3747560	be a pretty handy system because they're something visual, also they're logarithmic.
3747560	3752760	So therefore the apparent magnitude system ranges from negative 30 which is, well negative
3752760	3757200	30 which is roughly around the sun, the sun's a little bit dimmer than negative 30 but the
3757200	3760760	apparent magnitude of the sun is negative 27, goes all the way to full moon which is
3760760	3763040	about negative 12 and a half or so.
3763040	3769640	Naked eye limit is about six, binoculars go down to about 10, the typical one meter scope
3769640	3775480	is around magnitude 18 or 20 and anything bigger than the meter class scope, that's
3775480	3778480	almost out of amateur astronomy land.
3778480	3781360	There are some amateurs who have bigger scopes than this, there's not many of them, they're
3781360	3785680	expensive equipment to use and work with but with them we're talking in terms of large
3785680	3790560	scale observational qualities and you get to four meter class scopes which can observe
3790560	3795560	down to 26 magnitude and the Hubble that can observe to about 30th magnitude.
3795560	3801280	So the science of flux photometry and what we call flux, not the flux capacitor from
3801280	3807840	back to the future, what flux photometry is the total amount of energy, meaning flux,
3807840	3813320	flux is another name for brightness, is the total flux that we perceive on top of, through
3813320	3815280	a detector.
3815280	3820360	Sometimes you wish to use fluence where fluence is the total amount of energy, not just energy
3820360	3824800	per second but total energy on a detector, so it's energy per second and that's been
3824800	3827600	integrated over time, you know what we call the fluids.
3827600	3832800	So flux photometry says I'm going to measure the brightnesses between various stars using
3832800	3836680	various standards and I'm going to use a filter wheel on top of this thing and check the differences
3836680	3840520	of brightness between various filters and then I'm going to start from Vega or whatever
3840520	3845840	standard stars I have perhaps or anything in the land ults that will send me over to
3845840	3847360	brightnesses of stars.
3847360	3854600	So the science of flux photometry then says good, I'm going to try to get these brightnesses
3854600	3862920	as accurately as I can and I'm going to difference them against known standard stars or if not
3862920	3869360	this, not Vega, then standard stars are agreed by the entire astronomical community in order
3869360	3872320	to say this is how bright a star is with respect to this.
3872320	3878320	So these standard stars have had their energy output carefully measured and repeatedly measured
3878320	3883000	for non-variability so they can be called standard stars and that's how Vega was discovered
3883000	3887160	to be a variable star, it's a slightly variable star so it's harder to use.
3887160	3890920	The sun is a slightly variable star in terms of if you were looking at it from a distance,
3890920	3893000	in fact it is a variable star.
3893000	3897560	So we have to take into many accounts when we're doing the science of flux photometry,
3897560	3901680	we have to detect whether or not there's clouds in the sky, how high the object is in the
3901680	3909600	sky, where there's a lot of things, the detector itself, how your camera works, how your telescope
3909680	3915400	works, whether or not you have, the readout of your camera is good or bad, the temperature
3915400	3921040	of your system, there's a whole bunch of things that can affect the brightness of your measurement.
3921040	3925640	So that's for another day and I'll allow you to go dig around the internet to walk down
3925640	3931680	that very deep rabbit hole to see what you have to do in order to calibrate to your telescope.
3931680	3938680	But in very general terms we can then say the luminosity of an object measured through
3938680	3940200	some brightness.
3940200	3945680	So is simply equal to 4 pi times the distance squared to the object times that brightness
3945680	3950480	and you just need two measurements in order to get the actual luminosity.
3950480	3953240	You need to know the distance and you need to know the brightness.
3953240	3956320	So if you can get one of those, you can get two of those, brightness is pretty easy, that's
3956320	3961040	just what you get at your detector, but you've got to back play it and remove all the effects
3961040	3965360	of the earth's atmosphere and many other effects in order to make sure that you actually
3965360	3968640	get really what you think is the real brightness so you can say oh there's all these things
3968640	3973360	that took away light darn it and you take that into account and then you'll get the
3973360	3977600	brightness outside your detector and outside the atmosphere and then you get a distance
3977600	3980600	measurement and guess what you'll have the luminosity.
3980600	3984920	So a lot of practical issues associated with this is a huge number.
3984920	3989360	The largest thing I describe many of them to you but one of the biggest is distance.
3989360	3990360	Distance, distance, distance.
3990360	3996360	Oh that's the worst thing in the world but a lot of distances can be measured using parallax
3996360	4002800	and so parallax gets by the Haparco satellite in the early 90s got the distances to about
4002800	4007760	100,000 stars and the Gaia mission recently got distances to over a few billion stars.
4007760	4012160	So this is a big, big, big improvement so using these distances will allow us to get secondary
4012160	4018480	things such as luminosities based upon appearances that can be seen without checking distance.
4018480	4022480	So distances are incredibly critical and once we get those things there's a lot of things
4022480	4026600	to go and luckily the Gaia mission has done a lot of that so this is fantastic.
4026600	4032920	So luminosity is either measured in watts or in this unit list thing that we will call
4032920	4036000	absolute magnitudes.
4036000	4040080	Absolute magnitudes or luminosity in watts, they don't depend on the distance.
4040080	4045460	They almost stars have different absolute and apparent magnitudes meaning the absolute
4045460	4050800	magnitude is different than what we perceive it to be or see it to be and the lower the
4050800	4056960	number the more luminous it is in magnitudes and luminous just as how much light is coming
4056960	4057960	out.
4057960	4062520	So what we'll tend to do is we'll compare two objects luminosities and we see that they're
4062520	4066720	relative to their brightness and the inverse of their distance is squared and that gives
4066720	4068880	us, that will give us what we're going for.
4068880	4075480	But we can create this concept called the luminosity distance meaning how far is it based on how
4075480	4076800	bright it is.
4076800	4079520	So let's take as our example the Sun.
4079520	4083980	We can measure the Sun to a pretty good accuracy, a very good accuracy, it's roughly 93 million
4083980	4084980	miles.
4084980	4088080	That's a good accuracy, 150 million kilometers.
4088080	4089760	So we can use that as a baseline.
4089760	4095760	So if we know the distance to the Sun and if we know the luminosity of the Sun, that's
4095760	4097240	also very well studied.
4097240	4101760	So if we got the luminosity of the Sun, we've got the distance to the Sun, we can make brightness
4101760	4104880	measurements in the Sun, then that helps us.
4104880	4108560	Strictly speaking, we want to go across all wavelengths and that would be called the
4108560	4112440	bolometric luminosity, but we'll talk about that maybe later, but I don't think that's
4112440	4113440	totally critical.
4113440	4116040	But that's a real end result, it's a total output.
4116040	4120120	So we're going to assume that we're going to, we're doing the bolometric luminosity
4120120	4121120	in any event.
4121120	4125360	So you figure out the brightness of the Sun across the entire spectrum and you know the
4125360	4131240	distance to it and you know the, then if you can somehow derive the luminosity across
4131240	4133760	the entire spectrum, then guess what?
4133760	4138440	You can use that to find the distance to other stars because if you can guess somehow,
4138440	4143920	compare luminosity by hook or crook, maybe there's a way to do that and there is, it's
4143920	4146760	called spectroscopic parallax, but we'll talk about that later.
4146760	4150400	So if you can get the luminosity of the star compared to the Sun or if you can get the
4150400	4154920	bright and get the brightness of that star compared to the Sun, then guess what?
4154920	4160440	You can get the distance to the star and that's called the luminosity distance or the distance
4160440	4165480	based on a standard object that you can calibrate against and then get the distance based on
4165480	4171200	how bright you see it to be knowing how bright it actually is.
4171200	4176040	And the, the standard way we talk about this in astronomy is using a thing called absolute
4176040	4182200	magnitudes and absolute magnitudes are a pretend concept that actually says pretend you take
4182200	4188680	every star or every object in the sky and move it close or far to a distance from the
4188680	4195040	Sun of 10 parsecs, 10 parsecs, 32.6 light years and then how bright does it appear?
4195040	4200280	Because it's magnitude, it's visual magnitude, it's V magnitude, it's I magnitude.
4200280	4206040	How bright does it appear when it's brought by magic or hook and crook or just imagination
4206040	4207560	to 10 parsecs from home?
4207560	4210600	And that's the definition of the absolute magnitude.
4210600	4211760	So how can we use this?
4211760	4214800	The brightness, we compare the brightness of the Sun and luminosity, we can rearrange
4214800	4221200	it and to get to say, well, how, if we then say, let's look at one star, just one star,
4221200	4226800	and if we think, ah, when the star is far, it's dimmer than when it's near.
4226800	4232280	And if the star, but it's the same luminosity because it's the same star, so the brightness
4232280	4235520	only depends upon the distance squared that we have.
4235520	4240360	So the farther star, it will be compared to the distance, the nearest star squared will
4240360	4244040	give us, well, that will show us the distance between them.
4244040	4249780	Remember, brightness is defined to be a difference in magnitudes.
4249780	4253740	So we're going to use the magnitude system in order to get there.
4253740	4258300	The brightness versus far is one thing, and then we can equate that to a Pogson's equation
4258300	4263100	for the magnitudes, and then we get the magnitude of the far star compared to the magnitude
4263100	4266380	of the near star, and then that gives us the brightness difference.
4266380	4270460	And we work out to this thing where we find that the difference in magnitudes is equal
4270460	4273180	to a logarithm of the brightness.
4273180	4277660	So a logarithm of the brightness gives a logarithm of the, a logarithm of the brightness, and
4277660	4283100	therefore, logarithm of the distance gives us the magnitudes.
4283100	4288500	Now if we can get the distances, we're good, but we've already established one thing.
4288500	4289900	It's the same star.
4289900	4294480	So the magic distance we're going to pretend it is is 10 parsecs.
4294480	4300420	So if we instead of saying, look at the two magnitudes, we say one of them is the absolute
4300420	4307060	magnitude, and that is the magnitude if the star, we're magically placed at 10 parsecs
4307060	4308060	away.
4308060	4313340	Then we end up with what's called the distance modulus equation, which says the apparent
4313340	4319020	magnitude subtract, and then you take the apparent magnitude, they subtract it, subtract
4319020	4325100	from it the absolute magnitude, and that is the same, that is equal to 5 times the base
4325100	4331200	log 10 logarithm, logarithm of the distance, and then minus some number 5, because remember
4331200	4333020	magnitudes have no units.
4333020	4334020	They're really strange.
4334020	4336260	They're just relative brightnesses between two stars.
4336260	4342700	So there are relative brightness, so they have no units, unlike luminosity, which does.
4342700	4345100	So absolute magnitudes is kind of a funny thing.
4345100	4349260	It's a unitless way of talking about luminosity.
4349260	4353180	But if we know the distance is something, and we can measure the measure of the brightness
4353180	4358100	and apparent magnitudes, then we have the absolute magnitude, and that's really something
4358100	4359100	we can use.
4359100	4360780	So absolute magnitudes are important.
4360780	4367980	If we know the parallax of a star, the parallax is the inverse of the distance in arc seconds.
4367980	4372020	So if we know the parallax, we can take the base 10 logarithm of the parallax, add 1 to
4372020	4376100	it, multiply that by 5, and then add the apparent magnitude to that.
4376100	4377700	We get the absolute magnitude.
4377700	4383700	So now we take two measurable things, the apparent magnitude and the parallax, and then
4383700	4388780	we do some magic, some mathematical, magic, some arithmetic on that, and we get the absolute
4388780	4390220	magnitude.
4390220	4395260	So if we can get the absolute magnitude of a star, and know how that absolute magnitude
4395260	4403420	compares to the luminosity of the star, and we have a fixed way of doing that, then measuring
4403420	4407580	the apparent magnitude and the parallax will give us the absolute luminosity.
4407580	4413140	There's a lot of trickery that goes into the last step, but it is possible, and it is doable
4413140	4414580	at the very minimum.
4414580	4419060	So as an example, if we take one of the nearest stars to us, one of the actually the approximate
4419180	4426060	of an alpha centauri, which has a parallax of 742 milli arc seconds, and it has an absolute
4426060	4431140	magnitude of just a little bit brighter than zero, it's minus 0.01, then that means it's
4431140	4436100	absolute visual magnitude, apparent visual magnitude, meaning what we see it to be.
4436100	4437580	It's a visual magnitude.
4437580	4442020	And then the absolute visual magnitude is about 4.3 plus 4.3, and that's what the math
4442020	4443340	works out to be.
4443340	4447860	So magnitudes themselves are things that also we measure inside of filters.
4447860	4452340	So a filter will actually determine it, what we use.
4452340	4456460	So we're going to have a magnitude in the Johnson B, or the Johnson V, the Johnson
4456460	4461580	I, or the Sloan I, or the Sloan U, or the Sloan V, or the Sloan B, there's all sorts
4461580	4466140	of things that you can measure them as long as you have a standard filter system.
4466140	4470940	So absolute magnitudes are a really great way to actually get a great way to actually
4470940	4472900	give us luminosities.
4472900	4477620	And roughly the solar luminosity in absolute magnitudes is about 5.
4477620	4483740	It's recently been defined by the International Astronomical Union, and so absolute magnitude
4483740	4490300	system no longer definitively relies on the sun simply because the sun is slightly variable,
4490300	4496140	so you don't want to try to tie an absolute system onto a variable thing such as the sun.
4496140	4502020	So roughly speaking, the sun is about an absolute luminosity of plus 5, give it a little bit,
4502020	4505660	and that corresponds to a solar luminosity of 1.
4505660	4509980	So if we then go up and down, if it's 100 times the solar luminosity, then it has an
4509980	4511940	absolute magnitude of 0.
4511940	4518260	If it's 10,000 solar luminosities, then it has an absolute magnitude of minus 5.
4518260	4524820	If it has a hundredth of a solar luminosity, then it is about an absolute magnitude of
4524820	4525820	about 10.
4525820	4531980	And if it is 1 1⁄10,000th of a solar luminosity, then it has an absolute magnitude of plus
4531980	4533380	15.
4533380	4539860	So this kind of helps us get around because you'll notice that the luminosity whereas
4539860	4547020	the magnitude system is linear, the luminosity of the magnitude system is exponential.
4547020	4549380	That's the nature of a logarithmic relationship.
4549380	4552540	So that's how bright we can look at it, and that's another way of thinking about it.
4552540	4556820	So brightness then becomes luminosity as long as we know the distance.
4556820	4560020	And the best thing we can get for distance is called parallax.
4560020	4565060	So parallax then gives us distances in parsecs, which is a geometric distance.
4565060	4569220	So we can play lots of games and say, oh, something's 20 parsecs away, what's the magnitude?
4569220	4573980	If you have an apparent magnitude of 4, and if it's like 5 distant parsecs away, the apparent
4573980	4576980	magnitude of 4, what's the absolute magnitude, et cetera, et cetera.
4576980	4580220	Lots of games you can play.
4580220	4587420	And so what we find is that the relationships really lead us down a lot of different places,
4587420	4592260	and we're going to use these relationships over and over and over again with respect
4592260	4597900	to luminosity and brightness and magnitudes, and the distance-modules equation will come
4597900	4601500	in many times in the future.
4601500	4606580	Hello, my name is Jason Kendall.
4606580	4609420	Welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.
4609420	4613380	Today we're going to continue the idea that we did last time when we discussed the nature
4613380	4616660	of magnitudes and brightness and luminosity.
4616660	4621460	But now we're going to formulate it in terms of an important thing that we call color.
4621460	4626860	Color is an incredibly important thing to astronomy because, well, things have different
4626860	4627860	colors.
4627860	4631620	So we need to actually know how we can quantify this concept of color.
4631620	4635380	But first what we need to do is understand a little bit about where color arises and
4635380	4637460	how light interacts with matter.
4637460	4641540	So let's discuss that first before we get into the nature of what color is with magnitudes.
4641540	4642540	All right.
4642540	4644940	So light and matter interact.
4644940	4649900	And if you've ever been alive, you know that light bounces off walls, reflects off of things,
4649900	4654420	comes from light sources like light bulbs, things that are hot, glow, and so forth.
4654420	4660020	So what matter can do to light is it can allow it to pass through it, such as the glass that's
4660020	4662900	passing through the lens that I'm looking at you with.
4662900	4667700	It can also reflect light like it's reflected off of various surfaces, and it can then bounce
4667700	4669900	from one surface to the next.
4669900	4673560	Matter can gain this energy by absorbing light.
4673560	4678400	So if you go out on a hot day, the light from the sun, you get absorbed, the light, that
4678400	4682160	light in the form of infrared radiation that reflects, that goes into you and absorbs in
4682160	4686340	your skin, as also as the ultraviolet light does the same thing.
4686340	4689560	And then you absorb the energy of that light.
4689560	4694880	Third, matter can lose energy by emitting light.
4694880	4700400	So if it's warm or hot or hotter than the surroundings, then light will spontaneously
4700400	4704760	come off of matter that is warmer than its surroundings and radiate to the surrounding
4704760	4708360	environment, and that's called radiative transfer of energy.
4708360	4715360	Okay, so there are two things that are important with respect to color and temperature, and
4715360	4719700	temperature relates to the internal energy of the matter.
4719700	4724680	So the internal energy of the matter is what we would call temperature.
4724680	4727520	So the internal energy can have multiple forms.
4727520	4731680	One is the structure of the material itself, that would be the phase of the matter, and
4731680	4736040	the other is the average random motions of the material inside the matter, and that would
4736040	4740520	be the vibrations of the matter, of it, if it's a gas, how fast it's moving around the
4740520	4741520	room.
4741520	4744120	So the internal energy is a function of temperature.
4744120	4750480	All right, so let's look at how color relates to temperature.
4750480	4753000	So first and foremost, color is a funny thing.
4753000	4754000	What is color?
4754000	4756640	I mean, I'm wearing a little checkered red, white, and blue shirt.
4756640	4758120	How do you know what I'm wearing?
4758120	4762920	It's a blue shirt, blue checkers and red checkers on it with a white shirt, and some fun red
4762920	4765280	and blue and yellow things in the background here.
4765280	4767280	How do I know what color is?
4767280	4772000	Well, color is a funny thing because it's defined inside your head.
4772000	4779640	Color is actually a concept of relative brightness between sets of things that do reception of
4779640	4780640	light.
4780640	4781640	What do I mean by that?
4781640	4786080	Okay, so your eyes are filled with cells on the back.
4786840	4788440	It's called the retina, the retinal cells.
4788440	4789800	There's the cones and the rods.
4789800	4794560	The rods are for nighttime, and the cones are for color and daytime.
4794560	4798800	So the cones or the color rods have various receptor cells.
4798800	4803440	And there's maybe, let's just be over, for an oversimplification, we know that there's
4803440	4804440	maybe three.
4804440	4805440	Let's just call it three.
4805440	4809480	So you've got a set of cells inside the cones that are red receptors that receive, and a
4809480	4812000	green receptor and a blue receptor.
4812000	4818520	So a red receptor would only say fire off if red light lands on it, or what light in
4818520	4821040	a specific wavelength region.
4821040	4826600	Let's say then a green receptor only fires off if green light or this wavelengths of
4826600	4830280	light in a specific wavelength region, same with blue.
4830280	4835680	So then the relative brightnesses of these signals from the various cells, the pieces
4835680	4838800	in each cell, determine the color.
4838880	4842160	If more of the red cell got fired than the green, then we would call it red.
4842160	4847400	If the green and the blue got fired, then we would call it yellow compared to the red.
4847400	4852760	So anyway, the red color then gets constructed in your brain, and then we culturally decide
4852760	4856240	to call red, red, and blue, blue, and yellow, yellow, yellow.
4856240	4858160	But that's cultural.
4858160	4860400	We want to quantify it.
4860400	4864520	So what was done a long time ago is the Johnson filter system actually tried to mirror roughly
4864520	4868880	what your eye sees, except it extends it into the infrared and the ultraviolet.
4868880	4875040	So the primary filters that are used astronomically, or at least the easiest ones, or some of
4875040	4881680	the oldest ones to use that are still standardized, are the Johnson, UB, VR, and Eye filters.
4881680	4885480	So we've got a blue filter, which is B, we've got a V filter, which is kind of yellow-green,
4885480	4888840	and then we've got an R filter, which is red.
4888840	4895000	So the R filter covers a wavelength region about 6,000 to 7,000 angstroms.
4895000	4901360	The V filter covers roughly about 5,000 or 5,500 angstroms, and the blue filter covers
4901360	4903880	roughly about 4,000 angstroms.
4903880	4910120	So these three filters together allow light of only a certain wavelength to pass through
4910120	4911680	to the detector.
4911680	4914960	Notice how that's similar to what your eye does, but your eye doesn't automatically.
4914960	4918360	The retina has these cells that only detect the light.
4918360	4923800	Instead, now we make a nice photo detector, some sort of camera, and what we do is we
4923800	4929240	put in front of the camera a filter so it blocks out all except the blue light, or the
4929240	4934320	green light, or the red light, and therefore what falls on the camera is either blue light
4934320	4936640	or green light or red light.
4936640	4939460	That's different than what happens in your eye.
4939460	4942760	We don't have filters in our eye that filter things out.
4942760	4945560	We have cells that receive the certain things.
4945560	4949080	So we can think of the cells as kind of like inverse filters.
4949080	4955880	They absorb only specific wavelengths of light, but a filter transmits only certain wavelengths
4955880	4961200	of light, and it's the specialization of this transmission that allows us to actually determine
4961200	4962200	color.
4962200	4963200	All right.
4963200	4967600	So the Johnson's Cousins Filter Response System, which has some very specific wavelength
4968440	4972880	transmission frequency, transmission wavelength dependency.
4972880	4981880	So we don't expect to get pretty much any light that is more blue than, say, 3,000 angstroms
4981880	4988280	in the B filter, and we don't expect much light longer than 5,000 angstroms to pass
4988280	4992400	through the B filter, and that's what we mean by these transmission curves.
4992400	4997040	So the sun itself has a certain brightness in each one of these filters, and we can actually
4997040	5001640	then look at things and do relative brightnesses of the filters.
5001640	5004760	Typically astronomy is done with relative brightnesses, so you say, oh, this thing is
5004760	5007320	brighter than that thing, and that thing's brighter than this thing, and this thing's
5007320	5008400	brighter than that thing.
5008400	5011560	And the filter system like this makes it very easy because then you can use the magnitude
5011560	5014920	system, which itself is a relative brightness concept.
5014920	5022000	So the visible light bands are only covered by the B, V, and R sections of the Johnson's
5022000	5023960	Cousins Filter System.
5023960	5027880	The U section, you're going to have to go way up in altitude in order to use it, and
5027880	5032400	same with the I section, you need to be at high altitude in order to use these because
5032400	5035960	the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs ultraviolet infrared light.
5035960	5043160	So what we got is we have these wavelength regions, which the filter system allows through.
5043160	5047840	Once again, just like we defined with Pogson's system, last time Pogson originally said that
5047840	5053840	every filter system, in any filter system, including the Johnson's Cousins, the definition
5053840	5057280	of zero magnitude is the star Vega.
5057280	5062360	So we start with that idea and then say, oh, how bright or dim is the object with respect
5062360	5063520	to Vega.
5063520	5069200	And the reason we use Vega, again, is because Vega goes across the zenith for many observers
5069200	5070600	in the Northern Hemisphere.
5070600	5071760	All right.
5071760	5075000	So what do we really mean by color?
5075000	5081000	In your eye, it is the difference in brightness that you perceive in the red cells versus
5081000	5085520	the green cells versus the blue cells in your retina of your eye.
5085520	5089640	Likewise, in an astronomical sense, what we have is three filters.
5089640	5095160	So the filters then say, well, what is the, we can then make, we can determine the magnitude
5095160	5096160	of the object.
5096160	5097160	And that's our brightness.
5097160	5100440	Remember, magnitude here is brightnesses.
5100440	5104720	The apparent brightness in the U filter, the apparent brightness in the B filter, the
5104720	5107040	apparent brightness in the VR and eye.
5107040	5109160	And so what we do is it's kind of funny.
5109160	5113400	Like we've defined magnitudes before where we have the distance modus, little m and big
5113400	5115280	m for absolute magnitude.
5115280	5123320	Here we define the apparent magnitude of an object to be the capital letter of the filter
5123320	5124440	that you're using.
5124440	5130000	So here we say the magnitude in the U filter and the magnitude in the B filter and the
5130000	5132840	magnitude in the V in the R, those are just the letters.
5132840	5139060	So we take those values of the magnitudes, the brightness in magnitudes on these six.
5139060	5145880	Not brightness in terms of watts per meter squared or that's not how we do it.
5145880	5150160	We use magnitude system because we can easily do differential brightnesses between them.
5150160	5154840	So the magnitudes become our reference point in astronomy, not necessarily flux.
5154840	5159160	We will translate that eventually into flux, but we start with magnitudes.
5159160	5165600	Alright, so color then is defined in astronomy to be the difference in brightness between
5165600	5167680	two filters that are adjacent.
5167680	5173400	And you always take the short wavelength filter minus the long wavelength filter, the magnitude
5173400	5177400	in the shorter wavelength minus the magnitude in the longer wavelength.
5177400	5183080	And it's typical that you only, that you look at adjacent filters and not necessarily
5183080	5187920	span across, but there might be a science reason why you would actually do that.
5187920	5191240	So typically you might take the difference in brightness between say the U and the B
5191240	5195920	and the B and the V and the V and the R and the R and the I and then call those the colors.
5195920	5201520	So a standard color that is used frequently throughout all astronomy is an observation
5201520	5204560	in the B filter and an observation in the V filter.
5204560	5207920	And then you take the difference in those observations, meaning the magnitude difference
5207920	5213200	between B and V, meaning what is the, what is the, if you take the magnitude of B and
5213200	5216720	subtract from it the magnitude of V, that is the color.
5217480	5218480	Kind of a funny thing.
5218480	5221000	So there's lots of different ways we can call color.
5221000	5223360	And so therefore we can quantify color.
5223360	5228080	It's not just calling it magenta or red or pews or aquamarine or any of the names that
5228080	5233040	you would find in a crayon box from Crayola, on those 64 colors with all those pretty names.
5233040	5234480	We don't care about those names.
5234480	5237440	Those names are really nice and everything and they're very fun to have.
5237440	5242160	But really what we want to do is we want to use the definition of color in order to get
5242160	5244040	us data and understanding.
5244040	5245040	All right.
5245040	5248880	So the blue star, the blue color of say the star Sirius.
5248880	5253860	So Sirius is by definition, well not by definition but by your eye, you can see in the sky as
5253860	5255720	being a blue star.
5255720	5262600	So therefore it must be brighter in the blue magnitude, in blue magnitudes than in V magnitudes.
5262600	5263800	And in fact it is.
5263800	5268640	So if you take and likewise it must be brighter in the V than the R. So if you look at these
5268640	5277840	numbers, the B number, the B magnitude of Sirius must be closer, must be lower in value
5277840	5279240	than the V magnitude.
5279240	5283960	Because remember, magnitudes, the larger the magnitude, the dimmer it is.
5283960	5289440	So the more negative it is, the closer towards negative infinity it is, the larger negative
5289440	5294040	number or the smaller positive number, the brighter it is.
5294040	5298920	So if you compare a tenth magnitude star to a fifth magnitude star, the fifth magnitude
5298920	5301200	star is brighter than the tenth magnitude.
5301200	5306760	So let's say that a star like Sirius might happen to be in the B magnitude.
5306760	5307760	It's pretty bright.
5307760	5311520	So I'm just going to make up a number here and the number I'm going to make up is that
5311520	5318600	it is a B magnitude of say one, let's call it a B magnitude of one.
5318600	5323480	But because it's dimmer in the V magnitude, maybe it would have a V magnitude of two.
5323480	5329440	So the color two, C2, which is the color two in the Johnson's filter system, B minus
5329440	5331120	V is minus one.
5331120	5336840	So there's the color of Sirius in the B minus V. B minus V color equals minus one.
5336840	5341240	And let's say the R magnitude is four because it's a very strongly blue thing.
5341240	5346640	So then V minus R is minus three, so C sub three, which is another color definition in
5346640	5350680	the Johnson's system, that would be a minus three.
5350680	5355040	So B minus V color is minus one, and V minus R color is minus three.
5355040	5359360	Now I pulled all these numbers out of thin air, so don't bother looking them up.
5359360	5360360	They're wrong.
5360360	5364880	So, but anyway, I invite you to actually go look up what the B minus V magnitude colors
5364880	5367520	are of Sirius and the V minus R that are standard.
5367520	5371000	And if you look at the American Association of Variable Star Observers, you should be
5371000	5372600	able to actually see that.
5372600	5375640	All right, so let's take a different star.
5375640	5381320	So in, say, in the winter sky, Betelgeuse, which is in the constellation Orion, very
5381320	5388040	beautiful red star, so therefore the B magnitude would have to be dimmer than the V magnitude.
5388040	5393280	So, and we also know that Betelgeuse is also roughly a magnitude one-ish sort of star in
5393280	5394280	visual.
5394280	5399760	So let's say the B magnitude is, say, three, because it's much dimmer in B than in V, and
5399760	5402120	we'll say that V is, say, a one.
5402120	5403280	All right?
5403280	5404280	So that makes sense.
5404280	5410280	So B minus V, for Betelgeuse, would be three minus one is plus two.
5410280	5417540	So now we see that a color that is in B minus V, if it's positive, it's red.
5417540	5419760	If it's negative, the star is blue.
5419760	5424600	So a positive C2 color, B minus V, means the star is pretty much red.
5424600	5428760	If the, if the B minus V color is negative, it's probably blue.
5428760	5433800	And if it's zero, it's probably kind of whiteish-yellow, like the sun, which just makes sense.
5433800	5438240	Anyway, so with the same thing with V minus R, maybe the V minus R color is more significant
5438240	5443440	for Betelgeuse, but our magnitudes tend to be a little bit tweaky for a lot of reasons.
5443440	5448680	And we tend to see V minus V as a pretty big standard in the American Association Variable
5448680	5449680	Star Observation.
5449680	5450680	All right.
5450680	5453400	So the B minus V color will be more positive.
5453400	5457680	The V minus R color will be more positive for a red star.
5457680	5465720	So we can construct all of these colors, and this is like an extraordinarily low-resolution
5465720	5466720	spectroscopy.
5466720	5469800	What is spectroscopy?
5469800	5474680	Spectroscopy is where you take the light from a star, say, and you pass it through a prism.
5474680	5479200	And when you pass it through that prism, the light then gets broken out into a rainbow,
5479200	5481400	and you see how bright it is to get various frequencies.
5481400	5484200	So you really care about how bright it is at various frequencies.
5484200	5487200	That's what you really care about when you're doing spectroscopy.
5487200	5492200	But the nice thing about doing filters like this, filter photometry, is that pretty much
5492200	5494240	everything you look at is pretty bright.
5494240	5496640	So spectroscopy can be pretty dim.
5496640	5499840	You need a lot of light in order to make a decent spectrum.
5499840	5507120	But you can do pretty well at lower resolution spectroscopy with Johnson's filters, with
5507120	5511120	such B minus, B, V, R, I, and filters, U, B, V, R, filters.
5511120	5512120	All right.
5512520	5517280	This color is important because it does relate to temperature.
5517280	5519040	So let's find out how that is.
5519040	5523080	In general, if we look at the types of stars and we break out their spectra, remember that's
5523080	5529320	what Annie Jump Cannon did at Harvard back in the 1910s and 1920s with her team of computers
5529320	5534840	underpickering, the spectra of stars were classified according to their temperature.
5534840	5540280	And their temperature was guided by the prominence of hydrogen lines.
5540280	5541280	So okay.
5541280	5548240	So if we look at the nature of how spectral lines look, we see that O stars in general
5548240	5549240	are much brighter.
5549240	5554720	Well, in general, always, O stars are by definition brighter in the blue than they are in the
5554720	5558920	red, and M stars are brighter in the red than they are in the blue.
5558920	5562560	Sometimes when we look at stellar spectral classification, we forget that O stars are
5562560	5565520	inherently much, much, much, much brighter than M stars.
5565520	5568320	But we'll talk about why that is shortly.
5568320	5571680	In any event right now, what we can do is look at the temperature of a star, and we
5571680	5577440	see that as the temperature decreases, it goes from being bright in the blue to bright
5577440	5578440	in the red.
5578440	5584160	And that's why we can say that a blue hot object is much hotter than a red hot object.
5584160	5587800	Red is pretty hot to eyes if you're thinking about flame, but don't want to get close to
5587800	5588960	a blue hot flame.
5588960	5591240	That's very, very, very hot in any event.
5591240	5597160	So real spectra of real stars show that hot stars look blue because they're brighter in
5597160	5599360	blue than they are in red.
5599360	5606400	So let's say we put fake BV filters on top of some spectra and see what the impact of
5606400	5608280	that would be.
5608280	5615320	We can easily see that the brightness in B filter for an O star, that's kind of BVO,
5615320	5621960	the brightness in the blue filter for an O star, the B magnitude is much greater than
5621960	5624440	the V magnitude for the O star.
5624440	5628440	So therefore the color will be negative.
5628440	5636600	And if we look at an M type star, the B magnitude will be dimmer and therefore larger than the
5636600	5641800	V magnitude, where the V magnitude will be brighter and therefore a smaller value.
5641800	5646520	So a big value minus a small value equals a positive value.
5646520	5653400	So the color, the B minus V color for M stars is positive and the B minus V color for O
5653400	5655780	stars is negative.
5655780	5660240	So that's kind of what we were talking about, the O and B stars are all over the place.
5660240	5665280	And in general a star like the sun, the G stars right in the middle, their B minus V colors
5665280	5669840	tend to be roughly about zero because the magnitude difference between the two filters
5669840	5672120	is roughly nothing, there's almost nothing.
5672120	5676320	So there is a transition point and that is roughly around the middle of the spectral
5676320	5679080	sequence and roughly at the G's.
5679080	5683960	So let's say we instead, instead of looking at it from like a pretty picture rainbow type
5683960	5690320	of things, we decided to look at it from a spectral sequence where we actually measure
5690320	5697480	the total brightness of a star numerically instead of using like our eyeballs or magnitudes
5697480	5702080	but we start with say flux, which is watts per square centimeter.
5702080	5707800	That's flux falling upon a per square, yeah, watts per square meter, well you know I could
5707800	5715200	say a meter sized detector but anyway, we then say what's the absolute flux or the amount
5715200	5720440	of light that is the luminosity falling on our detector and count the real energy that
5720440	5725320	was being deposited by that light and we get what we call a spectrum.
5725320	5730760	So that spectrum can be numerically related to the Johnson color system and we can say
5730760	5735720	well what is the B minus V colors for the various objects and then we see that O stars
5735720	5739720	are of course brighter in exactly the same way that we discussed with them when we looked
5739720	5742000	at simple spectra.
5742000	5749280	So the next question that we have is a rather interesting one and so we see that stars are
5749280	5754360	organized by their temperatures and O stars are hot and M stars are cool.
5754360	5760440	How do we know this, why do we know this and the answer is in the spectra themselves.
5760440	5766600	So the spectrum itself determines the temperature of the star and we just are lucky enough to
5766600	5771520	be able to use the Johnson's filter system to actually determine that much more easily.
5771520	5777760	Alright, so when we're looking at the spectra of a star, notice the shapes of the spectra.
5777760	5782880	In general the shapes of the spectrum of a star, the blue one looks kind of nice and
5782880	5789280	slopey, it starts off in the visible part of the way of electromagnetic radiation.
5789280	5794240	It is bright in the blue and the ultraviolet and dim by the time it gets to red and infrared
5794240	5797280	and the situation is reversed for the M stars.
5797280	5799520	So what do these curves mean?
5799520	5805560	What do these plots of intensity as a function of wavelength mean?
5805560	5812760	Well they just mean that what we're seeing is if we look at a star it's really far away.
5812760	5818880	So we're not taking the image of a particular patch of a star, we're looking at it averaged
5818880	5820760	over the entire star.
5820760	5826280	So we're looking at the average say temperature and the average spectrum of all the regions
5826280	5827280	of the star.
5827280	5830000	Some might be a little hotter, some might be a little cooler, that's what sunspots are
5830000	5834480	in the sun, sunspots are slightly cooler areas, prominences are a little bit cooler,
5834480	5839000	the sun radiates in X-rays but if we took the sun and put it really far away, maybe
5839000	5843680	tens of parsecs away, then we wouldn't be able to resolve the sun, but we would still
5843680	5849560	be able to get the average spectrum of all the light that comes to us from the sun.
5849560	5854680	Most important thing though about a star is that no matter how far away it is, no matter
5854680	5858600	how tiny it seems in the sky, it is a big thing.
5858600	5863640	Stars are enormous objects, they're much bigger than planets, even little M dwarf stars are
5863640	5865440	bigger than the planet Jupiter.
5865440	5870440	So if we take something like the size of the sun, the sun itself is 100 earths could fit
5870440	5874400	across it and a million earths could fit inside it, so these are enormous objects.
5874400	5880720	And an enormous hot dense body is opaque, and an enormous hot dense body that is opaque
5880720	5885600	means the light bounces around inside it if light is being generated inside of there,
5885600	5889920	and it bounces around inside it until everything becomes the same temperature.
5889920	5894640	Once everything is the same temperature inside the star, then it's at the same temperature
5894640	5899280	and what we see at the surface of the star is that average temperature of all the light
5899280	5903240	then all the material being all the same temperature at the surface.
5903240	5909200	So that's interesting because it's opaque, everything gets to the same temperature.
5909200	5913720	So temperature is a funny thing because it's measurement, it is a measurement of the internal
5913720	5917760	energy of the object, when the solid it's just the things vibrating in place and how
5917760	5921900	much vibrational motion it has inside of the structure of the solid.
5921900	5925140	If you give it enough heat then there are bonds that must be broken down in order to
5925140	5929140	churn it from a solid to say a liquid or a solid to a gas, but we'll ignore that for
5929140	5937740	just a second because that's a different kind of change in heat latency and heat latency.
5937740	5942180	But if you have a gas that's much easier, and stars are gases, they're not solids,
5942180	5947060	so a gaseous ball, a starry gaseous ball, the higher the temperature, the higher the
5947060	5952020	average motion of the molecules, the atoms that make up the star, so they move faster.
5952020	5958100	So temperature itself in a gas is related to how fast the atoms are moving inside it
5958100	5961300	or ions if it's too hot.
5961300	5967580	The way we can then relate temperature itself as a measurement to the speeds and therefore
5967580	5972620	energy because speed is like kinetic energy, it's the energy of going fast.
5972620	5978260	So therefore the temperature must be an average measurement of all of the speeds, of all of
5978260	5979260	the objects in it.
5979260	5982700	It's not everything going exactly the same speed, that would be kind of weird.
5982700	5989480	But what we see is that it's an average speed over the entire set of molecules and atoms.
5989480	5996100	So we can relate it to the average kinetic energy of an atom inside of there.
5996100	6001180	And that thing that we call its movement is what we call heat.
6001180	6004820	And heat has a lot of different things that we can talk about, and that would be a thermodynamic
6004820	6005820	course.
6005820	6009980	But let's just start with a relatively easy concept and begin from there.
6009980	6013900	And so heat is something that you measure, temperature is something you measure with
6013900	6019420	a thermometer, and heat is a measurement of how much wiggling there is occurring inside
6019420	6020420	of the atoms.
6020420	6024060	A little bit loose definition there, I know, but off we go, we'll just kind of keep with
6024060	6026060	it for now.
6026060	6028740	But cold can be defined as the lack of motion.
6028780	6033900	So in absolute temperature scale, we might want to say, absolutely cold, we want nothing
6033900	6036580	moving, but we'll call that temperature equals zero.
6036580	6041860	And so as you give it more and more heat, the things move faster and faster, so therefore
6041860	6044540	there the temperature gets higher and higher.
6044540	6048900	Because not everything's at the same motion, it's the average speeds of the object that
6048900	6050420	determine the temperature.
6050420	6055780	So the Kelvin temperature scale was defined a long time ago by Lord Kelvin.
6055820	6061700	And it's related to zero is the absolute zero of it, and at that time there is no motion
6061700	6067420	whatsoever on the part of anything that's inside an object that is at absolute zero.
6067420	6071300	The cosmic microwave background is at three degrees above absolute zero, which means it
6071300	6076660	is very cold, but still there's some, actually an incredible amount of energy associated with
6076660	6078780	that, but we'll let that go for a second.
6078780	6086100	The pure water boils at 277, it freezes, at least if you cool water below 273 degrees Kelvin,
6086100	6087300	it becomes a solid.
6087300	6092940	If you warm it above 273 Kelvin, then as it first does, it was a funny thing.
6092940	6098340	First when it becomes, it's a solid, and then there is heat as you can apply heat to ice
6098340	6104380	and it'll change phase from solid to liquid at the same temperature until you've given
6104380	6109020	it enough heat to break down the bonds that make it go from a solid to a liquid.
6109020	6113940	And then once it becomes a liquid, then the temperature again begins to rise because when
6113940	6119220	you apply heat to a phase that is in the phase transition mode, you actually, that's what
6119220	6123660	phase transition means is that you could have the same temperature, but yet there you don't
6123660	6128180	change the relative, the relative average motion of it.
6128180	6133860	A phase change simply changes the arrangement or the fundamental arrangement of the atoms
6133860	6135700	and molecules inside of it.
6135700	6137980	So that's a pretty loose definition too.
6137980	6143820	But once we get to 373 Kelvin, then it boils, which then the bonds that make up a liquid
6143820	6149100	that are broken down and you add heat into the liquid to make it become a vapor.
6149100	6154620	It stays at that temperature 373 until you've given it so much heat that all of a sudden
6154620	6157580	nothing's left in the liquid state and it's all a vapor state and then the temperature
6157580	6164780	can increase again and temperature then becomes, and it still is in all of these cases, a measurement
6164780	6167260	of the average motion of the objects.
6167260	6172100	But heat is, as you can see, slightly different because heat can be applied to something and
6172100	6175620	it doesn't necessarily raise the temperature, which is interesting and that's about phase
6175620	6179500	transitions and that should be done within a separate video.
6179500	6184420	But for our purposes for this, all we really want to say is that the Kelvin temperature
6184420	6190660	scale for gases, which make up stars, that is in measurement of their average speed.
6190660	6192980	And the Kelvin temperature scale has some basic things.
6192980	6197500	We already talked about water boiling and so forth, but then fusion of hydrogen occurs
6197500	6203060	when the temperature is approximately 13, approximately 10 million degrees or about 10
6203060	6204060	million Kelvin.
6204060	6207820	So we don't say degrees Kelvin, we say degrees centigrade, we say degrees Fahrenheit, we just
6207820	6212300	say 10 million Kelvin because it's units like watts or meters.
6212300	6220820	We don't say 10 million lengths meters, we don't say oh that's 10 million times seconds
6220820	6221820	right?
6221820	6224820	Because we don't say seconds are a time, we know it's a time, we know Kelvin is a unit
6224820	6230740	of temperature, so we just say that's 10 million Kelvin, that's the temperature of that star.
6230740	6236600	So light and heat is therefore a different thing, but yet they're all, but they're related.
6236600	6243800	So you may receive light from the sun in the form of infrared photons and those infrared
6243800	6251760	photons can go to doing one of two things that can go to changing the internal heat of your
6251760	6256080	body and the internal heat then can be manifested in numerous ways.
6256080	6261240	The most common way is to make the atoms and molecules in your body vibrate or move more
6261240	6262240	quickly.
6262240	6267920	You also can change the state from a liquid to a gas or a solid to a liquid depending
6267920	6273240	on the intensity and the wavelength of the light, so that all depends on how it absorbs
6273240	6274240	and emits it.
6274240	6280920	But from our perspective what we really care about is that when light falls upon a gas
6280920	6288800	we can treat it as a heat input and as it inputs that heat into the system then what
6288800	6291360	occurs is the temperature rises.
6292360	6298880	Now if it's an average, if it's completely opaque and everything inside there is at thermal
6298880	6306320	equilibrium, meaning that there isn't a place inside the star that is significantly different
6306320	6310800	compared to another place inside the star, well it's kind of a tricky thing because
6310800	6314120	stars have to be a little bit out of thermal equilibrium because they emit light and emit
6314120	6319320	heat so they have to have a source coming in there, but if the source of energy inside
6319320	6323760	of the star equals the amount of energy that's coming out of the star then it can be said
6323760	6325560	to be in thermal equilibrium.
6325560	6330960	So as long as the star is in thermal equilibrium, meaning in general it's not getting a lot
6330960	6335840	hotter and in general it's not getting a lot cooler and in general there's no big areas
6335840	6342320	where there's motion of heat going from one place to another, then we call thermal equilibrium.
6342320	6349080	If an object is hot at the same temperature throughout and opaque then it would be called
6349080	6350280	the black body.
6350280	6355800	A black body is even a stranger object, it's kind of a theoretical, in fact it is a theoretical
6355800	6362240	object that absorbs all light that falls upon it and since it absorbs all the light that
6362240	6366480	falls upon it, it doesn't reflect anything, it reflects no light, it absorbs all light
6366480	6370840	that's kind of a stretch, there's nothing that does not absorb all light.
6370840	6375280	So any light that falls on a black body gets absorbed and therefore it gets mixed around
6375280	6382120	inside the black body until then it thermalizes with all the other light inside of that, all
6382120	6388040	the other matter inside of that and then the black body then because it can perfectly absorb,
6388040	6393000	it can perfectly emit and it doesn't hold back certain wavelengths of light.
6393000	6397920	If a black body held back certain wavelengths of light then it would also reflect those
6397920	6401040	certain wavelengths of light which is interesting to say.
6401040	6406480	So a black body is a perfect absorber of light and a perfect emitter which means everything
6406480	6409920	inside of it gets to the same temperature, that's what we care about.
6409920	6417680	So things that are very close to black bodies in mostly everyday parlance, molten steel
6417680	6423240	at a foundry, the ingots of steel, those are most certainly black body objects, they're
6423240	6427160	hot, they're very hot, they're glowing, they're all at the same temperature and in fact if
6427160	6431600	you look inside the foundry it's hard to tell the color of the sides of the walls of
6431600	6435400	the foundry from the actual molten steel itself, in fact when they put it in there you can't
6435400	6440640	see the difference because the steel and the walls and the gas inside of there are all
6440640	6444760	glowing at the same exact temperature and since they're glowing at the same exact temperature
6444760	6448720	they have the same exact spectrum because it's a black body spectrum.
6448720	6453040	The next thing we can look at that's a very familiar thing is the coals of a fire, look
6453040	6458880	deep inside the coals of a fire and on some camping night that you might go out to and
6458880	6463800	the coals of a fire, not the fire flame above but deep inside the coals below the wood you
6463800	6468480	can't tell where the fire begins and where the coals end if you look carefully.
6468480	6471640	In fact they all have the same temperature, they all have the same color.
6471640	6475800	The only reason something has a slightly different temperature is if it's darker it's cooler
6475800	6479320	but if it has the same exact temperature it'll have the same exact color.
6479920	6487400	The cool, the hot area that's being shielded inside of the cavity of the fire deep down
6487400	6489640	in there, that's a black body too.
6489640	6495160	Now a welder's arc is a very very hot object but what actually is the thing that might happen
6495160	6496160	to be a black body?
6496160	6502800	Remember the welder melts something, melts the steel at very high temperature and so
6502800	6506520	not the sparking stuff because that would be an emission spectrum, it would be a gaseous
6506520	6511680	form of it but the sparks coming off, the actual sparks themselves they're reddish but
6511680	6517280	if you look at the center of a welding arc's light the light itself is where the metal
6517280	6522400	has been turned to blue hot and now blue hot that area is very small, remember the foundry
6522400	6526400	look is this enormous thing and you can still look at it, it's bright but you can still
6526400	6531600	look at it but the intensity of light goes up here either rapidly as the temperature
6531600	6532960	goes up.
6532960	6536960	So the melted iron that is being focused on by the arc welder that's the thing that's
6536960	6541400	incredibly hot and incredibly blue and incredibly bright so there's something about it getting
6541400	6544040	hot that means also getting bright too.
6544040	6550160	Alright, oh no now I get to throw equations at you so equations are a funny thing so the
6550160	6555680	entire shape doesn't matter if it's a black body, any black body, every black body has
6555680	6562200	a theoretical curve that has the shape that kind of looks like an off kilter normal curve
6562200	6567520	or a bell curve, take a bell curve and like stretch one side long and that's kind of
6567520	6570120	what the black body curve looks like.
6570120	6575600	The only thing that can be different from one black body to another is the temperature
6575600	6580680	and so it just basically scales everything up by a factor of the temperature.
6580680	6588320	So as if it's hotter the area of the black body curve scales up by a factor of the temperature
6588320	6593960	of the third power and so as you get hotter and hotter the area gets hot, the temperature
6593960	6595400	gets higher and higher.
6595400	6598520	So it's a very, well it's actually the temperature of the fourth power is really what it comes
6598520	6600160	down to but still.
6600160	6607160	So the point is that every black body has the same shape, doesn't matter what its temperature
6607160	6613120	is, the same shape but yet whether it's brighter at one frequency or another that's a different
6613120	6614320	thing.
6614320	6620800	So different black bodies at different temperatures have peak wavelengths at different wavelengths.
6620800	6625200	When they're very, very cool black bodies as we saw in say the iron foundry or even
6625200	6631120	a very cool star like Beetlejuice, it peaks in the red or even in the infrared and then
6631120	6636440	as it gets hotter and hotter it starts peaking in the visible light like say yellow or green
6637320	6642040	but if you were to see such a thing that's like 6,000 or 6,000 Kelvin, to your eye it
6642040	6648800	would look white because it's roughly evenly balanced across the visible spectrum.
6648800	6653320	But it peaks at specific wavelengths that we would call green if it was peaking roughly
6653320	6660320	on 6,000 Kelvin and once you get above 7,000 Kelvin the peak temperature, the peak location
6660320	6662640	starts going into the ultraviolet.
6662640	6666320	So it starts from the red and infrared moves through the center of the visible spectrum
6666320	6668200	and all the way up to ultraviolet.
6668200	6673560	It just so happens that stellar temperatures, stellar surface temperatures range in their
6673560	6678920	peak brightnesses for most stars in the visible light range all the way up through the blue
6678920	6682200	light and all the way up through infrared, so infrared to ultraviolet.
6682200	6687960	That's where stars seem to peak in their black body radiation.
6687960	6697280	So when we take the curves for black bodies and we isolate only the sections that are
6697280	6702800	visible light, if we isolate only those sections it just so happens that the actual spectra
6702800	6708320	of stars very closely match the theoretical predictions of what a black body curve of
6708320	6709760	that temperature looks like.
6709760	6711240	They're really, really, really close.
6711240	6716400	It's not perfect and the reason it's not perfect is because stars have atmospheres and the
6716400	6722440	atmosphere of the star acts to absorb light from that star and when it absorbs the light
6722440	6726640	from the star it takes the light away from the star and then we don't see it and we
6726640	6727640	see an absorption feature.
6727640	6731680	Maybe we see even emission features, but typically it'll absorb it in one wavelength
6731680	6736200	and then those atoms and molecules will re-radiate it in some other location and it'll escape
6736200	6737200	in a different way.
6737200	6741640	It doesn't hang on to it, it just re-radiates in another direction, in other wavelengths.
6742000	6750600	The sun itself, specifically the black body for it would peak right around 5,000, roughly
6750600	6755640	right in the middle of the spectrum, but yet the actual curve because of this redistribution
6755640	6757480	is a little bit more blue.
6757480	6764480	So that's kind of interesting, but even so, the curve for the solar spectrum is really
6764480	6766920	close to a black body spectrum.
6766920	6771880	So what are some other astronomical objects that we see that have a black body spectrum?
6771880	6776240	Remember, it has to be dense and it has to be thermalized, it has to be all at the same
6776240	6779440	temperature and it has to be one object that's at the same temperature.
6779440	6783680	Alright, that's cool and we'll see what kind of things we have.
6783680	6789960	So if we look at dark, dark dust clouds deep in interstellar space, the places where stars
6789960	6794280	are being born, dense enough so that they barely collapse under their gravity, they
6794280	6797920	might be a parsec or two across, they're very, very cold objects.
6797920	6800760	They might be 60 degrees above absolute zero.
6800760	6805640	And so even if it's 60 degrees above absolute zero, it can still have a black body curve
6805640	6809640	because that's the average temperature, so if it's an average temperature of that, what's
6809640	6810640	the peak wavelength?
6810640	6815240	Well, the peak wavelength is deep in the infrared, deep in the infrared if not even in the radio
6815240	6816280	wavelengths.
6816280	6820800	So when you have something at 60 degrees Kelvin, if you look in infrared light, you'll see
6820800	6821800	it glowing.
6821800	6824840	So therefore, that's why the Spitzer space, infrared space telescope has been built and
6824840	6830840	why space telescope has been built to look at objects that glow in the infrared and
6830840	6834040	things that are cool objects, very cool objects.
6834040	6838760	A dark dust cloud does not glow in any light, in the visible light and therefore we see
6838760	6839760	it to be dark.
6839760	6845200	If we then look at say something like a protostellar object, like let's say now a star is formed
6845200	6846800	inside this dark dust cloud.
6846800	6850240	Once it's formed inside there, the star itself is pretty warm.
6850240	6854240	But yet it's not hot enough to call itself a star.
6854240	6857000	Maybe it's a bit warmer than the surface, maybe it's much warmer than the surface of
6857000	6860560	Jupiter and it might be a few hundred Kelvin.
6860560	6865600	Therefore it seems to be a dull red, but it peaks in the infrared, in the near infrared.
6865600	6875640	Near infrared means just a little bit further red than the about 7,000 angstroms or 700 nanometers.
6875640	6881600	And you'll notice also that something that is 600 Kelvin is a thousand times brighter
6881600	6884840	at the peak than something that's 60 Kelvin.
6884840	6888920	So the warmer it is, the much brighter it is.
6888920	6894720	So by multiplying by a factor of 10 gives you a lot, lot, lot larger factor of luminosity
6894720	6896880	in terms of temperature, in luminosity.
6896880	6902920	So we go to the sun now and the sun is about 6,000 Kelvin and so it's about a thousand
6902920	6907200	times again brighter than say some dust cloud that's at 600 Kelvin.
6907200	6912200	And it peaks roughly in the visible wavelength region, but it has significant output in infrared
6912200	6916760	radio, well not really a lot of radio, but significant infrared output and significant
6916760	6918200	ultraviolet output.
6918200	6923880	The sun's spectrum is pretty close to a black body and we can use that as a measurement.
6923880	6929320	And what we feel as warmth on a summer day is the infrared light that passes from the
6929320	6934200	sun through the atmosphere to us as part of the black body spectrum.
6934200	6940200	The sunscreen you wear is for the intense ultraviolet light that drops off rapidly at
6940200	6942200	a shorter wavelength.
6942200	6945040	So then the next thing we can look at is something even hotter.
6945040	6951280	Say the accretion disc around a black hole, so there's material falling into a black hole
6951280	6955920	and as it falls into that black hole, it gets hotter and hotter and hotter and just before
6955920	6958080	it falls into the center of a black hole.
6958080	6960960	It gets to be tens of thousands of Kelvin.
6960960	6964240	Actually it gets much hotter than that, but we're talking about the outskirts or maybe
6964240	6968080	we're even looking at an extraordinarily hot O-star.
6968080	6971640	So an extraordinarily hot O-star might be tens of thousands of Kelvin.
6971640	6975880	And those things are even more luminous than the sun, thousands of times more luminous
6975880	6977040	than the sun.
6977040	6982400	And their peak wavelength is way out in the ultraviolet and they emit even more visible
6982400	6984440	light than the sun does.
6984440	6989400	They emit even more infrared light than the sun does, but they emit even more ultraviolet
6989400	6990400	light.
6990400	6994840	So in general, the hotter something is if it's a black body, which is mostly a star,
6994840	7000360	stars are mostly black bodies or really close to black bodies in terms of their spectra,
7000360	7006320	then it's brighter overall wavelength and the peak of the brightness moves to be shorter
7006320	7008320	and shorter and shorter wavelengths.
7008320	7013800	All right, so the law for black body says the wavelength maximum, the maximum wavelength
7013800	7019280	of the peak of the curve just depends on some little number B, which is a measurable number.
7019280	7021680	And then you divide, it's the inverse of the temperature.
7021680	7026600	So the hotter it is, the shorter the wavelength is where the peak exists.
7026600	7034800	And finally, how much energy gets dumped out of an object that has a particular temperature
7034800	7037040	in Kelvin if it's a black body?
7037040	7044520	The temperature of an object goes as the temperature, the energy output per surface area on the
7044520	7049200	surface of the object goes like the temperature of the fourth power.
7049200	7054400	So we take a standard sized patch and we take that patch, maybe it's the size of your hand
7054400	7059040	or something, we put it on various things that are hot or cool and we measure the total
7059040	7064160	energy output through a standard patch, say, you know, it's like 10 centimeters by centimeters
7064160	7067280	or five centimeters by five centimeters, whatever it happens to be.
7067280	7071720	The energy output through that standard patch will go like the temperature of the fourth
7071720	7072720	power.
7072720	7078000	So something that's twice as hot as something else will emit 16 times as much energy.
7078000	7082480	Something that's 10 times as hot will emit 10,000 times as much energy.
7082480	7088080	And something that's 100 times as hot will emit 100 million times as much energy.
7088080	7095440	So the hotter it is, the more energy it puts out and it's a very fast function of temperature.
7095440	7101620	So these are our basic concepts of stellar, of stars, and it makes them pretty easy.
7101620	7103520	Stars are pretty close to black bodies.
7103520	7105600	If it's hotter, it's brighter.
7105600	7107880	If it's hotter, it's bluer.
7107880	7110260	That's really what we really care about.
7110260	7114920	So when we take about these, when we look at all the stars that we see in the sky and
7114920	7120440	then we look at their stellar spectra, we now have a pretty good firm foundation of what
7120440	7121720	we can look at.
7121720	7126960	And we take the spectra of a star and we see that O stars are bluer compared to M stars
7126960	7129160	so we know what that means.
7129160	7134960	And now then we can use the Johnson's filter system to uniquely determine the temperature
7134960	7136360	of a star.
7136360	7141640	All we have to do is calibrate using the spectra on high level calibration.
7141640	7146000	What the spectrum of a star is, like an O star and M star, G star, whatever.
7146000	7150800	And we learn what the average spectrum of those are with their temperatures are according
7150800	7152080	to spectra.
7152080	7156880	And then we can step it down and you do it easier by saying, well, look at the colors
7156880	7163760	and the B minus V. The B minus V color uniquely determines the temperature of a star.
7163760	7169040	So all we have to do in order to learn about something very important about the star, meaning
7169040	7174280	how fast the atoms are moving on average at the surface of the star or right at the
7174280	7181160	inside of the star, is take a picture with two filters in front of it, say the B filter
7181160	7185720	of Johnson and the V filter of Johnson, put pictures in front of those things and difference
7185720	7187640	the brightness between the two.
7187640	7190560	And once we do that, we know the color index.
7190560	7195520	The color index is uniquely determined by the temperature.
7195520	7197720	So this is an amazing consequence.
7197720	7204720	And those colors, the B minus V colors, transition relatively smoothly from the hot to the cold.
7204720	7206120	There's some lumps along the way.
7206120	7212840	But in general, the more negative the color, the bluer, the more positive the B minus V
7212840	7215880	color, the redder and cooler.
7215880	7218560	B minus V negative, hotter, hotter, hotter, bluer.
7218560	7222080	B minus V positive, cooler, cooler, cooler, redder.
7222080	7225520	So we can go on and on with those kind of stuff and we will.
7225520	7229680	So this is a really interesting thing where you take the concept of the magnitude system
7229680	7235480	and apply it to some deep physics about the nature of how atoms move inside an object.
7235480	7242520	And we'll talk more about that next time.
7242520	7243520	Hello, this is Jason Kendall.
7243520	7246680	Welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.
7246680	7249680	Today we're going to be talking about spectroscopy.
7249680	7255480	Spectroscopy is the study of how light interacts with matter and how the interaction of matter
7255640	7262480	with light betrays itself and gets transmitted through space to us so we can receive it.
7262480	7266560	Spectroscopy is simply the way we take the light that's coming from a distance source
7266560	7272560	and use some method by which we can break it apart into a spectrum to see how the intensity
7272560	7276200	of the light varies with wavelength or frequency.
7276200	7281400	So an easy way to think about this is allow normal white light to pass through a prism
7281400	7283760	and then you'll see a rainbow effect.
7283760	7289200	Well typically a rainbow effect is pretty hard to see unless of course there's a very
7289200	7295840	narrow opening through which that passes the light in a very narrow beam and that narrow
7295840	7297960	beam then goes through the prism.
7297960	7302880	If it's a general wave of light that goes through it or an ambient then the prism will
7302880	7305440	not necessarily be a create a spectrum.
7305440	7309040	Well it will create a spectrum but it will be harder to see.
7309040	7313600	So for us to make it better we usually take the source, whatever it is, send it through
7313600	7317200	a narrow slit so that it becomes a ray or a beam.
7317200	7320400	We don't care about losing all that light because we're just going to analyze the light
7320400	7321600	that comes to us from there.
7321600	7327520	We pass it through a prism, the prism breaks apart the light because the inside of glass,
7327520	7331520	the speed of light is different for different wavelengths and so it spreads the light apart
7331520	7336240	into its constituent wavelengths or frequencies and then we take a picture of the incident
7336240	7342520	light after it goes through the prism and that is the study of spectroscopy.
7342520	7346840	Then divides the light up so that we can see the intensity at given wavelengths or frequencies
7346840	7352280	and that we know exactly how that thing is interacting with the light, meaning the prism.
7352280	7355840	So we don't have to worry about the prism's interaction of the light, we just worry about
7355840	7358480	the origin of the source.
7358480	7362200	So if we then look at more common things like if we take a prism, just a garden household
7362200	7365720	variety prism or a crystal, you notice that there's always a pretty rainbow that comes
7365720	7367240	off of the sunlight.
7367240	7372040	Well pretty rainbows from the sunlight are indicated here in this image from the McMath
7372040	7379320	Solar Observatory down in Tucson, Arizona run by NOAO and this rainbow that we always
7379320	7384720	see has actually some darker spots in it and those darker spots are the shadows of the
7384720	7387720	slit through which we passed the sunlight.
7387720	7396720	So that's what we call the absorption lines because we make a vertical line slit through
7396720	7403560	which we pass the sunlight and that sunlight then passes into our spectroscope and that
7403560	7407600	spectroscope might just simply be a prism or it might be some other device like in a
7407600	7411680	shell spectrograph or something like that or reflecting off of the surface.
7411680	7417880	But at the angle what we see is we see a series of dark lines on the spectrum and those are
7417880	7422740	places where it simply is dimmer than the surrounding continuum.
7422740	7427220	So the rainbow itself we call it the continuum or the continuous spectrum and there are
7427220	7432380	absorption features which are darker than the surrounding continuum.
7432380	7438180	So the sun's spectrum is actually what we call an absorption spectrum.
7438180	7441180	There is light that's been absorbed from the continuum.
7441180	7447340	Alright so there's a different kind of spectrum as well where there's bright emission on top
7447340	7448700	of a dark background.
7448700	7453260	So perhaps the material is not emitting light at all frequencies maybe it's emitting light
7453260	7458420	at specific frequencies and if the material is emitting it only at specific frequencies
7458420	7463220	not with a rainbow but with specific wavelengths of light then if we pass it through a spectroscope
7463220	7468060	we see the lines of emission that we put here.
7468060	7472260	What's funny we call them lines and that's simply because when we talk about emission
7472260	7478660	lines or absorption lines that's simply because we're using a slit type opening and so we're
7478660	7481340	actually seeing the image of the slit.
7481340	7486860	So in an absorption spectrum or I'm sorry in an emission spectrum such as these the
7486860	7492180	emission spectrum themselves that's the image of the slit through which the light is going.
7492180	7496420	And so you'll see that the image of the slit the appearance of the line is the same for
7496420	7497420	each one.
7497420	7500580	It's just the color is different and the wavelength is different.
7500580	7504900	So that's interesting and we also notice that they're kind of distinct.
7504900	7510260	Well emission spectra are fascinating because what you can where you can get them is if
7510260	7517700	you take say sodium, sodium chloride, table salt and you hold it in a Bunsen burner and
7517700	7522460	you hold it like a bit of table salt in like a metal piece of metal and you put it over
7522460	7527460	a Bunsen burner and heat it up till it glows then the flame that comes off the Bunsen burner
7527460	7532100	will have a particular wavelength and if you look at the lights that is coming off of the
7532100	7536380	burning salt that comes off of there you get a specific set of wavelengths and those are
7536380	7537380	emission spectra.
7537380	7541900	Now you'll get a sodium spectrum and of course since it's table salt you'll also get a chlorine
7541900	7542900	spectrum as well.
7542900	7547740	What really we care about like the sodium spectrum but you see that a noble gas such
7547740	7552340	as neon will have a different spectrum and mercury vapor has a different spectrum and
7552340	7557500	ubiquitous hydrogen throughout the cosmos has a specific spectrum.
7557500	7562260	So what's funny about all these emission spectra is that it doesn't matter where you get the
7562260	7567260	material from say hydrogen or helium or neon or sodium chloride or something or when you
7567260	7570940	get it or from whom you get it it doesn't matter.
7570940	7575260	All you have to do is heat it up such that it becomes vaporous and it will emit the same
7575260	7580900	exact emission spectrum and so therefore everything has its own fingerprint.
7580900	7584220	Hydrogen is the same thing no matter where you get your hydrogen from.
7584220	7588180	Hydrogen has the same fingerprint no matter what and we call these things fingerprints
7588180	7594820	because the emission spectra is it exactly the same wavelengths or frequencies every
7594820	7599660	single time you measure it which is very interesting which tells you something about the nature
7599660	7601020	of the matter.
7601020	7606420	So what what emission lines can be done and specifically we're going to be talking about
7606420	7612380	what are called Kirchhoff's laws of spectroscopy and Kirchhoff was his full name is Gustav Kirchhoff
7612380	7617620	and in the mid 19th century he was doing a whole bunch of experimental physics and he
7617620	7621620	worked with the guy who invented the Bunsen burner Mr. Bunsen and they did a bunch of
7621620	7626940	spectroscopy and what he found were the following three laws.
7626940	7632820	Kirchhoff's laws first say that emission lines are produced at single frequencies up behind
7632820	7640660	in front of a dark background if you're looking at a hot rarefied gas that has no bright emission
7640660	7645900	source or no bright continuum behind it it's just a gas that you see with nothing right
7645900	7646900	behind it.
7646900	7651780	So you get specific wavelengths appearing at specific brightness at specific wavelengths
7651780	7657020	and that comes from a hot gas and that is one of Kirchhoff's laws of spectroscopy.
7657020	7662620	The next one is if you take a continuous source like a light bulb like an incandescent light
7662620	7669740	bulb which gives a black body type of radiation and that is in front and that is behind a
7669740	7675020	cool gas maybe it's the same gas maybe it's hydrogen gas that's cooler than the bulb.
7675020	7683740	Well as the light from the hot hot bulb passes through the cooler gas the cool gas absorbs
7683740	7691100	the light and the absorption then dims the light at specific frequencies and those specific
7691100	7696100	frequencies where it gets dimmed then get passed through we see it as a spectrum and
7696100	7701180	we see something like the solar spectrum but when we look carefully we actually see
7701180	7706180	something more interesting deeper in just a bit and so we can actually relate Kirchhoff's
7706180	7715620	laws to as a trio of things because a hot opaque body such as a light bulb emits a continuous
7715620	7721740	spectrum something hot and opaque emits a continuous spectrum something hot and opaque
7721740	7729300	that is behind a cloud of cooler gas that emits that we see if we look through the cooler
7729300	7735540	gas to the hot source we will see an absorption spectrum.
7735540	7741140	Now if we look at a quarter to that and just look at the gas that did the absorbing of
7741140	7744380	the light we will see an emission spectrum.
7744380	7750620	So really Kirchhoff's laws are three sides of the same situation you can either look
7750620	7754740	straight at the continuous the straight at the hot dense object and you'll see a continuous
7754740	7761100	object a continuous source you'll look at the cloud that's sitting off to the side of
7761100	7765660	the absorption of the hot object and look through the cloud at the hot body and you'll
7765660	7769740	see an absorption spectrum or you'll look off to the side of just the emission light
7769740	7774940	just the hot cloud that will cooler cloud compared to the hot body and you'll see an
7774940	7779900	emission spectrum so they're all part of the same thing and that means that as we look
7779940	7786700	at these objects that the emission lines and the absorption lines are at exactly the same
7786700	7792380	wavelengths and that makes sense because let's say it's a hydrogen cloud gas and hydrogen
7792380	7798860	will absorb and emit at exactly the same wavelengths it's not like it absorbs at one wavelength
7798860	7805140	and emits at another you know it emits at the same exact wavelength that it absorbs that's
7805140	7809620	interesting so that's telling you something about the nature of matter the nature of matter
7809620	7816020	itself and Gustav Kirchhoff did all the work in spectroscopy well before the advent of quantum
7816020	7821940	mechanics and the model of the the Bohr model of the atom so as we look at the nature of what
7821940	7827540	matter is he didn't know about all this stuff so he derived these laws empirically and these
7827540	7832260	observations then had to be accounted for with the advent of quantum mechanics which they were
7833140	7839940	so most importantly is that the setup of the spectroscope tells us an enormous amount
7839940	7845940	about the nature of the material so we can tip it depends on what you how you wish to view things
7845940	7851460	or what is possible for you to view you can set up an experimental apparatus in many many ways
7852100	7858100	in order to do spectroscopy but it's typically pretty easy and dirt well not easy typically
7858820	7864340	it's helpful to start with an emission spectrum in order to identify exactly what material you're
7864340	7868340	looking at and then hopefully through some chemistry you can determine really what you're
7868340	7874580	looking at but spectroscopy itself is considered to be probably one of the most prevalently used
7874580	7882660	science device scientific tools at our disposal to understand exactly what makes up an some kind
7882660	7890500	of object so Kirchhoff's laws were were were developed in the mid early 19th mid 19th century
7890500	7896420	and refined until the early we're not understood of why they behaved until the mid 20th century
7896420	7901860	now what can you get out of spectroscopy well the first thing is because every chemical element
7901860	7908580	has its own particular fingerprint or signature every single element that must be present in there
7909220	7915140	must emit light or absorb light so you can tell the composition of what's in the what's in the gas
7915140	7921460	that you're absorbing or what the nature of the cool gas in front of the hot body is in addition
7921460	7928020	the spectrum changes a little bit if you're looking at ionized gas so if you ionize a gas
7928020	7934420	meaning the electron gets blown out of the atom and if it's blown out of the atom then the electric
7934420	7939380	field changes a little bit which changes the spectrum just slightly and so not only do you
7939380	7944900	have to make all these fingerprint catalogues of emission spectrum but you also have to try to get
7944900	7949620	the emission spectrum of ionized gases as well which really becomes kind of a pain because the
7949620	7957300	more you ionize a heavy element the the actual the spectrum itself changes considerably and then
7957300	7962340	if you then take it and we were just talking simple atomic spectra atomic elements if molecules
7962340	7968660	are involved like such as water or carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide or deoxyribonucleic acid or
7968660	7975060	RNA or anything if you used to do spectroscopy on complex molecules or even simple molecules
7975060	7981860	every single molecule has its own individual spectrum and some of them can be incredibly complex
7981860	7989940	and then we know that poly aromatic poly aromatic cyclic hydrocarbons are actually present in space
7989940	7996100	and can be observed because of their spectrum in fact ethyl alcohol has been found in space and some
7996100	8002340	extraordinarily simple amino acids have been found in space so this is really interesting we can know
8002340	8007620	something about the nature of which molecules are present not even having to go there it's really
8007620	8014260	fascinating now the other thing that's interesting about the nature of spectroscopy is that because
8014340	8019780	it takes energy in order to we had a hot remember in a hot bulb in front of a cool gas
8019780	8027380	that hot bulb provides energy into the gas and that gas then reacts to it well if the temperature
8027380	8033140	of the gas is not hot enough then it might not react or it might not absorb certain that we
8033140	8038500	pray it might not it might not get the wavelengths of light it needs in or it doesn't get the energy
8038500	8045620	it needs in order to hop up and down or we can also then determine that by looking at how the
8045620	8050260	gas is absorbing or emitting at different wavelengths or frequencies we can actually
8050260	8056820	determine the temperature of that gas so if you have a gas full of hydrogen and it's in front
8056820	8062020	it's above a star if that gas is above right above a star maybe it's the atmosphere of the star
8062980	8068420	and the atmosphere is cooler than the star then we might see a big absorption feature for say hydrogen
8068420	8074420	but let's say the star is extremely extremely hot and the electrons are ionized off of the hydrogen
8074420	8080260	atom then you won't get any absorption at all even though hydrogen is present or maybe the star is
8080260	8087220	very very very cool and you don't get any absorption of hydrogen because the star doesn't have enough
8087220	8092340	energy to kick the electrons out of the lower orbits of the of hydrogen into higher orbits
8093140	8097700	well this could also and spectroscopy the spectroscopy can tell you something about the
8097700	8104100	temperature of it if you then look at the nature of the lines themselves we can find that sometimes
8104100	8112900	the lines are not exactly as narrow as we think so maybe you in a laboratory you measure the
8112900	8118020	frequency of hydrogen the emission lines of hydrogen and then what you do is you take that
8118020	8122900	hot gas and put it under extraordinary pressure if it's under extraordinary pressure you're going
8122900	8129620	to find that the lines themselves these emission lines will be broader because as it's under pressure
8129620	8134500	the atoms the hydrogen atoms are moving at a higher speed which means that some some of them
8134500	8139940	are Doppler shifted towards you away from you from your emission which means that as the energy
8139940	8147380	goes into and out of the the energy as the small as the atoms of hydrogen are moving fast
8147380	8152420	as they're emitting then that can Doppler shift it either towards you away from you and thus
8152420	8157540	broaden the lines when it's called pressure broadening and the same thing happens with density
8157540	8162340	so if you have a high dense atmosphere you can get different kinds of broadening so each of these
8162340	8169060	things can be studied inside of the spectrum of the star and different kinds of broadening
8169060	8174180	or different profiles to the line meaning not just that the line is like okay it's totally
8174900	8180340	dark and then bank i've got this one bright thing like a spike maybe it's shaped like a like a like
8180340	8184820	a funnel and we have funnel type shapes maybe you've got wings and then a funnel there's all
8184820	8191540	sorts of ways that this that matter can interact with light and the proof the profile of the line
8191540	8197700	meaning exactly how does it vary around that particular wavelength can tell you a lot about
8197700	8203060	the nature of the star itself or whatever you're looking at and there's an incredible amount of
8203060	8209860	information that gets carried along with it and that gives us the physical data about what's
8209860	8216100	happening at the conditions of the matter when the light was emitted and because now we can
8216100	8222500	understand the elements of such as pressure and density and temperature and composition now we
8222500	8228580	can do physics and the physics then allows us to understand what's really going on and that's
8228580	8234500	what we that's what so spectroscopy and the invention of the spectroscope and if the the
8234500	8242740	invention of Gustavs laws as they began introduced the concept of astrophysics to astronomy because
8242740	8248820	up until the concept of astrophysics up until the concept of spectroscopy really took hold
8249380	8254500	we could never really know anything about what was going on in the stars all we could learn
8254500	8260100	is that this thing's moving it's going across the sky it's bright but we didn't really understand
8260100	8266020	the spectrum so it took some time before we said well look if there must be an absorption spectrum
8266020	8271300	coming from that star well stars are very dim so it took a long time for the technology to come
8271300	8276340	around such as you could actually make a spectrum of a star photographically at least but once we
8276340	8282180	understood the nature of the spectrum of a star we now then could transform astronomy
8282180	8287700	into astrophysics and that allows us to learn exactly how something is happening even though
8287700	8292500	it's hundreds of light years away or thousands of light years away or millions of light years away
8292500	8298580	because we trust that all of the physics that happens here in the laboratory and this is a
8298580	8303860	really big assumption this is one of the most important underlying assumptions about all astrophysics
8303860	8309380	due to spectroscopy is that since all the laws of the physics are the same everywhere in the
8309380	8316660	universe at all times of the universe is existence meaning from all the way ago to all the way today
8316660	8324660	that the laws of physics themselves are the same then we can trust spectroscopy because we only get
8324660	8331620	a messenger of light so that's a really interesting assumption that all of light and all of matter is
8331620	8339060	the same here as it was there and as we measure the laboratory wavelengths of hydrogen and then
8339060	8345380	we look at some distant quasar and that distant quasar emits light and it absorbs light and
8345380	8353620	there's absorption of light as it travels to us through the intergalactic medium then we can trust
8353620	8360100	that we can actually understand what's happening between us and the quasar and even at the quasar
8360100	8366420	that emitted the light say 10 billion years ago and the light traveled for 10 billion years so
8367060	8372740	the universality of the laws of physics is what we trust because we've never been to the stars
8372740	8378740	we probably never will be to the stars but the physics of light interact with matter
8378740	8384260	allows us to reach with our imagination out to the stars and learn about what is happening over
8384340	8390180	there and we'll see the effect of spectroscopy everywhere throughout all of these courses
8390180	8393220	and that's how we actually know what's going on over there
8398420	8403300	hello this is jason kendall and welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures today
8403300	8408900	we're going to be talking about the nature of matter itself what is the matter with matter
8408900	8415140	matter is that stuff that makes up the universe in fact let's even make a more interesting definition
8415140	8423540	for matter matter has mass and as mass it must be pushed around by forces so anything that can
8423540	8431220	accelerate a mass through a force is how matter interacts with other matter kind of a weird way
8431220	8434980	of thinking about it but that's old newton's laws so we just go all the way back to newton's
8435060	8442580	laws and say there's some stuff that we'll call matter and matter may be accelerated or decelerated
8442580	8447620	and the thing that does that accelerating or deceleration is called a force and so there are
8447620	8452980	four different ways the universe has of pushing things around and they're called the four fundamental
8452980	8459620	forces of nature one of them is gravity and gravity obviously attracts every mass attracts
8459620	8465380	every other mass and causes it to accelerate that's the nature of gravity well we also we know by
8465380	8471140	by einstein now and just newton's laws work very well but we know einstein's law einstein's
8471140	8476340	version of gravity says that matter curves spacetime and it falls inside of that curved
8476340	8481060	spacetime but what we can think about let's go back to newton's laws newton's version of gravity
8481780	8487220	we have two pieces of matter that then gravitate to each other and they accelerate towards each other
8487220	8491700	that's what we really care about is the acceleration of matter well what's the other thing well we
8491700	8495540	could put a pair of charges on top of it we could have a plus charge and a minus charge an electric
8495540	8499540	charge and they can if they're the same type of charge they repel if they have the opposites then
8499540	8504500	they'll attract each other and that will cause the matter to accelerate the electromagnetic
8504500	8510020	force causes an acceleration and the thing that we call the electromagnetic force that which
8510020	8515460	transmits the force in the case of gravity it's the curvature of spacetime but with the electromagnetic
8515460	8521380	force it's the transmission of light photo photons back and forth between the charge particles as
8521380	8526820	they move and vibrate they change the electric field and that vibrating moving electric field
8526820	8532420	then indicates how that thing should be pushed or pulled by the charges that as the light is
8532420	8538260	receiving them all right so the electromagnetic force is another way that matter can be accelerated
8538260	8544580	or moved and the next one is the strong and weak nuclear forces the strong nuclear force holds
8544660	8550340	holds protons together inside of the nucleus of an atom and holds neutrons and protons all
8550340	8554900	inside a nucleus as well as holding the constituent quarks of an atom but we'll talk about that
8554900	8558900	shortly so the strong and weak nuclear forces only really come into play when we talk about
8558900	8565620	nuclear particles or the centers of atoms all right so what do we mean by matter all right so
8565620	8571700	I just said it's the thing that gets pushed around when their force is acted upon it all right so you
8571700	8578820	have to have some way of interacting well gravity says that if it's got mass it will you have something
8578820	8584660	to do with the gravitational force if it also has charge then the mass that has the charge will
8584660	8591060	then be accelerated if it has it if it interacts via the weak nuclear force by the exchange of
8591060	8597140	w or z bosons or it exchanges or interacts by the by the strong nuclear force the interchange of
8597140	8603220	blue odds then the matter then will accelerate because of these interactions but what makes
8603220	8608900	up matter well matter in the universe is comes in from very big things to very small things and
8608900	8612900	we'll start with the tiniest like quarks and leptons which are fundamental particles you can't
8612900	8617860	break them apart any further when there are subatomic particles like protons and neutrons
8617860	8622180	which are composed of quarks and then you think about electrons which are fundamental park
8622180	8627780	particles themselves the fundamental particle called a lepton is an electron and it can't
8627780	8631940	be broken apart and then you can take protons and neutrons and smash put them together and
8631940	8636420	then you get a nucleus of an atom and if you put some electrons around it you've got an atom if you
8636420	8642580	put atoms together with next to each other and you've got molecules if you have multi huge molecules
8642580	8648180	you can have a bucky ball or a bucky chain or carbon nanotube or you can have a crystal of iron
8648500	8653860	or a nice little quartz crystal of amethyst or something or you can have deoxyribonucleic acid
8653860	8660580	or just water H2O any many of these things complex molecules and simple molecules and then you can
8660580	8665540	take all sorts of molecules and pump them together make crystals out of there make glomerations on
8665540	8669700	and put some over here and some over there and pack them together and you might get a person
8669700	8676820	or an elephant or a giraffe or a car or a planet or a star or a galaxy you know all sorts of stuff
8676820	8680820	you can make out of atoms and just think of atoms as your building blocks of everything and that's
8680820	8687300	what you can make it out of so the ordinary matter in the universe is what we call atoms and it makes
8687300	8694420	up all the stuff that we know so what's an atom all right so an atom has a nucleus and a nucleus
8694420	8698900	has some electrons swarming around it and the cartoon thing that we always see and always have
8698900	8704180	seen for a long time that's a really helpful visualization but it really doesn't look like
8704180	8708260	that and we'll talk about what we mean by that next time but we'll look at it but we'll kind of
8708260	8714020	go with this cartoon for a little bit and the cartoon says that in the center of the atom
8714020	8719540	there is a nucleus and the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons and the neutrons are
8719540	8725140	uncharged and electrically neutral they don't do anything they're a little bit more massive than the
8725140	8730900	proton but the neutron itself just a tiny bit more massive than the proton but the proton has a positive
8730900	8736660	charge so the proton's positive charge is part of the nucleus and the neutrons positive charge
8736660	8743460	could be in a nucleus and they're surrounded by a cloud of electrons and there is if it's a neutral
8743460	8750340	atom then there's one electron for every proton that exists in the atom so you got one in one
8751060	8756660	if it's ionized then there will be fewer there will be fewer electrons than there are protons
8756660	8760340	and you can also have ions where there are more electrons that's kind of weird you'd have to have
8760340	8765460	a very strange arrangement so the electrons don't fully screen the protons or it might be a dense
8765460	8770260	environment where the electrons are being forced upon the atom but in general we can think of
8770260	8775780	that electrons and protons come one to one with respect to each other and when they go one to one
8775780	8780820	we see a cloud of electrons and we have a neutral atom i what's funny is is also that we talked
8780820	8785380	about the fundamental particles so an electron is a fundamental particle and a proton is not
8785380	8792980	it is a subatomic particle it's composed of quarks but a proton is about 1800 times the mass of an
8792980	8798740	electron and if we think about how much mass that is a typical person college students say here at
8798740	8804260	William Patterson the typical student is about if they're eating ramen on a Saturday night as they're
8804260	8808340	studying for their finals then they'll meet be like 140 150 pounds because they're losing weight
8808340	8816580	and they're all stressed out so but now you take 1800 of those and that's approximately 100 tons
8816580	8823460	so an electron let's say a normal person is the mass of an electron then the mass of the proton
8823460	8831060	would be 100 tons i'm just trying to think of what exactly would be 100 tons i mean dump trucks a
8831060	8835860	huge dump trucks well we'd have to look at earth mover dump trucks those enormous things that are
8835860	8840740	in mining operations or strip mining operations those are hundreds of tons so there's some big
8840740	8847300	things that are hundreds of tons and we can think about wow me compared to 100 tons and what is okay
8847300	8854420	so some pickup trucks or some large trucks that you might go by are about a ton so 100 pickup
8854420	8861780	trucks or 100 suvs or 100 large cars compare and compact them together and call that one object
8861780	8866900	is equivalent is the mass of one thing the best the proton compared to say you
8866900	8872340	if you are an electron kind of interesting all right so now how are they distributed in space
8872340	8876100	according to this cartoon it makes it look oh everybody's all happy and joyful and the electrons
8876100	8880660	are really big and the protons are really big and the neutrons are really big but they're not
8880660	8888420	they're incredibly tiny the typical size scale of of an atom is on the order of 10 to the minus
8888420	8896260	10th meters we're about an angstrom or so and most of the of the atom itself is empty space in fact
8896260	8904100	only one part in 10 to the 15th of an atom is actually taken up by the matter of the atom the
8904100	8910180	rest is the fields of of electromagnetism between the electron and the proton the disturbed field
8910180	8915220	that actually keeps the the electron in place and the protons where it tells the electrons where
8915220	8921540	they are in any event this is really interesting because we think well how empty is it if we were
8921540	8928500	to say take a lot a relatively decent size building or a house and a typical house might be say 30
8928500	8934180	meters across specifically if we go to the Museum of Natural History we see the Hayden sphere is
8934180	8939780	exactly 30 meters across that big glassed-in ball at the Hayden planetarium in New York City
8939780	8944740	so at the Museum of Natural History in fact there's a really fun exhibit in there that shows
8944740	8951540	the size of a proton compared to the atom and in fact the 30 meter wide which is 100 feet wide
8951540	8958580	100 feet foot wide ball compared is say the size of an atom somewhere in the surface of that ball
8958580	8963060	is where the electron is for hydrogen it's called just plain old hydrogen hydrogen atom which only
8963060	8968900	has one proton and one electron so if we're looking at that a typical atom of hydrogen we'll have one
8968900	8973780	proton and one electron the electron is somewhere on the surface of that ball and the proton is at
8973780	8980420	the center of that ball how big is the proton it's about a six point font of a printed a six
8980420	8989220	point printed font so it's the size of a moat of dust so that's how small the proton is it is a moat
8989220	8997620	of dust compared to something a hundred feet in diameter that's amazing so most of the of all atoms
8997620	9004900	is completely empty space electrons are really tiny so and the electrons are about 100 times smaller
9004900	9011140	than a proton in terms of size which is fascinating so an electron is a tiny tiny tiny tiny thing
9011140	9016980	and even still the moat of dust compared to where the electron is on the surface of an atom
9016980	9024180	anyway so well how do we distinguish atoms well we we can have multiple protons in the nucleus
9024180	9028580	so let's say we have multiple protons and these protons tend to be well they're always at the
9028580	9033300	nucleus but if you have one proton we call hydrogen you have two we call it helium three we call it
9033300	9040180	lithium four we call it beryllium and then nitrogen carbon oxygen and so on the name of the element
9040180	9045460	tells you how many protons it has in it and so the atomic number is the number of protons
9045460	9051940	and every single atom every single atom every single element which is is chemically distinct
9051940	9058020	and operates and each of the chem the chemistry is different between each one so right now we know
9058020	9064180	that there are 118 elements that have been made about 24 of them have to actually be made in
9064180	9068500	laboratories and they only live for like microseconds or nanoseconds before they fall apart
9069140	9076100	about 87 of them are metals meaning they have the capacity to to allow electrons to flow off of them
9076100	9083540	into and they the valence electrons they can easily be stripped off 11 of them in in in naturally
9083540	9089780	well like normal human circumstances not too hot not too cold good enough for a human not too high in
9089780	9095780	the atmosphere not too far below the ground that 11 of them come as gases um two of them occur like
9095780	9101220	as liquids like mercury is one of them and bromines another a bunch of them are radioactive about 25
9101300	9107860	or so uh and these are the chemical elements and only the most the most massive ones are only
9107860	9114420	formed in in um in in particle accelerators so when we look at the name we look at that we've
9114420	9120020	seen periodic tables in the past so let's look at how we read the name of the elements always the
9120020	9125540	number of protons the atomic number describes the name of the element and so if it's got one proton
9125540	9131860	it's always hydrogen if it's got 23 protons it's always vanadium if it's got 19 protons it's always
9131860	9138260	potassium if it's got 11 it's always sodium if it's got two it's always helium if it's got six it's
9138260	9144260	always carbon that's the name of it and so all of the names require are exactly what the atomic
9144260	9148900	number is now the funny thing is is that the names themselves then become abbreviated so hydrogen is
9148900	9156660	age beryllium is be lithium is li sodium of course is na gold is of course au oh my goodness
9156660	9162660	potassium is k what's going on here so basically most of them are revolutions but some of them
9162660	9168500	derive from greek and latin so we don't necessarily have a one-to-one with their with their revolutions
9168500	9172900	and the names that are common in in say english but they would be common in other languages
9172900	9178500	so but the name is always no matter what language they're spoken in the name of the thing describes
9178500	9182900	the total number of protons and so there's a whole slog of them and the periodic table of
9182900	9190420	elements is is broken up into similar chemical behavior such as hydrogen and lithium and sodium
9190980	9198820	readily readily readily give away their their electron and fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine
9198820	9204740	readily grab an electron and so they're not filled electron shells so they will take an electron
9204740	9210820	so the most reactive elements come on both sides of the periodic table so that's kind of how they
9210820	9215860	go and the farthest right ones are the noble gases and they hardly react anything because they're
9215860	9222420	like their electron shells are filled so when the the most abundant elements out of all of the
9222420	9228580	elements in the universe almost 75 percent of all the matter all the elements of the universe all
9228580	9233940	the matter of the universe is hydrogen and 25 percent of the matter in the universe is helium
9233940	9241940	and then oxygen carbon neon nitrogen silicon iron magnesium and sulfur come next and so all of the
9241940	9246980	things beyond hydrogen and helium make up only about one percent of all the matter in the universe
9246980	9253140	so if we want to say what is the matter of the universe is hydrogen and it's helium that's pretty
9253140	9257380	much it all the other stuff the things that we're made out of the things that everything else that
9257380	9263780	we encounter that's made out of that's just really rare stuff and some of it's really rare compared
9263780	9268180	to the rarity of it is so hydrogen and helium is everything in the universe and where's the
9268180	9273380	helium on earth well it's embedded inside of natural gas deposits and it comes to us as a result of
9273380	9280180	of emissions by the sun all right so remember we talked about the total number of protons to
9280180	9285220	get with the atomic number but remember we also said that neutrons can be in the core
9285220	9291060	in the in the nucleus of an atom so when neutrons are in the nucleus of an atom if they're differing
9291060	9298180	numbers we call them isotopes so they're isotope meaning isotopic meaning the the topos is the
9298180	9303220	number of protons and so the number of protons is always the same so hydrogen plain old hydrogen
9303220	9309620	has none no neutrons but if it has a neutron it's called deuterium and there's deuterium
9309860	9314420	has two objects in the core it's called tritium if it is hydrogen with two
9315060	9322580	neutrons attached to it in the nucleus so tritium though is radioactive and will readily decay
9322580	9329060	that that neutron will readily decay away but in every case there's all to make an atom with
9329060	9333540	deuterium it only takes even though there's two things in the nucleus there's only one electron
9333540	9338260	because the proton has one charge and the neutron has no charge so if we look at something a little
9338260	9344740	bit bigger say carbon carbon 12 has six neutrons and six protons carbon 13 has six protons and seven
9344740	9350980	neutrons carbon 14 has six protons and eight neutrons and once you get too many neutrons
9350980	9356660	tends to fall apart so isotopes with lots and lots and lots of neutrons tend to fall apart if they
9356660	9363540	have far and if they happen to have fewer neutrons than protons they will also fall apart fall apart
9363620	9368500	too so radioactive carbon is very familiar we call about radioactive carbon dating and carbon
9368500	9374420	falls apart and what does falling apart mean we mean that it's radioactive and radioactivity
9374420	9382100	is a decay of a subatomic particle from one type of thing to another so tritium as i said was
9382100	9389620	radioactive tritium will spontaneously decay at some random interval a random atom a random nucleus
9389620	9394740	of tritium will spontaneously one of the neutrons will go i don't think i want to be a neutron anymore
9394740	9401380	and turn into a proton and in so doing the the nucleus will spit out an electron and also spit
9401380	9406260	out a neutrino and those things will go away but now it's helium because there's two protons and one
9406260	9411860	neutron so it's light helium so that's we call light helium or or yeah see it's got one neutron
9411860	9419780	less than the number of protons that's light helium and likewise carbon 14 decays to nitrogen 14
9419780	9426340	by one of the neutrons transforming itself into a proton and so carbon then which has six protons
9426340	9432580	becomes nitrogen which has seven so now we have seven and seven and the the nitrogen is happy
9433460	9438020	and in so decaying and switching from a proton from a neutron to a proton
9438020	9443460	an electron gets spitted spot out and a neutrino gets spot out and that in if a neutron is also all
9443460	9449860	by itself it'll spontaneously decay in about 11 minutes or so so these neutrons really don't
9449860	9454100	know how to stay together because the electron the proton and electron really want to fly apart
9454100	9459140	and the the thing that's holding them together is the weak nuclear force and that's the reaction
9459140	9463140	if you have a neutrino coming out you've got the weak nuclear forces which we talked about earlier
9463140	9468580	part so these things are all called beta decays you can also have an alpha decay where a full
9468580	9474100	helium nucleus of two protons and two neutrons gets spat out by a very massive very massive
9474100	9480020	nucleus like uranium or something like that uh you can also gamma decay where the nucleus itself
9480020	9488340	is in an energized state and emits a very high energy light particle a very high energy photon
9488340	9492180	in the form of a gamma ray so wait a second that's where we get the gamma ray idea from
9492180	9498660	is gamma rays are high energy light so we have alpha beta and gammas alpha particles are heavy
9498660	9504980	nuclei beta particles are electrons and gamma particles are photons and very high energy
9505860	9510340	and these things were given their names during the early years of studying radioactivity
9511060	9516500	back in the turn of the 19th century right around the turn of the 20th century in that area
9517460	9522260	so people name them that way and sometimes you'll always be hearing alpha particles or alpha decay
9522260	9528260	or alpha this that always means a helium nucleus and we consider beta decay or beta particles
9528260	9532580	and those are always electrons and the gamma rays what we know about gamma rays they're like
9532580	9538980	and that's where that comes from so why we care about all this is because when we're looking at
9538980	9544660	astronomy we can't actually reach out to the stars and take a bucket of a distant star and bring it
9544660	9550740	home and see what's cooking in there we can't do that so we want to learn what is going on at
9550740	9555140	those distant stars and what's happening to the matter over there we wish to identify what kind
9555140	9561780	of matter it is and that's where we get Kirchhoff's laws of spectroscopy because every single element
9561780	9568500	on the periodic table has its own spectrum when it gets excited or gets collided into any
9568500	9573780	midst light if it'll absorb specific lights light energy and it'll emit those things exactly those
9573780	9580580	wavelengths so every single chemical element in existence has its own individual spectrum
9580580	9586180	and those spectra are always the same no matter what because every hydrogen atom is exactly the
9586180	9592100	same in the entire universe every carbon atom is the same in the entire universe different isotopes
9592100	9596900	but they're the same they're always the same because they're just because protons are the same
9596980	9600980	everywhere in the universe and neutrons are the same everywhere in the universe and electrons are
9600980	9608420	the same in everywhere in the universe so every atom is just like any other atom if it's the same
9608420	9613780	isotope and even if they're different isotopes they're almost the same because they just differ
9613780	9618820	by the total number of neutrons so and there's no difference between them other than the number
9618820	9624020	of neutrons but what's a neutron what's a proton what's an electron they're the same things everywhere
9624020	9630100	in the universe, and you stack them together to make atoms, and each individual atom and
9630100	9633180	all the molecules associated with them, well let's stick with atoms because we're talking
9633180	9635420	about elements for a second.
9635420	9641020	The atomic elements, each one of them has their own individual spectral signature, and
9641020	9642460	that can be discovered.
9642460	9649740	In fact, it was first discovered that these things existed as objects, spectroscopically,
9649740	9653060	because we'd have to say, oh, what do we have in this gas?
9653060	9657740	If we have some rarefied gas that we cannot see, but yet it glows because of the energy
9657740	9659100	we're putting into it.
9659100	9662260	If it glows with that characteristic pink, it must be hydrogen.
9662260	9666500	If it glows in a particular different way, it's helium, and we break apart the spectrum
9666500	9671980	and we look at the spectrum of the thing as it's glowing, or maybe it's cool and we've
9671980	9676060	got something behind it that's hot that passes through the cool gas.
9676060	9679460	The absorption lines are exactly the same as the emission lines, and that's what we talked
9679460	9683580	about with Kirchhoff's Laws of Spectroscopy.
9683580	9688620	Every single element, every single atom is the same in the cosmos in terms of what they
9688620	9693420	are, meaning one carbon-12 atom is exactly the same as every other carbon-12 atom in
9693420	9698180	the universe, and they all have exactly the same spectral fingerprint.
9698180	9705380	That fundamental statement, that the spectra of all of these are identical, says that the
9705380	9711700	light interacts with the matter, interacts with carbon-12, no matter how it interacts,
9711700	9713740	all light interacts with everything.
9713740	9719340	That is part of an incredibly important idea called the Copernican Principle, which means
9719340	9723500	the cosmological principle says that there is no special place in the cosmos and that
9723500	9729020	all laws of physics are the same everywhere, and we will rely on that idea to get us out
9729020	9733180	to the stars and learn what is out there.
9733580	9738540	What's funny is, is that this whole thing I discussed about the nature of these things,
9738540	9744820	it's not been known forever, so let's see, next time, how the history of the atom developed
9744820	9745820	through time.
9745820	9755020	Hello, this is Jason Kendall, and welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.
9755020	9759580	Today we're continuing on the history of the atom, where we talked last time about what
9759580	9764860	an atom is, what elements are, how they have protons and electrons and neutrons, and how
9764860	9769580	they're arranged in these orbits around them, and there's isotopes and so forth, but where
9769580	9774420	did this concept of the idea of the atom ever really come from?
9774420	9776540	So that's what we're going to talk about right now.
9776540	9783100	So the history of the atom is an interesting one, because it develops out of natural philosophy.
9783100	9788460	Natural philosophy is basically a way of talking about the world, philosophizing about the world
9788460	9792780	in a way that is consistent with how you perceive the world.
9792780	9797180	And so natural philosophy is a way of conducting science without having the tools to actually
9797180	9801900	be able to gather the evidence or analyze it, but you do it as rigorously as you can.
9801900	9807180	So let's take a couple of ideas about the nature of what we mean by matter, because stuff is
9807180	9813420	in existence and so stuff does things to other stuff, so you might want to say, well, what
9813420	9816340	exactly is matter?
9816420	9820180	Some of the earliest recorded ideas about what the nature of matter are come from
9820180	9827300	Democritus, who was a pre-Socratic philosopher in ancient Greece, and his goals around 400
9827300	9829700	A.B.C. or so thereabouts.
9829700	9837380	He came up with the concept of an indivisible unit of matter, meaning you can cut something
9837380	9841620	and keep cutting things and it doesn't divide, and that's where the word atom comes from,
9841700	9847380	a tomos, meaning not divisible, not cuttable, not sliceable.
9847380	9851220	That's what tomos meaning to cut or divide, a meaning not.
9851220	9854580	So the atom is that which cannot be cut.
9854580	9860580	Democritus himself was referenced throughout much of antiquity's literature, however a lot
9860580	9867220	of his works do not survive because he was kind of on the outs with respect to medieval theology
9867220	9871060	and he disagreed with Plato and Aristotle and some key ideas.
9871060	9874020	So his work was excluded throughout history.
9874020	9878100	But we know that he came up with the concept, that he alluded to the concept of the atom.
9878660	9883940	We also know that he alluded to the idea that the Milky Way is a series of stars that are
9883940	9887940	incredibly distant, that they're so distant that they actually look like one thing,
9887940	9893780	and that kind of goes along with this concept of the atom, and let's see what that is right now.
9893860	9901780	The concept of the atom that Democritus had is that imagine you had a block of clay or anything,
9901780	9903780	but let's just use clay for this instance.
9904500	9907460	Actually I'm going to diverge away from, I'm not going to say clay, I'm going to start with a tree.
9907460	9913860	And if we start with a tree and you cut the tree say in half, well which half of the tree is it?
9913860	9916980	Well you know, you're going to get some half, whatever it happens to be.
9916980	9920740	Let's say we cut it vertically, and so you've got a half of the tree that's vertically cut
9920740	9925140	and so it still has a big chunk of the branches, a big chunk of the root,
9926340	9928660	a big chunk of the leaves, and so forth.
9928660	9934260	But at some point as you keep cutting this tree in half, depending on how you cut it,
9934260	9938900	eventually you're going to have to get to a point where you're going to cut the tree,
9938900	9943700	and you're going to divide the bark or the wood of the tree from the leaves of the tree.
9943700	9948180	So therefore the tree was one thing, and now you're cutting into two things,
9948180	9950740	and each of those things is different from the other.
9951540	9955780	It's all right, so now you're paring away the thing that is not the same as it.
9955780	9958980	So we get rid of the leaf, and so we're left with the wood.
9958980	9962100	And so now we cut the wood away, and we say, oh there's the meat of the wood,
9962100	9965060	the wood that's below the bark, and we have the wood that's above the bark,
9965060	9966980	the bark wood, and so we cut away the bark.
9966980	9972100	And now we're left with the wood that has the grains, and it's that nice yellow tone.
9972980	9976740	As we cut further, we find that there's water inside of the bark,
9976740	9980660	we find that they're inside of the wood, we find that there's sap inside of the wood,
9980660	9984580	we find that there's dark and light little striations of the wood.
9984580	9988580	So we keep cutting those things, eliminating the bark, eliminating the sap,
9988580	9992580	eliminating the water, trying to get down to the essence of what is wood.
9992580	9997060	And so at some point you can philosophize that you would get down to the point where you say,
9997060	10003940	ah, I've cut away everything that is not wood, and I found the tiniest element of something that
10003940	10009940	is wood, and if I cut it, I will no longer have wood, I might have something else,
10009940	10014340	but then I just keep cutting until I get down to the thing that I say that this is the element of
10014340	10020500	wood. So the concept of the atomos then says there must be some fundamental building block
10020500	10026980	out of which you can no longer cut, because how can you cut anything infinitely posed,
10026980	10030020	democratist? And so this is an interesting concept.
10030100	10034740	Likewise, that's where his concept of matter comes from. It doesn't matter whether it's clay,
10034740	10040820	or water, or anything. There will eventually be some point at which you cannot cut any further,
10040820	10047140	because that is the atomos, the indivisible unit. Well, this has some ramifications,
10047140	10052900	and there was no real evidence for it, because like I said, in 400 BC, it's philosophy,
10052900	10058980	it's not science yet. So the thing is, is that other philosophers disagree, notably Plato and
10059060	10067060	Aristotle, who disagreed with him entirely, and thought that matter like space is continuous.
10067060	10076420	So you'll notice that there is no gap in space or gap in matter between, say, the tree and the air
10076420	10081780	that surrounds it, or when the tree is submerged in water, the water goes right up to the trees.
10081780	10087460	There must be a transition between tree and water. That's a very sharp transition, but we notice that
10087460	10094420	there's water in the tree, that the sap is made from tree and water, that when you burn a tree,
10095060	10101140	the fire comes out of the tree. And so it's very interesting to think that maybe a tree is made
10101140	10105780	up of fire, maybe it's made out of some sort of earthy element, maybe it's made out of some sort
10105780	10111540	of airy element, because the fire lifts, the smoke is lifted out of there, maybe it's made out of some
10111540	10116340	sort of water, well, we know that. So all of these things can combine together. And if you combine
10116340	10121620	them in just the right way alchemically, an alchemist would do this, then you would get tree.
10121620	10127380	So the proper combinations of fire, earth, water, and air, according to Plato and Aristotle, give
10127380	10135220	you tree, or gold, or iron, or what have you. All of the various things that exist, according to
10135220	10141620	Plato and Aristotle, were continuous matter. And this continuous matter can never be subdivided,
10141700	10148740	and you can't find a boundary to it. So it's kind of innately linked to the concept of space,
10148740	10154580	as well. So why did Aristotle disagree, and what happened, and where did the concept of this
10154580	10159780	continuous matter, and how did Aristotle blast democratize the idea? Well, he appealed to religion
10159780	10166020	and repealed to divinity. And divinity is definitely a part of natural philosophy, and you can actually
10166020	10171220	add it in by saying, imagine that there's a spiritual plane, a spiritual divine plane,
10171220	10175700	and this was okay in that time, because they've divided the physics of the earth,
10175700	10181940	the materia, versus the physics of the heavens, the celestial. And the two really did not behave
10181940	10188660	the same, according to anybody's observations. So the celestial realm is the divine realm,
10188660	10193780	it's the unchanging realm, it's the permanent realm. The material world is ever-changing,
10193780	10199140	and ever-fluid. And so there is a concept which arises from the four elements, and the fifth
10199140	10204100	element is then spirituality or divinity, and Aristotle said the following. So, Mr.
10204100	10210740	Democratus, you're saying that the god Zeus, who is all-powerful, who took the eight-legged beast
10210740	10216980	and ripped it apart to make man and woman, you're saying that he cannot rip apart the tiniest,
10216980	10222660	tiniest dust moat, the thing that you say is the smallest possible thing? How can a god not
10222660	10229300	break that apart? And that's kind of a valid philosophical argument if you posit the existence
10229300	10235060	of deities. So it really is a big thing, and so most of Christian thought and most of Western
10235060	10240020	thought gravitated towards the concept of the continuous matter and Aristotle's thinking,
10240020	10248660	because of the heightened element of the divine in natural philosophy. All right, so it took some
10248660	10257140	time before people would take Democratus's idea seriously, and John Dalton in about 1803 or so,
10257140	10265220	2,000 years after Democratus came up with this concept, 2,000 years, and even 200 years after
10265220	10274340	Galileo first put some dents in the armor of Aristotle with all of his work. So then we have
10274340	10280580	Dalton coming along and proposed, well, we've got some interesting things that we see. We see that
10280580	10292740	if you have water, water is always roughly 88% or 88.9% mass oxygen, and the rest is hydrogen.
10292740	10297780	So we can always have that the same, where the percentages of oxygen and hydrogen are always
10297780	10304260	the same, where mass is conserved and mass doesn't disappear or reappear. You
10304260	10308180	can say, well, imagine that there's little tiny building blocks that have certain amounts of mass,
10308180	10312900	and these things then matter, then, is the arrangement of these little tiny building blocks,
10312900	10318020	and perhaps some of those little tiny building blocks are hydrogen, some of them are oxygen,
10318020	10323860	then it's a process of discovering which they are. And so the atomic theory that Dalton revived,
10323860	10329060	he used the word atom, atomic theory, he said that atoms can either be created or they can
10329060	10334900	be destroyed, they are just there, there are pieces of matter that are permanent in existence,
10334900	10341540	and all chemistry can be defined by adding and putting together various atoms in various
10341540	10346740	arrangements. So the Dalton's theory of the atom, which is, which is a highly simplified version
10346740	10352260	of chemistry today, is that basically, well, even when you do elementary first semester chemistry,
10352260	10355060	you're going to be looking at Dalton's version of the atom. You're not going to look at quantum
10355060	10359860	mechanics just yet, but when you look at Dalton's version, you say, well, if you want to make water,
10359860	10367220	well, you take one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen, and that is water. And if you want to
10367220	10374580	make carbon dioxide, it's one carbon and two oxygens. If you wish to make methane, it's a CH4,
10374580	10378740	and if you want to make ammonia, it's NH3. So you've got all these things where they combine
10378740	10384580	together, and the combination thereof becomes the molecule. So Dalton's theory of the atom worked
10384580	10388900	up pretty good. Every element has its own particular properties. They all have the same
10388900	10393060	properties, and atoms simply combine in whole numbers. You can't break atoms apart in order to
10393060	10399300	say, no, there's no half water, which is like a half an oxygen and one and one hydrogen. That's
10399300	10405220	not half water. There's no such thing as half water. So Dalton's idea of the atom held sway for
10405220	10413780	about 100 years. And about 1903, roughly actually more like 1897, JJ Thompson's or JJ Thompson
10413780	10420180	discovered the electron, the first fundamental particle. This is the discovery of the concept
10420180	10426420	that, yes, there can actually be fundamental particles, meaning things that cannot be divided
10426420	10434020	anymore. The literal atomos of democratists back in 400 BC. So what he discovered was the electron,
10434020	10439540	which had a positive, it was a negative charge, and it must reside. He discovered it by using
10439540	10444180	cathode ray and understanding what the nature of a cathode ray is. And so what he said is that,
10444180	10450020	well, wait a second, we know these electrons must exist. And so he posited that, that perhaps
10450020	10455380	Dalton's concept of the atom can be modified, instead of being the smooth distribution of
10455380	10461220	Lego Bob's or just little things, little balls, like billiard balls that are smooth. Perhaps inside
10461220	10466340	the billiard ball of Dalton, there are electrons and they're moving around. And so therefore,
10466340	10470740	if there's an electron, which is a negative charge, there must be some positive charged
10470740	10476980	object, a proton, that's also in there, because every atom is electrically neutral. If it wasn't,
10476980	10482100	it would be quickly therefore, it would quickly neutralize itself by either acquiring electron
10482100	10488820	or losing electron. So Thompson's concept was is that inside of each of these little billiard balls,
10488820	10495620	Dalton's billiard balls, there were a plum pudding of electrons and protons in a mesh that
10495620	10501620	neutralized themselves out. So this is a good little model of the of the of the atom. And the
10501620	10506180	thing is, is that it took the concept of the electron said, oh, it's a piece of the atom,
10506180	10512580	and inside the atom, there's this thing. All right, so this also led him to learn that electrons
10512580	10518980	were about 2000 times smaller mass than the proton, whatever it was, these tiny, tiny, tiny things
10518980	10527060	were there. Anyway, so it didn't take long for people to say, well, okay, got it. What Thompson
10527060	10533140	is saying is that the electrons and protons are arranged inside the atom. All right, how exactly
10533140	10538900	are they arranged? That's a really key question. It's like, okay, fine. Are they moving randomly?
10538900	10544420	Do they have structure? Are they set up like little bricks? How are they set up inside of Dalton's
10544420	10549780	little atom? And how is the plum pudding mixed? Are the plums evenly distributed in the pudding?
10549780	10558100	Or are the plums tiny little bits going through? So what Sir Ernest Rutherford in 1911 sought to
10558100	10565140	understand this, the interior of Thompson's plum pudding model. And what he decided to do is to say,
10565140	10570740	I'm going to take a very, very, very heavy atom that I can make into a very, very, very flat sheet,
10570740	10576980	an extraordinarily thin, flat sheet. And the goal of this extraordinarily thin, flat sheet
10576980	10583380	is that if I throw something at a thin, flat sheet, things should go through it or bounce off of it.
10583380	10588180	And you know that if you take an object that is not flat and you throw something at it,
10588180	10592660	it can, things can reflect off of it in all sorts of ways. So if you take a flat surface,
10592660	10597380	then you bounce a ball off of the flat surface, the angle of incidence equals the angle of
10597380	10603860	reflection off of a flat surface. However, if the surface is all jagged or regular in some way,
10603860	10608420	then if you throw balls at that surface at different angles, the angle of incidence at the
10608420	10612980	moment at the location where the ball hit the surface, let's say the basketball, let's say you
10612980	10617780	do this off a basketball court, which is flat. And now you play a game where it's on a curved
10617780	10622340	surface like this, maybe it's got humps. And so as it reflects, you can actually see where it
10622340	10627700	reflects from and where it goes to after it reflects. And that gives you a map by looking
10627700	10632660	back where the things came from is to the shape of the object. And now that's one way of looking
10632660	10638500	at things. But Tom, but, but sir Ernest Rutherford, why do I keep saying sir? I forget if he is a
10638500	10644660	sir. In any event, Ernest Rutherford in 1911 said, I'm going to take gold, which I can hammer down
10644660	10649860	and make into gold foil. And this gold foil can be literally only a few atoms thick,
10649860	10654340	just just the thinnest thing. And this is an amazing property of gold, by the way. And gold
10654340	10662100	itself can be can be made into very, very thin foils. And it's so thin that if a gold atom
10662980	10667300	is one of Thompson's plum pudding models, then the electrons in there have to be distributed in
10667300	10672660	some way. And if I throw something at it, and it goes through the atom, it might deflect it
10672660	10677300	as it goes through. So if you throw something through something, you throw, go through something,
10677300	10681780	and you interact with it gently, it'll diverge the path of the thing that you threw through it.
10681780	10687300	So it assumes that Thompson's plum pudding model is is porous, or at least maybe not necessarily
10687300	10692180	porous, but at least kind of some material, some thing. And we don't know exactly how it's structured.
10692180	10696660	But let's take a helium nucleus called an alpha particle, and we'll take that alpha particle
10696660	10704420	and send it through the gold nucleus. Now here was the expectation. The expectation was that as
10704420	10710180	the gold as the helium nuclei went through, they'll be gently redirected by the distribution of
10710180	10716900	electrons inside of there. Because it's been known that by cathode ray by the interactions of cathode
10716900	10721620	rays, and again, alpha particles that they actually interact, and they can redirect each other's
10721620	10727300	paths. So what happens is that you send the elect send the alpha particle through the gold foil,
10727300	10732340	and see how it gets bent around. And that gives you the structure of the electrons inside there,
10732340	10736500	because the gold must be the gold, right? It just must be whatever it is. And nicely enough,
10736500	10740980	gold does not do much reaction. It's very not heavily reactive. And it's very, very thin.
10741700	10748100	So here's what what Rutherford found. He found that most of the of the alpha particles went
10748100	10752580	straight through the gold foil, and were detected on a silver iodide screen on the far side.
10753460	10758900	But just to be careful, Rutherford put a screen all the way around it. And he found that a
10758900	10765620	significant number and a non a pre and significant number actually bounced back. So that's kind of
10765620	10770180	weird. So you throw something at something very, very thin, that's supposed to allow things to
10770180	10777220	pass through. But instead, it bounces off of something. So that meant that if if with Rutherford's
10777220	10783780	concept, then he had to reconfigure what he meant by the atom. And he said, wait, there must be some
10783780	10789940	dense, heavy thing that the alpha particles knocking off of. Because if you then say, let's say you
10789940	10795940	have the protons, or the alpha particles are part of the gold nucleus. If you send one alpha
10795940	10800180	particle into the other, they're going to hit off of each other, but they won't necessarily
10800180	10803620	bounce straight off of each other. They have to be a perfect alignment for them to do that.
10804340	10810100	But what happened is, is that the gold foil reflected off of the alpha particles reflected
10810100	10815940	off of the gold foil coming back towards the, towards the emitter. And that, as Rutherford
10815940	10821620	said, was like taking a 15 inch shell, an artillery shell, such as might have been used in, say,
10821620	10827380	the First World War, right around 1911, which we're talking about. 1911, I, and the 15 inch shell
10827380	10833460	going through a piece of tissue paper, and the tissue paper bounces the artillery shell off of it.
10833460	10838740	Now that would be surprising. And that's a surprise. In fact, that the energetics of that are about as
10838740	10843620	surprising as what Rutherford discovered with this experiment, which meant that there must be some
10843620	10850180	massive object in the atom that can reflect off of, can reflect something, can push something back,
10850180	10856100	that's coming into it at high speed, that has some, that has some decent mass to it. So he reconfigured
10856100	10861300	the concept to say that at the center of the atom was the, was a positively charged nucleus,
10861300	10866500	and that positively charged nucleus has mass, as most of the mass of the atom, and the electrons
10866500	10873540	are somehow spiraling around it. So the, that is the difference between, between the plum pudding
10873540	10881060	model and Rutherford's swarm of electrons around a nucleus, and this was put to bed Thompson's
10881060	10887860	model of the, of the, of the plum pudding. So now we have this concept that there must be a dense
10887860	10894660	nucleus. This led to some problems though, because the, if it's smoothly distributed, then it can be
10894660	10899380	electrically neutral. But if Rutherford's concept is right, now you've got this positive charged
10899380	10904100	thing, and you've got these negative charged things flying around it, and observationally,
10904100	10909060	experimentally, they exist, they, there is some large positive charged thing, and the electrons
10909060	10914580	are negatively charged, and they're clearly not on top of it. They're near it, but not on top of it.
10915220	10922180	So the question then becomes, why doesn't the electron spiral down from its orbit around this
10922180	10930180	nucleus, and fall into the nucleus, and become Thompson's plum pudding? What is the thing that
10930180	10935220	makes the plum pudding not true? Meaning it should just spiral together, so it's all neutral, and
10935220	10941540	everybody's on top of each other. Why do the electrons stay away from the nucleus, which is
10941540	10945780	positively charged? We get why it should be near, because there's an attractive force. But why should
10945860	10953300	all of a sudden it stop? And nobody knew why that would be. So no matter what, when you did this
10953300	10960820	experiment, you found that the nucleus had to be there, separate from the electrons. And this became
10960820	10967540	the topic for an enormous amount of research, and it spurred the entire idea, because Rutherford's
10967540	10974740	atom has a very difficult time explaining the spectra of light. Because now we have to say,
10974980	10979940	Rutherford's atom says, if you have an electron spiraling around, as it spirals, it should emit
10979940	10986020	a continuous spectrum of light, not a discrete spectrum. So Rutherford's atom cannot predict
10986020	10993300	the spectrum. However, it does predict the event of collisions into it, and it does disprove the
10993300	10999700	plum pudding model. So there's a bit of a problem. And that problem is, one experiment shows one
10999700	11004420	thing, but other experiments demand that that's not the full story. And the full story of what
11004420	11009620	happens to Rutherford's atom comes up next time, when we talk about the Bohr model of the atom.
11013540	11018100	Hello, this is Jason Kendall, and welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.
11018100	11022660	Today, we're going to be finishing out the nature of what the hydrogen atom is,
11022660	11027460	and the models of the atom through history. So let's take a step back. Last time we looked at
11027460	11031620	Rutherford's version of the atom, which has kind of like little stars orbiting a little planet,
11031620	11036260	a little planet orbiting a little star. That's the kind of basic assumption that Rutherford came
11036260	11041940	about when he did his gold foil experiment. But if we go back just a little bit further back in
11041940	11048500	time, we find that there's a very interesting hint to things to come. The Swedish physicist Johannes
11048500	11056980	Rydberg in 1888 looked at the nature of the hydrogen spectrum and tried to create an empirical
11056980	11063380	formula. This empirical formula had a goal, and the goal was to actually simply model the actual
11063380	11068980	lines that are seen, the transitions that are seen, or at least the spectral lines that are seen
11068980	11076340	in the hydrogen spectrum. So what he did is he found a periodic pattern to them, and he was able
11076340	11082340	to determine that the reciprocal of the wavelength is equal to some constant, some full constant,
11082340	11088500	and then multiply it by the reciprocal of the inverse of two squared integers. Now,
11088500	11094580	this is really interesting because it highlights a concept that what you sometimes do in science
11094580	11100980	is you just try to create some sort of empirical formula for what you're observing in nature.
11100980	11106020	And after you do that empirical formula, you then try to see if you can understand the underlying
11106020	11112660	science below it. Well, so that's what Rydberg did. He made an empirical formula that is only
11112660	11118820	based off of the data, but he had no underlying reason as to why it would be this way. He just
11118820	11124340	made a formula that worked. Fascinatingly enough, the Rydberg formula for the hydrogen atom is
11124340	11131780	extraordinarily simple. So what it should tell us is that we are looking for underlying physics
11131860	11137380	that actually works to tell us something deeper. And that was in 1888. So many things were happening
11137380	11141860	right around the turn of the 20th century, 19th and the 20th century in terms of modern physics.
11141860	11148260	It's astonishing. But Rydberg's hint gives us a little bit of a clue. All right, so let's go
11148260	11155220	forward in time from 1888 to 1911. And 1911 is when Rutherford came up with his concept for the atom,
11155220	11160660	and it was necessitated, it was needed to be done because the Thompson's plum pudding model doesn't
11160660	11167060	work. Well, Rutherford's model of the atom also cannot work. And it can't be the last answer to
11167060	11173860	things. Because if you have an electron orbiting a proton, and you would be very active at going
11173860	11179460	around in a circle is an accelerated motion. If you have an accelerated motion, you're going to
11179460	11185460	emit energy. And by emitting energy, the thing will eventually spiral in the electron will spiral in
11185540	11190820	emitting electromagnetic radiation, as it spirals in, and it'll crash into the proton
11190820	11197460	and become Thompson's plum pudding. So the Rutherford's model of the atom could not
11197460	11201700	actually be the final answer because well established extraordinarily well established
11201700	11207300	electromagnetic theory demanded that they would eventually collide together. So something else
11207300	11214740	had to be there in order to make this work. Well, that came along because in very shortly
11214740	11220100	thereafter in 1913 by Niels Bohr. So what Niels Bohr did is he said, okay, fine, we don't want
11220100	11227380	this thing spiraling. Fine, imagine that the angular momentum of the of the objects was fixed.
11227380	11232740	And so what he did is he said, okay, every one of these little planets that orbits this little
11232740	11239140	sun, they can only orbit at specific radii. So if he said that's his pot, that's his positive,
11240100	11245140	his basic assumption. The basic concept is, is that they can only orbit at specific radii and
11245140	11250420	they can't spiral in. Well, why can't they spiral in? That's the essence of the Bohr model of the
11250420	11258420	atom. The Bohr model of the atom said basically that the angular momentum had to have fixed values.
11258420	11265060	And these fixed values were multiples, integer multiples of some value. So that's his idea is
11265060	11271540	that Bohr's model of the atom said we can have quantized angular momentum. And what is angular
11271540	11277460	momentum? Well, if you take a little planet orbiting a little star, the angular momentum of
11277460	11281940	the little planet orbiting the little star is the mass times the speed with which it's going around,
11281940	11287940	times the radius at which it's going around. So if the angular momentum is quantized, then,
11287940	11293940	well, you know the mass, fine, you can determine the speed, sure, but then the radius must then
11293940	11300180	be fixed. There must be only stepwise distances that the electron can live from the proton.
11300180	11306740	So the Bohr model of the atom says let's now take this concept of quantized angular momentum.
11306740	11312100	And what we'll do is we'll say what is the force that is required to keep something going in a
11312100	11320180	circular orbit and then equate that to the force due to the electromagnetic attraction between the
11320180	11326180	electron and the proton, make those two things equal, slide in the concept that that the product
11326180	11330500	of the mass times the speed of the electron going around in that circular orbit at the radius of
11330500	11336740	the circular orbit is some integer multiple of some number. And that number is the Planck's constant,
11336740	11342980	the reduced Pollock's constant h bar. And you get out of that by doing some hooks and some crooks
11342980	11350020	and looking and playing around with it. You eventually discover that the energy at a given
11350180	11356420	level that you would have. So if you have a potential energy between the electron and the proton,
11356420	11361620	so they're trying to pull on each other. So that gives an energy that is a position and that we
11361620	11368820	call a potential energy. So the potential energy between them is fixed and we can determine what
11368820	11373220	it is and it's dependent on the radius and how far apart they are. And we say, okay, what is the
11373220	11379300	energy at a particular location? And it works out to be a very small amount which is in the
11379300	11385860	electron volts. About 13.6 electron volts is the amount of negative energy or energy that's
11385860	11390420	different from when the electron is free. So it loses a bit of energy getting close to it,
11390980	11399060	close to the proton. So we can only have energy at fixed orbital radii. And these orbital radii
11399700	11406500	have our integer multiples are product of the orbital number squared. So the ground state,
11406500	11411540	which is the lowest possible state, which is n equals one, that is the lowest possible state.
11411540	11415540	And then you can have larger and larger and larger ends, but they just get bigger and bigger,
11415540	11421700	which means that the energy approaches zero as you have greater and greater distance from the
11421700	11429380	from the from the proton. So Naboor model of the atom, but by having quantized angular momentum
11429380	11435460	and using the definition of the potential energy between an electron and a proton and the definition
11435460	11441300	of a force that's taking some keeping something in a circular orbit at a particular quantized
11441300	11446340	angular momentum utilizing the four of the Coulomb relationship, which is the force of
11446340	11453140	attraction between two charged particles, we can then derive with with Bohr's concept
11453140	11459220	that they that these the angular momentum is quantized. We get a very interesting set of results.
11459220	11467140	So first, the electron can only live in fixed orbital radii from the proton. And the nearest one
11467140	11474020	is when the number this fixed number is one, or this quantum number is one. And if it's at
11474020	11478980	quantum number one, we call it the ground state. If it's quantum number two, we call it the first
11478980	11483540	excited state. If it's quantum number three, we call it the second excited state. So an electron
11483540	11490500	can only jump up and can move between energy levels. So these are levels of energy fixed radii
11490500	11495060	from the proton. And so we have an electron either at the ground state at the nearest radius,
11495060	11500100	or at the first excited state, which is at the next radius up. Now, something could come along
11500100	11505700	and smack the electron. So let's let's pause it now, as we will, how we can use the Bohr model
11505700	11509780	of the atom. So let's have an electron orbiting a proton, it's a nice little hydrogen atom,
11509780	11513780	it's sitting out there somewhere in space, not doing anything, it's minding its own business.
11513780	11517140	And another proton comes along, or another hydrogen atom comes along,
11517140	11520900	smacks into it, and gives it a little bit of energy, just like a billiard ball,
11520900	11525940	by smacking another billiard ball. It makes a little clicking sound, but instead of clicking,
11526660	11531060	what happens is a little bit of that collision goes to making the electron go up an orbital.
11531060	11535780	It kicks it up to the next orbit. So a collision can do that, gives it a little bit of energy.
11535860	11540420	When it gives it a little bit of energy, it can jump a little bit further away from the proton.
11540420	11546020	So now it's gotten some energy, it's pushed away from the proton, which is trying to pull it home.
11546020	11551860	And it says, eventually, the state can't live for very long. And what happens is the electron then
11551860	11555620	says, I'm going to go back down to the lower level from the second, from the first excited state,
11555620	11561540	down to the second, and in so doing, emits energy. Now, it can do this emission of energy by, say,
11561540	11567380	colliding into something else, but probably the most efficient way, and the most common way,
11567380	11575060	is for it to emit light. So when it drops from an higher energy level than the ground state,
11575060	11579940	down to ground state, it'll emit a light, it'll emit photon. And that photon will have exactly
11579940	11585220	the energy of the difference between two levels. So let's see what that actually works out to be.
11585220	11590420	At the ground state, the energy that you have is about 13.6 electron volts. And we're going to call
11590420	11596580	that a negative energy, because if it's at, let's say the electron and proton are not bound
11596580	11600900	together. If they're not bound together, we would have, we would say they have no energy with respect
11600900	11607140	to each other. So they're free. So a free bound, a free electron free from its proton would have
11607140	11611700	zero energy. And we call bound states negative states. So you can think of them as at the bottom
11611700	11615700	of a well or the bottom of a hill or something like that. So they have to fall into this potential
11615700	11621060	well. Once that's where we get the negative state from. So the energy we're going to call it is a
11621060	11626820	negative 13.6 electron volts. And I'll let you Google what an electron volt is, because that's
11626820	11632420	a really interesting subject all of itself. So that is n equals one. And that has an energy
11632420	11636660	of 13.6 electron volts. So now something comes along, it collides into it, the electron jumps
11636660	11640980	up to the next orbit. So this is n equals two. And that works out to have an energy of minus
11640980	11646900	3.4 electron volts. It then emits an electron, it emits a photon as it drops from the first
11646900	11653060	excited state back down to the ground state. And you subtract the two minus 3.4 minus a minus 13.6
11653060	11659380	that ends up to be 10.2 electron volts. That's a very small amount of energy. It's on the order
11659380	11665540	of 10 to the minus 19th joules. So it's a tiny amount of energy. You'd have to have a whole
11665540	11671700	bunch of these happen in order to even see it. So it's a single photon emitted by a single
11671700	11676900	electron dropping down from the first excited state to the second. So what does that energy
11676900	11683220	correspond to in terms of light? Because we know that light has frequencies, right? So
11683220	11688340	what does the energy of light correspond to? Well, here's the thing. Now we're going to
11688340	11695060	drop back in time again. So Niels Bohr is working on this thing in 1913, Ryd Bertbert in 1888, but
11695060	11700420	smack in between them. Albert Einstein brought us a very, very interesting thing by studying what's
11700420	11706020	called the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect shows how electrons are liberated from
11706020	11712100	a metal if light shines upon them. And it was found that if the light, no matter how intense it was,
11712100	11717140	if it was infrared light, it did not liberate the electrons. But as soon as the frequency was large
11717140	11721620	enough, then the electrons would be liberated away from the metal and then they could move.
11721620	11728100	So what this meant is that photons were acting like a particle, just an and a wave. Uh-oh,
11728100	11732500	that brings us back all the way to Newton's corpuscles of light again. Oh my goodness. Well,
11732500	11738900	light has a duality of waves and particles. So here is now proof by Einstein in 1905,
11738900	11744260	which got him the Nobel Prize, by the way, that the energy of a photon is proportional to the
11744260	11749780	frequency or inversely proportional to the wavelength of the light. And the different,
11749780	11755220	the transmogrification of frequency or wavelength into this particle concept of like how much
11755220	11761940	billiard ball type particle is in the photon is by the Planck constant h. So energy of a light of
11761940	11766740	the light is equal to h, which is Planck's constant times the speed of light divided by the wavelength.
11766740	11772740	And that gives you these, the energy of the photon. Ha! But we just saw that the energy
11772740	11776580	difference between the photon that the energy dropping from the first excited state down to
11776580	11782020	the ground state is 10.2 electron volts. And if we say that's the energy and then we see what the
11782020	11790900	wavelength works out to be, the wavelength works out to be 122 nanometers. Wow, okay. So when the
11790900	11796900	electron drops from the first excited state down to the ground state, the wave, the energy is 10.2
11796900	11806500	electron volts. And that's converted into 1.22 times 122 nanometers, or approximately a point,
11806500	11812740	yeah, well, 12, yeah, 1200, 1200 angstroms. So now that we can plug in and look at that and see what
11812740	11818020	the Rydberg number is, and we say, well, wait a second, what's the Rydberg value? Well, Rydberg
11818020	11823860	value says that what's the wavelength? And we say, oh, n1, n2 squared. Wow, is this interesting?
11823860	11830900	It matches Rydberg's formula exactly if you put in n1 equals 1 and n2 equals 2, which is just really
11830900	11836820	amazing. So Rydberg's formula predicted it, or at least was empirical. Now we've got something that
11836820	11845140	actually shows it. So the wavelengths that are predicted by Bohr's model of the atom are matched,
11845140	11851380	matched directly what Rydberg found in 1888. Just as another example, and a more pertinent one
11851380	11856580	that we're going to talk about later, electrons can jump up multiple orbital levels and drop
11856580	11860260	back down multiple orbital levels, or it can go up and down and up and up and down and up,
11860260	11865060	depending on what's happening in the environment in which it lives. So let's say that the electron,
11865060	11870100	instead of going up only one level, jumped up two from the ground state to the second excited state,
11870100	11876100	or n equals 3. So now it's an n equals 3. And let's say it's going to drop twice. So it's going to
11876100	11880580	step down each level of the ladder on its way home to ground state. So it's going to drop from 3
11880580	11886660	to 2, and then from 2 to 1. And we just did 2 to 1, which gives you an energy of about 10 electron
11886660	11891780	volts. But let's look specifically at the one where it drops from 3 down to 2. All right,
11891780	11896820	so 3 down to 2, we can calculate the energy of the two of them. And it starts for the third,
11896820	11904660	it is n equals 3, is the second excited state. I know, 3 is second, 2 is first, ground is zero,
11905220	11910500	right? Kind of really annoying, but let's work with it. So if we're going to start from n equals 3,
11910500	11914740	the second excited state, and it's going to be a little bit higher, a little bit closer to zero
11914740	11920820	energy, about one and a half electron volts in the hole. And the second excited, the first excited
11920820	11925140	state is three and a half electron volts, 3.4 electron volts in the hole. And we take the
11925140	11931380	difference of those. It's an energy difference of just under two electron volts or 1.89 electron
11931380	11937380	volts. We convert that using the formula that Einstein discovered in 1905, that got in the
11937380	11945380	Nobel Prize. And we find that 656.3 nanometers. And if we look at that, that is Rydberg's formula
11945380	11952100	for the transition between 3 and 2 in the Rydberg formula. And that is exactly the wavelength of
11952100	11959780	light that is predicted. That's exactly the wavelength of light that you observe in a spectroscope.
11959780	11965540	That is the transition in the red area of the spectrum. That is H alpha, one of the most common
11965540	11970980	wavelengths of light to look at for all astronomical species, because most of the universe is made of
11970980	11976900	hydrogen. And so when you look out at the Orion nebula, which has this characteristic pink glow,
11977620	11983380	and that characteristic pink glow comes from radiation, light being emitted specifically
11983380	11990180	at 656.3 nanometers. We now know that's due, according to the Bohr model, to an electron
11990180	11995540	dropping from the third excited state down to the second excited state and then on its way back
11995540	11999460	to the ground state. But it's actually gotten some energy from somewhere and it's falling and
11999460	12004900	cascading back through and it emits this form of light. And there it goes, it's emitting this light.
12004900	12011620	So now we know we have a model for a very important thing, which is we're now can model the spectrum
12011620	12018820	of light. But let's take, before we go there, let's go into a little weird place because
12019380	12023780	we've had a very strange set of things and Bohr's model of the atom assumes a little
12023780	12030340	dot orbiting another little dot in a circular motion. But we've already seen that there's a
12030340	12036660	certain way, but physics kind of went a little awry for us and that model works extremely well
12036660	12042180	for us, the Bohr model. But let's take it forward just a little bit to determine that that's not
12042180	12051540	still the end of the story because electrons are not pure particles. Well, what was found in 1924
12051540	12060100	is Louis de Broglie in his PhD thesis. He's a French physicist and in his PhD thesis,
12060180	12067060	he postulated, he postulated that every subatomic particle, or more specifically,
12067060	12073540	every particle has a wavelength. So he said that every particle, an electron, a proton, you, me,
12073540	12078580	the chair, a building, a whole planet, the galaxy, it has a wavelength. And that wavelength will
12078580	12087460	call the de Broglie wavelength. And we can take the concept of the energy of a photon,
12087460	12095060	we convert like just from Einstein's discovery and we convert that into a momentum
12095060	12100820	because light, even though it has no mass, still carries momentum. So if it can carry momentum
12100820	12105140	and matter does carry momentum, this is where de Broglie kind of made the leap, he said, well,
12105140	12111220	if light carries momentum and matter carries momentum, then we should be able to equate the two.
12111220	12118180	So de Broglie said, well, what is the, what is the momentum of light given its wavelength? And so
12118180	12122260	he said, fine, there it is. And so now you actually then put the weight and you establish then that
12122260	12129380	there's also a momentum associated with, with an electron. And so combining his concept with
12129380	12134020	general relativity says that there is a speed with which it's going and if it's not, if it's
12134020	12139060	going greater than the speed of zero, then it'll have some sort of wavelength associated with it.
12139060	12144580	In any event, de Broglie said that there's a, as electrons travel through space,
12145380	12150820	they are not just particles, they're a packet of waves. And what's fascinating about this
12150820	12156420	is this concept that every element and every subatomic particle or every particle in existence
12156420	12162900	has a wavelength and we call it the de Broglie wavelength, then as this concept is experimentally
12162900	12170100	verifiable. And in fact, in 1927, it was experimentally verified that electrons do diffraction
12170100	12176500	just in the same way that light does. So electrons do diffraction, protons do diffraction,
12176500	12182340	even large molecules do diffraction. This concept of the de Broglie wavelength is ubiquitous
12182340	12186500	throughout. And apparently there's macromolecules that can even be shown with their de Broglie
12186580	12193140	wavelength and actually measure it. So we can measure the spread of a particle that means it's
12193140	12198980	not all in one place. It means it's not a pinpoint particle that you can say at the head of this pin,
12198980	12203700	at the point of this pin, that is exactly where the electron is. You can't do that because it has
12203700	12209220	a wavelength. Really weird. All right. So what does that mean for our model of the atom? We're
12209220	12215060	going to kind of diverge away into it. We're going to say de Broglie said that wavelengths of light,
12215620	12222260	wavelengths of electrons, if they're trapped, then they have a standing wave. And so he said,
12222260	12226340	okay, fine, what's a standing wave? A standing wave is just like if you tie a rope into a doorknob
12226340	12230740	and you flick your wrist up and down, you hold it, you can make various waves against it,
12230740	12234580	because your wrist is fixed and the doorknob is fixed. So you can make a standing wave,
12234580	12238980	even though the waves are moving, they're in there, they're moving up and down like a jump rope,
12238980	12243140	or you're doing all sorts of rope tricks, but the ends are fixed, they're not flapping around,
12243140	12249620	the ends are fixed. So you can have standing waves and the more energy you give to the standing wave,
12249620	12257140	the more nodes there are to the wave. So we can then reformulate the Bohr model as having a pit.
12257140	12260740	And so think of the Bohr model of the atom, and this is de Broglie's sort of version of it,
12260740	12268180	or at least one way of thinking about it using waves of electrons. So the bottom lowest energy
12268180	12273140	is where it's only one wavelength, and the next wavelength, next energy level is two wavelengths,
12273140	12278580	the third wavelength is three wavelengths, and so on, and so on, and so on. So the lowest possible
12278580	12284260	energy state in an atom, it must have only one wavelength in a standing wave at the bottom of
12284260	12292900	the pit. And so each one of these locations of the radius at which it is, it's not an electron
12292900	12298340	circling like a little dot, a little planet circling a little sun, it's a standing wave
12298340	12303940	surrounding the dot, which is itself kind of a wiggly thing too. So now we can think of it
12303940	12308340	instead of having it fixed on the doors, the ends must connect together, and so we have a circular
12308340	12312500	standing wave, not a linear standing wave, but just take the end of the door and your wrist and
12312500	12318180	put them together, and now you've got a circle. And at the bottom of the, and they must be circular
12318180	12323460	waves, otherwise it's not going to be in the box. So only at these fixed locations where you
12323460	12330100	have one wavelength doesn't work, and then we can equate the radius to the wavelength of the,
12330100	12337380	using the de Broglie relationship, and we get the same exact result as, as, as Bohr did with his
12337380	12344340	concept of the little planet, orbiting the little sun. Now we say that the electron is not actually
12344340	12351140	a point particle, it is a standing matter wave surrounding the proton, which means where the
12351140	12356900	heck is the electron inside the atom? That's a really interesting question. We can't find it,
12356900	12363540	because it's a wave. So it's a wave inside of there. And the, the de Broglie relationship then
12363540	12370660	then gives a very good explanation as to why this quantization must occur, because electrons have
12370660	12377140	wave properties, and they must have fixed standing length wave properties inside of the atom,
12377140	12383620	in order for it to actually be bound inside of an atom. If it does not have these standing,
12383620	12388340	if it's not a standing wave inside of the, inside there, then it's not going to be,
12389060	12396020	it simply will not be a bound state. So unbound states are states that have more energy than
12396020	12401620	is, well, they're more energy than being in the bound state, plus they don't have the right number
12401620	12407540	of wavelengths. So you can't, you must have the circular standing wave inside the atom of some
12407540	12415220	kind. So this concept, these two concepts where we have the Bohr's relatively simple model of
12415220	12420100	electron spinning around as a ball, that works. But then we have de Broglie's relationship,
12420100	12425140	which tells us something even new about the nature of matter. Both of them work and tell us
12425140	12429460	everything we want to know about the spectrum of light from the Lyman series and the ultraviolet
12429460	12433860	showing the transitions up and down the Balmer series in the visible light, showing transitions
12433860	12438900	up and down the Pashen series, which is an infrared, which starts at level three or ends at level three,
12440020	12446020	or yeah, n equals three. And then if we then, we can then explain all of Kirchhoff's laws
12446020	12452340	using the Bohr model of the atom. The lines that you see in Kirchhoff's spectra, an emission spectrum
12452340	12459220	is due to the huge numbers of atoms jumping up and down electrons jumping up and down in orbits
12459220	12465140	and sending light out from those in various directions in random directions. There's no one
12465140	12469540	direction that sends the light out. So it might as well go to you. And so the photons that you
12469540	12474180	receive, you receive them at specific, specific wavelengths. And therefore that's where we get
12474180	12479700	the emission spectrum of Kirchhoff, which was an empirically derived idea. Likewise, absorption
12479700	12484820	does the same thing because as the light goes into the cloud of atoms, they absorb specific
12484820	12489380	wavelengths. It makes it a little darker at those wavelengths and because that light's going someplace
12489380	12493780	else. And so if you look through a cloud of gas, you're going to see that it's darker at those
12493780	12498260	locations because some of that light has been absorbed and re-radiated in other directions.
12498260	12502580	And that gives the emission spectrum from the side. So the Bohr model of the atom and even
12502580	12508340	De Broglie's model of the atom explains Kirchhoff's empirically derived laws about the nature of what
12508340	12513380	spectra are. So we have lots of different ways of talking about emission lines, absorption lines,
12514260	12521620	and this leads us to the incredibly important idea that spectroscopy is the most key thing that we
12521620	12529620	have in all of astrophysics. It is everything. Basically, we will be able to determine huge
12529620	12535380	numbers of things about a location because of its spectrum. First and foremost, we can determine what
12535380	12541380	elements there are by modeling the spectrum of it, by looking at exactly what we see in the light.
12541380	12545540	We've got all this light here. We've got coming in and out, emission, absorption, and so forth.
12545540	12549540	But we can also determine temperatures and pressures because of the widths of the lines,
12549540	12555140	because of the Doppler shifts. We can determine huge numbers of things from spectra, but it all
12555140	12561700	comes from the very simple concept of the nature of the model of the atom. So let's actually just
12561700	12566340	back this up a little bit and we're going to take it away from the spectroscopy for just a second
12566340	12572660	and go address something that I was looking at and kind of dodged around, but now I'm going to come
12572660	12579940	at it full force. Okay, so where is the electron inside of the atom? So I alluded that there's
12579940	12586580	some really odd ideas and let's see what we get out of them. De Broglie's concept of a matter wave
12586660	12593940	and having electrons be standing waves inside of the atom changes a lot of things about the
12593940	12600420	nature of what we think about the atoms and matter in general. So De Broglie's hypothesis
12600420	12604820	that matter is a wave fundamentally changed a lot of ways the way we think about things.
12604820	12614180	So if the electron is in a standing wave inside of the atom, then where is it? Because just in
12614180	12619460	the same way that we said, okay, we're going to hook the string up to a doorknob and to my wrist,
12619460	12624020	we can easily make it so it's a nice standing wave. We can say, oh, what's the wavelength? Okay, we
12624020	12628660	can get the wavelength of it and if we flick it harder, we can have more nodes on that thing and
12628660	12635780	we can say it's a shorter wavelength, but if we then ask, we ask where actually is the wave
12635780	12641780	on the string, we wouldn't have a good answer. We'd say, well, I know that it's on the string.
12641780	12648020	I know that it makes up the entire length of the string, but where exactly is it? Can I pinpoint
12648020	12654500	it on the string? And the answer is no, you cannot. So in the same sense, we now have a very strange
12654500	12661860	thing where we cannot pin the electron's location inside of a bound atom. So once it's in there,
12661860	12667140	it's in a standing wave setup. The standing wave does not permit us to actually find the
12667140	12673380	location of the electron and it gets worse from there. De Broglie's concept actually still kept
12674660	12679300	Neal's Bohr's idea of the little planet orbiting the little sun, but now we don't even do that.
12679300	12684900	So now De Broglie said, okay, make a standing wave that's orbiting a little sun. Fine, but that's
12684900	12690740	a circular pattern. And we now know by actually then taking De Broglie's concept and accelerating it
12690740	12695700	a bit more and looking at it in 3D space. And actually that's the only way to actually look at
12695780	12703300	it is that we don't see it as a circular standing wave, but a spherical standing wave with spherical
12703300	12709460	harmonics. And that's a very, very, very weird thing. And the solution to the equations of what
12709460	12716020	the hydrogen atom really looks like had to wait until Schrodinger made his famous equation,
12716020	12725300	the Schrodinger equation, which codified completely the concept that matter does behave as a wave.
12725780	12734100	And so when we take this concept of the wave nature of all particles, then and filter this through
12734100	12739700	the Schrodinger equation, we find that not only is the electron a standing wave going around it,
12739700	12745780	but somehow it's somewhere on the surface of a sphere that's as a certain radius. And so the
12745780	12750980	Bohr radius is not just the radius of the orbit, it's the radius of the sphere that the electron
12750980	12758100	seems to be it. And the actual radius itself is fuzzy. And where the electron is on there is fuzzy.
12758100	12764260	In fact, it's not determined. We know it's orbit, we know with the most probable location of it,
12764260	12769940	most probable location. And then we can actually say, well, where should it be in this place?
12769940	12774020	Still applies the same thing, though, if you actually give the electron a little bit more
12774020	12778660	energy, it'll go up a level, it'll change its standing way properties, it'll change its
12778660	12783540	harmonic standing waves, but you won't be able to find the electron. And why won't you be able
12783540	12788900	to find the electron? Well, take the proton and the electron and break them apart and turn them
12788900	12794260	into an atom, not an atom, not a bound atom, but have them be free particles. The proton itself is
12794260	12801060	an extraordinarily small object. If you were to say that the if we were to take the proton,
12801060	12806740	which is on the order of 10 to the minus 12 meters, it's on that size. So it's a micromete,
12806740	12812340	it's a million times smaller than a micromete, or a billion times smaller than a millimeter.
12812340	12817220	They're really tiny things. So if you take a proton, and it's on the order of 10 to the minus
12817220	12823460	12 meters, and let's say we want to see how big the electron is compared to that, well, let's blow
12823460	12828900	up the proton not from 10 to the minus 12 meters, but now let's make it the size of a moat of cigarette
12828900	12836420	dust, a cigarette smoke, a moat of dust, a single moat of cigarette smoke. That's a really tiny
12836420	12842100	thing. It's just visible to your eye. And if we put that somewhere in a box, how far would the
12842100	12847620	electron be in a bound orbit? We'll come back to the size in a second. So the electron is about,
12848660	12855780	would live on the ground state on the surface of a sphere. That's about 25 or 30 meters in diameter.
12855860	12860660	So you've got this tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny thing. And on somewhere on the surface of a sphere that's
12860660	12865780	25 meters in diameter, that's where the electron would live. And the electron would live somewhere
12865780	12870180	on that surface. It would have a fuzzy radius, so it wouldn't necessarily be right at that surface.
12870180	12875700	So it'd be somewhere maybe between 20 meters and 30, 40 meters. It'll be in between there. And so it'd
12875700	12881380	be a wave type property throughout there. And you can't pin down where it is. In fact, saying where
12881380	12886260	it is when it's bound as an atom, it doesn't really have a lot of meaning. It has a loose meaning.
12887140	12890900	But really, we know the energy level of the electron, but even that is not well known.
12891780	12898740	So the electron itself is a fuzzy object. And so is the proton, too. So the actual orbital radii
12898740	12903380	are fuzzy, but it shows you the size scales. Think about the Museum of Natural History. Go to the
12903380	12908660	Museum of Natural History in New York City. You find this enormous, huge sphere. Google the Hayden
12908660	12913300	Planetarium to see the size of the sphere. It's really big. So there's a model inside the Museum
12913300	12917220	that says, here's the size of a proton, and here's the size of an electron. It tries to show you the
12917220	12924180	size of an atom. And basically, put the proton, this mode of dust in the center of that sphere,
12924180	12927780	and put the electron somewhere on the surface of that sphere. And that gives you the concept of how
12927780	12933940	big it is. The electron itself is about 1,000 times, 2,000 times less massive than the proton.
12934020	12939460	But its size is determined kind of by its interaction. So it actually has kind of a very
12939460	12945540	strange, it's very, very small. Its characteristic interaction is a little bit bigger, so its actual
12945540	12951860	physical size is kind of an oddly ill-defined term. There are some definitions. There are ways
12951860	12959780	to define how big an electron is, but it's a much smaller object than the proton. So the electrons
12959780	12966340	orbit around the proton is fuzzy. However, we can approximate it with de Broglie's concept,
12966340	12971940	which means it's to a circular orbit. And we can approximate de Broglie's idea to a little tiny
12971940	12977780	planet around a little tiny sun. That's Bohr's model of the atom. And Bohr's model of the atom
12977780	12983460	had a quantized set of, as a quantized angular momentum. And we still maintain this concept
12983460	12988340	of the quantum mechanics. I mean, that's what we mean. The mechanics simply is, how do things move
12988340	12993460	under the influences of forces when they're given energies and speeds, and what are their locations,
12993460	12998100	how fast do they go, how fast do they accelerate, how fast do they decelerate, etc.
12998100	13002340	What are their directions change? That is mechanics. And it depends on their masses,
13002340	13005700	it depends on their inertia, it depends on their momenta, it depends on all these things. And those
13005700	13011860	are the study of mechanics. So quantum mechanics says, what happens when you take classical
13011860	13017780	mechanics, which is just how things move, but apply quantum principles to it, such as quantized
13017860	13025300	angular momenta, like Niels Bohr suggested, or matter wave concepts, such as de Broglie came up with.
13025300	13034260	Now, this idea of the fuzziness arose, of course, from the Schrödinger equation, which is a
13034260	13043380	relationship that just demonstrates how all of matter demonstrates wave-like properties. Even
13043380	13048660	large-scale matter displays wave-like properties, although the wavelengths are incredibly short.
13048660	13052900	When you're talking electrons, the wavelengths are roughly the same size as the particle itself,
13052900	13056580	so now you've got a matter and a wavelength that are roughly the same size, and you have to deal
13056580	13061700	with these quantum mechanical effects. We don't, in our daily lives, don't have to deal with
13061700	13067380	quantum mechanical effects because our sizes are much larger than our characteristic de Broglie
13067380	13072900	wavelengths. So this is kind of an important set of things. In fact, the quantum mechanical
13072900	13078180	universe that we're talking about, the quantum mechanical model of the universe, is extraordinarily
13078180	13083460	well supported by experiment. It is considered to be one of the triumphs of 20th century physics,
13084260	13089940	and it had the evidence for this model that matter behaves in wave-like properties. That's
13089940	13096500	enormous, enormous evidence for it, such as the nature of the black body radiation. Einstein's
13097220	13102820	photoelectric effect demonstrates it. There's wave-particle duality, meaning the dual nature
13102820	13109860	of both wave-like properties and particle-like properties using, say, Young's double-slit
13109860	13115220	experiment, but you can use Young's double-slit experiment for photons and apply it to electrons,
13115220	13122500	and you get the same thing. So this was done in 1927, and this was characteristic proof of
13122500	13128020	de Broglie's concept in 1924. Further and foremost, you get out of electron scanning microscopes,
13128020	13133940	which must do quantum mechanical behavior, but even more bizarrely is that every electronic
13133940	13139700	device that is used today must take into account quantum mechanical effects in order to actually
13139700	13145300	operate, and we'll even see that quantum mechanical effects are critical for our understanding of how
13145300	13151540	the sun works. Without quantum mechanics, we would actually not have any idea how the sun actually
13151540	13157540	shines as long as it does for the rate of energy that it puts out. Quantum mechanics is a requirement
13157540	13164580	for us to understand the way that the sun works, and the predictions associated with it tell us
13164580	13170260	how the sun works, which is a really fascinating thing. And so when we dig deeper into the nature
13170260	13175940	of what quantum mechanics tells us, we uncover what we would call a bedrock principle, and some
13176020	13182500	textbooks on quantum mechanics start with the concept of the non-commutativity of the various
13182500	13187460	parameters or various measurements, but we can summarize that with the Heisenberg uncertainty
13187460	13193220	principle, which says you simply can't measure paired measurements, there are certain sets of
13193220	13198900	paired measurements that you cannot measure infinitely accurately at the same time.
13199860	13205700	Specifically, two of the most famous are you can't measure the momentum of a particle
13205700	13213860	and the position of a particle with infinite precision. So if you know exactly where the
13213860	13218900	electron is, you have no idea what its momentum is, and momentum, according to the Broglie principle,
13218900	13224580	is the wavelength. So if you knew exactly what the Broglie wavelength was, you don't know where its
13224580	13230020	position is, and that's exactly what we meant by the whole string wave on a string thing, is that
13230020	13234500	if now the electron is a wave on a string between a doorknob and your wrist, and that's the electron,
13234500	13241620	where is the electron? It's there, but where, so you can't find it, and that's a fundamental basis
13241620	13246900	of quantum mechanics, is that you can't have these measurements, you can't have infinitely precise
13246980	13254420	measurements of two things, of paired sets of measurements. So another one is the energy
13254420	13261140	difference between states, and the time at which they live at that state, or the knowledge of the
13261140	13267620	energy level of that state, and that's actually why the second one is actually why the lines
13267620	13273540	have a breadth to them in spectroscopy, and that's one of the bases of the lines, there's
13273540	13278420	many reasons for the line's breadth, but the width of the lines can be attributed to the fact that
13278420	13283140	we really can't actually know the energy level inside of the atom, so we see how it's three
13283140	13288020	energy level three and energy level two, well those energy levels are fuzzy, and so the very
13288020	13294180	act of the fuzziness itself creates a width to the line, so the frequency at which we observe it
13294180	13300020	and is proportion, cannot be, you can't actually measure the, you can't measure both the energy
13300020	13308020	of the output and how long it lives at that location in that state, which is really fascinating.
13308020	13313380	So the concept of quantum mechanics, the basis of it, is that there's these fundamental bedrock
13313380	13317220	principles, and one of them is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that says there are,
13317220	13322740	there are two separate measurements or paired measurements that cannot be measured with equal
13322740	13327620	or infinite precision, you can't measure one of them without having complete lack of knowledge
13327620	13332500	of both with the other one, so you basically get fuzzy on these things, it's like I kind of know
13332500	13335700	it to this well, and I kind of know that one to that well, and that's all I'm never going to get,
13335700	13342740	and there's no thing you can do to circumvent that, that is a fundamental axiom of quantum
13342740	13348180	mechanics, people say well if technology gets better then they'll figure it out, well this is
13348900	13356020	having been figured out, and this is how nature works, which really is weird, it's not something
13356740	13361460	overcome by somebody building a new widget or something like that, no this will never be
13361460	13367780	overcome because it's a fact of nature, it's the way nature works, which makes it even more
13367780	13376420	interesting, so if we think about the nature of what nature works, we find that the solution
13376420	13381860	for the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom has all sorts of funny waveforms, and they're
13381860	13386980	based on spherical harmonics and the appearance of the thing, so it's not these simple spherical
13386980	13391300	orbits, these circular orbits, it depends on, there's actually three quantum numbers, there's
13391300	13396500	the primary quantum number, we also have what was called the azimuthal quantum number, the magnetic
13396500	13401780	quantum number, and they're kind of weird, but they're all interrelated, and yet these three
13401780	13406660	quantum numbers which are associated with electrons and matter waves, or waves of matter,
13406660	13410660	because now we're looking at three dimensions, we have three quantum numbers, I guess you can do it
13410660	13414740	that way, but let's just keep it that for simplicity, but there are three quantum numbers
13415780	13422900	that determine the appearance of the, that determine the appearance of the waveform of the
13422900	13430580	electron as it orbits the proton at various energy levels, which is interesting, and some of those
13430580	13436020	quantum numbers don't change the energy, the magnetic quantum number does not change the energy,
13436020	13440900	they're degenerate, it was called because of the same energy, but they have different configurations,
13440900	13445460	so we can have the same configuration at, different configurations of the same energy.
13445460	13451940	In any event, the hydrogen wave equation is the only atom for which we can solve the Schrodinger
13451940	13458660	equation to actually give us the appearance, to analytically show with an equation what it is.
13458660	13463780	Everything else is too complicated and must be done numerically. Finally, what's very strange,
13463860	13469300	remember I mentioned, it's like, well, what's your, what is your quantum wavelength? Well,
13469300	13475140	it's true, is that if you could somehow over an extraordinarily long period of time live,
13475140	13481460	let's say you could potentially live for 10 to the 70th years, let's just say you could do that,
13481460	13487860	that's a long time to live, if you could live for 10 to the 70th years, and every day you cut,
13487860	13492100	you punched your hand at a wall, you just went pop, pop, pop, punch your hand through a wall,
13492100	13496340	at some point your hand would go through the wall, not because you're punching a hole in the wall,
13496340	13502100	but because the probability for you to do that, maybe you punched your hand at the wall
13503140	13508180	10 to the 12th times a second for 10 to the 60th years, it's a lot of times to punch a hand
13508180	13512740	on the wall and you're going to be doing like a super hummingbird, and so whatever, in any event,
13512740	13518100	if you could do that, eventually your hand would go through the wall and come back,
13518100	13522980	because you're pulling your hand back through, and it will be okay, so the quantum mechanical world
13522980	13528660	says that you can't necessarily know the position of things, and when we talk about macroscopic
13528660	13534020	objects like people, their wavelengths are incredibly small, so the probability that they
13534020	13539860	go through things like that is catastrophically tiny, and so therefore you don't have to worry
13539860	13545940	about tunneling through walls and things like that, but if we lived in a quantum mechanical world,
13545940	13552420	then cows could go visit dolphins, so long as they, as they dolphin jumped out, a cow could then
13552420	13558180	drop back, as soon as it got back to the ocean, that's okay, so long as the cow lands on the ground,
13558180	13563300	remember the concept of quantum mechanics says you can't know the position and the momentum of
13563300	13568740	something with equal accuracy, if we lived in a quantum mechanical world, things would be appearing
13568740	13574020	and disappearing all around us, trucks, buses, buildings, everything, other people, friends,
13574020	13577300	would just simply appear and disappear, we would have no idea where they came from or where they're
13577300	13582180	going next, and that's the quantum mechanical world, it's like, well what's the probability that
13582180	13586900	you're going to see your friend over here downtown, you would not say, hey meet me downtown at six o'clock,
13586900	13591300	you'd say, well what's your best chance you'll be downtown at six o'clock, you'll get, you'll
13591300	13596900	calculate the joint probability of you and your friend being downtown at the same time,
13597780	13602980	in any event, quantum mechanics is how we actually discuss the nature of the world,
13602980	13607620	but when we talk astronomically, we tend to use the Bohr model of the atom because it's really
13607620	13611940	simple to understand, and that kind of gives a really good visualization, it's very hard to
13611940	13616980	visualize all these other things, so what we do is we try to think that we know that there's,
13616980	13624020	that basically electrons must live in fixed orbital radii away from their nuclei of their atoms,
13624020	13629220	and that concept that leads us to the nature of what spectroscopy does and helps us to understand
13629220	13633860	how Kirchhoff's laws arise, and so when we look at, we look at distant astronomical objects,
13633860	13640580	as we will in the future, then we will see that we can model an atomic process to the light that
13640580	13647700	gets emitted to what happens when it arrives at our telescope and our detector, so next time
13647700	13650980	we'll talk about telescopes and how they work.
