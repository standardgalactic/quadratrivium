00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello and welcome, this is Jason Kendall to one of my introductory astronomy lectures

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,780
and this time we're talking again about the nature of light.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,760
Light is that thing that allows us to see things from here to there, there to here.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,880
We don't emit light out of our eyes unlike certain kind of superheroes who beams of light

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,880
come out of their eyes.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,080
No, light, it comes to us from sources.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,040
Those sources might be hot objects that are so hot that they glow, or they're so hot

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,920
that they atoms in them emit light as they jump between orbits in their atomic shells.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,360
There's lots of ways for light to be emitted, but let's just see what light is as a thing.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,080
And as we've always seen from like the album cover of Pink Floyd, I look like we're looking

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,240
out here, when light passes into a from one medium to another, it changes direction and

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,440
depending on the medium, it has a frequency dependence for the speed of light inside that

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
new medium.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,760
But the speed of light that we're going to care about comes up really shortly.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,480
In any event, what is light?

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,680
Well light is electromagnetic radiation and electromagnetic radiation is a way of saying

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,200
that energy is being transported through space without there being a physical connection

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
between the two things.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,720
There's no actual physical link.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,320
So electromagnetic radiation is a transfer of energy.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,840
Examples where the other two examples where energy gets transferred are conduction, where

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,680
you heat something up and the vibrations of the molecules and atoms inside of that

23
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,560
object that you're heating up, they vibrate against each other and eventually all the

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
atoms move very fast.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,560
And if you happen to be heating up a skillet or a pan on sort of an open fire or a heating

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,560
element, then eventually the handle gets hot too.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,600
So that's called conduction.

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,040
Conduction is the vibration and the collisions of atoms inside a solid object or any object

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,760
where the atoms and molecules inside of it are close enough together that their vibrations

30
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
can impact each other.

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,760
So that's physical contact.

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,360
Another way that physical contact can occur is through conduction.

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,000
Convection is where you take a hot body of some sort, a hot bubble of gas or liquid or

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,640
what have you, or even a hot solid, and you move it from here to there by some physical

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
process.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,320
The heat then is transferred.

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,800
The energy is transferred because now you've got something with a greater amount of energy

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,760
and you take it from here and you put it there, presumably to a place of lower energy

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
or lower heat.

40
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,200
Or you could place it to a place where higher energy, but then it would gain more energy.

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,000
So that's not really the flow that we think of in terms of convection.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,320
So a good example is a boiling pot.

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,640
You heat the pot, the bottom of the pot gets hot, makes a bubble of hot water.

44
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,200
That water then rises in the pot, releases it in steam or heat into the surrounding,

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,760
into the kitchen, and then that cooler liquid then sinks back down.

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,400
It makes a boiling pot.

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,840
So there's actually a flow of water, a flow of water inside the pot as it goes.

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
So that's convection.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,560
It also happens with air, that's how we get storms because there's convective cells in

50
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,400
storms and so we've seen that happen all over the earth with the creation of hurricanes

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,840
and so forth.

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,320
But with electromagnetic radiation, radiative transfer of energy does not require the physical

53
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,720
contact.

54
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,680
Convection means you transfer objects that are physically moving through each other.

55
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,040
This bubble that's high moves through a region until it gets to a region where it's cool.

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,640
Conduction is where electrons bounce against other electrons right next to each other.

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,320
But if it's radiative transfer, electrons and protons don't go on and touch you and

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
move along.

59
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,680
No, it's light.

60
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,640
Light actually transfers its energy from here to there.

61
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,360
So there is no physical contact that the photon does.

62
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,720
It's just the thing that it transmits energy.

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,840
And so light is something, but let's get to it in just a little bit.

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,320
That's a very complex question.

65
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,760
But light's everywhere.

66
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,080
The reason you could see me now is because light's bouncing off of me, getting recorded

67
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,920
by the camera.

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,800
The camera then holds it as an electromagnetic impulse and then I transfer it to the computer.

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,380
After I transfer the computer, I play around with it on the computer, manipulating the

70
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,360
electric and magnetic fields on the computer and then I upload it using electromagnetic

71
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,680
fields to YouTube.

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,840
And after I have transferred to YouTube, you then turn on your computer and using more

73
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,400
electromagnetic energy, that creates light that comes out of the screen, which you then

74
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
see.

75
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Interesting.

76
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,920
But what is this light thing?

77
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:33,320
This thing that is transmitting energy from me through the magic of YouTube to you?

78
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,680
Anyway, there are characteristics to light that we should discuss before we say what

79
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,760
light is because we can't discuss what it is without discussing its characteristics.

80
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,000
And one of them is its wave motion.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,880
The light has a wave property, meaning that there's wavelength to light.

82
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,920
And light's wavelength is a very important thing.

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,520
So what do we mean by wavelength?

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,560
Wave lengths, if we take some sort of medium, and we have a regular disturbance in it, we

85
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,920
get waves that go up and down, like water waves.

86
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,000
Water waves are a perfect example of wave activity.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,360
In water waves, we see the distance between the crests and water waves, and those distances

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,160
are the wavelength.

89
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,240
So the wavelength is the distance between crests or troughs in a wave, as it traverses.

90
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,440
And so it's a cyclic pattern, it's just not one wave, there are many waves in a train

91
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,720
of waves.

92
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,840
And the train of waves has a speed with which they move through the medium, say the water

93
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,760
waves move at whatever speed they do through water.

94
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:39,080
And that speed is important because the speed of the wave is equal to the frequency, or

95
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,840
how many waves go by you per second, times the wavelength of it.

96
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,960
So if you have a high frequency, then if you have wavelengths of the same type, same length,

97
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,800
and one of them is high frequency, then of course the waves are moving faster by you.

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,440
If the same frequency is occurring, but one of the wavelengths is much shorter than the

99
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:12,520
other, then the smaller wavelength at the same frequency has a much slower wave speed.

100
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,160
Now we're going to see something interesting about the nature.

101
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,120
We call the period of the wave is what the time is between individual cycles.

102
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,680
So in terms of the speed of light, the speed of light is a constant in vacuum.

103
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,240
It only has one speed.

104
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,680
There is no other speed to light.

105
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,960
Maybe there is not existing, meaning there is no light, or it's going this speed, which

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
is very interesting.

107
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,200
There's no acceleration or deceleration to light.

108
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,800
Light just simply goes at this speed, the speed of light, which is just shy of 300,000

109
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,320
kilometers per second, or just shy of 186,000 miles per second.

110
00:06:52,320 --> 00:07:01,640
But specifically, it's 299,792.458 kilometers per second, which is a very fast speed.

111
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,000
That means it gets to the moon and back in two seconds.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,920
That's why those pings in the Apollo missions, where they have that little ping sound, because

113
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,840
it's rude to talk over people and you actually want to know, so you send the ping, they say,

114
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,440
I'm done with transmission, because it takes a second for the light transmission to get

115
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
from the earth to the moon.

116
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,440
And that's why they had the ping sound at the end of the Apollo mission transmissions

117
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,840
when they were talking back and forth between the moon and Houston.

118
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
So what does that mean?

119
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:34,680
If you have the speed of light being a constant, then the product of the frequency times the

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,960
wavelength gives you the speed.

121
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,120
All right, so if the speed's always the same, then if you have a long wavelength, you have

122
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,440
a short frequency.

123
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,080
And if you have a short wavelength, you have a high frequency.

124
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,120
And so they're inversely related.

125
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,240
Because the speed of light is a constant.

126
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,480
So once again, if you have a very small wavelength, lambda, which is typically what we use for

127
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,400
wavelength, then you must have a very, very, very high frequency in order to maintain that

128
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
speed.

129
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,800
And if you have a very low frequency, then you must have a very long wavelength, and

130
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,400
those are radio waves.

131
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,600
The other one are gamma rays.

132
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,200
So light goes in all sorts of flavors, but it all travels at exactly the same speed.

133
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,480
All right, so how do we know what the speed of light is?

134
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,600
Well, the speed of light, as we discussed in a previous lecture, was first investigated

135
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,280
or at least investigated in many ways.

136
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,360
But Oli Romer looked about it by looking at the timing, the timing, the transits of Iowa

137
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,760
across Jupiter over a long period of time, over many months, and actually noticing that

138
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,640
the times that it was expected to be were wrong.

139
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,960
But another more direct way to do it is with Fissot, who actually used mirrors on tops

140
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,600
of mountains, and actually bounced light all the way across and through a rotating tooth

141
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
wheel.

142
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
The tooth wheel spun and spun and spun, and as the light passed through the wheel and

143
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:04,240
bounced off the mirror and came back, it had to make that trip while the wheel was rotating,

144
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,520
and the light had to come back through the same tooth it left or else it would be blurred.

145
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:15,920
So Fissot made it a pulsing beam, and that pulsed beam had to have the same speed as

146
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,280
the light going through it or else it would get blocked.

147
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,880
And so you either get blocked light or you would let it through, and how you determined

148
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,120
the speed of light was how fast was the gear, how fast was the rotary wheel turning, what's

149
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,760
the length of space between the teeth, and so you could say, well, how long did it take

150
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,840
for light to go all the way down and back such that you don't get a distortion, you

151
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,760
don't get a blurred view, and that's one way of determining it, how fast the wheel is rotating

152
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,240
and the size that it's rotating through.

153
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,800
In any event, the wave nature of light was determined because you can actually say, well,

154
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,720
what are some features of wave light, is that light diffracts around boundaries, just like

155
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,960
water waves do.

156
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,760
So when water hits a boundary like a jetty, it curves around that jetty, it doesn't actually

157
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,800
stop, it doesn't go around it, when it goes past it, it doesn't not go around it.

158
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,200
You don't see waves not propagating.

159
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,400
Waves have a way of actually spreading out, and so they don't stay trained on one place,

160
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,400
they just spread out until they thin out across their breath, if it's a water wave, but in

161
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,480
terms of like a jetty going around, as soon as it passes the jetty, it starts to spread

162
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,400
back out around the jetty.

163
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,880
In any event, you can have multiple, you can have interferences of waves where waves can

164
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,960
constructively interfere and destructively interfere, and if the waves constructively

165
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,780
interfere, that means the two waves merge together, and if their peaks match at a given

166
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,200
place in space, then they add together.

167
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,560
If their peaks are counter, if one wave's peak matches another, the same wavelength's

168
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,520
waves trough, then they cancel out.

169
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,880
So you can either have what's called interfering constructively, meaning they add together,

170
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,600
or they can destructively interfere and subtract from each other.

171
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,480
The waves superimpose and add to each other, and the trough acts like a negative number,

172
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,440
and the peak acts like a positive number, so if it's a wave height of two, and the other

173
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,040
wave height is two, and they happen to be at the same place, that the peaks are at the

174
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,440
same place at the same time, then the wave height is not four, but if the trough is at

175
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,200
the same place as a peak, then the wave height is zero and it's flat.

176
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,080
So you can't have waves passing through each other and not make a noise.

177
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,760
It's kind of a weird thought, but it can happen.

178
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,760
So constructive and destructive wave interference can be seen pretty easily.

179
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,600
If you look at it trough two stones in a puddle of water, you can see two outbound ripples.

180
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,520
It helps to have some nice sunshine, so you can actually point out the troughs in the

181
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,840
water and the peaks in the water, and it's pretty easy to see as you dry it out at home,

182
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
because it's like, what the heck?

183
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Everybody's got puddles of water around them, maybe something deep, and you can see the

184
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,720
reflection of water on it and see the constructive and destructive interference.

185
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,320
Another thing to look at is back in 1901 or so, or the early part of the 20th century.

186
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,800
Young did a, what is it, famous double slit experiment where he put a slit inside a barrier

187
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,640
to make an image of a slit as a single, as a single sort of, as a single source, and then

188
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,800
allowed that image of that slit then to spread out, because light spreads out from a source,

189
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,600
diffractively, to impact on two other slits.

190
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:48,560
And those two other slits then, they each act as sources, but those sources, then the,

191
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:56,400
what we see on the far side, are a constructive and destructive interference pattern on the,

192
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,680
on the far side of it.

193
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,440
So you have a source, a continuous source, going through a slit, that slit then goes

194
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,520
through a double slit, and that double slit then makes constructive and destructive interference

195
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,340
patterns, which can only occur if light is doing a, is light has wave properties.

196
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,760
So Young's experiment actually proved that light actually did have wave properties.

197
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,080
So what are some effects of wave properties?

198
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,960
Well, let's say you were moving towards or away from something.

199
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,380
We've always heard of the nature of the, the nature of wave properties.

200
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,640
So let's say you're going to see a Doppler effect, and Doppler effects occur, because

201
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,720
let's say you see a car driving towards you, and it's honking its horn, the pitch will

202
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,040
be slightly increased as the car is driving towards you.

203
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,480
And if it's driving away from you, the pitch will be slightly decreased.

204
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,640
And I had the benefit of going to the Indy 500 a long time ago with my good friend and

205
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,560
best man for my wedding, Ralph Hater.

206
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,840
And Ralph got tickets for us to go see it.

207
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,080
And you could really hear the effect of the Doppler effect as the cars went, flew by you.

208
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
You know, okay.

209
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,080
So just to say it, when cars in the Indy 500 are driving, they're these little things,

210
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
and they're extremely loud.

211
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,240
They go, oh, right.

212
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
They're driving like that.

213
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,760
They're really fast.

214
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Really fast.

215
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,120
Now that sound, is what you hear if you're inside the car.

216
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,220
Now what do you hear when you're seeing them go by in the track?

217
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,920
What you hear is, that's what you hear.

218
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,400
Now inside the car, it's, because that's the sound of the engine.

219
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,960
They're really whining.

220
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:30,220
But outside you hear, as it approaches you, and then as it goes by you and the pitch changes.

221
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,420
So the wavelength of the sound changes to the observer.

222
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,940
So I'm the observer, sitting on the stands in the fourth row above, the little finish

223
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,740
line going, yay, there's the cars.

224
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,540
And I hear this sound, and everybody who's ever watched these kind of things has seen

225
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,540
and heard this sound.

226
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,100
It's a really cool sound.

227
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,140
In any event, that's the Doppler effect, which is the change in wavelength or frequency

228
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:56,940
as a result of a movement of the source towards you or away from you.

229
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,660
So the Doppler effect is just that.

230
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,820
You have the true wavelength, which is all inside the car, the sound of the engine.

231
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,060
But then there is the perceived wavelength or the apparent wavelength, which depends

232
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,420
on the relative motion of the source.

233
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,540
So the faster something goes by you or towards you or away from you, the greater the Doppler

234
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,660
effect is.

235
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,700
So that's all dependent upon both the speed with which it's moving and the speed with

236
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,020
which the wave travels, the sound wave.

237
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,780
So for light, we have a slightly different thing, but it works the same way because light

238
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,100
has a wavelength.

239
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,940
So if it has a wavelength, then we can see if there's a Doppler shift and there is.

240
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:44,780
So light has a wavelength, and there's a certain wavelength at which the light is emitted,

241
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,740
and there's a certain wavelength at which the light is received.

242
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:57,540
So if I were to actually take a red light, maybe it's 6,500 nanometers in wavelength,

243
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,140
maybe that's the wavelength I'm looking at.

244
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,660
And that wavelength source of light, which by the way would be a cloud of hydrogen gas,

245
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,820
if that wavelength of light is traveling towards me, or actually, let's say it's moving away,

246
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:15,300
if it's going away from me at, say, 90% the speed of light or maybe 80% just to keep it

247
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,100
easy.

248
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:23,140
If the light was going away from us at 80% the speed of light, then the total wavelength

249
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:29,540
change would actually change the wavelength to almost twice its wavelength, almost twice.

250
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:37,180
So it would be well into the infrared, roughly about 1200 nanometers, as opposed to about

251
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,540
600 nanometers.

252
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,900
So it would be well into the infrared, and you wouldn't be able to see it.

253
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,140
So if something's emitting, if it's a hydrogen class gas, and it's rushing away from you,

254
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,740
whatever reasons, hot hydrogen rushing away from you at 80% the speed of light, normally,

255
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,580
if we're still, you could see it.

256
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,540
But if it's rushing away from you that fast, then the light gets redshifted down to the

257
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,380
infrared, and you have to use infrared to see it.

258
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,340
That would be important when we're talking about the big bang, but in any event, Doppler

259
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:07,140
shift is important in light because if the source is moving, then there is a Doppler shift.

260
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:12,100
And that occurs in every direction, you can have a slightly change of a version away from

261
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
it.

262
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:19,380
If you're looking at it from the side, there's a part of the motion that's towards you changes

263
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
it.

264
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,220
So effectively, the light bunches up in the direction of it that it's going, changing

265
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,540
the frequency to a higher frequency, and gets stretched out away from the source, as if

266
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,220
from things behind it.

267
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,620
In any event, there are four wavelengths of light, like it shifts up.

268
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,420
But the important thing about the Doppler shift with respect to, let's say, that cloud

269
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,380
of hydrogen gas I was talking about, is that all the wavelengths get shifted by the exact

270
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,420
same proportion.

271
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:56,500
So the spacing between the wavelengths, that is not dependent on the speed.

272
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,060
So the pattern stays the same.

273
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,100
It just gets shifted by the same amount, either blue shifted, meaning if it's going to shorter

274
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,620
wavelength, or redshifted, it's going to a longer wavelength.

275
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:12,060
And if something's receding at, like, say, 1% the speed of light, if it's receding, then

276
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,580
it'll be slightly redshifted.

277
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,500
If it's if it's running towards you, approaching at a much faster rate, maybe twice, 2% the

278
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,780
speed of light, then it'll be much greater.

279
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:29,220
But on every case, all of the emission is simply just shifted by that same amount to

280
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,380
the left or to the right.

281
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,420
By the same amount.

282
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,220
And they don't get stretched out or pulled out in any direction.

283
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,220
All right.

284
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,100
Where can we measure this?

285
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,700
I just said gas cloud, hydrogen, rushing away.

286
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Well, you know, what if it's rotating?

287
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,340
Let's say you've got some rotating glowing object.

288
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,460
If it's rotating and glowing, then the side that's rotating, maybe a big, hot, glowing

289
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
ball.

290
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
That's kind of weird.

291
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,780
Big, hot, glowing ball rotating really fast.

292
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,980
When it's rotating really fast, the side that's approaching you would be blue shifted.

293
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,500
And the side that's retreating away from you would be redshifted.

294
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,260
And so you can have a Doppler shift on a big, hot, rotating ball of gas, maybe a superfast

295
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:12,180
rotating star or something, or even a moderately rotating star can do, can show a Doppler shift.

296
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,780
In fact, the sun shows a slight Doppler shift from at physical wavelengths, but you got

297
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,820
to be really sensitive to see it.

298
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,260
If you have two stars that are orbiting each other and they're part of a binary system,

299
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,660
then those two stars then also show this Doppler shift because, hey, maybe one of them is approaching

300
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,740
and one of them is receding.

301
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,260
So all of the spectral features of the star that's approaching you get shifted to the

302
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,380
blue, and all the star features of the spectral features of the star that's receding away

303
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,060
from you get shifted to the red, and then they swap back and forth as one's retreating

304
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,300
and one's retreating, and the other's retreating and the other's receding.

305
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,060
So that's another thing.

306
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,380
Look for binaries that do this.

307
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,540
And finally, as the earth goes around the sun.

308
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,860
What's even very interesting is that there's a slight Doppler shift as the earth goes around

309
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,220
the sun with respect to all of the stars in the sky.

310
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,980
So that's a very small amount, and that has to be taken into account if you're being very

311
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,460
sensitive with respect to spectroscopy.

312
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,620
So the earth's motion around the sun can cause a Doppler shift in stars.

313
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,460
All right, so is it real?

314
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,460
What's real speed?

315
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,460
So what's the real speed?

316
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,100
I mean, I know I'm going fast with respect to you, but what's the real speed?

317
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
What's my real speed?

318
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,740
Well, there is no real speed.

319
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,340
There's only relative speed.

320
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,820
The Doppler shift only carries about relative speed.

321
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,460
There is no absolute speed, meaning, okay, if I could find my reference frame such that

322
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,980
I'm going the absolute speed, then everything is going to be fine.

323
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,100
That sounds like something you might hear about in a comic book, maybe.

324
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,740
It's like, oh, I'm going the absolute speed, kind of a flash thing or something.

325
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,540
So you're going at absolute speed, but there is no absolute speed.

326
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,460
That's an odd thought, but there is one absolute speed, the speed of light, but that's the

327
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,460
speed that the light's going, and it only goes that speed.

328
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,820
So that's kind of a weird thing.

329
00:20:52,820 --> 00:21:04,220
So there's really no such thing as a true speed, meaning the speed with respect to the

330
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,180
space and time, because all space and time is relative.

331
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,660
So you have to measure Doppler shift with respect to your speed with respect to the

332
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,540
source or the observer, and if one's moving, the other one could be moving in exactly the

333
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,540
same way.

334
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,780
In the same sense that the Doppler shift would occur if in the Indy 500, everybody in the

335
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:30,620
Indy 500 stands were simply moving by the car, and the car was standing still.

336
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,420
The Doppler shift would still occur for the people in the stands.

337
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,420
That would be very jarring to realize that the car is standing still in the entire city

338
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:45,020
of Indianapolis is moving, but it would have the same effect in terms of the Doppler effect.

339
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
All right.

340
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,740
So we're moving by the wave nature of light, and what do we get out of it?

341
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,860
And one of the nice things that we see is that you get pretty rainbows, and pretty rainbows

342
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:59,500
are part of the wave nature of light, because as light enters a prism, the speed of light

343
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:07,500
changes, and in a prism, in glass, the speed of light is a function of wavelength and frequency.

344
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,660
So the blue light is bent more than the red light, and so there is a frequency dependence,

345
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:19,220
and so the light spreads out as it passes from air into glass, and then from glass back

346
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,220
into air, the change in medium, actually, because it goes through the glass, it actually

347
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,180
gets spread out by the glass.

348
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:30,660
Anyway, our most important thing is the pretty rainbows that are caused by water droplets

349
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:36,580
in the air, or by pretty prisms hanging in your window, is that the visible spectrum,

350
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,260
the visible spectrum, that which we can see is called the visible electromagnetic spectrum,

351
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,940
and the visible electromagnetic spectrum is roughly between about 4,000 angstroms and

352
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:52,380
about 7,000 angstroms, or 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers, and it spans from the violet

353
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,700
all the way through the deep, deep red.

354
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,460
And if it's shorter wavelength than violet, we call it ultraviolet, and if it's longer

355
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,700
wavelength than red, we call it infrared, and their frequencies are very high, they're

356
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,900
on the order of 10 to the 14th cycles per second.

357
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,620
But the wavelengths, let's look at it with the wavelengths for just a second, 400 to 700

358
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,900
nanometers.

359
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,620
We already know that there's wave properties that about light, and since light has wave

360
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,620
properties, it does diffraction.

361
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,340
So why don't we see diffraction everywhere?

362
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:29,740
Why isn't everything fuzzy, because waves of light are, which should make things fuzzy?

363
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:35,220
I mean, we have eyes, and as light enters our eyes, it's an aperture, and the aperture

364
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,500
then means that inside your eye, the light must spread out, so why isn't everything

365
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
all fuzzy?

366
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,340
Well, because the wavelength is very small with respect to the aperture of your iris

367
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
of your eyeball.

368
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,220
So your iris of your eyeball is a couple of millimeters, right, it's a few millimeters.

369
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:55,220
That's really big compared to nanometers.

370
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:01,420
So there's an order of tens of thousands of them, so if you're looking at 700 nanometers

371
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:07,820
or 500 nanometers, let's keep it simple, and that's many thousands of times smaller

372
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,260
than the aperture size of your iris.

373
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:16,140
And so waves don't really notice the diffraction, so the diffraction effects are not very noticeable.

374
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,740
However, if you wish to see them, take this little experiment, take two of your fingers

375
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,420
together like this, and just barely close them, so there's just a tiny bit of light

376
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,820
between them, hold them close together, so there's just a little bit of light, and bring

377
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,640
it close to your eye and look at some bright light source, and you'll see in between your

378
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,300
fingers dark and light bands, that's some diffraction patterns happening because of

379
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,420
the diffraction around the edges of your fingers, so it's really kind of pretty, you can see

380
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,380
that with just your fingers.

381
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,780
Alright, so the fun thing is that the light comes in frequencies and wavelengths, and

382
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:53,820
packets of light called photons do that, and that's what we call light.

383
00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:01,060
Now, here's the funny thing, because individual packets of light called photons have individual

384
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:06,260
frequencies, then there's really no such thing as color.

385
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,140
Color is a construct, it's a biological construct in your brain.

386
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,780
What does that mean?

387
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:19,980
Well it means that there are cells in your eye which are receptive to certain ranges

388
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,460
of color, and if they're receptive to say maybe 50 nanometers from say 500 nanometers

389
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:33,260
to 550 nanometers, maybe that's the sensitivity of that cell in your retina, in your eye,

390
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,700
and the rods and cones in your eye are receptive to many wavelength bands, and so if you can

391
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,500
see many, many colors, and you are gifted to see many colors, then you have lots of

392
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,260
different sensors, and they're very fine, and they can see lots of different things,

393
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:50,740
and you have lots of ways that the very narrow bands of frequencies to which these cells

394
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,260
are sensitive.

395
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,900
So your brain then takes this information as the cells are fired off by the light, and

396
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,420
they say, oh I can see this, I get a photon, I get a photon, I get a photon, but then your

397
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,940
brain then says, ooh, that's the cell that makes purple, that's the cell that makes green,

398
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,260
that's the cell that makes red, and where'd you get those words from?

399
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,820
Those words came from what everybody called that thing that we call red, and that redness

400
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,620
is what we culturally call red, isn't that interesting?

401
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:29,020
So color is in your brain, you construct it because you add photons inside of a filtered

402
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:35,460
frequency receptor, and that receptor is called a cell, and the cells can see lots of different

403
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,500
bands, and it's the difference in brightness between your yellow receptors and your blue

404
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,620
receptors, or your blue receptors and your red receptors that tells you what the color

405
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,620
is.

406
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,500
If your red receptors are really firing off and your blue receptors are not, then you'll

407
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,660
call it red.

408
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,100
If your green receptors are firing off and neither of the other two are, then you'll call

409
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,260
it green.

410
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,860
That's how color works, and we call that thing green.

411
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,660
Now people who are colorblind, their blue receptors and green receptors are fired equally,

412
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,140
so you can't tell the difference, and that's kind of a sad thing for them because they

413
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,580
go, what the heck is that?

414
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,300
I don't see green, I don't see blue.

415
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,980
I just see kind of a gray, and that's what people who've got with their colorblindness,

416
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,340
they can't tell the difference between the colors.

417
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,060
All right, so that's pretty good.

418
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,740
We'll see you next time.

419
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:26,700
Hi, this is Jason Kendall, and welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.

420
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,460
We're still talking about light.

421
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,340
Light, what the heck is that stuff, light?

422
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:37,980
Light is, well, the thing that we see things with, so we want to know exactly how light

423
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,580
does what it does.

424
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,020
Last time we reviewed the concept of the speed of light, we reviewed the concept of Doppler

425
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:48,740
shift, we reviewed the concept of what the electromagnetic spectrum is and how it varies

426
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,100
with wavelength and what visible light is, we didn't say what it was, and how it's

427
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
creative.

428
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,300
It's kind of weird.

429
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,580
We know that it has these wave properties and it acts like a wave, but what makes it

430
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,780
act like a wave, and exactly what is it?

431
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,140
Well, to understand that, we need to know how light is created.

432
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,940
So let's take an example.

433
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,820
How does matter create light?

434
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,580
Hmm, that's an interesting question.

435
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,780
Let's start and go back and say, well, we've talked about Maxwell's laws and the nature

436
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,580
of electromagnetic interactions, but we also talked about the nature of fundamental particles,

437
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:30,700
like electrons and protons, and electron and proton has a charge, like an electric charge.

438
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:36,540
A proton is how the electric charge is distributed inside it, it has quarks inside it, but really

439
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,940
from the outside far enough away, meaning about 10 to the minus 10th meters, it looks

440
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,660
like a point charge with a plus sign, and that's pluses by convention.

441
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
We just call it a plus.

442
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,660
It could be a minus, it could be a plus.

443
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,660
It doesn't really matter.

444
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,620
It's just what we call it.

445
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,100
But then the electron has the exact opposite charge, the same exact amount, but exactly

446
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,140
this different, exactly opposite sign.

447
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:06,500
So two like charges, plus plus, will repel each other, and two opposite charges will

448
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,700
attract each other, and that's the nature of it.

449
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,660
But what do we mean by charges, and why do they retell each other, and what's going on?

450
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:19,980
Well, let's think about this concept, an incredibly important concept to all of physics, and in

451
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,220
fact, the incredibly important concept to the element of what we call electromagnetism

452
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,300
is the idea of an electric field.

453
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:36,260
An electric field is the influence in space by an electric charge to everything around

454
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,620
it, and it doesn't have a limit.

455
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,060
It just keeps going.

456
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
There's no limit.

457
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,820
It's just its intensity drops off as the distance squared, but there's no real like limit where

458
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,460
it says, well, now I'm done, and it stops, and it's the end of the line.

459
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:59,060
So really, this picture of an atom that is out there, or a plus charge that sits there,

460
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,180
and that plus charge just has these, what we call field lines.

461
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:11,020
And if you place something, say another plus charge at a location on a field line, the total

462
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:17,580
number or density of field lines at that location determines how much it's getting pushed away.

463
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:23,940
So the field says, give me a test charge, I'll tell you what force I'm going to exert

464
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,980
on another due to the charge at the source.

465
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:36,140
So I placed a little test charge at the field line, and we can place another test charge,

466
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,740
maybe one's plus, one's minus, but if it's plus, it gets pushed away, and if it's minus,

467
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,980
it gets attracted towards it.

468
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:50,180
So the field lines also determine the direction of motion that the test charge will go.

469
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,020
And from a plus charge, we can think of it as being outbound, and a minus charge, you

470
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,860
can be considered inbound, and by convention, it doesn't really matter what direction, but

471
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,340
we can just do it that way.

472
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,900
So a plus charge, if you place another plus charge on a field in an electric field next

473
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,820
to a plus charge, and the test charge is very tiny, so incredibly tiny or positive to be

474
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,940
tiny, that it actually is the thing that's moved and not the source because they're pushing

475
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
against it.

476
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,740
Remember Newton's equal and opposite forces, one of them just has to be a big enough charge

477
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,740
that it doesn't get affected by the other charges much.

478
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,100
So the test charge can be infinitesimally small.

479
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,220
And then it just gets rocketed out on those field lines, and it goes very, very far away.

480
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,540
But if you place it closer, then the field lines are denser, and that means it gets a

481
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,340
harder push.

482
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,540
And if it's an electric, if it's a negative charge, then it'll be attracted in the same

483
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,540
way.

484
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,660
Not as much if it's far, and the closer you put it, the more attraction it shall be.

485
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:51,980
So it gains energy as they fall towards each other because they're pulling on each other,

486
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,980
and the closer they are, the harder they pull each other because the force of attraction

487
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:04,020
is increased as their distance is made small, and the force of attraction or repulsion is

488
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,700
decreased as they're farther and farther apart.

489
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:14,180
And so at some point, they can be so far apart that the electrostatic or electromagnetic

490
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:20,500
force between them, the electrostatic force between them, can be minuscule and not taken

491
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
into account.

492
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,980
However, if you have loose charges around there, they really true, the electric force

493
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,460
is very strong, and it's going to really try to actually make it so that they charges

494
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
get neutral.

495
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,580
In any event, opposites attract, light charges repel.

496
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,980
And if you've got one, you've got the other.

497
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,420
So that's really what we're talking about.

498
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:43,060
So plus charges repel against plus charges, and minus charges repel against minus charges.

499
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,220
Protons have a plus charge, electrons have a negative charge, they have exactly the same

500
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,020
amount of charge, they're just opposite and equal magnitude.

501
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,540
The electron has a much smaller mass, the proton has a much larger mass than the electron.

502
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:01,900
So the proton tends to stay still where the electron tends to whizz about.

503
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:08,820
All right, so distant charges feel the effect of other charges.

504
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,420
So all charges feel the effect of the other charges through the electric field that they

505
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,660
generate.

506
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:21,300
So really space is permeated by the electric field due to charges.

507
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,300
And if they're all standing still, all these electric fields don't move, they're just kind

508
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
of sitting there.

509
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,340
If everybody's held in place, they're all pinned down, let's say all the charges in

510
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,220
the universe are pinned to one place.

511
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,460
To wherever they're at, doesn't matter where they're at, they're just pinned.

512
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,980
Then everything will be pushing on it, but then they're pinned down so they can't move,

513
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,460
but they're pushing with the electric field, or they're pulling depending on their charges

514
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,620
or the signs of their charges, and that tells us how they're going to move.

515
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,940
All right, now let's do something very strange.

516
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,740
We then jiggle one of them.

517
00:33:52,740 --> 00:34:01,260
If we jiggle them, then the field must change, and how does the field change?

518
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,060
The field may change in a regular way.

519
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:12,100
Let's say you instead somehow take an electron and put it between, let's say you staple it

520
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:17,140
between two springs, and if it's between two springs, it might go up and down between

521
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:21,420
the two springs, or it's stapled between two boards on two springs, and so it can go up

522
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,420
and down.

523
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,340
And as long as you don't touch it, it's not going to vibrate, just like anything that's

524
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,740
held by two strings between two boards, right?

525
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:33,100
But if you come along and flick it, then the electron will bounce up and down, right?

526
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,940
Now if the electron has an electric field that's associated with it, and the electric

527
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,740
field is inbound by convention, and the field lines are drawing towards it, so let's use

528
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,740
a proton.

529
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,740
So this outbound, I like the outbound errors.

530
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,420
So a proton is stapled, and it's held between these two springs, between the two boards,

531
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
and you kick it.

532
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,420
Now it's going up and down.

533
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,140
And if it's just going up and down, bouncing up and down like this, what do we notice?

534
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:02,860
The field doesn't stay fixed in space, the field follows the proton.

535
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:08,940
So the proton was here, and the field radiates out from wherever the proton is at that moment.

536
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,740
So then the way, some of the field lines, aren't fixed in space.

537
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,740
They're moving.

538
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,140
They have to be moving up and down.

539
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
Wait a second.

540
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,940
If you make something move up and down, then you've got a wave.

541
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,780
Now what happens to that?

542
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:30,300
Well then there's a disturbance in, or disturbance, or a wave motion of up and down of the proton.

543
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,980
So now the electric field is going up and down.

544
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,500
Now how long does it take for something very far away, a distant charge to feel it?

545
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Huh.

546
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:46,700
Well, those changes in the electric field propagate at a particular speed, the speed

547
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,640
of light.

548
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,720
So really, what is light?

549
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,240
Light is a disturbance in the electric field of a charge particle that makes a disturbance.

550
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,540
It vibrates, it moves, it accelerates, it changes.

551
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:07,560
And as it changes, the electric field disturbs and that disturbance propagates along.

552
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,440
That disturbance is called a photon.

553
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,520
That's light.

554
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,720
Light is that disturbance.

555
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,960
Now why doesn't it propagate forever, like these vibrating strings that we see, or like

556
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,560
you can pluck a string and have a standing wave?

557
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:27,040
Well photons propagate from here to there in the same way that if you take a jump rope

558
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,800
and you flick the jump rope, when you flick the jump rope, it bounces.

559
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,360
And if the jump rope bounces, then you see the pulse go up down the jump rope and the

560
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,560
pulse comes back from the jump rope.

561
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,240
Now you can make it so there's a nice regular pattern to it.

562
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,360
You can do double dutch by having two of the jump ropes go around.

563
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,840
You can make it have a nice even string where you have wave patterns in the rope.

564
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,440
But really, if you flick the rope, then the disturbance goes down the rope and back the

565
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,600
rope.

566
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:01,040
And that disturbance in the electric field line, as it propagates due to the previous

567
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,880
motion of the proton, is what the photon is.

568
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,520
It's a disturbance in that electromagnetic field.

569
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,240
That's really something.

570
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,720
So a photon is a disturbed magnetic field that was disturbed, say some time ago, by

571
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,040
a very distant thing, and then that distant thing that propagation of that electric field

572
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,160
from there to here gets to us eventually.

573
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,720
Isn't that weird?

574
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,760
If that's what light is, if that's what light is, and that's probably a very close analogy

575
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:36,280
to what we call it from deep studies of what the nature of space and time are, then light,

576
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,160
when you look at some distant galaxy, maybe millions of light years away, there was some

577
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:49,000
electron that shook, just a tiny electron or a tiny proton, a very, very, very lightweight

578
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,000
object shook, created a disturbance by its shaking that made a disturbance in its electric

579
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
field.

580
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,480
And that electric field disturbance propagated out through space on the electric field of

581
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,360
the proton, and eventually reached your eye three million light years away.

582
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,280
Wow, that's interesting.

583
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,920
So it propagates through space radiatively, carrying the energy of the disturbance that

584
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,800
created it across space, vast to areas of space, as a packet of a disturbance, as a wave

585
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,720
packet, a disturbed wave packet in the electric field lines as it propagates through space.

586
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,720
That's an interesting picture of a photon, and that's what we call that, so that packet

587
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,840
of waves, that disturbance is called a photon.

588
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,080
And electrons don't vibrate forever, protons don't vibrate forever, they take a certain

589
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,120
amount of time and then they stop vibrating, and when it's done vibrating, then guess what?

590
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,320
That's the end of the wave packet train, and there it goes, the photons on its way.

591
00:38:53,360 --> 00:39:00,720
Alright, now that's essentially a very meat and potatoes sort of elementary way of talking

592
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,600
about photons.

593
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,560
Photons have a certain amount of energy, that amount of energy is related to the frequency

594
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,520
or the wavelength, whichever you like to use, in order to say how much energy the photon

595
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
has.

596
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,040
So the wavelength of the photon determines its energy.

597
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,000
The short wavelength photons have high energy, the long wavelength photons have low energy.

598
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The light has long wavelengths, it's low energy.

599
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,240
Gamma ray light has short wavelengths, so it has high energy.

600
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,680
Next because it's a wave motion, and if you do something really interesting, if you take,

601
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,240
because we learn this through electromagnetism, if you go take an electrostatics class, you

602
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,880
learn about Faraday's Law, you learn about the nature of the Beelzebub Art Law, you learn

603
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,960
all these interesting things where if you take a current, take a current of electrons,

604
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,800
which is now an electric flow, a flow of charges, in a circle, make a circular charge

605
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,600
flow, you create a magnetic field, and a magnetic field flows through the charge.

606
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,160
So if you want to start your car, you use what's called a selenoid, and a selenoid is

607
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,480
a many, many, many turns of an electric coil.

608
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,080
You then put a charge back and forth, you change an electric current back and forth

609
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,800
through that selenoid, and it moves a piston that then starts the engine running, and that

610
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,120
forces gasoline into the engine, and then starts the engine up.

611
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:27,120
So you can take an electric force from the battery and do an alternating current through

612
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,600
it that then shakes the selenoid, and shakes it, and it creates an alternating magnetic

613
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,000
field and starts a car.

614
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So an electric field, going in a circular motion, creates a magnetic field.

615
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,240
Likewise, if you take a magnetic field, a fixed magnet, a fixed magnet that has a magnetic

616
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,280
field, like an iron magnet or a bar magnet, and then you spin it, it will create an electric

617
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,520
field.

618
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,080
That's part of the way that we get electricity out of hydroelectric dams.

619
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,720
You create fixed, large bar magnets that then as the water goes over the waterfall, it turns

620
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:13,120
turbines, and the turbines then spin magnets which wrap around coils of wire, and those

621
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:19,160
wires then have an electric current that is created out of them by the twisting, by

622
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,880
the spinning magnetic field.

623
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,200
Wow.

624
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,000
So there's a link between the electric, the motion of an electric field, and the creation

625
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,080
of a magnetic field, and the motion of a magnetic field, and the creation of an electric field.

626
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,520
We've just learned that when you vibrate an atom, you create an electric field.

627
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,560
You always have an electric field, but if you vibrate an atom, then it creates a disturbance

628
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,840
in the electric field that disturbance is called a photon.

629
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:49,000
But if you have it, but remember you're accelerating it, and you then have, if you have any kind

630
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,600
of motion that can be determined to be cyclic with respect to an electric field, then there

631
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,960
is a perpendicular magnetic field to that.

632
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,880
So it is predicted that the photon has a magnetic field that runs perpendicular to the electric

633
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,120
field in the direction of propagation.

634
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,320
And as the magnetic, as the photon propagates maybe with a direction, with a wavelength

635
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,800
like that going in that direction, it will also have a magnetic field that goes this

636
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,680
way as it propagates in that direction.

637
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,520
So electromagnetic fields, magnetic fields are linked to electric fields.

638
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,040
For the earth, that is another example, the earth has a liquid metal iron core, and as

639
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,920
the earth spins, that magnetic, that liquid iron core has a strong magnetic property because

640
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,600
of ferromagnetism, and that creates an electric field, which then creates a magnetic field,

641
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:43,840
and we have a dynamo effect, and thus the earth has a protective magnetic field around

642
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
it.

643
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,520
Really quite interesting.

644
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,880
So magnetic fields are created by the movement of current, and the movement of current creates

645
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,440
magnetic fields, and they're linked.

646
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,320
Alright, and that's the nature of a photon is that oscillating electric fields create

647
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,800
magnetic fields, and the same thing, oscillating magnetic fields creates an electric field.

648
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,640
And as that propagates through time, we call that a photon as well.

649
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,040
So the wave packet of a photon isn't just an electric field, there's also a magnetic

650
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,240
field component to it as well.

651
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,280
So the direction that we call that magnetic field is called polarization.

652
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,520
So the photon might be oriented up and down, the electric field, the vibration might be

653
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,480
like this because of how we shook the proton, it might be going like this.

654
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,320
And so the orientation, the polarization of the light might be in that direction, might

655
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,600
be up and down.

656
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,280
This is also a reason why when you wish to have good sunglasses for the summertime, and

657
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,000
you wish to see the road while you're driving, you use polarized sunglasses, because when

658
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,320
light reflects off the road, it reflects off of a flat surface, and when it reflects off

659
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:50,920
of a flat surface, it bounces off that flat surface, and all the vertical components of

660
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,960
the polarization are gone from the scattered or randomly oriented light in its polarizations

661
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,680
to only having the ones that are parallel to the road.

662
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,240
So all you need to do to have good glasses to drive with, which are called polarizing

663
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,240
sunglasses, is to have something that blocks out the light that goes like this.

664
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,760
And how can you do that?

665
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,520
Not too difficult, you think of a picket fence.

666
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,800
Picket fences, you can throw a Frisbee through on its edge, because the slats are vertical,

667
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,080
and so there's a hole that's vertical between the slats, and you can't throw a Frisbee between

668
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,600
the slats of a picket fence.

669
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,640
However, you can throw it on the angle, throw it on the side through the picket fence, but

670
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,400
not flat through the picket fence.

671
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:40,680
Well, if you wanted to take that principle aside, so polarizing sunglasses are simply

672
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:47,520
very small slats that are printed inside the glass that then block the light, and how can

673
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,520
you see it through it?

674
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:55,400
Because the size of the slats is on the order of the size of the wavelength of light, and

675
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:01,000
so the polarized light that's coming up and down, that's going side to side, is blocked

676
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,120
because all the slats are vertical.

677
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,240
So you get to see only the vertically oriented light, which is minimized because of the reflective

678
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,080
property of the asphalt.

679
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:17,000
So light comes as polarized as well as being electromagnetic, and it has an orientation

680
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,040
to the electric field, an orientation to the magnetic field 90 degrees to the electric

681
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,360
field, it has a direction of motion at the speed of light that we talked about.

682
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,320
So what is light?

683
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:33,000
Light gets emitted in copious quantities by hot objects, by electric fields that are being

684
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:42,080
made by vibrating electrons and protons inside of atoms and molecules, inside of dense objects

685
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:48,880
or inside of hot objects or inside of things that are simply energy, and we see that energy

686
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,720
coming off of them.

687
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,560
So the light's really there, and it's all sorts of different frequencies, and it's

688
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:01,320
all sorts of different wavelengths from very, very high energy to very low energy, and

689
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:06,680
how it propagates from one medium to another, whether it can penetrate a wall or penetrate

690
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,760
only air, or whether it gets absorbed by water, or whether it gets absorbed by nothing and

691
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,840
passes through everything, is all dependent on the properties of the material through

692
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,480
which it passes.

693
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:23,000
So light is everywhere, it bounces around the room, knocking about, and as it hits

694
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,760
a wall, it reflects off.

695
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,880
How does it reflect off a wall?

696
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,760
It goes a little bit in, and it shakes the electron inside of there, and the electron

697
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,400
says, no, I don't think I'll need that sandwich today, and shakes back, and the photon comes

698
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,440
back out.

699
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,840
So really what happens in a reflection is it goes in and gets turned around.

700
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,760
You can think of it as getting trapped in a turn style, the light gets pulled in and

701
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,160
swung around.

702
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,520
It doesn't actually, it gets absorbed very briefly, and then re-radiated back out the

703
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,760
same direction it came.

704
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,600
And these kind of ray tracings were done by Newton a long time ago, so we have predictions,

705
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,080
and in fact quantum electrodynamics actually accurately predicts by some really interesting

706
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:07,160
arguments that I'll leave to Richard Feynman if you go look up at his videos about this,

707
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,560
exactly how that works, which is really fascinating.

708
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,480
You can look that stuff up.

709
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,160
This is not really for an introductory level thing, but you look up at quantum electrodynamics

710
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:21,880
and it'll tell you exactly how the nature of the phase shift of the frequency of light

711
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:30,040
interacts with the phasing, with how the electrons move inside of a material.

712
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:37,080
So it's a very, I won't be able to do it justice in a short video, so I'll just leave it to

713
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,080
others who have done that.

714
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,920
I'll go to Richard Feynman videos, go look his stuff up, it'll be fantastic, you'll love

715
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
it.

716
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,160
But be that as it may, the study of how light actually interacts with material is an incredibly

717
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,200
important element to all of astronomy and all of physics.

718
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:57,600
In fact, it's central because one of our more key ways to understanding the nature of materials

719
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,480
in physics is actually through spectroscopy.

720
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,080
All right, so let's finish with the electromagnetic spectrum.

721
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:09,840
The electromagnetic spectrum is all the possible wavelengths of light.

722
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,200
There are many different wavelength regions from radio to infrared to microwave to visible

723
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,480
to ultraviolet to x-ray to gamma ray and they span an enormous number of wavelengths and

724
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,480
frequencies.

725
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,520
The total number of wavelengths that we call infrared is as I think about almost a thousand

726
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,400
times bigger than what we call visible light and radio light is pretty much everything

727
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,280
shorter and longer than like a centimeter or so.

728
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,800
That light is shorter than 300 nanometers and goes down to a few tens of nanometers

729
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,920
when we get into soft x-rays and soft x-rays go up to angstrom level, go up to single angstrom

730
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:52,720
sizes and even harder when you talk to gamma rays which are on the size scale of 10 to

731
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,320
the minus 12 meters in terms of wavelength.

732
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:01,200
So the higher the energy of the light, the shorter the wavelength and the higher the

733
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:08,360
frequency and there's no real theoretical limit to the lower limit to the wavelength

734
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:13,480
of light but there is kind of a theoretical upper limit to the total energy of light that

735
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,000
can occur in terms of energy because at a certain point the light becomes so energetic

736
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,160
that it can actually fall apart and become other particles like it actually can just

737
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,600
turn into matter if the energy is great enough and that's a study for nuclear physics.

738
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:31,080
So the electromagnetic spectrum is simply all the different forms of light in all their

739
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,240
different wavelengths but the total amount of light and different kinds of light that

740
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:40,280
exist in the electromagnetic spectrum is vast and the best way to, the best analogy

741
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:48,600
for it is look at the keys on a grand piano and if we could only look at the sky in visible

742
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:54,000
light like we had for centuries all the way up through the early 1960s when we finally

743
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,280
got the technology to look at radio light and when we finally launched satellites actually

744
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:05,040
to look at ultraviolet and gamma ray and x-ray and infrared the analogy is almost completely

745
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:10,440
accurate that looking at the light, looking at the universe with only one in the visible

746
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:18,200
range is like playing a piano concerto by only listening to one middle C, one note middle

747
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,360
C on the piano and that's what it's like.

748
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,560
So imagine hearing a gorgeous symphony and somebody, some crazy composer says well this

749
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,640
is a symphony, this is so and so symphony but I've removed all of the notes except for

750
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:36,640
middle C and so you might hear this 25 minute cacop, you might hear this wonderful piano

751
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:43,080
concerto that lasts for half an hour and all you ever hear is when they play middle C.

752
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,280
That's what it's like.

753
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,840
Almost you're missing the whole thing if you don't see in these other wavelengths of light.

754
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:56,920
So the electromagnetic spectrum looks at so many things and we get to see so many more

755
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:03,160
things, so many different processes that occur as a result of it and what are those processes?

756
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:09,240
That's what we'll talk about next time.

757
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,560
Hello this is Jason Kendall welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.

758
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,560
Great to have you back.

759
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,520
We're now going to start diving deeply into technical aspects of astronomy and how they

760
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,240
relate to the physics of astrophysics.

761
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,520
So to this time we're going to be talking about the nature of stellar brightness and

762
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:29,520
luminosity and luminosity distances.

763
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,280
So let's start with the concept of what we mean when we say the words how bright is the

764
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,680
star.

765
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,560
Usually when I take people outside to go to a telescope they're going to say wow look

766
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,560
at that bright star.

767
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,400
What they won't say look how bright that star is, they'll say look how big that star is.

768
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,040
And people mean big but they really mean bright and so what do we actually mean by the word

769
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,040
bright?

770
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,600
And so brightness is a thing that we actually try to quantify.

771
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:58,920
Brightness is an amount of energy we receive in terms of photons per second and given what

772
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:05,240
brightness is and so that can over in a detector such as an eye or a camera or something like

773
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,240
that.

774
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,880
So when we talk about that we're really talking about the nature of brightness is a perception.

775
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,600
But really if we want to know about the nature of the object itself we need to talk about

776
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,640
luminosity.

777
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:23,000
And luminosity is the intrinsic amount of energy the object such as a star is putting

778
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,440
out every second over whatever wavelength band we wish to care about.

779
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,360
So how bright is a luminous a source?

780
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,360
How bright is it?

781
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:36,560
Well that's the number of photons that arrive at a detector and so that's what we call the

782
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,000
apparent brightness.

783
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,200
And frequently in the literature we call that B. Capital big B is the apparent brightness.

784
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:49,680
And what we measure that in is some really odd units but strictly speaking everything

785
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:56,320
that we ever measure brightness in is essentially either photons per second in a surface area

786
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,960
or energy per second in a surface area.

787
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,840
Photons per second we already know what the energy of the photons is so we can just deal

788
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,840
with that.

789
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,600
So our real question is we want to know the energy that we're receiving per second over

790
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,040
a surface area and that's what we call the apparent brightness.

791
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,080
The thing we're trying to hunt for though is what we call the luminosity.

792
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,160
That's how bright something really is.

793
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,000
So we're getting these two words brightness and luminosity a little mixed up but we're

794
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,480
going to resolve that shortly.

795
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,720
Luminosity is the entire luminous output of the star when we say luminous output that's

796
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
where it comes from luminous means light.

797
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,840
So luminous output is the total amount of energy output by a star in the form of light

798
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,840
per second.

799
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,480
Now we can measure that in energy per second or more commonly we use the word watts such

800
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,040
as light bulbs, light bulbs have a 100 watt light bulb or a 500 watt light bulb etc etc.

801
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,160
The sun's a lot brighter than the average light bulb.

802
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,080
So the energy we met, the units we measure luminosity in are energy per second and that's

803
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:02,240
what the production amount of energy is happening by that object.

804
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,080
So these two things are of course related because brightness is how bright you see it

805
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,040
to be and luminosity is what it's actually putting out and how bright it appears to you

806
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:16,760
is actually the depends on the luminosity divided by 4 pi times the distance to the

807
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:21,840
object squared because let's assume that the light is being spread out uniformly across

808
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,920
a sphere such as like a bulb light.

809
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,840
So if it's a bulb light we expect it to be going across a sphere and so it spreads out

810
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:34,760
evenly and so the brightness drops off as the distance squared to the object.

811
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,600
So luminosity gets dimmed by the distance squared so that's where we get the units of

812
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:45,040
energy per second per square meter or watts per square meter if we're using SI standard

813
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,040
units.

814
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,960
And when we're talking about that that's where that 4 pi comes in from it's not just

815
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,120
the distance squared it's the 4 pi because it gets spread out over a surface area and

816
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,640
it drops as it goes.

817
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:01,400
So if something's twice as far it's 4 times as dim, if it's 3 times as far it's 9 times

818
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:07,600
as dim, if it's 5 times as far it's 25 times as dim, if it's 11 times as far it's 121

819
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,760
times as dim and so on.

820
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,080
So the 4 pi comes from the fact that we're assuming it spreads out evenly over the surface

821
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,680
of a sphere.

822
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,180
So what do we mean?

823
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:24,880
Does the star look bright simply because it is intrinsically very luminous or is it faint

824
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,120
but nearby?

825
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:30,640
So we have to measure the distances to things so distances become a very important thing.

826
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,840
Luminosity is not distance dependent is a distance independent property it's a property

827
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,640
of the object itself whereas brightness is dependent upon our perception of it.

828
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,120
So we need to be able to know how to measure brightness and that science is the thing we

829
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,760
call photometry and we express it.

830
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:54,320
Photometry is really the measuring of photons, photometry, the measuring of photons.

831
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,640
So we're counting the total number of photons we receive and there's a couple of ways we

832
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,560
talk about it we can express it in terms of the old familiar thing that we learned from

833
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:08,340
Parkus a long time ago in stellar magnitudes or we can express it in absolute fluxes meaning

834
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:13,120
the energy that we receive in detector per second on top of the surface area.

835
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,400
And in astronomy we use both of them interchangeably.

836
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,520
So the magnitude system is something that you'll hear very commonly if you go outside

837
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,040
with a bunch of amateurs, astronomers say oh up in the sky that's a 5th magnitude star

838
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,040
hour.

839
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,160
This is a great night we can see down to 6th magnitude and you'll hear things like that

840
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,880
or wow the brightest star in the sky is a 0th magnitude star and you'll hear such things.

841
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,960
Well the tradition of magnitudes dates a very long time ago.

842
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:44,440
It comes from Parkus which was a Greek philosopher and he actually of Nicaea and he lived roughly

843
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,160
about roughly roughly in the 2nd century B.C.

844
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:54,320
He lived about 70 years, about 190 B.C. to 120 and he classified stars and ranked them

845
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,400
into magnitudes.

846
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,240
He said the first magnitude star is the brightest, the second magnitude star is the second brightest

847
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,280
and the other ones are dimmer than that so he ranked them into three groups.

848
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:11,320
Later on Ptolemy of the Almagast who gave us the Ptolemaic system of the cosmos which

849
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,680
is the sun centered, Ptolemy came along and made it more qualitative and added them into

850
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,400
six separate buckets so that the magnitudes could be divided into the first magnitude

851
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:26,280
degree all the way down to the sixth brightest stars, sixth magnitude being the sixth brightest

852
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,440
type of stars.

853
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,440
So these were all relative brightnesses and they were done by eye.

854
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:37,160
There's no detectors, there's no photometric detectors, no cameras in 100 B.C.

855
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,200
So that was kind of a tricky thing.

856
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,440
So you had to say well this one's a little bit brighter than that one, this one's brighter

857
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,200
than that one, that one's brighter than this one, this one's brighter than that one.

858
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:48,000
So they ranked them in terms of their parent brightness and that was called their magnitude

859
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,040
system and magnitude simply meant to them it looked bigger because magnitude means size.

860
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,760
So my goodness, it's actually not a size thing, stars are so far away that we can't

861
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,560
actually perceive their size from Earth very easily, only a few stars have actually been

862
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,200
measured in such a way.

863
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,760
But the point is that magnitude means size but here we're using it as a word for brightness

864
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,640
and magnitudes are a measure of relative brightnesses between stars.

865
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,560
Now the modern magnitude system was developed in 1856 by Norman Pogson and Norman Pogson

866
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:27,520
at Oxford who was considered to be, he's also from, he went to India, I believe he was from

867
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,440
India originally and he developed what we call the modern system magnitudes and he codified

868
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,400
this ancient idea of Hipparchus into a separate set of definitions.

869
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:45,880
He said, well every five steps of the stars, every five magnitudes is a set of 100 brightness

870
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,880
in times.

871
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,920
Now he actually was able to quantify this because it's very close to the truth in terms

872
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,720
of the old idea.

873
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,880
So Hipparchus' idea, modified by Ptolemy, was actually very close to the eye and the

874
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:03,040
eye acts logarithmically in terms of their brightnesses that we can measure and so he

875
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,760
said that if a difference in five magnitudes is 100 times brightness.

876
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:12,120
And so he also said the standard star of brightness was Vega which is 0th magnitude.

877
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:17,880
So for example a 9th magnitude star is 100 times brighter than a 4th magnitude star and

878
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:23,480
a 0th magnitude star is 100 times brighter than a 5th magnitude star and so forth and

879
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,480
so on.

880
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,240
So the faintest stars that we can possibly discover with any aspect aren't really necessarily

881
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,800
stars, they're probably galaxies or quasars, that's about 30th magnitude and those have

882
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,920
been detected by the Hubble Space Telescope.

883
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,440
Ground based equipment, the best ground based equipment by amateurs is roughly 15, 16, maybe

884
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,640
18th or 19th magnitude on the ground.

885
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,480
So you can get some pretty faint stuff.

886
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,240
Remember every difference of five is 100 times.

887
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:53,800
So zero magnitude is 100 times brighter than five which is 100 times brighter than 10 which

888
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,440
is 100 times brighter than 15 which is 100 times brighter than 20.

889
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:03,640
So a difference between 0th magnitude and 20th magnitude is 100 times 100 times 100

890
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,760
or 10 to the 8th, that's 100 million times brighter.

891
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:14,000
A 0th magnitude star such as Sirius in the sky is 100 million times brighter than a 20th

892
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,080
magnitude star and there are 20th magnitude stars that have been observed in the Milky

893
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,880
Way, they're just really dim and really far.

894
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,920
Alright, so Poxton's definition can be codified numerically by saying the ratio of the brightness

895
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:32,960
is equals 100 to the difference in magnitudes divided by five and so the difference in five

896
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,440
magnitudes gives us 100 times brightness and that allows us to define the magnitude system

897
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,720
but still it's a relative magnitude system, it's always relative.

898
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,520
What's nice though is that it actually allows us to codify, if we can get the brightness

899
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,600
in energy per second on a surface area we get the brightness of one star and then we

900
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,640
can actually translate brightnesses between each other.

901
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:00,400
This also allows us to roughly guess by eye the brightness of something and then allow

902
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:05,760
us to get very close to what we actually get with some sort of formal detector.

903
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:12,260
Nicely enough, the standard star is Vega and Vega is prominent to most people in the sky

904
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:18,160
and the standard for Vega is a little tweaky because Vega is a variable star but in terms

905
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,880
of things Vega was defined in many magnitude systems to be zero and so you can basically

906
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,280
start from Vega and go everywhere and you compare and compare and compare, oh how am

907
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,560
I to compare to Vega, I'm brighter, I'm dimmer, I'm brighter, I'm dimmer.

908
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:36,040
Vega is useful because it goes across the zenith for most of, for many North American

909
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:41,360
and Northern European and Northern Hemisphere observers, doesn't go across the zenith for

910
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,000
people in the South Hemisphere so they got to use secondary standards of some kind because

911
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,640
the entire system has been centered around Northern Hemisphere so we can codify that

912
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:55,760
and so basically we can say the star compared to Vega's brightness could be 100 to the stellar

913
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,680
magnitude divided by five and that allows us to actually compare a star's brightness

914
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,840
with respect to Vega and give us a numeric value.

915
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:10,200
If somehow you can get the energy received per second at Vega, from Vega as you can perceive

916
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,520
the energy per second on top of the surface area, that gives you that thing.

917
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:19,160
Now you can do that both ways because your detector detects in energy per second, that's

918
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,960
how it detects so you're going to translate this into magnitude so magnitudes tend to

919
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,560
be a pretty handy system because they're something visual, also they're logarithmic.

920
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:32,760
So therefore the apparent magnitude system ranges from negative 30 which is, well negative

921
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,200
30 which is roughly around the sun, the sun's a little bit dimmer than negative 30 but the

922
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,760
apparent magnitude of the sun is negative 27, goes all the way to full moon which is

923
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,040
about negative 12 and a half or so.

924
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:49,640
Naked eye limit is about six, binoculars go down to about 10, the typical one meter scope

925
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:55,480
is around magnitude 18 or 20 and anything bigger than the meter class scope, that's

926
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,480
almost out of amateur astronomy land.

927
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,360
There are some amateurs who have bigger scopes than this, there's not many of them, they're

928
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,680
expensive equipment to use and work with but with them we're talking in terms of large

929
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:10,560
scale observational qualities and you get to four meter class scopes which can observe

930
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:15,560
down to 26 magnitude and the Hubble that can observe to about 30th magnitude.

931
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:21,280
So the science of flux photometry and what we call flux, not the flux capacitor from

932
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:27,840
back to the future, what flux photometry is the total amount of energy, meaning flux,

933
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:33,320
flux is another name for brightness, is the total flux that we perceive on top of, through

934
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,280
a detector.

935
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,360
Sometimes you wish to use fluence where fluence is the total amount of energy, not just energy

936
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:44,800
per second but total energy on a detector, so it's energy per second and that's been

937
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,600
integrated over time, you know what we call the fluids.

938
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:52,800
So flux photometry says I'm going to measure the brightnesses between various stars using

939
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,680
various standards and I'm going to use a filter wheel on top of this thing and check the differences

940
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,520
of brightness between various filters and then I'm going to start from Vega or whatever

941
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,840
standard stars I have perhaps or anything in the land ults that will send me over to

942
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,360
brightnesses of stars.

943
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:14,600
So the science of flux photometry then says good, I'm going to try to get these brightnesses

944
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:22,920
as accurately as I can and I'm going to difference them against known standard stars or if not

945
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:29,360
this, not Vega, then standard stars are agreed by the entire astronomical community in order

946
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,320
to say this is how bright a star is with respect to this.

947
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:38,320
So these standard stars have had their energy output carefully measured and repeatedly measured

948
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:43,000
for non-variability so they can be called standard stars and that's how Vega was discovered

949
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,160
to be a variable star, it's a slightly variable star so it's harder to use.

950
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:50,920
The sun is a slightly variable star in terms of if you were looking at it from a distance,

951
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,000
in fact it is a variable star.

952
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,560
So we have to take into many accounts when we're doing the science of flux photometry,

953
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,680
we have to detect whether or not there's clouds in the sky, how high the object is in the

954
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:09,600
sky, where there's a lot of things, the detector itself, how your camera works, how your telescope

955
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,400
works, whether or not you have, the readout of your camera is good or bad, the temperature

956
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:21,040
of your system, there's a whole bunch of things that can affect the brightness of your measurement.

957
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:25,640
So that's for another day and I'll allow you to go dig around the internet to walk down

958
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:31,680
that very deep rabbit hole to see what you have to do in order to calibrate to your telescope.

959
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:38,680
But in very general terms we can then say the luminosity of an object measured through

960
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,200
some brightness.

961
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,680
So is simply equal to 4 pi times the distance squared to the object times that brightness

962
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:50,480
and you just need two measurements in order to get the actual luminosity.

963
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,240
You need to know the distance and you need to know the brightness.

964
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,320
So if you can get one of those, you can get two of those, brightness is pretty easy, that's

965
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:01,040
just what you get at your detector, but you've got to back play it and remove all the effects

966
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,360
of the earth's atmosphere and many other effects in order to make sure that you actually

967
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,640
get really what you think is the real brightness so you can say oh there's all these things

968
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:13,360
that took away light darn it and you take that into account and then you'll get the

969
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,600
brightness outside your detector and outside the atmosphere and then you get a distance

970
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,600
measurement and guess what you'll have the luminosity.

971
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,920
So a lot of practical issues associated with this is a huge number.

972
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,360
The largest thing I describe many of them to you but one of the biggest is distance.

973
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,360
Distance, distance, distance.

974
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:36,360
Oh that's the worst thing in the world but a lot of distances can be measured using parallax

975
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:42,800
and so parallax gets by the Haparco satellite in the early 90s got the distances to about

976
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,760
100,000 stars and the Gaia mission recently got distances to over a few billion stars.

977
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,160
So this is a big, big, big improvement so using these distances will allow us to get secondary

978
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:58,480
things such as luminosities based upon appearances that can be seen without checking distance.

979
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,480
So distances are incredibly critical and once we get those things there's a lot of things

980
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,600
to go and luckily the Gaia mission has done a lot of that so this is fantastic.

981
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:12,920
So luminosity is either measured in watts or in this unit list thing that we will call

982
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,000
absolute magnitudes.

983
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,080
Absolute magnitudes or luminosity in watts, they don't depend on the distance.

984
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:25,460
They almost stars have different absolute and apparent magnitudes meaning the absolute

985
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:30,800
magnitude is different than what we perceive it to be or see it to be and the lower the

986
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:36,960
number the more luminous it is in magnitudes and luminous just as how much light is coming

987
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:37,960
out.

988
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:42,520
So what we'll tend to do is we'll compare two objects luminosities and we see that they're

989
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:46,720
relative to their brightness and the inverse of their distance is squared and that gives

990
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,880
us, that will give us what we're going for.

991
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:55,480
But we can create this concept called the luminosity distance meaning how far is it based on how

992
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,800
bright it is.

993
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,520
So let's take as our example the Sun.

994
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,980
We can measure the Sun to a pretty good accuracy, a very good accuracy, it's roughly 93 million

995
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:04,980
miles.

996
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,080
That's a good accuracy, 150 million kilometers.

997
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,760
So we can use that as a baseline.

998
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:15,760
So if we know the distance to the Sun and if we know the luminosity of the Sun, that's

999
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,240
also very well studied.

1000
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:21,760
So if we got the luminosity of the Sun, we've got the distance to the Sun, we can make brightness

1001
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,880
measurements in the Sun, then that helps us.

1002
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,560
Strictly speaking, we want to go across all wavelengths and that would be called the

1003
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,440
bolometric luminosity, but we'll talk about that maybe later, but I don't think that's

1004
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:33,440
totally critical.

1005
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,040
But that's a real end result, it's a total output.

1006
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:40,120
So we're going to assume that we're going to, we're doing the bolometric luminosity

1007
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,120
in any event.

1008
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,360
So you figure out the brightness of the Sun across the entire spectrum and you know the

1009
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:51,240
distance to it and you know the, then if you can somehow derive the luminosity across

1010
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,760
the entire spectrum, then guess what?

1011
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:58,440
You can use that to find the distance to other stars because if you can guess somehow,

1012
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,920
compare luminosity by hook or crook, maybe there's a way to do that and there is, it's

1013
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,760
called spectroscopic parallax, but we'll talk about that later.

1014
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:10,400
So if you can get the luminosity of the star compared to the Sun or if you can get the

1015
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,920
bright and get the brightness of that star compared to the Sun, then guess what?

1016
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:20,440
You can get the distance to the star and that's called the luminosity distance or the distance

1017
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:25,480
based on a standard object that you can calibrate against and then get the distance based on

1018
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:31,200
how bright you see it to be knowing how bright it actually is.

1019
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:36,040
And the, the standard way we talk about this in astronomy is using a thing called absolute

1020
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:42,200
magnitudes and absolute magnitudes are a pretend concept that actually says pretend you take

1021
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:48,680
every star or every object in the sky and move it close or far to a distance from the

1022
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:55,040
Sun of 10 parsecs, 10 parsecs, 32.6 light years and then how bright does it appear?

1023
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:00,280
Because it's magnitude, it's visual magnitude, it's V magnitude, it's I magnitude.

1024
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:06,040
How bright does it appear when it's brought by magic or hook and crook or just imagination

1025
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,560
to 10 parsecs from home?

1026
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,600
And that's the definition of the absolute magnitude.

1027
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,760
So how can we use this?

1028
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,800
The brightness, we compare the brightness of the Sun and luminosity, we can rearrange

1029
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:21,200
it and to get to say, well, how, if we then say, let's look at one star, just one star,

1030
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:26,800
and if we think, ah, when the star is far, it's dimmer than when it's near.

1031
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:32,280
And if the star, but it's the same luminosity because it's the same star, so the brightness

1032
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,520
only depends upon the distance squared that we have.

1033
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:40,360
So the farther star, it will be compared to the distance, the nearest star squared will

1034
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:44,040
give us, well, that will show us the distance between them.

1035
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:49,780
Remember, brightness is defined to be a difference in magnitudes.

1036
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:53,740
So we're going to use the magnitude system in order to get there.

1037
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:58,300
The brightness versus far is one thing, and then we can equate that to a Pogson's equation

1038
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:03,100
for the magnitudes, and then we get the magnitude of the far star compared to the magnitude

1039
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:06,380
of the near star, and then that gives us the brightness difference.

1040
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:10,460
And we work out to this thing where we find that the difference in magnitudes is equal

1041
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,180
to a logarithm of the brightness.

1042
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:17,660
So a logarithm of the brightness gives a logarithm of the, a logarithm of the brightness, and

1043
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:23,100
therefore, logarithm of the distance gives us the magnitudes.

1044
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:28,500
Now if we can get the distances, we're good, but we've already established one thing.

1045
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,900
It's the same star.

1046
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:34,480
So the magic distance we're going to pretend it is is 10 parsecs.

1047
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:40,420
So if we instead of saying, look at the two magnitudes, we say one of them is the absolute

1048
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:47,060
magnitude, and that is the magnitude if the star, we're magically placed at 10 parsecs

1049
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,060
away.

1050
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:53,340
Then we end up with what's called the distance modulus equation, which says the apparent

1051
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:59,020
magnitude subtract, and then you take the apparent magnitude, they subtract it, subtract

1052
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:05,100
from it the absolute magnitude, and that is the same, that is equal to 5 times the base

1053
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:11,200
log 10 logarithm, logarithm of the distance, and then minus some number 5, because remember

1054
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,020
magnitudes have no units.

1055
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,020
They're really strange.

1056
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:16,260
They're just relative brightnesses between two stars.

1057
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:22,700
So there are relative brightness, so they have no units, unlike luminosity, which does.

1058
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,100
So absolute magnitudes is kind of a funny thing.

1059
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:29,260
It's a unitless way of talking about luminosity.

1060
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:33,180
But if we know the distance is something, and we can measure the measure of the brightness

1061
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:38,100
and apparent magnitudes, then we have the absolute magnitude, and that's really something

1062
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,100
we can use.

1063
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,780
So absolute magnitudes are important.

1064
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:47,980
If we know the parallax of a star, the parallax is the inverse of the distance in arc seconds.

1065
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:52,020
So if we know the parallax, we can take the base 10 logarithm of the parallax, add 1 to

1066
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:56,100
it, multiply that by 5, and then add the apparent magnitude to that.

1067
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,700
We get the absolute magnitude.

1068
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:03,700
So now we take two measurable things, the apparent magnitude and the parallax, and then

1069
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:08,780
we do some magic, some mathematical, magic, some arithmetic on that, and we get the absolute

1070
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,220
magnitude.

1071
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:15,260
So if we can get the absolute magnitude of a star, and know how that absolute magnitude

1072
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:23,420
compares to the luminosity of the star, and we have a fixed way of doing that, then measuring

1073
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:27,580
the apparent magnitude and the parallax will give us the absolute luminosity.

1074
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:33,140
There's a lot of trickery that goes into the last step, but it is possible, and it is doable

1075
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,580
at the very minimum.

1076
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:39,060
So as an example, if we take one of the nearest stars to us, one of the actually the approximate

1077
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:46,060
of an alpha centauri, which has a parallax of 742 milli arc seconds, and it has an absolute

1078
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:51,140
magnitude of just a little bit brighter than zero, it's minus 0.01, then that means it's

1079
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:56,100
absolute visual magnitude, apparent visual magnitude, meaning what we see it to be.

1080
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,580
It's a visual magnitude.

1081
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:02,020
And then the absolute visual magnitude is about 4.3 plus 4.3, and that's what the math

1082
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,340
works out to be.

1083
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:07,860
So magnitudes themselves are things that also we measure inside of filters.

1084
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:12,340
So a filter will actually determine it, what we use.

1085
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,460
So we're going to have a magnitude in the Johnson B, or the Johnson V, the Johnson

1086
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:21,580
I, or the Sloan I, or the Sloan U, or the Sloan V, or the Sloan B, there's all sorts

1087
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:26,140
of things that you can measure them as long as you have a standard filter system.

1088
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:30,940
So absolute magnitudes are a really great way to actually get a great way to actually

1089
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:32,900
give us luminosities.

1090
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:37,620
And roughly the solar luminosity in absolute magnitudes is about 5.

1091
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:43,740
It's recently been defined by the International Astronomical Union, and so absolute magnitude

1092
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:50,300
system no longer definitively relies on the sun simply because the sun is slightly variable,

1093
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:56,140
so you don't want to try to tie an absolute system onto a variable thing such as the sun.

1094
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:02,020
So roughly speaking, the sun is about an absolute luminosity of plus 5, give it a little bit,

1095
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:05,660
and that corresponds to a solar luminosity of 1.

1096
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:09,980
So if we then go up and down, if it's 100 times the solar luminosity, then it has an

1097
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,940
absolute magnitude of 0.

1098
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:18,260
If it's 10,000 solar luminosities, then it has an absolute magnitude of minus 5.

1099
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:24,820
If it has a hundredth of a solar luminosity, then it is about an absolute magnitude of

1100
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,820
about 10.

1101
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:31,980
And if it is 1 1⁄10,000th of a solar luminosity, then it has an absolute magnitude of plus

1102
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,380
15.

1103
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:39,860
So this kind of helps us get around because you'll notice that the luminosity whereas

1104
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:47,020
the magnitude system is linear, the luminosity of the magnitude system is exponential.

1105
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:49,380
That's the nature of a logarithmic relationship.

1106
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:52,540
So that's how bright we can look at it, and that's another way of thinking about it.

1107
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:56,820
So brightness then becomes luminosity as long as we know the distance.

1108
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:00,020
And the best thing we can get for distance is called parallax.

1109
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:05,060
So parallax then gives us distances in parsecs, which is a geometric distance.

1110
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:09,220
So we can play lots of games and say, oh, something's 20 parsecs away, what's the magnitude?

1111
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:13,980
If you have an apparent magnitude of 4, and if it's like 5 distant parsecs away, the apparent

1112
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:16,980
magnitude of 4, what's the absolute magnitude, et cetera, et cetera.

1113
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:20,220
Lots of games you can play.

1114
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:27,420
And so what we find is that the relationships really lead us down a lot of different places,

1115
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:32,260
and we're going to use these relationships over and over and over again with respect

1116
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:37,900
to luminosity and brightness and magnitudes, and the distance-modules equation will come

1117
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:41,500
in many times in the future.

1118
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:46,580
Hello, my name is Jason Kendall.

1119
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,420
Welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.

1120
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:53,380
Today we're going to continue the idea that we did last time when we discussed the nature

1121
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,660
of magnitudes and brightness and luminosity.

1122
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:01,460
But now we're going to formulate it in terms of an important thing that we call color.

1123
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:06,860
Color is an incredibly important thing to astronomy because, well, things have different

1124
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:07,860
colors.

1125
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:11,620
So we need to actually know how we can quantify this concept of color.

1126
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:15,380
But first what we need to do is understand a little bit about where color arises and

1127
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:17,460
how light interacts with matter.

1128
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:21,540
So let's discuss that first before we get into the nature of what color is with magnitudes.

1129
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:22,540
All right.

1130
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,940
So light and matter interact.

1131
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:29,900
And if you've ever been alive, you know that light bounces off walls, reflects off of things,

1132
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:34,420
comes from light sources like light bulbs, things that are hot, glow, and so forth.

1133
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:40,020
So what matter can do to light is it can allow it to pass through it, such as the glass that's

1134
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:42,900
passing through the lens that I'm looking at you with.

1135
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:47,700
It can also reflect light like it's reflected off of various surfaces, and it can then bounce

1136
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,900
from one surface to the next.

1137
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:53,560
Matter can gain this energy by absorbing light.

1138
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:58,400
So if you go out on a hot day, the light from the sun, you get absorbed, the light, that

1139
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,160
light in the form of infrared radiation that reflects, that goes into you and absorbs in

1140
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:06,340
your skin, as also as the ultraviolet light does the same thing.

1141
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:09,560
And then you absorb the energy of that light.

1142
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,880
Third, matter can lose energy by emitting light.

1143
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:20,400
So if it's warm or hot or hotter than the surroundings, then light will spontaneously

1144
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,760
come off of matter that is warmer than its surroundings and radiate to the surrounding

1145
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,360
environment, and that's called radiative transfer of energy.

1146
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:35,360
Okay, so there are two things that are important with respect to color and temperature, and

1147
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:39,700
temperature relates to the internal energy of the matter.

1148
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:44,680
So the internal energy of the matter is what we would call temperature.

1149
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,520
So the internal energy can have multiple forms.

1150
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,680
One is the structure of the material itself, that would be the phase of the matter, and

1151
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:56,040
the other is the average random motions of the material inside the matter, and that would

1152
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:00,520
be the vibrations of the matter, of it, if it's a gas, how fast it's moving around the

1153
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,520
room.

1154
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,120
So the internal energy is a function of temperature.

1155
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:10,480
All right, so let's look at how color relates to temperature.

1156
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,000
So first and foremost, color is a funny thing.

1157
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
What is color?

1158
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,640
I mean, I'm wearing a little checkered red, white, and blue shirt.

1159
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,120
How do you know what I'm wearing?

1160
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:22,920
It's a blue shirt, blue checkers and red checkers on it with a white shirt, and some fun red

1161
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:25,280
and blue and yellow things in the background here.

1162
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,280
How do I know what color is?

1163
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:32,000
Well, color is a funny thing because it's defined inside your head.

1164
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:39,640
Color is actually a concept of relative brightness between sets of things that do reception of

1165
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:40,640
light.

1166
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,640
What do I mean by that?

1167
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:46,080
Okay, so your eyes are filled with cells on the back.

1168
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,440
It's called the retina, the retinal cells.

1169
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:49,800
There's the cones and the rods.

1170
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:54,560
The rods are for nighttime, and the cones are for color and daytime.

1171
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,800
So the cones or the color rods have various receptor cells.

1172
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,440
And there's maybe, let's just be over, for an oversimplification, we know that there's

1173
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,440
maybe three.

1174
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,440
Let's just call it three.

1175
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,480
So you've got a set of cells inside the cones that are red receptors that receive, and a

1176
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,000
green receptor and a blue receptor.

1177
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,520
So a red receptor would only say fire off if red light lands on it, or what light in

1178
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,040
a specific wavelength region.

1179
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:26,600
Let's say then a green receptor only fires off if green light or this wavelengths of

1180
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,280
light in a specific wavelength region, same with blue.

1181
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:35,680
So then the relative brightnesses of these signals from the various cells, the pieces

1182
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,800
in each cell, determine the color.

1183
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,160
If more of the red cell got fired than the green, then we would call it red.

1184
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:47,400
If the green and the blue got fired, then we would call it yellow compared to the red.

1185
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:52,760
So anyway, the red color then gets constructed in your brain, and then we culturally decide

1186
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,240
to call red, red, and blue, blue, and yellow, yellow, yellow.

1187
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,160
But that's cultural.

1188
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,400
We want to quantify it.

1189
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:04,520
So what was done a long time ago is the Johnson filter system actually tried to mirror roughly

1190
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,880
what your eye sees, except it extends it into the infrared and the ultraviolet.

1191
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:15,040
So the primary filters that are used astronomically, or at least the easiest ones, or some of

1192
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:21,680
the oldest ones to use that are still standardized, are the Johnson, UB, VR, and Eye filters.

1193
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:25,480
So we've got a blue filter, which is B, we've got a V filter, which is kind of yellow-green,

1194
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,840
and then we've got an R filter, which is red.

1195
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:35,000
So the R filter covers a wavelength region about 6,000 to 7,000 angstroms.

1196
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:41,360
The V filter covers roughly about 5,000 or 5,500 angstroms, and the blue filter covers

1197
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,880
roughly about 4,000 angstroms.

1198
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:50,120
So these three filters together allow light of only a certain wavelength to pass through

1199
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,680
to the detector.

1200
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:54,960
Notice how that's similar to what your eye does, but your eye doesn't automatically.

1201
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,360
The retina has these cells that only detect the light.

1202
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:03,800
Instead, now we make a nice photo detector, some sort of camera, and what we do is we

1203
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:09,240
put in front of the camera a filter so it blocks out all except the blue light, or the

1204
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:14,320
green light, or the red light, and therefore what falls on the camera is either blue light

1205
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,640
or green light or red light.

1206
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,460
That's different than what happens in your eye.

1207
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:22,760
We don't have filters in our eye that filter things out.

1208
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:25,560
We have cells that receive the certain things.

1209
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:29,080
So we can think of the cells as kind of like inverse filters.

1210
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:35,880
They absorb only specific wavelengths of light, but a filter transmits only certain wavelengths

1211
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:41,200
of light, and it's the specialization of this transmission that allows us to actually determine

1212
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,200
color.

1213
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,200
All right.

1214
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:47,600
So the Johnson's Cousins Filter Response System, which has some very specific wavelength

1215
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:52,880
transmission frequency, transmission wavelength dependency.

1216
01:22:52,880 --> 01:23:01,880
So we don't expect to get pretty much any light that is more blue than, say, 3,000 angstroms

1217
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:08,280
in the B filter, and we don't expect much light longer than 5,000 angstroms to pass

1218
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:12,400
through the B filter, and that's what we mean by these transmission curves.

1219
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:17,040
So the sun itself has a certain brightness in each one of these filters, and we can actually

1220
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,640
then look at things and do relative brightnesses of the filters.

1221
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,760
Typically astronomy is done with relative brightnesses, so you say, oh, this thing is

1222
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,320
brighter than that thing, and that thing's brighter than this thing, and this thing's

1223
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,400
brighter than that thing.

1224
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:31,560
And the filter system like this makes it very easy because then you can use the magnitude

1225
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,920
system, which itself is a relative brightness concept.

1226
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:42,000
So the visible light bands are only covered by the B, V, and R sections of the Johnson's

1227
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,960
Cousins Filter System.

1228
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,880
The U section, you're going to have to go way up in altitude in order to use it, and

1229
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:52,400
same with the I section, you need to be at high altitude in order to use these because

1230
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,960
the Earth's atmosphere strongly absorbs ultraviolet infrared light.

1231
01:23:55,960 --> 01:24:03,160
So what we got is we have these wavelength regions, which the filter system allows through.

1232
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:07,840
Once again, just like we defined with Pogson's system, last time Pogson originally said that

1233
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:13,840
every filter system, in any filter system, including the Johnson's Cousins, the definition

1234
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,280
of zero magnitude is the star Vega.

1235
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,360
So we start with that idea and then say, oh, how bright or dim is the object with respect

1236
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,520
to Vega.

1237
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:29,200
And the reason we use Vega, again, is because Vega goes across the zenith for many observers

1238
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,600
in the Northern Hemisphere.

1239
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,760
All right.

1240
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,000
So what do we really mean by color?

1241
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:41,000
In your eye, it is the difference in brightness that you perceive in the red cells versus

1242
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,520
the green cells versus the blue cells in your retina of your eye.

1243
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,640
Likewise, in an astronomical sense, what we have is three filters.

1244
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:55,160
So the filters then say, well, what is the, we can then make, we can determine the magnitude

1245
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,160
of the object.

1246
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,160
And that's our brightness.

1247
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:00,440
Remember, magnitude here is brightnesses.

1248
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:04,720
The apparent brightness in the U filter, the apparent brightness in the B filter, the

1249
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,040
apparent brightness in the VR and eye.

1250
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,160
And so what we do is it's kind of funny.

1251
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:13,400
Like we've defined magnitudes before where we have the distance modus, little m and big

1252
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,280
m for absolute magnitude.

1253
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:23,320
Here we define the apparent magnitude of an object to be the capital letter of the filter

1254
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,440
that you're using.

1255
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:30,000
So here we say the magnitude in the U filter and the magnitude in the B filter and the

1256
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,840
magnitude in the V in the R, those are just the letters.

1257
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:39,060
So we take those values of the magnitudes, the brightness in magnitudes on these six.

1258
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:45,880
Not brightness in terms of watts per meter squared or that's not how we do it.

1259
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:50,160
We use magnitude system because we can easily do differential brightnesses between them.

1260
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:54,840
So the magnitudes become our reference point in astronomy, not necessarily flux.

1261
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:59,160
We will translate that eventually into flux, but we start with magnitudes.

1262
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:05,600
Alright, so color then is defined in astronomy to be the difference in brightness between

1263
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,680
two filters that are adjacent.

1264
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:13,400
And you always take the short wavelength filter minus the long wavelength filter, the magnitude

1265
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:17,400
in the shorter wavelength minus the magnitude in the longer wavelength.

1266
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:23,080
And it's typical that you only, that you look at adjacent filters and not necessarily

1267
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:27,920
span across, but there might be a science reason why you would actually do that.

1268
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,240
So typically you might take the difference in brightness between say the U and the B

1269
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:35,920
and the B and the V and the V and the R and the R and the I and then call those the colors.

1270
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:41,520
So a standard color that is used frequently throughout all astronomy is an observation

1271
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,560
in the B filter and an observation in the V filter.

1272
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,920
And then you take the difference in those observations, meaning the magnitude difference

1273
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:53,200
between B and V, meaning what is the, what is the, if you take the magnitude of B and

1274
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,720
subtract from it the magnitude of V, that is the color.

1275
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,480
Kind of a funny thing.

1276
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,000
So there's lots of different ways we can call color.

1277
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,360
And so therefore we can quantify color.

1278
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:08,080
It's not just calling it magenta or red or pews or aquamarine or any of the names that

1279
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:13,040
you would find in a crayon box from Crayola, on those 64 colors with all those pretty names.

1280
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,480
We don't care about those names.

1281
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,440
Those names are really nice and everything and they're very fun to have.

1282
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:22,160
But really what we want to do is we want to use the definition of color in order to get

1283
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:24,040
us data and understanding.

1284
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,040
All right.

1285
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,880
So the blue star, the blue color of say the star Sirius.

1286
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,860
So Sirius is by definition, well not by definition but by your eye, you can see in the sky as

1287
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,720
being a blue star.

1288
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:42,600
So therefore it must be brighter in the blue magnitude, in blue magnitudes than in V magnitudes.

1289
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,800
And in fact it is.

1290
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:48,640
So if you take and likewise it must be brighter in the V than the R. So if you look at these

1291
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:57,840
numbers, the B number, the B magnitude of Sirius must be closer, must be lower in value

1292
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,240
than the V magnitude.

1293
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:03,960
Because remember, magnitudes, the larger the magnitude, the dimmer it is.

1294
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:09,440
So the more negative it is, the closer towards negative infinity it is, the larger negative

1295
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:14,040
number or the smaller positive number, the brighter it is.

1296
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:18,920
So if you compare a tenth magnitude star to a fifth magnitude star, the fifth magnitude

1297
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,200
star is brighter than the tenth magnitude.

1298
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:26,760
So let's say that a star like Sirius might happen to be in the B magnitude.

1299
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,760
It's pretty bright.

1300
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,520
So I'm just going to make up a number here and the number I'm going to make up is that

1301
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:38,600
it is a B magnitude of say one, let's call it a B magnitude of one.

1302
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:43,480
But because it's dimmer in the V magnitude, maybe it would have a V magnitude of two.

1303
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:49,440
So the color two, C2, which is the color two in the Johnson's filter system, B minus

1304
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,120
V is minus one.

1305
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:56,840
So there's the color of Sirius in the B minus V. B minus V color equals minus one.

1306
01:28:56,840 --> 01:29:01,240
And let's say the R magnitude is four because it's a very strongly blue thing.

1307
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:06,640
So then V minus R is minus three, so C sub three, which is another color definition in

1308
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:10,680
the Johnson's system, that would be a minus three.

1309
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:15,040
So B minus V color is minus one, and V minus R color is minus three.

1310
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,360
Now I pulled all these numbers out of thin air, so don't bother looking them up.

1311
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,360
They're wrong.

1312
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:24,880
So, but anyway, I invite you to actually go look up what the B minus V magnitude colors

1313
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,520
are of Sirius and the V minus R that are standard.

1314
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,000
And if you look at the American Association of Variable Star Observers, you should be

1315
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,600
able to actually see that.

1316
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,640
All right, so let's take a different star.

1317
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:41,320
So in, say, in the winter sky, Betelgeuse, which is in the constellation Orion, very

1318
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:48,040
beautiful red star, so therefore the B magnitude would have to be dimmer than the V magnitude.

1319
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:53,280
So, and we also know that Betelgeuse is also roughly a magnitude one-ish sort of star in

1320
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,280
visual.

1321
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:59,760
So let's say the B magnitude is, say, three, because it's much dimmer in B than in V, and

1322
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,120
we'll say that V is, say, a one.

1323
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:03,280
All right?

1324
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,280
So that makes sense.

1325
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:10,280
So B minus V, for Betelgeuse, would be three minus one is plus two.

1326
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:17,540
So now we see that a color that is in B minus V, if it's positive, it's red.

1327
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:19,760
If it's negative, the star is blue.

1328
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,600
So a positive C2 color, B minus V, means the star is pretty much red.

1329
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:28,760
If the, if the B minus V color is negative, it's probably blue.

1330
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,800
And if it's zero, it's probably kind of whiteish-yellow, like the sun, which just makes sense.

1331
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:38,240
Anyway, so with the same thing with V minus R, maybe the V minus R color is more significant

1332
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:43,440
for Betelgeuse, but our magnitudes tend to be a little bit tweaky for a lot of reasons.

1333
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:48,680
And we tend to see V minus V as a pretty big standard in the American Association Variable

1334
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,680
Star Observation.

1335
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,680
All right.

1336
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,400
So the B minus V color will be more positive.

1337
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:57,680
The V minus R color will be more positive for a red star.

1338
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:05,720
So we can construct all of these colors, and this is like an extraordinarily low-resolution

1339
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:06,720
spectroscopy.

1340
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,800
What is spectroscopy?

1341
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:14,680
Spectroscopy is where you take the light from a star, say, and you pass it through a prism.

1342
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:19,200
And when you pass it through that prism, the light then gets broken out into a rainbow,

1343
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,400
and you see how bright it is to get various frequencies.

1344
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,200
So you really care about how bright it is at various frequencies.

1345
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,200
That's what you really care about when you're doing spectroscopy.

1346
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:32,200
But the nice thing about doing filters like this, filter photometry, is that pretty much

1347
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,240
everything you look at is pretty bright.

1348
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,640
So spectroscopy can be pretty dim.

1349
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:39,840
You need a lot of light in order to make a decent spectrum.

1350
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:47,120
But you can do pretty well at lower resolution spectroscopy with Johnson's filters, with

1351
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:51,120
such B minus, B, V, R, I, and filters, U, B, V, R, filters.

1352
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,120
All right.

1353
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:57,280
This color is important because it does relate to temperature.

1354
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,040
So let's find out how that is.

1355
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:03,080
In general, if we look at the types of stars and we break out their spectra, remember that's

1356
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:09,320
what Annie Jump Cannon did at Harvard back in the 1910s and 1920s with her team of computers

1357
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:14,840
underpickering, the spectra of stars were classified according to their temperature.

1358
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:20,280
And their temperature was guided by the prominence of hydrogen lines.

1359
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,280
So okay.

1360
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:28,240
So if we look at the nature of how spectral lines look, we see that O stars in general

1361
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:29,240
are much brighter.

1362
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:34,720
Well, in general, always, O stars are by definition brighter in the blue than they are in the

1363
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:38,920
red, and M stars are brighter in the red than they are in the blue.

1364
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:42,560
Sometimes when we look at stellar spectral classification, we forget that O stars are

1365
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,520
inherently much, much, much, much brighter than M stars.

1366
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,320
But we'll talk about why that is shortly.

1367
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,680
In any event right now, what we can do is look at the temperature of a star, and we

1368
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:57,440
see that as the temperature decreases, it goes from being bright in the blue to bright

1369
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,440
in the red.

1370
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:04,160
And that's why we can say that a blue hot object is much hotter than a red hot object.

1371
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:07,800
Red is pretty hot to eyes if you're thinking about flame, but don't want to get close to

1372
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:08,960
a blue hot flame.

1373
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,240
That's very, very, very hot in any event.

1374
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:17,160
So real spectra of real stars show that hot stars look blue because they're brighter in

1375
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,360
blue than they are in red.

1376
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:26,400
So let's say we put fake BV filters on top of some spectra and see what the impact of

1377
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,280
that would be.

1378
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:35,320
We can easily see that the brightness in B filter for an O star, that's kind of BVO,

1379
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:41,960
the brightness in the blue filter for an O star, the B magnitude is much greater than

1380
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,440
the V magnitude for the O star.

1381
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:48,440
So therefore the color will be negative.

1382
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:56,600
And if we look at an M type star, the B magnitude will be dimmer and therefore larger than the

1383
01:33:56,600 --> 01:34:01,800
V magnitude, where the V magnitude will be brighter and therefore a smaller value.

1384
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:06,520
So a big value minus a small value equals a positive value.

1385
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:13,400
So the color, the B minus V color for M stars is positive and the B minus V color for O

1386
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:15,780
stars is negative.

1387
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:20,240
So that's kind of what we were talking about, the O and B stars are all over the place.

1388
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:25,280
And in general a star like the sun, the G stars right in the middle, their B minus V colors

1389
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:29,840
tend to be roughly about zero because the magnitude difference between the two filters

1390
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,120
is roughly nothing, there's almost nothing.

1391
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:36,320
So there is a transition point and that is roughly around the middle of the spectral

1392
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,080
sequence and roughly at the G's.

1393
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:43,960
So let's say we instead, instead of looking at it from like a pretty picture rainbow type

1394
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:50,320
of things, we decided to look at it from a spectral sequence where we actually measure

1395
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:57,480
the total brightness of a star numerically instead of using like our eyeballs or magnitudes

1396
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:02,080
but we start with say flux, which is watts per square centimeter.

1397
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:07,800
That's flux falling upon a per square, yeah, watts per square meter, well you know I could

1398
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:15,200
say a meter sized detector but anyway, we then say what's the absolute flux or the amount

1399
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:20,440
of light that is the luminosity falling on our detector and count the real energy that

1400
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:25,320
was being deposited by that light and we get what we call a spectrum.

1401
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:30,760
So that spectrum can be numerically related to the Johnson color system and we can say

1402
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:35,720
well what is the B minus V colors for the various objects and then we see that O stars

1403
01:35:35,720 --> 01:35:39,720
are of course brighter in exactly the same way that we discussed with them when we looked

1404
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,000
at simple spectra.

1405
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:49,280
So the next question that we have is a rather interesting one and so we see that stars are

1406
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:54,360
organized by their temperatures and O stars are hot and M stars are cool.

1407
01:35:54,360 --> 01:36:00,440
How do we know this, why do we know this and the answer is in the spectra themselves.

1408
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:06,600
So the spectrum itself determines the temperature of the star and we just are lucky enough to

1409
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:11,520
be able to use the Johnson's filter system to actually determine that much more easily.

1410
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,760
Alright, so when we're looking at the spectra of a star, notice the shapes of the spectra.

1411
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:22,880
In general the shapes of the spectrum of a star, the blue one looks kind of nice and

1412
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:29,280
slopey, it starts off in the visible part of the way of electromagnetic radiation.

1413
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:34,240
It is bright in the blue and the ultraviolet and dim by the time it gets to red and infrared

1414
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,280
and the situation is reversed for the M stars.

1415
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,520
So what do these curves mean?

1416
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:45,560
What do these plots of intensity as a function of wavelength mean?

1417
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:52,760
Well they just mean that what we're seeing is if we look at a star it's really far away.

1418
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:58,880
So we're not taking the image of a particular patch of a star, we're looking at it averaged

1419
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,760
over the entire star.

1420
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:06,280
So we're looking at the average say temperature and the average spectrum of all the regions

1421
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,280
of the star.

1422
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,000
Some might be a little hotter, some might be a little cooler, that's what sunspots are

1423
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,480
in the sun, sunspots are slightly cooler areas, prominences are a little bit cooler,

1424
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:19,000
the sun radiates in X-rays but if we took the sun and put it really far away, maybe

1425
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,680
tens of parsecs away, then we wouldn't be able to resolve the sun, but we would still

1426
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:29,560
be able to get the average spectrum of all the light that comes to us from the sun.

1427
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:34,680
Most important thing though about a star is that no matter how far away it is, no matter

1428
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:38,600
how tiny it seems in the sky, it is a big thing.

1429
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:43,640
Stars are enormous objects, they're much bigger than planets, even little M dwarf stars are

1430
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:45,440
bigger than the planet Jupiter.

1431
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:50,440
So if we take something like the size of the sun, the sun itself is 100 earths could fit

1432
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:54,400
across it and a million earths could fit inside it, so these are enormous objects.

1433
01:37:54,400 --> 01:38:00,720
And an enormous hot dense body is opaque, and an enormous hot dense body that is opaque

1434
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:05,600
means the light bounces around inside it if light is being generated inside of there,

1435
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,920
and it bounces around inside it until everything becomes the same temperature.

1436
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:14,640
Once everything is the same temperature inside the star, then it's at the same temperature

1437
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:19,280
and what we see at the surface of the star is that average temperature of all the light

1438
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:23,240
then all the material being all the same temperature at the surface.

1439
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:29,200
So that's interesting because it's opaque, everything gets to the same temperature.

1440
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:33,720
So temperature is a funny thing because it's measurement, it is a measurement of the internal

1441
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:37,760
energy of the object, when the solid it's just the things vibrating in place and how

1442
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:41,900
much vibrational motion it has inside of the structure of the solid.

1443
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:45,140
If you give it enough heat then there are bonds that must be broken down in order to

1444
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:49,140
churn it from a solid to say a liquid or a solid to a gas, but we'll ignore that for

1445
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:57,740
just a second because that's a different kind of change in heat latency and heat latency.

1446
01:38:57,740 --> 01:39:02,180
But if you have a gas that's much easier, and stars are gases, they're not solids,

1447
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:07,060
so a gaseous ball, a starry gaseous ball, the higher the temperature, the higher the

1448
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:12,020
average motion of the molecules, the atoms that make up the star, so they move faster.

1449
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:18,100
So temperature itself in a gas is related to how fast the atoms are moving inside it

1450
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:21,300
or ions if it's too hot.

1451
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:27,580
The way we can then relate temperature itself as a measurement to the speeds and therefore

1452
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:32,620
energy because speed is like kinetic energy, it's the energy of going fast.

1453
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:38,260
So therefore the temperature must be an average measurement of all of the speeds, of all of

1454
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:39,260
the objects in it.

1455
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:42,700
It's not everything going exactly the same speed, that would be kind of weird.

1456
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:49,480
But what we see is that it's an average speed over the entire set of molecules and atoms.

1457
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:56,100
So we can relate it to the average kinetic energy of an atom inside of there.

1458
01:39:56,100 --> 01:40:01,180
And that thing that we call its movement is what we call heat.

1459
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:04,820
And heat has a lot of different things that we can talk about, and that would be a thermodynamic

1460
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:05,820
course.

1461
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:09,980
But let's just start with a relatively easy concept and begin from there.

1462
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:13,900
And so heat is something that you measure, temperature is something you measure with

1463
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:19,420
a thermometer, and heat is a measurement of how much wiggling there is occurring inside

1464
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:20,420
of the atoms.

1465
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:24,060
A little bit loose definition there, I know, but off we go, we'll just kind of keep with

1466
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,060
it for now.

1467
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:28,740
But cold can be defined as the lack of motion.

1468
01:40:28,780 --> 01:40:33,900
So in absolute temperature scale, we might want to say, absolutely cold, we want nothing

1469
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:36,580
moving, but we'll call that temperature equals zero.

1470
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:41,860
And so as you give it more and more heat, the things move faster and faster, so therefore

1471
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:44,540
there the temperature gets higher and higher.

1472
01:40:44,540 --> 01:40:48,900
Because not everything's at the same motion, it's the average speeds of the object that

1473
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:50,420
determine the temperature.

1474
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:55,780
So the Kelvin temperature scale was defined a long time ago by Lord Kelvin.

1475
01:40:55,820 --> 01:41:01,700
And it's related to zero is the absolute zero of it, and at that time there is no motion

1476
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:07,420
whatsoever on the part of anything that's inside an object that is at absolute zero.

1477
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:11,300
The cosmic microwave background is at three degrees above absolute zero, which means it

1478
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:16,660
is very cold, but still there's some, actually an incredible amount of energy associated with

1479
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,780
that, but we'll let that go for a second.

1480
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:26,100
The pure water boils at 277, it freezes, at least if you cool water below 273 degrees Kelvin,

1481
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:27,300
it becomes a solid.

1482
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:32,940
If you warm it above 273 Kelvin, then as it first does, it was a funny thing.

1483
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:38,340
First when it becomes, it's a solid, and then there is heat as you can apply heat to ice

1484
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:44,380
and it'll change phase from solid to liquid at the same temperature until you've given

1485
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:49,020
it enough heat to break down the bonds that make it go from a solid to a liquid.

1486
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:53,940
And then once it becomes a liquid, then the temperature again begins to rise because when

1487
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:59,220
you apply heat to a phase that is in the phase transition mode, you actually, that's what

1488
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:03,660
phase transition means is that you could have the same temperature, but yet there you don't

1489
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:08,180
change the relative, the relative average motion of it.

1490
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:13,860
A phase change simply changes the arrangement or the fundamental arrangement of the atoms

1491
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:15,700
and molecules inside of it.

1492
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:17,980
So that's a pretty loose definition too.

1493
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:23,820
But once we get to 373 Kelvin, then it boils, which then the bonds that make up a liquid

1494
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:29,100
that are broken down and you add heat into the liquid to make it become a vapor.

1495
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:34,620
It stays at that temperature 373 until you've given it so much heat that all of a sudden

1496
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:37,580
nothing's left in the liquid state and it's all a vapor state and then the temperature

1497
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:44,780
can increase again and temperature then becomes, and it still is in all of these cases, a measurement

1498
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:47,260
of the average motion of the objects.

1499
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:52,100
But heat is, as you can see, slightly different because heat can be applied to something and

1500
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:55,620
it doesn't necessarily raise the temperature, which is interesting and that's about phase

1501
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:59,500
transitions and that should be done within a separate video.

1502
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:04,420
But for our purposes for this, all we really want to say is that the Kelvin temperature

1503
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:10,660
scale for gases, which make up stars, that is in measurement of their average speed.

1504
01:43:10,660 --> 01:43:12,980
And the Kelvin temperature scale has some basic things.

1505
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:17,500
We already talked about water boiling and so forth, but then fusion of hydrogen occurs

1506
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:23,060
when the temperature is approximately 13, approximately 10 million degrees or about 10

1507
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:24,060
million Kelvin.

1508
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:27,820
So we don't say degrees Kelvin, we say degrees centigrade, we say degrees Fahrenheit, we just

1509
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:32,300
say 10 million Kelvin because it's units like watts or meters.

1510
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:40,820
We don't say 10 million lengths meters, we don't say oh that's 10 million times seconds

1511
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:41,820
right?

1512
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:44,820
Because we don't say seconds are a time, we know it's a time, we know Kelvin is a unit

1513
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:50,740
of temperature, so we just say that's 10 million Kelvin, that's the temperature of that star.

1514
01:43:50,740 --> 01:43:56,600
So light and heat is therefore a different thing, but yet they're all, but they're related.

1515
01:43:56,600 --> 01:44:03,800
So you may receive light from the sun in the form of infrared photons and those infrared

1516
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:11,760
photons can go to doing one of two things that can go to changing the internal heat of your

1517
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:16,080
body and the internal heat then can be manifested in numerous ways.

1518
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:21,240
The most common way is to make the atoms and molecules in your body vibrate or move more

1519
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,240
quickly.

1520
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:27,920
You also can change the state from a liquid to a gas or a solid to a liquid depending

1521
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:33,240
on the intensity and the wavelength of the light, so that all depends on how it absorbs

1522
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:34,240
and emits it.

1523
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:40,920
But from our perspective what we really care about is that when light falls upon a gas

1524
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:48,800
we can treat it as a heat input and as it inputs that heat into the system then what

1525
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,360
occurs is the temperature rises.

1526
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:58,880
Now if it's an average, if it's completely opaque and everything inside there is at thermal

1527
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:06,320
equilibrium, meaning that there isn't a place inside the star that is significantly different

1528
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:10,800
compared to another place inside the star, well it's kind of a tricky thing because

1529
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:14,120
stars have to be a little bit out of thermal equilibrium because they emit light and emit

1530
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:19,320
heat so they have to have a source coming in there, but if the source of energy inside

1531
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:23,760
of the star equals the amount of energy that's coming out of the star then it can be said

1532
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,560
to be in thermal equilibrium.

1533
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:30,960
So as long as the star is in thermal equilibrium, meaning in general it's not getting a lot

1534
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:35,840
hotter and in general it's not getting a lot cooler and in general there's no big areas

1535
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:42,320
where there's motion of heat going from one place to another, then we call thermal equilibrium.

1536
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:49,080
If an object is hot at the same temperature throughout and opaque then it would be called

1537
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:50,280
the black body.

1538
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:55,800
A black body is even a stranger object, it's kind of a theoretical, in fact it is a theoretical

1539
01:45:55,800 --> 01:46:02,240
object that absorbs all light that falls upon it and since it absorbs all the light that

1540
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:06,480
falls upon it, it doesn't reflect anything, it reflects no light, it absorbs all light

1541
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:10,840
that's kind of a stretch, there's nothing that does not absorb all light.

1542
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:15,280
So any light that falls on a black body gets absorbed and therefore it gets mixed around

1543
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:22,120
inside the black body until then it thermalizes with all the other light inside of that, all

1544
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:28,040
the other matter inside of that and then the black body then because it can perfectly absorb,

1545
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:33,000
it can perfectly emit and it doesn't hold back certain wavelengths of light.

1546
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,920
If a black body held back certain wavelengths of light then it would also reflect those

1547
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,040
certain wavelengths of light which is interesting to say.

1548
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:46,480
So a black body is a perfect absorber of light and a perfect emitter which means everything

1549
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,920
inside of it gets to the same temperature, that's what we care about.

1550
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:57,680
So things that are very close to black bodies in mostly everyday parlance, molten steel

1551
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:03,240
at a foundry, the ingots of steel, those are most certainly black body objects, they're

1552
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:07,160
hot, they're very hot, they're glowing, they're all at the same temperature and in fact if

1553
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:11,600
you look inside the foundry it's hard to tell the color of the sides of the walls of

1554
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:15,400
the foundry from the actual molten steel itself, in fact when they put it in there you can't

1555
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:20,640
see the difference because the steel and the walls and the gas inside of there are all

1556
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:24,760
glowing at the same exact temperature and since they're glowing at the same exact temperature

1557
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:28,720
they have the same exact spectrum because it's a black body spectrum.

1558
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:33,040
The next thing we can look at that's a very familiar thing is the coals of a fire, look

1559
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:38,880
deep inside the coals of a fire and on some camping night that you might go out to and

1560
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:43,800
the coals of a fire, not the fire flame above but deep inside the coals below the wood you

1561
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:48,480
can't tell where the fire begins and where the coals end if you look carefully.

1562
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,640
In fact they all have the same temperature, they all have the same color.

1563
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:55,800
The only reason something has a slightly different temperature is if it's darker it's cooler

1564
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,320
but if it has the same exact temperature it'll have the same exact color.

1565
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:07,400
The cool, the hot area that's being shielded inside of the cavity of the fire deep down

1566
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:09,640
in there, that's a black body too.

1567
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:15,160
Now a welder's arc is a very very hot object but what actually is the thing that might happen

1568
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:16,160
to be a black body?

1569
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:22,800
Remember the welder melts something, melts the steel at very high temperature and so

1570
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,520
not the sparking stuff because that would be an emission spectrum, it would be a gaseous

1571
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:31,680
form of it but the sparks coming off, the actual sparks themselves they're reddish but

1572
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:37,280
if you look at the center of a welding arc's light the light itself is where the metal

1573
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:42,400
has been turned to blue hot and now blue hot that area is very small, remember the foundry

1574
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:46,400
look is this enormous thing and you can still look at it, it's bright but you can still

1575
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:51,600
look at it but the intensity of light goes up here either rapidly as the temperature

1576
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,960
goes up.

1577
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:56,960
So the melted iron that is being focused on by the arc welder that's the thing that's

1578
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:01,400
incredibly hot and incredibly blue and incredibly bright so there's something about it getting

1579
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:04,040
hot that means also getting bright too.

1580
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:10,160
Alright, oh no now I get to throw equations at you so equations are a funny thing so the

1581
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:15,680
entire shape doesn't matter if it's a black body, any black body, every black body has

1582
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:22,200
a theoretical curve that has the shape that kind of looks like an off kilter normal curve

1583
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:27,520
or a bell curve, take a bell curve and like stretch one side long and that's kind of

1584
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,120
what the black body curve looks like.

1585
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:35,600
The only thing that can be different from one black body to another is the temperature

1586
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:40,680
and so it just basically scales everything up by a factor of the temperature.

1587
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:48,320
So as if it's hotter the area of the black body curve scales up by a factor of the temperature

1588
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:53,960
of the third power and so as you get hotter and hotter the area gets hot, the temperature

1589
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,400
gets higher and higher.

1590
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:58,520
So it's a very, well it's actually the temperature of the fourth power is really what it comes

1591
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:00,160
down to but still.

1592
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:07,160
So the point is that every black body has the same shape, doesn't matter what its temperature

1593
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:13,120
is, the same shape but yet whether it's brighter at one frequency or another that's a different

1594
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:14,320
thing.

1595
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:20,800
So different black bodies at different temperatures have peak wavelengths at different wavelengths.

1596
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:25,200
When they're very, very cool black bodies as we saw in say the iron foundry or even

1597
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:31,120
a very cool star like Beetlejuice, it peaks in the red or even in the infrared and then

1598
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:36,440
as it gets hotter and hotter it starts peaking in the visible light like say yellow or green

1599
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:42,040
but if you were to see such a thing that's like 6,000 or 6,000 Kelvin, to your eye it

1600
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:48,800
would look white because it's roughly evenly balanced across the visible spectrum.

1601
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:53,320
But it peaks at specific wavelengths that we would call green if it was peaking roughly

1602
01:50:53,320 --> 01:51:00,320
on 6,000 Kelvin and once you get above 7,000 Kelvin the peak temperature, the peak location

1603
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,640
starts going into the ultraviolet.

1604
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:06,320
So it starts from the red and infrared moves through the center of the visible spectrum

1605
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,200
and all the way up to ultraviolet.

1606
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:13,560
It just so happens that stellar temperatures, stellar surface temperatures range in their

1607
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:18,920
peak brightnesses for most stars in the visible light range all the way up through the blue

1608
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:22,200
light and all the way up through infrared, so infrared to ultraviolet.

1609
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:27,960
That's where stars seem to peak in their black body radiation.

1610
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:37,280
So when we take the curves for black bodies and we isolate only the sections that are

1611
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:42,800
visible light, if we isolate only those sections it just so happens that the actual spectra

1612
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:48,320
of stars very closely match the theoretical predictions of what a black body curve of

1613
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:49,760
that temperature looks like.

1614
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,240
They're really, really, really close.

1615
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:56,400
It's not perfect and the reason it's not perfect is because stars have atmospheres and the

1616
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:02,440
atmosphere of the star acts to absorb light from that star and when it absorbs the light

1617
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:06,640
from the star it takes the light away from the star and then we don't see it and we

1618
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:07,640
see an absorption feature.

1619
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:11,680
Maybe we see even emission features, but typically it'll absorb it in one wavelength

1620
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:16,200
and then those atoms and molecules will re-radiate it in some other location and it'll escape

1621
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:17,200
in a different way.

1622
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:21,640
It doesn't hang on to it, it just re-radiates in another direction, in other wavelengths.

1623
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:30,600
The sun itself, specifically the black body for it would peak right around 5,000, roughly

1624
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:35,640
right in the middle of the spectrum, but yet the actual curve because of this redistribution

1625
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:37,480
is a little bit more blue.

1626
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:44,480
So that's kind of interesting, but even so, the curve for the solar spectrum is really

1627
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,920
close to a black body spectrum.

1628
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:51,880
So what are some other astronomical objects that we see that have a black body spectrum?

1629
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:56,240
Remember, it has to be dense and it has to be thermalized, it has to be all at the same

1630
01:52:56,240 --> 01:52:59,440
temperature and it has to be one object that's at the same temperature.

1631
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:03,680
Alright, that's cool and we'll see what kind of things we have.

1632
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:09,960
So if we look at dark, dark dust clouds deep in interstellar space, the places where stars

1633
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:14,280
are being born, dense enough so that they barely collapse under their gravity, they

1634
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:17,920
might be a parsec or two across, they're very, very cold objects.

1635
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,760
They might be 60 degrees above absolute zero.

1636
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:25,640
And so even if it's 60 degrees above absolute zero, it can still have a black body curve

1637
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:29,640
because that's the average temperature, so if it's an average temperature of that, what's

1638
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:30,640
the peak wavelength?

1639
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:35,240
Well, the peak wavelength is deep in the infrared, deep in the infrared if not even in the radio

1640
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:36,280
wavelengths.

1641
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:40,800
So when you have something at 60 degrees Kelvin, if you look in infrared light, you'll see

1642
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:41,800
it glowing.

1643
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:44,840
So therefore, that's why the Spitzer space, infrared space telescope has been built and

1644
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:50,840
why space telescope has been built to look at objects that glow in the infrared and

1645
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:54,040
things that are cool objects, very cool objects.

1646
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:58,760
A dark dust cloud does not glow in any light, in the visible light and therefore we see

1647
01:53:58,760 --> 01:53:59,760
it to be dark.

1648
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:05,200
If we then look at say something like a protostellar object, like let's say now a star is formed

1649
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:06,800
inside this dark dust cloud.

1650
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:10,240
Once it's formed inside there, the star itself is pretty warm.

1651
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:14,240
But yet it's not hot enough to call itself a star.

1652
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:17,000
Maybe it's a bit warmer than the surface, maybe it's much warmer than the surface of

1653
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,560
Jupiter and it might be a few hundred Kelvin.

1654
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:25,600
Therefore it seems to be a dull red, but it peaks in the infrared, in the near infrared.

1655
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:35,640
Near infrared means just a little bit further red than the about 7,000 angstroms or 700 nanometers.

1656
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:41,600
And you'll notice also that something that is 600 Kelvin is a thousand times brighter

1657
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,840
at the peak than something that's 60 Kelvin.

1658
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:48,920
So the warmer it is, the much brighter it is.

1659
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:54,720
So by multiplying by a factor of 10 gives you a lot, lot, lot larger factor of luminosity

1660
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,880
in terms of temperature, in luminosity.

1661
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:02,920
So we go to the sun now and the sun is about 6,000 Kelvin and so it's about a thousand

1662
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:07,200
times again brighter than say some dust cloud that's at 600 Kelvin.

1663
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:12,200
And it peaks roughly in the visible wavelength region, but it has significant output in infrared

1664
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:16,760
radio, well not really a lot of radio, but significant infrared output and significant

1665
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:18,200
ultraviolet output.

1666
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:23,880
The sun's spectrum is pretty close to a black body and we can use that as a measurement.

1667
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:29,320
And what we feel as warmth on a summer day is the infrared light that passes from the

1668
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:34,200
sun through the atmosphere to us as part of the black body spectrum.

1669
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:40,200
The sunscreen you wear is for the intense ultraviolet light that drops off rapidly at

1670
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,200
a shorter wavelength.

1671
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:45,040
So then the next thing we can look at is something even hotter.

1672
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:51,280
Say the accretion disc around a black hole, so there's material falling into a black hole

1673
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:55,920
and as it falls into that black hole, it gets hotter and hotter and hotter and just before

1674
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,080
it falls into the center of a black hole.

1675
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,960
It gets to be tens of thousands of Kelvin.

1676
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:04,240
Actually it gets much hotter than that, but we're talking about the outskirts or maybe

1677
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:08,080
we're even looking at an extraordinarily hot O-star.

1678
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:11,640
So an extraordinarily hot O-star might be tens of thousands of Kelvin.

1679
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:15,880
And those things are even more luminous than the sun, thousands of times more luminous

1680
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,040
than the sun.

1681
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:22,400
And their peak wavelength is way out in the ultraviolet and they emit even more visible

1682
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,440
light than the sun does.

1683
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:29,400
They emit even more infrared light than the sun does, but they emit even more ultraviolet

1684
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:30,400
light.

1685
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:34,840
So in general, the hotter something is if it's a black body, which is mostly a star,

1686
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:40,360
stars are mostly black bodies or really close to black bodies in terms of their spectra,

1687
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:46,320
then it's brighter overall wavelength and the peak of the brightness moves to be shorter

1688
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,320
and shorter and shorter wavelengths.

1689
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:53,800
All right, so the law for black body says the wavelength maximum, the maximum wavelength

1690
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:59,280
of the peak of the curve just depends on some little number B, which is a measurable number.

1691
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,680
And then you divide, it's the inverse of the temperature.

1692
01:57:01,680 --> 01:57:06,600
So the hotter it is, the shorter the wavelength is where the peak exists.

1693
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:14,800
And finally, how much energy gets dumped out of an object that has a particular temperature

1694
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,040
in Kelvin if it's a black body?

1695
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:24,520
The temperature of an object goes as the temperature, the energy output per surface area on the

1696
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:29,200
surface of the object goes like the temperature of the fourth power.

1697
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:34,400
So we take a standard sized patch and we take that patch, maybe it's the size of your hand

1698
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:39,040
or something, we put it on various things that are hot or cool and we measure the total

1699
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:44,160
energy output through a standard patch, say, you know, it's like 10 centimeters by centimeters

1700
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:47,280
or five centimeters by five centimeters, whatever it happens to be.

1701
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:51,720
The energy output through that standard patch will go like the temperature of the fourth

1702
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,720
power.

1703
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:58,000
So something that's twice as hot as something else will emit 16 times as much energy.

1704
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,480
Something that's 10 times as hot will emit 10,000 times as much energy.

1705
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:08,080
And something that's 100 times as hot will emit 100 million times as much energy.

1706
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:15,440
So the hotter it is, the more energy it puts out and it's a very fast function of temperature.

1707
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:21,620
So these are our basic concepts of stellar, of stars, and it makes them pretty easy.

1708
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:23,520
Stars are pretty close to black bodies.

1709
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:25,600
If it's hotter, it's brighter.

1710
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,880
If it's hotter, it's bluer.

1711
01:58:27,880 --> 01:58:30,260
That's really what we really care about.

1712
01:58:30,260 --> 01:58:34,920
So when we take about these, when we look at all the stars that we see in the sky and

1713
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:40,440
then we look at their stellar spectra, we now have a pretty good firm foundation of what

1714
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:41,720
we can look at.

1715
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:46,960
And we take the spectra of a star and we see that O stars are bluer compared to M stars

1716
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:49,160
so we know what that means.

1717
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:54,960
And now then we can use the Johnson's filter system to uniquely determine the temperature

1718
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,360
of a star.

1719
01:58:56,360 --> 01:59:01,640
All we have to do is calibrate using the spectra on high level calibration.

1720
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:06,000
What the spectrum of a star is, like an O star and M star, G star, whatever.

1721
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,800
And we learn what the average spectrum of those are with their temperatures are according

1722
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,080
to spectra.

1723
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:16,880
And then we can step it down and you do it easier by saying, well, look at the colors

1724
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:23,760
and the B minus V. The B minus V color uniquely determines the temperature of a star.

1725
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:29,040
So all we have to do in order to learn about something very important about the star, meaning

1726
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:34,280
how fast the atoms are moving on average at the surface of the star or right at the

1727
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:41,160
inside of the star, is take a picture with two filters in front of it, say the B filter

1728
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:45,720
of Johnson and the V filter of Johnson, put pictures in front of those things and difference

1729
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,640
the brightness between the two.

1730
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:50,560
And once we do that, we know the color index.

1731
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:55,520
The color index is uniquely determined by the temperature.

1732
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:57,720
So this is an amazing consequence.

1733
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:04,720
And those colors, the B minus V colors, transition relatively smoothly from the hot to the cold.

1734
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:06,120
There's some lumps along the way.

1735
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:12,840
But in general, the more negative the color, the bluer, the more positive the B minus V

1736
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:15,880
color, the redder and cooler.

1737
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:18,560
B minus V negative, hotter, hotter, hotter, bluer.

1738
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:22,080
B minus V positive, cooler, cooler, cooler, redder.

1739
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:25,520
So we can go on and on with those kind of stuff and we will.

1740
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:29,680
So this is a really interesting thing where you take the concept of the magnitude system

1741
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:35,480
and apply it to some deep physics about the nature of how atoms move inside an object.

1742
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:42,520
And we'll talk more about that next time.

1743
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:43,520
Hello, this is Jason Kendall.

1744
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,680
Welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.

1745
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:49,680
Today we're going to be talking about spectroscopy.

1746
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:55,480
Spectroscopy is the study of how light interacts with matter and how the interaction of matter

1747
02:00:55,640 --> 02:01:02,480
with light betrays itself and gets transmitted through space to us so we can receive it.

1748
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:06,560
Spectroscopy is simply the way we take the light that's coming from a distance source

1749
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:12,560
and use some method by which we can break it apart into a spectrum to see how the intensity

1750
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:16,200
of the light varies with wavelength or frequency.

1751
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:21,400
So an easy way to think about this is allow normal white light to pass through a prism

1752
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,760
and then you'll see a rainbow effect.

1753
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:29,200
Well typically a rainbow effect is pretty hard to see unless of course there's a very

1754
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:35,840
narrow opening through which that passes the light in a very narrow beam and that narrow

1755
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:37,960
beam then goes through the prism.

1756
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:42,880
If it's a general wave of light that goes through it or an ambient then the prism will

1757
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,440
not necessarily be a create a spectrum.

1758
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:49,040
Well it will create a spectrum but it will be harder to see.

1759
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:53,600
So for us to make it better we usually take the source, whatever it is, send it through

1760
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:57,200
a narrow slit so that it becomes a ray or a beam.

1761
02:01:57,200 --> 02:02:00,400
We don't care about losing all that light because we're just going to analyze the light

1762
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,600
that comes to us from there.

1763
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:07,520
We pass it through a prism, the prism breaks apart the light because the inside of glass,

1764
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:11,520
the speed of light is different for different wavelengths and so it spreads the light apart

1765
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:16,240
into its constituent wavelengths or frequencies and then we take a picture of the incident

1766
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:22,520
light after it goes through the prism and that is the study of spectroscopy.

1767
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:26,840
Then divides the light up so that we can see the intensity at given wavelengths or frequencies

1768
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:32,280
and that we know exactly how that thing is interacting with the light, meaning the prism.

1769
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:35,840
So we don't have to worry about the prism's interaction of the light, we just worry about

1770
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:38,480
the origin of the source.

1771
02:02:38,480 --> 02:02:42,200
So if we then look at more common things like if we take a prism, just a garden household

1772
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:45,720
variety prism or a crystal, you notice that there's always a pretty rainbow that comes

1773
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:47,240
off of the sunlight.

1774
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:52,040
Well pretty rainbows from the sunlight are indicated here in this image from the McMath

1775
02:02:52,040 --> 02:02:59,320
Solar Observatory down in Tucson, Arizona run by NOAO and this rainbow that we always

1776
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:04,720
see has actually some darker spots in it and those darker spots are the shadows of the

1777
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:07,720
slit through which we passed the sunlight.

1778
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:16,720
So that's what we call the absorption lines because we make a vertical line slit through

1779
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:23,560
which we pass the sunlight and that sunlight then passes into our spectroscope and that

1780
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:27,600
spectroscope might just simply be a prism or it might be some other device like in a

1781
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:31,680
shell spectrograph or something like that or reflecting off of the surface.

1782
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:37,880
But at the angle what we see is we see a series of dark lines on the spectrum and those are

1783
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:42,740
places where it simply is dimmer than the surrounding continuum.

1784
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:47,220
So the rainbow itself we call it the continuum or the continuous spectrum and there are

1785
02:03:47,220 --> 02:03:52,380
absorption features which are darker than the surrounding continuum.

1786
02:03:52,380 --> 02:03:58,180
So the sun's spectrum is actually what we call an absorption spectrum.

1787
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:01,180
There is light that's been absorbed from the continuum.

1788
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:07,340
Alright so there's a different kind of spectrum as well where there's bright emission on top

1789
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:08,700
of a dark background.

1790
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:13,260
So perhaps the material is not emitting light at all frequencies maybe it's emitting light

1791
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:18,420
at specific frequencies and if the material is emitting it only at specific frequencies

1792
02:04:18,420 --> 02:04:23,220
not with a rainbow but with specific wavelengths of light then if we pass it through a spectroscope

1793
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:28,060
we see the lines of emission that we put here.

1794
02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:32,260
What's funny we call them lines and that's simply because when we talk about emission

1795
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:38,660
lines or absorption lines that's simply because we're using a slit type opening and so we're

1796
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:41,340
actually seeing the image of the slit.

1797
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:46,860
So in an absorption spectrum or I'm sorry in an emission spectrum such as these the

1798
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:52,180
emission spectrum themselves that's the image of the slit through which the light is going.

1799
02:04:52,180 --> 02:04:56,420
And so you'll see that the image of the slit the appearance of the line is the same for

1800
02:04:56,420 --> 02:04:57,420
each one.

1801
02:04:57,420 --> 02:05:00,580
It's just the color is different and the wavelength is different.

1802
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:04,900
So that's interesting and we also notice that they're kind of distinct.

1803
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:10,260
Well emission spectra are fascinating because what you can where you can get them is if

1804
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:17,700
you take say sodium, sodium chloride, table salt and you hold it in a Bunsen burner and

1805
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:22,460
you hold it like a bit of table salt in like a metal piece of metal and you put it over

1806
02:05:22,460 --> 02:05:27,460
a Bunsen burner and heat it up till it glows then the flame that comes off the Bunsen burner

1807
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:32,100
will have a particular wavelength and if you look at the lights that is coming off of the

1808
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:36,380
burning salt that comes off of there you get a specific set of wavelengths and those are

1809
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:37,380
emission spectra.

1810
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:41,900
Now you'll get a sodium spectrum and of course since it's table salt you'll also get a chlorine

1811
02:05:41,900 --> 02:05:42,900
spectrum as well.

1812
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:47,740
What really we care about like the sodium spectrum but you see that a noble gas such

1813
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:52,340
as neon will have a different spectrum and mercury vapor has a different spectrum and

1814
02:05:52,340 --> 02:05:57,500
ubiquitous hydrogen throughout the cosmos has a specific spectrum.

1815
02:05:57,500 --> 02:06:02,260
So what's funny about all these emission spectra is that it doesn't matter where you get the

1816
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:07,260
material from say hydrogen or helium or neon or sodium chloride or something or when you

1817
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:10,940
get it or from whom you get it it doesn't matter.

1818
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:15,260
All you have to do is heat it up such that it becomes vaporous and it will emit the same

1819
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:20,900
exact emission spectrum and so therefore everything has its own fingerprint.

1820
02:06:20,900 --> 02:06:24,220
Hydrogen is the same thing no matter where you get your hydrogen from.

1821
02:06:24,220 --> 02:06:28,180
Hydrogen has the same fingerprint no matter what and we call these things fingerprints

1822
02:06:28,180 --> 02:06:34,820
because the emission spectra is it exactly the same wavelengths or frequencies every

1823
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:39,660
single time you measure it which is very interesting which tells you something about the nature

1824
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:41,020
of the matter.

1825
02:06:41,020 --> 02:06:46,420
So what what emission lines can be done and specifically we're going to be talking about

1826
02:06:46,420 --> 02:06:52,380
what are called Kirchhoff's laws of spectroscopy and Kirchhoff was his full name is Gustav Kirchhoff

1827
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:57,620
and in the mid 19th century he was doing a whole bunch of experimental physics and he

1828
02:06:57,620 --> 02:07:01,620
worked with the guy who invented the Bunsen burner Mr. Bunsen and they did a bunch of

1829
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:06,940
spectroscopy and what he found were the following three laws.

1830
02:07:06,940 --> 02:07:12,820
Kirchhoff's laws first say that emission lines are produced at single frequencies up behind

1831
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:20,660
in front of a dark background if you're looking at a hot rarefied gas that has no bright emission

1832
02:07:20,660 --> 02:07:25,900
source or no bright continuum behind it it's just a gas that you see with nothing right

1833
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:26,900
behind it.

1834
02:07:26,900 --> 02:07:31,780
So you get specific wavelengths appearing at specific brightness at specific wavelengths

1835
02:07:31,780 --> 02:07:37,020
and that comes from a hot gas and that is one of Kirchhoff's laws of spectroscopy.

1836
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:42,620
The next one is if you take a continuous source like a light bulb like an incandescent light

1837
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:49,740
bulb which gives a black body type of radiation and that is in front and that is behind a

1838
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:55,020
cool gas maybe it's the same gas maybe it's hydrogen gas that's cooler than the bulb.

1839
02:07:55,020 --> 02:08:03,740
Well as the light from the hot hot bulb passes through the cooler gas the cool gas absorbs

1840
02:08:03,740 --> 02:08:11,100
the light and the absorption then dims the light at specific frequencies and those specific

1841
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:16,100
frequencies where it gets dimmed then get passed through we see it as a spectrum and

1842
02:08:16,100 --> 02:08:21,180
we see something like the solar spectrum but when we look carefully we actually see

1843
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:26,180
something more interesting deeper in just a bit and so we can actually relate Kirchhoff's

1844
02:08:26,180 --> 02:08:35,620
laws to as a trio of things because a hot opaque body such as a light bulb emits a continuous

1845
02:08:35,620 --> 02:08:41,740
spectrum something hot and opaque emits a continuous spectrum something hot and opaque

1846
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:49,300
that is behind a cloud of cooler gas that emits that we see if we look through the cooler

1847
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:55,540
gas to the hot source we will see an absorption spectrum.

1848
02:08:55,540 --> 02:09:01,140
Now if we look at a quarter to that and just look at the gas that did the absorbing of

1849
02:09:01,140 --> 02:09:04,380
the light we will see an emission spectrum.

1850
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:10,620
So really Kirchhoff's laws are three sides of the same situation you can either look

1851
02:09:10,620 --> 02:09:14,740
straight at the continuous the straight at the hot dense object and you'll see a continuous

1852
02:09:14,740 --> 02:09:21,100
object a continuous source you'll look at the cloud that's sitting off to the side of

1853
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:25,660
the absorption of the hot object and look through the cloud at the hot body and you'll

1854
02:09:25,660 --> 02:09:29,740
see an absorption spectrum or you'll look off to the side of just the emission light

1855
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:34,940
just the hot cloud that will cooler cloud compared to the hot body and you'll see an

1856
02:09:34,940 --> 02:09:39,900
emission spectrum so they're all part of the same thing and that means that as we look

1857
02:09:39,940 --> 02:09:46,700
at these objects that the emission lines and the absorption lines are at exactly the same

1858
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:52,380
wavelengths and that makes sense because let's say it's a hydrogen cloud gas and hydrogen

1859
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:58,860
will absorb and emit at exactly the same wavelengths it's not like it absorbs at one wavelength

1860
02:09:58,860 --> 02:10:05,140
and emits at another you know it emits at the same exact wavelength that it absorbs that's

1861
02:10:05,140 --> 02:10:09,620
interesting so that's telling you something about the nature of matter the nature of matter

1862
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:16,020
itself and Gustav Kirchhoff did all the work in spectroscopy well before the advent of quantum

1863
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:21,940
mechanics and the model of the the Bohr model of the atom so as we look at the nature of what

1864
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:27,540
matter is he didn't know about all this stuff so he derived these laws empirically and these

1865
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:32,260
observations then had to be accounted for with the advent of quantum mechanics which they were

1866
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:39,940
so most importantly is that the setup of the spectroscope tells us an enormous amount

1867
02:10:39,940 --> 02:10:45,940
about the nature of the material so we can tip it depends on what you how you wish to view things

1868
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:51,460
or what is possible for you to view you can set up an experimental apparatus in many many ways

1869
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:58,100
in order to do spectroscopy but it's typically pretty easy and dirt well not easy typically

1870
02:10:58,820 --> 02:11:04,340
it's helpful to start with an emission spectrum in order to identify exactly what material you're

1871
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:08,340
looking at and then hopefully through some chemistry you can determine really what you're

1872
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:14,580
looking at but spectroscopy itself is considered to be probably one of the most prevalently used

1873
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:22,660
science device scientific tools at our disposal to understand exactly what makes up an some kind

1874
02:11:22,660 --> 02:11:30,500
of object so Kirchhoff's laws were were were developed in the mid early 19th mid 19th century

1875
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:36,420
and refined until the early we're not understood of why they behaved until the mid 20th century

1876
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:41,860
now what can you get out of spectroscopy well the first thing is because every chemical element

1877
02:11:41,860 --> 02:11:48,580
has its own particular fingerprint or signature every single element that must be present in there

1878
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:55,140
must emit light or absorb light so you can tell the composition of what's in the what's in the gas

1879
02:11:55,140 --> 02:12:01,460
that you're absorbing or what the nature of the cool gas in front of the hot body is in addition

1880
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:08,020
the spectrum changes a little bit if you're looking at ionized gas so if you ionize a gas

1881
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:14,420
meaning the electron gets blown out of the atom and if it's blown out of the atom then the electric

1882
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:19,380
field changes a little bit which changes the spectrum just slightly and so not only do you

1883
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:24,900
have to make all these fingerprint catalogues of emission spectrum but you also have to try to get

1884
02:12:24,900 --> 02:12:29,620
the emission spectrum of ionized gases as well which really becomes kind of a pain because the

1885
02:12:29,620 --> 02:12:37,300
more you ionize a heavy element the the actual the spectrum itself changes considerably and then

1886
02:12:37,300 --> 02:12:42,340
if you then take it and we were just talking simple atomic spectra atomic elements if molecules

1887
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:48,660
are involved like such as water or carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide or deoxyribonucleic acid or

1888
02:12:48,660 --> 02:12:55,060
RNA or anything if you used to do spectroscopy on complex molecules or even simple molecules

1889
02:12:55,060 --> 02:13:01,860
every single molecule has its own individual spectrum and some of them can be incredibly complex

1890
02:13:01,860 --> 02:13:09,940
and then we know that poly aromatic poly aromatic cyclic hydrocarbons are actually present in space

1891
02:13:09,940 --> 02:13:16,100
and can be observed because of their spectrum in fact ethyl alcohol has been found in space and some

1892
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:22,340
extraordinarily simple amino acids have been found in space so this is really interesting we can know

1893
02:13:22,340 --> 02:13:27,620
something about the nature of which molecules are present not even having to go there it's really

1894
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:34,260
fascinating now the other thing that's interesting about the nature of spectroscopy is that because

1895
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:39,780
it takes energy in order to we had a hot remember in a hot bulb in front of a cool gas

1896
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:47,380
that hot bulb provides energy into the gas and that gas then reacts to it well if the temperature

1897
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:53,140
of the gas is not hot enough then it might not react or it might not absorb certain that we

1898
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:58,500
pray it might not it might not get the wavelengths of light it needs in or it doesn't get the energy

1899
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:05,620
it needs in order to hop up and down or we can also then determine that by looking at how the

1900
02:14:05,620 --> 02:14:10,260
gas is absorbing or emitting at different wavelengths or frequencies we can actually

1901
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:16,820
determine the temperature of that gas so if you have a gas full of hydrogen and it's in front

1902
02:14:16,820 --> 02:14:22,020
it's above a star if that gas is above right above a star maybe it's the atmosphere of the star

1903
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:28,420
and the atmosphere is cooler than the star then we might see a big absorption feature for say hydrogen

1904
02:14:28,420 --> 02:14:34,420
but let's say the star is extremely extremely hot and the electrons are ionized off of the hydrogen

1905
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:40,260
atom then you won't get any absorption at all even though hydrogen is present or maybe the star is

1906
02:14:40,260 --> 02:14:47,220
very very very cool and you don't get any absorption of hydrogen because the star doesn't have enough

1907
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:52,340
energy to kick the electrons out of the lower orbits of the of hydrogen into higher orbits

1908
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:57,700
well this could also and spectroscopy the spectroscopy can tell you something about the

1909
02:14:57,700 --> 02:15:04,100
temperature of it if you then look at the nature of the lines themselves we can find that sometimes

1910
02:15:04,100 --> 02:15:12,900
the lines are not exactly as narrow as we think so maybe you in a laboratory you measure the

1911
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:18,020
frequency of hydrogen the emission lines of hydrogen and then what you do is you take that

1912
02:15:18,020 --> 02:15:22,900
hot gas and put it under extraordinary pressure if it's under extraordinary pressure you're going

1913
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:29,620
to find that the lines themselves these emission lines will be broader because as it's under pressure

1914
02:15:29,620 --> 02:15:34,500
the atoms the hydrogen atoms are moving at a higher speed which means that some some of them

1915
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:39,940
are Doppler shifted towards you away from you from your emission which means that as the energy

1916
02:15:39,940 --> 02:15:47,380
goes into and out of the the energy as the small as the atoms of hydrogen are moving fast

1917
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:52,420
as they're emitting then that can Doppler shift it either towards you away from you and thus

1918
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:57,540
broaden the lines when it's called pressure broadening and the same thing happens with density

1919
02:15:57,540 --> 02:16:02,340
so if you have a high dense atmosphere you can get different kinds of broadening so each of these

1920
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:09,060
things can be studied inside of the spectrum of the star and different kinds of broadening

1921
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:14,180
or different profiles to the line meaning not just that the line is like okay it's totally

1922
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:20,340
dark and then bank i've got this one bright thing like a spike maybe it's shaped like a like a like

1923
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:24,820
a funnel and we have funnel type shapes maybe you've got wings and then a funnel there's all

1924
02:16:24,820 --> 02:16:31,540
sorts of ways that this that matter can interact with light and the proof the profile of the line

1925
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:37,700
meaning exactly how does it vary around that particular wavelength can tell you a lot about

1926
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:43,060
the nature of the star itself or whatever you're looking at and there's an incredible amount of

1927
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:49,860
information that gets carried along with it and that gives us the physical data about what's

1928
02:16:49,860 --> 02:16:56,100
happening at the conditions of the matter when the light was emitted and because now we can

1929
02:16:56,100 --> 02:17:02,500
understand the elements of such as pressure and density and temperature and composition now we

1930
02:17:02,500 --> 02:17:08,580
can do physics and the physics then allows us to understand what's really going on and that's

1931
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:14,500
what we that's what so spectroscopy and the invention of the spectroscope and if the the

1932
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:22,740
invention of Gustavs laws as they began introduced the concept of astrophysics to astronomy because

1933
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:28,820
up until the concept of astrophysics up until the concept of spectroscopy really took hold

1934
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:34,500
we could never really know anything about what was going on in the stars all we could learn

1935
02:17:34,500 --> 02:17:40,100
is that this thing's moving it's going across the sky it's bright but we didn't really understand

1936
02:17:40,100 --> 02:17:46,020
the spectrum so it took some time before we said well look if there must be an absorption spectrum

1937
02:17:46,020 --> 02:17:51,300
coming from that star well stars are very dim so it took a long time for the technology to come

1938
02:17:51,300 --> 02:17:56,340
around such as you could actually make a spectrum of a star photographically at least but once we

1939
02:17:56,340 --> 02:18:02,180
understood the nature of the spectrum of a star we now then could transform astronomy

1940
02:18:02,180 --> 02:18:07,700
into astrophysics and that allows us to learn exactly how something is happening even though

1941
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:12,500
it's hundreds of light years away or thousands of light years away or millions of light years away

1942
02:18:12,500 --> 02:18:18,580
because we trust that all of the physics that happens here in the laboratory and this is a

1943
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:23,860
really big assumption this is one of the most important underlying assumptions about all astrophysics

1944
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:29,380
due to spectroscopy is that since all the laws of the physics are the same everywhere in the

1945
02:18:29,380 --> 02:18:36,660
universe at all times of the universe is existence meaning from all the way ago to all the way today

1946
02:18:36,660 --> 02:18:44,660
that the laws of physics themselves are the same then we can trust spectroscopy because we only get

1947
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:51,620
a messenger of light so that's a really interesting assumption that all of light and all of matter is

1948
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:59,060
the same here as it was there and as we measure the laboratory wavelengths of hydrogen and then

1949
02:18:59,060 --> 02:19:05,380
we look at some distant quasar and that distant quasar emits light and it absorbs light and

1950
02:19:05,380 --> 02:19:13,620
there's absorption of light as it travels to us through the intergalactic medium then we can trust

1951
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:20,100
that we can actually understand what's happening between us and the quasar and even at the quasar

1952
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:26,420
that emitted the light say 10 billion years ago and the light traveled for 10 billion years so

1953
02:19:27,060 --> 02:19:32,740
the universality of the laws of physics is what we trust because we've never been to the stars

1954
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:38,740
we probably never will be to the stars but the physics of light interact with matter

1955
02:19:38,740 --> 02:19:44,260
allows us to reach with our imagination out to the stars and learn about what is happening over

1956
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:50,180
there and we'll see the effect of spectroscopy everywhere throughout all of these courses

1957
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:53,220
and that's how we actually know what's going on over there

1958
02:19:58,420 --> 02:20:03,300
hello this is jason kendall and welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures today

1959
02:20:03,300 --> 02:20:08,900
we're going to be talking about the nature of matter itself what is the matter with matter

1960
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:15,140
matter is that stuff that makes up the universe in fact let's even make a more interesting definition

1961
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:23,540
for matter matter has mass and as mass it must be pushed around by forces so anything that can

1962
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:31,220
accelerate a mass through a force is how matter interacts with other matter kind of a weird way

1963
02:20:31,220 --> 02:20:34,980
of thinking about it but that's old newton's laws so we just go all the way back to newton's

1964
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:42,580
laws and say there's some stuff that we'll call matter and matter may be accelerated or decelerated

1965
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:47,620
and the thing that does that accelerating or deceleration is called a force and so there are

1966
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:52,980
four different ways the universe has of pushing things around and they're called the four fundamental

1967
02:20:52,980 --> 02:20:59,620
forces of nature one of them is gravity and gravity obviously attracts every mass attracts

1968
02:20:59,620 --> 02:21:05,380
every other mass and causes it to accelerate that's the nature of gravity well we also we know by

1969
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:11,140
by einstein now and just newton's laws work very well but we know einstein's law einstein's

1970
02:21:11,140 --> 02:21:16,340
version of gravity says that matter curves spacetime and it falls inside of that curved

1971
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:21,060
spacetime but what we can think about let's go back to newton's laws newton's version of gravity

1972
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:27,220
we have two pieces of matter that then gravitate to each other and they accelerate towards each other

1973
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:31,700
that's what we really care about is the acceleration of matter well what's the other thing well we

1974
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:35,540
could put a pair of charges on top of it we could have a plus charge and a minus charge an electric

1975
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:39,540
charge and they can if they're the same type of charge they repel if they have the opposites then

1976
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:44,500
they'll attract each other and that will cause the matter to accelerate the electromagnetic

1977
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:50,020
force causes an acceleration and the thing that we call the electromagnetic force that which

1978
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:55,460
transmits the force in the case of gravity it's the curvature of spacetime but with the electromagnetic

1979
02:21:55,460 --> 02:22:01,380
force it's the transmission of light photo photons back and forth between the charge particles as

1980
02:22:01,380 --> 02:22:06,820
they move and vibrate they change the electric field and that vibrating moving electric field

1981
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:12,420
then indicates how that thing should be pushed or pulled by the charges that as the light is

1982
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:18,260
receiving them all right so the electromagnetic force is another way that matter can be accelerated

1983
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:24,580
or moved and the next one is the strong and weak nuclear forces the strong nuclear force holds

1984
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:30,340
holds protons together inside of the nucleus of an atom and holds neutrons and protons all

1985
02:22:30,340 --> 02:22:34,900
inside a nucleus as well as holding the constituent quarks of an atom but we'll talk about that

1986
02:22:34,900 --> 02:22:38,900
shortly so the strong and weak nuclear forces only really come into play when we talk about

1987
02:22:38,900 --> 02:22:45,620
nuclear particles or the centers of atoms all right so what do we mean by matter all right so

1988
02:22:45,620 --> 02:22:51,700
I just said it's the thing that gets pushed around when their force is acted upon it all right so you

1989
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:58,820
have to have some way of interacting well gravity says that if it's got mass it will you have something

1990
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:04,660
to do with the gravitational force if it also has charge then the mass that has the charge will

1991
02:23:04,660 --> 02:23:11,060
then be accelerated if it has it if it interacts via the weak nuclear force by the exchange of

1992
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:17,140
w or z bosons or it exchanges or interacts by the by the strong nuclear force the interchange of

1993
02:23:17,140 --> 02:23:23,220
blue odds then the matter then will accelerate because of these interactions but what makes

1994
02:23:23,220 --> 02:23:28,900
up matter well matter in the universe is comes in from very big things to very small things and

1995
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:32,900
we'll start with the tiniest like quarks and leptons which are fundamental particles you can't

1996
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:37,860
break them apart any further when there are subatomic particles like protons and neutrons

1997
02:23:37,860 --> 02:23:42,180
which are composed of quarks and then you think about electrons which are fundamental park

1998
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:47,780
particles themselves the fundamental particle called a lepton is an electron and it can't

1999
02:23:47,780 --> 02:23:51,940
be broken apart and then you can take protons and neutrons and smash put them together and

2000
02:23:51,940 --> 02:23:56,420
then you get a nucleus of an atom and if you put some electrons around it you've got an atom if you

2001
02:23:56,420 --> 02:24:02,580
put atoms together with next to each other and you've got molecules if you have multi huge molecules

2002
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:08,180
you can have a bucky ball or a bucky chain or carbon nanotube or you can have a crystal of iron

2003
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:13,860
or a nice little quartz crystal of amethyst or something or you can have deoxyribonucleic acid

2004
02:24:13,860 --> 02:24:20,580
or just water H2O any many of these things complex molecules and simple molecules and then you can

2005
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:25,540
take all sorts of molecules and pump them together make crystals out of there make glomerations on

2006
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:29,700
and put some over here and some over there and pack them together and you might get a person

2007
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:36,820
or an elephant or a giraffe or a car or a planet or a star or a galaxy you know all sorts of stuff

2008
02:24:36,820 --> 02:24:40,820
you can make out of atoms and just think of atoms as your building blocks of everything and that's

2009
02:24:40,820 --> 02:24:47,300
what you can make it out of so the ordinary matter in the universe is what we call atoms and it makes

2010
02:24:47,300 --> 02:24:54,420
up all the stuff that we know so what's an atom all right so an atom has a nucleus and a nucleus

2011
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:58,900
has some electrons swarming around it and the cartoon thing that we always see and always have

2012
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:04,180
seen for a long time that's a really helpful visualization but it really doesn't look like

2013
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:08,260
that and we'll talk about what we mean by that next time but we'll look at it but we'll kind of

2014
02:25:08,260 --> 02:25:14,020
go with this cartoon for a little bit and the cartoon says that in the center of the atom

2015
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:19,540
there is a nucleus and the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons and the neutrons are

2016
02:25:19,540 --> 02:25:25,140
uncharged and electrically neutral they don't do anything they're a little bit more massive than the

2017
02:25:25,140 --> 02:25:30,900
proton but the neutron itself just a tiny bit more massive than the proton but the proton has a positive

2018
02:25:30,900 --> 02:25:36,660
charge so the proton's positive charge is part of the nucleus and the neutrons positive charge

2019
02:25:36,660 --> 02:25:43,460
could be in a nucleus and they're surrounded by a cloud of electrons and there is if it's a neutral

2020
02:25:43,460 --> 02:25:50,340
atom then there's one electron for every proton that exists in the atom so you got one in one

2021
02:25:51,060 --> 02:25:56,660
if it's ionized then there will be fewer there will be fewer electrons than there are protons

2022
02:25:56,660 --> 02:26:00,340
and you can also have ions where there are more electrons that's kind of weird you'd have to have

2023
02:26:00,340 --> 02:26:05,460
a very strange arrangement so the electrons don't fully screen the protons or it might be a dense

2024
02:26:05,460 --> 02:26:10,260
environment where the electrons are being forced upon the atom but in general we can think of

2025
02:26:10,260 --> 02:26:15,780
that electrons and protons come one to one with respect to each other and when they go one to one

2026
02:26:15,780 --> 02:26:20,820
we see a cloud of electrons and we have a neutral atom i what's funny is is also that we talked

2027
02:26:20,820 --> 02:26:25,380
about the fundamental particles so an electron is a fundamental particle and a proton is not

2028
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:32,980
it is a subatomic particle it's composed of quarks but a proton is about 1800 times the mass of an

2029
02:26:32,980 --> 02:26:38,740
electron and if we think about how much mass that is a typical person college students say here at

2030
02:26:38,740 --> 02:26:44,260
William Patterson the typical student is about if they're eating ramen on a Saturday night as they're

2031
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:48,340
studying for their finals then they'll meet be like 140 150 pounds because they're losing weight

2032
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:56,580
and they're all stressed out so but now you take 1800 of those and that's approximately 100 tons

2033
02:26:56,580 --> 02:27:03,460
so an electron let's say a normal person is the mass of an electron then the mass of the proton

2034
02:27:03,460 --> 02:27:11,060
would be 100 tons i'm just trying to think of what exactly would be 100 tons i mean dump trucks a

2035
02:27:11,060 --> 02:27:15,860
huge dump trucks well we'd have to look at earth mover dump trucks those enormous things that are

2036
02:27:15,860 --> 02:27:20,740
in mining operations or strip mining operations those are hundreds of tons so there's some big

2037
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:27,300
things that are hundreds of tons and we can think about wow me compared to 100 tons and what is okay

2038
02:27:27,300 --> 02:27:34,420
so some pickup trucks or some large trucks that you might go by are about a ton so 100 pickup

2039
02:27:34,420 --> 02:27:41,780
trucks or 100 suvs or 100 large cars compare and compact them together and call that one object

2040
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:46,900
is equivalent is the mass of one thing the best the proton compared to say you

2041
02:27:46,900 --> 02:27:52,340
if you are an electron kind of interesting all right so now how are they distributed in space

2042
02:27:52,340 --> 02:27:56,100
according to this cartoon it makes it look oh everybody's all happy and joyful and the electrons

2043
02:27:56,100 --> 02:28:00,660
are really big and the protons are really big and the neutrons are really big but they're not

2044
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:08,420
they're incredibly tiny the typical size scale of of an atom is on the order of 10 to the minus

2045
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:16,260
10th meters we're about an angstrom or so and most of the of the atom itself is empty space in fact

2046
02:28:16,260 --> 02:28:24,100
only one part in 10 to the 15th of an atom is actually taken up by the matter of the atom the

2047
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:30,180
rest is the fields of of electromagnetism between the electron and the proton the disturbed field

2048
02:28:30,180 --> 02:28:35,220
that actually keeps the the electron in place and the protons where it tells the electrons where

2049
02:28:35,220 --> 02:28:41,540
they are in any event this is really interesting because we think well how empty is it if we were

2050
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:48,500
to say take a lot a relatively decent size building or a house and a typical house might be say 30

2051
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:54,180
meters across specifically if we go to the Museum of Natural History we see the Hayden sphere is

2052
02:28:54,180 --> 02:28:59,780
exactly 30 meters across that big glassed-in ball at the Hayden planetarium in New York City

2053
02:28:59,780 --> 02:29:04,740
so at the Museum of Natural History in fact there's a really fun exhibit in there that shows

2054
02:29:04,740 --> 02:29:11,540
the size of a proton compared to the atom and in fact the 30 meter wide which is 100 feet wide

2055
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:18,580
100 feet foot wide ball compared is say the size of an atom somewhere in the surface of that ball

2056
02:29:18,580 --> 02:29:23,060
is where the electron is for hydrogen it's called just plain old hydrogen hydrogen atom which only

2057
02:29:23,060 --> 02:29:28,900
has one proton and one electron so if we're looking at that a typical atom of hydrogen we'll have one

2058
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:33,780
proton and one electron the electron is somewhere on the surface of that ball and the proton is at

2059
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:40,420
the center of that ball how big is the proton it's about a six point font of a printed a six

2060
02:29:40,420 --> 02:29:49,220
point printed font so it's the size of a moat of dust so that's how small the proton is it is a moat

2061
02:29:49,220 --> 02:29:57,620
of dust compared to something a hundred feet in diameter that's amazing so most of the of all atoms

2062
02:29:57,620 --> 02:30:04,900
is completely empty space electrons are really tiny so and the electrons are about 100 times smaller

2063
02:30:04,900 --> 02:30:11,140
than a proton in terms of size which is fascinating so an electron is a tiny tiny tiny tiny thing

2064
02:30:11,140 --> 02:30:16,980
and even still the moat of dust compared to where the electron is on the surface of an atom

2065
02:30:16,980 --> 02:30:24,180
anyway so well how do we distinguish atoms well we we can have multiple protons in the nucleus

2066
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:28,580
so let's say we have multiple protons and these protons tend to be well they're always at the

2067
02:30:28,580 --> 02:30:33,300
nucleus but if you have one proton we call hydrogen you have two we call it helium three we call it

2068
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:40,180
lithium four we call it beryllium and then nitrogen carbon oxygen and so on the name of the element

2069
02:30:40,180 --> 02:30:45,460
tells you how many protons it has in it and so the atomic number is the number of protons

2070
02:30:45,460 --> 02:30:51,940
and every single atom every single atom every single element which is is chemically distinct

2071
02:30:51,940 --> 02:30:58,020
and operates and each of the chem the chemistry is different between each one so right now we know

2072
02:30:58,020 --> 02:31:04,180
that there are 118 elements that have been made about 24 of them have to actually be made in

2073
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:08,500
laboratories and they only live for like microseconds or nanoseconds before they fall apart

2074
02:31:09,140 --> 02:31:16,100
about 87 of them are metals meaning they have the capacity to to allow electrons to flow off of them

2075
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:23,540
into and they the valence electrons they can easily be stripped off 11 of them in in in naturally

2076
02:31:23,540 --> 02:31:29,780
well like normal human circumstances not too hot not too cold good enough for a human not too high in

2077
02:31:29,780 --> 02:31:35,780
the atmosphere not too far below the ground that 11 of them come as gases um two of them occur like

2078
02:31:35,780 --> 02:31:41,220
as liquids like mercury is one of them and bromines another a bunch of them are radioactive about 25

2079
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:47,860
or so uh and these are the chemical elements and only the most the most massive ones are only

2080
02:31:47,860 --> 02:31:54,420
formed in in um in in particle accelerators so when we look at the name we look at that we've

2081
02:31:54,420 --> 02:32:00,020
seen periodic tables in the past so let's look at how we read the name of the elements always the

2082
02:32:00,020 --> 02:32:05,540
number of protons the atomic number describes the name of the element and so if it's got one proton

2083
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:11,860
it's always hydrogen if it's got 23 protons it's always vanadium if it's got 19 protons it's always

2084
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:18,260
potassium if it's got 11 it's always sodium if it's got two it's always helium if it's got six it's

2085
02:32:18,260 --> 02:32:24,260
always carbon that's the name of it and so all of the names require are exactly what the atomic

2086
02:32:24,260 --> 02:32:28,900
number is now the funny thing is is that the names themselves then become abbreviated so hydrogen is

2087
02:32:28,900 --> 02:32:36,660
age beryllium is be lithium is li sodium of course is na gold is of course au oh my goodness

2088
02:32:36,660 --> 02:32:42,660
potassium is k what's going on here so basically most of them are revolutions but some of them

2089
02:32:42,660 --> 02:32:48,500
derive from greek and latin so we don't necessarily have a one-to-one with their with their revolutions

2090
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:52,900
and the names that are common in in say english but they would be common in other languages

2091
02:32:52,900 --> 02:32:58,500
so but the name is always no matter what language they're spoken in the name of the thing describes

2092
02:32:58,500 --> 02:33:02,900
the total number of protons and so there's a whole slog of them and the periodic table of

2093
02:33:02,900 --> 02:33:10,420
elements is is broken up into similar chemical behavior such as hydrogen and lithium and sodium

2094
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:18,820
readily readily readily give away their their electron and fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine

2095
02:33:18,820 --> 02:33:24,740
readily grab an electron and so they're not filled electron shells so they will take an electron

2096
02:33:24,740 --> 02:33:30,820
so the most reactive elements come on both sides of the periodic table so that's kind of how they

2097
02:33:30,820 --> 02:33:35,860
go and the farthest right ones are the noble gases and they hardly react anything because they're

2098
02:33:35,860 --> 02:33:42,420
like their electron shells are filled so when the the most abundant elements out of all of the

2099
02:33:42,420 --> 02:33:48,580
elements in the universe almost 75 percent of all the matter all the elements of the universe all

2100
02:33:48,580 --> 02:33:53,940
the matter of the universe is hydrogen and 25 percent of the matter in the universe is helium

2101
02:33:53,940 --> 02:34:01,940
and then oxygen carbon neon nitrogen silicon iron magnesium and sulfur come next and so all of the

2102
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:06,980
things beyond hydrogen and helium make up only about one percent of all the matter in the universe

2103
02:34:06,980 --> 02:34:13,140
so if we want to say what is the matter of the universe is hydrogen and it's helium that's pretty

2104
02:34:13,140 --> 02:34:17,380
much it all the other stuff the things that we're made out of the things that everything else that

2105
02:34:17,380 --> 02:34:23,780
we encounter that's made out of that's just really rare stuff and some of it's really rare compared

2106
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:28,180
to the rarity of it is so hydrogen and helium is everything in the universe and where's the

2107
02:34:28,180 --> 02:34:33,380
helium on earth well it's embedded inside of natural gas deposits and it comes to us as a result of

2108
02:34:33,380 --> 02:34:40,180
of emissions by the sun all right so remember we talked about the total number of protons to

2109
02:34:40,180 --> 02:34:45,220
get with the atomic number but remember we also said that neutrons can be in the core

2110
02:34:45,220 --> 02:34:51,060
in the in the nucleus of an atom so when neutrons are in the nucleus of an atom if they're differing

2111
02:34:51,060 --> 02:34:58,180
numbers we call them isotopes so they're isotope meaning isotopic meaning the the topos is the

2112
02:34:58,180 --> 02:35:03,220
number of protons and so the number of protons is always the same so hydrogen plain old hydrogen

2113
02:35:03,220 --> 02:35:09,620
has none no neutrons but if it has a neutron it's called deuterium and there's deuterium

2114
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:14,420
has two objects in the core it's called tritium if it is hydrogen with two

2115
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:22,580
neutrons attached to it in the nucleus so tritium though is radioactive and will readily decay

2116
02:35:22,580 --> 02:35:29,060
that that neutron will readily decay away but in every case there's all to make an atom with

2117
02:35:29,060 --> 02:35:33,540
deuterium it only takes even though there's two things in the nucleus there's only one electron

2118
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:38,260
because the proton has one charge and the neutron has no charge so if we look at something a little

2119
02:35:38,260 --> 02:35:44,740
bit bigger say carbon carbon 12 has six neutrons and six protons carbon 13 has six protons and seven

2120
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:50,980
neutrons carbon 14 has six protons and eight neutrons and once you get too many neutrons

2121
02:35:50,980 --> 02:35:56,660
tends to fall apart so isotopes with lots and lots and lots of neutrons tend to fall apart if they

2122
02:35:56,660 --> 02:36:03,540
have far and if they happen to have fewer neutrons than protons they will also fall apart fall apart

2123
02:36:03,620 --> 02:36:08,500
too so radioactive carbon is very familiar we call about radioactive carbon dating and carbon

2124
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:14,420
falls apart and what does falling apart mean we mean that it's radioactive and radioactivity

2125
02:36:14,420 --> 02:36:22,100
is a decay of a subatomic particle from one type of thing to another so tritium as i said was

2126
02:36:22,100 --> 02:36:29,620
radioactive tritium will spontaneously decay at some random interval a random atom a random nucleus

2127
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:34,740
of tritium will spontaneously one of the neutrons will go i don't think i want to be a neutron anymore

2128
02:36:34,740 --> 02:36:41,380
and turn into a proton and in so doing the the nucleus will spit out an electron and also spit

2129
02:36:41,380 --> 02:36:46,260
out a neutrino and those things will go away but now it's helium because there's two protons and one

2130
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:51,860
neutron so it's light helium so that's we call light helium or or yeah see it's got one neutron

2131
02:36:51,860 --> 02:36:59,780
less than the number of protons that's light helium and likewise carbon 14 decays to nitrogen 14

2132
02:36:59,780 --> 02:37:06,340
by one of the neutrons transforming itself into a proton and so carbon then which has six protons

2133
02:37:06,340 --> 02:37:12,580
becomes nitrogen which has seven so now we have seven and seven and the the nitrogen is happy

2134
02:37:13,460 --> 02:37:18,020
and in so decaying and switching from a proton from a neutron to a proton

2135
02:37:18,020 --> 02:37:23,460
an electron gets spitted spot out and a neutrino gets spot out and that in if a neutron is also all

2136
02:37:23,460 --> 02:37:29,860
by itself it'll spontaneously decay in about 11 minutes or so so these neutrons really don't

2137
02:37:29,860 --> 02:37:34,100
know how to stay together because the electron the proton and electron really want to fly apart

2138
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:39,140
and the the thing that's holding them together is the weak nuclear force and that's the reaction

2139
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:43,140
if you have a neutrino coming out you've got the weak nuclear forces which we talked about earlier

2140
02:37:43,140 --> 02:37:48,580
part so these things are all called beta decays you can also have an alpha decay where a full

2141
02:37:48,580 --> 02:37:54,100
helium nucleus of two protons and two neutrons gets spat out by a very massive very massive

2142
02:37:54,100 --> 02:38:00,020
nucleus like uranium or something like that uh you can also gamma decay where the nucleus itself

2143
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:08,340
is in an energized state and emits a very high energy light particle a very high energy photon

2144
02:38:08,340 --> 02:38:12,180
in the form of a gamma ray so wait a second that's where we get the gamma ray idea from

2145
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:18,660
is gamma rays are high energy light so we have alpha beta and gammas alpha particles are heavy

2146
02:38:18,660 --> 02:38:24,980
nuclei beta particles are electrons and gamma particles are photons and very high energy

2147
02:38:25,860 --> 02:38:30,340
and these things were given their names during the early years of studying radioactivity

2148
02:38:31,060 --> 02:38:36,500
back in the turn of the 19th century right around the turn of the 20th century in that area

2149
02:38:37,460 --> 02:38:42,260
so people name them that way and sometimes you'll always be hearing alpha particles or alpha decay

2150
02:38:42,260 --> 02:38:48,260
or alpha this that always means a helium nucleus and we consider beta decay or beta particles

2151
02:38:48,260 --> 02:38:52,580
and those are always electrons and the gamma rays what we know about gamma rays they're like

2152
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:58,980
and that's where that comes from so why we care about all this is because when we're looking at

2153
02:38:58,980 --> 02:39:04,660
astronomy we can't actually reach out to the stars and take a bucket of a distant star and bring it

2154
02:39:04,660 --> 02:39:10,740
home and see what's cooking in there we can't do that so we want to learn what is going on at

2155
02:39:10,740 --> 02:39:15,140
those distant stars and what's happening to the matter over there we wish to identify what kind

2156
02:39:15,140 --> 02:39:21,780
of matter it is and that's where we get Kirchhoff's laws of spectroscopy because every single element

2157
02:39:21,780 --> 02:39:28,500
on the periodic table has its own spectrum when it gets excited or gets collided into any

2158
02:39:28,500 --> 02:39:33,780
midst light if it'll absorb specific lights light energy and it'll emit those things exactly those

2159
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:40,580
wavelengths so every single chemical element in existence has its own individual spectrum

2160
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:46,180
and those spectra are always the same no matter what because every hydrogen atom is exactly the

2161
02:39:46,180 --> 02:39:52,100
same in the entire universe every carbon atom is the same in the entire universe different isotopes

2162
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:56,900
but they're the same they're always the same because they're just because protons are the same

2163
02:39:56,980 --> 02:40:00,980
everywhere in the universe and neutrons are the same everywhere in the universe and electrons are

2164
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:08,420
the same in everywhere in the universe so every atom is just like any other atom if it's the same

2165
02:40:08,420 --> 02:40:13,780
isotope and even if they're different isotopes they're almost the same because they just differ

2166
02:40:13,780 --> 02:40:18,820
by the total number of neutrons so and there's no difference between them other than the number

2167
02:40:18,820 --> 02:40:24,020
of neutrons but what's a neutron what's a proton what's an electron they're the same things everywhere

2168
02:40:24,020 --> 02:40:30,100
in the universe, and you stack them together to make atoms, and each individual atom and

2169
02:40:30,100 --> 02:40:33,180
all the molecules associated with them, well let's stick with atoms because we're talking

2170
02:40:33,180 --> 02:40:35,420
about elements for a second.

2171
02:40:35,420 --> 02:40:41,020
The atomic elements, each one of them has their own individual spectral signature, and

2172
02:40:41,020 --> 02:40:42,460
that can be discovered.

2173
02:40:42,460 --> 02:40:49,740
In fact, it was first discovered that these things existed as objects, spectroscopically,

2174
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:53,060
because we'd have to say, oh, what do we have in this gas?

2175
02:40:53,060 --> 02:40:57,740
If we have some rarefied gas that we cannot see, but yet it glows because of the energy

2176
02:40:57,740 --> 02:40:59,100
we're putting into it.

2177
02:40:59,100 --> 02:41:02,260
If it glows with that characteristic pink, it must be hydrogen.

2178
02:41:02,260 --> 02:41:06,500
If it glows in a particular different way, it's helium, and we break apart the spectrum

2179
02:41:06,500 --> 02:41:11,980
and we look at the spectrum of the thing as it's glowing, or maybe it's cool and we've

2180
02:41:11,980 --> 02:41:16,060
got something behind it that's hot that passes through the cool gas.

2181
02:41:16,060 --> 02:41:19,460
The absorption lines are exactly the same as the emission lines, and that's what we talked

2182
02:41:19,460 --> 02:41:23,580
about with Kirchhoff's Laws of Spectroscopy.

2183
02:41:23,580 --> 02:41:28,620
Every single element, every single atom is the same in the cosmos in terms of what they

2184
02:41:28,620 --> 02:41:33,420
are, meaning one carbon-12 atom is exactly the same as every other carbon-12 atom in

2185
02:41:33,420 --> 02:41:38,180
the universe, and they all have exactly the same spectral fingerprint.

2186
02:41:38,180 --> 02:41:45,380
That fundamental statement, that the spectra of all of these are identical, says that the

2187
02:41:45,380 --> 02:41:51,700
light interacts with the matter, interacts with carbon-12, no matter how it interacts,

2188
02:41:51,700 --> 02:41:53,740
all light interacts with everything.

2189
02:41:53,740 --> 02:41:59,340
That is part of an incredibly important idea called the Copernican Principle, which means

2190
02:41:59,340 --> 02:42:03,500
the cosmological principle says that there is no special place in the cosmos and that

2191
02:42:03,500 --> 02:42:09,020
all laws of physics are the same everywhere, and we will rely on that idea to get us out

2192
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:13,180
to the stars and learn what is out there.

2193
02:42:13,580 --> 02:42:18,540
What's funny is, is that this whole thing I discussed about the nature of these things,

2194
02:42:18,540 --> 02:42:24,820
it's not been known forever, so let's see, next time, how the history of the atom developed

2195
02:42:24,820 --> 02:42:25,820
through time.

2196
02:42:25,820 --> 02:42:35,020
Hello, this is Jason Kendall, and welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.

2197
02:42:35,020 --> 02:42:39,580
Today we're continuing on the history of the atom, where we talked last time about what

2198
02:42:39,580 --> 02:42:44,860
an atom is, what elements are, how they have protons and electrons and neutrons, and how

2199
02:42:44,860 --> 02:42:49,580
they're arranged in these orbits around them, and there's isotopes and so forth, but where

2200
02:42:49,580 --> 02:42:54,420
did this concept of the idea of the atom ever really come from?

2201
02:42:54,420 --> 02:42:56,540
So that's what we're going to talk about right now.

2202
02:42:56,540 --> 02:43:03,100
So the history of the atom is an interesting one, because it develops out of natural philosophy.

2203
02:43:03,100 --> 02:43:08,460
Natural philosophy is basically a way of talking about the world, philosophizing about the world

2204
02:43:08,460 --> 02:43:12,780
in a way that is consistent with how you perceive the world.

2205
02:43:12,780 --> 02:43:17,180
And so natural philosophy is a way of conducting science without having the tools to actually

2206
02:43:17,180 --> 02:43:21,900
be able to gather the evidence or analyze it, but you do it as rigorously as you can.

2207
02:43:21,900 --> 02:43:27,180
So let's take a couple of ideas about the nature of what we mean by matter, because stuff is

2208
02:43:27,180 --> 02:43:33,420
in existence and so stuff does things to other stuff, so you might want to say, well, what

2209
02:43:33,420 --> 02:43:36,340
exactly is matter?

2210
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:40,180
Some of the earliest recorded ideas about what the nature of matter are come from

2211
02:43:40,180 --> 02:43:47,300
Democritus, who was a pre-Socratic philosopher in ancient Greece, and his goals around 400

2212
02:43:47,300 --> 02:43:49,700
A.B.C. or so thereabouts.

2213
02:43:49,700 --> 02:43:57,380
He came up with the concept of an indivisible unit of matter, meaning you can cut something

2214
02:43:57,380 --> 02:44:01,620
and keep cutting things and it doesn't divide, and that's where the word atom comes from,

2215
02:44:01,700 --> 02:44:07,380
a tomos, meaning not divisible, not cuttable, not sliceable.

2216
02:44:07,380 --> 02:44:11,220
That's what tomos meaning to cut or divide, a meaning not.

2217
02:44:11,220 --> 02:44:14,580
So the atom is that which cannot be cut.

2218
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:20,580
Democritus himself was referenced throughout much of antiquity's literature, however a lot

2219
02:44:20,580 --> 02:44:27,220
of his works do not survive because he was kind of on the outs with respect to medieval theology

2220
02:44:27,220 --> 02:44:31,060
and he disagreed with Plato and Aristotle and some key ideas.

2221
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:34,020
So his work was excluded throughout history.

2222
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:38,100
But we know that he came up with the concept, that he alluded to the concept of the atom.

2223
02:44:38,660 --> 02:44:43,940
We also know that he alluded to the idea that the Milky Way is a series of stars that are

2224
02:44:43,940 --> 02:44:47,940
incredibly distant, that they're so distant that they actually look like one thing,

2225
02:44:47,940 --> 02:44:53,780
and that kind of goes along with this concept of the atom, and let's see what that is right now.

2226
02:44:53,860 --> 02:45:01,780
The concept of the atom that Democritus had is that imagine you had a block of clay or anything,

2227
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:03,780
but let's just use clay for this instance.

2228
02:45:04,500 --> 02:45:07,460
Actually I'm going to diverge away from, I'm not going to say clay, I'm going to start with a tree.

2229
02:45:07,460 --> 02:45:13,860
And if we start with a tree and you cut the tree say in half, well which half of the tree is it?

2230
02:45:13,860 --> 02:45:16,980
Well you know, you're going to get some half, whatever it happens to be.

2231
02:45:16,980 --> 02:45:20,740
Let's say we cut it vertically, and so you've got a half of the tree that's vertically cut

2232
02:45:20,740 --> 02:45:25,140
and so it still has a big chunk of the branches, a big chunk of the root,

2233
02:45:26,340 --> 02:45:28,660
a big chunk of the leaves, and so forth.

2234
02:45:28,660 --> 02:45:34,260
But at some point as you keep cutting this tree in half, depending on how you cut it,

2235
02:45:34,260 --> 02:45:38,900
eventually you're going to have to get to a point where you're going to cut the tree,

2236
02:45:38,900 --> 02:45:43,700
and you're going to divide the bark or the wood of the tree from the leaves of the tree.

2237
02:45:43,700 --> 02:45:48,180
So therefore the tree was one thing, and now you're cutting into two things,

2238
02:45:48,180 --> 02:45:50,740
and each of those things is different from the other.

2239
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:55,780
It's all right, so now you're paring away the thing that is not the same as it.

2240
02:45:55,780 --> 02:45:58,980
So we get rid of the leaf, and so we're left with the wood.

2241
02:45:58,980 --> 02:46:02,100
And so now we cut the wood away, and we say, oh there's the meat of the wood,

2242
02:46:02,100 --> 02:46:05,060
the wood that's below the bark, and we have the wood that's above the bark,

2243
02:46:05,060 --> 02:46:06,980
the bark wood, and so we cut away the bark.

2244
02:46:06,980 --> 02:46:12,100
And now we're left with the wood that has the grains, and it's that nice yellow tone.

2245
02:46:12,980 --> 02:46:16,740
As we cut further, we find that there's water inside of the bark,

2246
02:46:16,740 --> 02:46:20,660
we find that they're inside of the wood, we find that there's sap inside of the wood,

2247
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:24,580
we find that there's dark and light little striations of the wood.

2248
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:28,580
So we keep cutting those things, eliminating the bark, eliminating the sap,

2249
02:46:28,580 --> 02:46:32,580
eliminating the water, trying to get down to the essence of what is wood.

2250
02:46:32,580 --> 02:46:37,060
And so at some point you can philosophize that you would get down to the point where you say,

2251
02:46:37,060 --> 02:46:43,940
ah, I've cut away everything that is not wood, and I found the tiniest element of something that

2252
02:46:43,940 --> 02:46:49,940
is wood, and if I cut it, I will no longer have wood, I might have something else,

2253
02:46:49,940 --> 02:46:54,340
but then I just keep cutting until I get down to the thing that I say that this is the element of

2254
02:46:54,340 --> 02:47:00,500
wood. So the concept of the atomos then says there must be some fundamental building block

2255
02:47:00,500 --> 02:47:06,980
out of which you can no longer cut, because how can you cut anything infinitely posed,

2256
02:47:06,980 --> 02:47:10,020
democratist? And so this is an interesting concept.

2257
02:47:10,100 --> 02:47:14,740
Likewise, that's where his concept of matter comes from. It doesn't matter whether it's clay,

2258
02:47:14,740 --> 02:47:20,820
or water, or anything. There will eventually be some point at which you cannot cut any further,

2259
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:27,140
because that is the atomos, the indivisible unit. Well, this has some ramifications,

2260
02:47:27,140 --> 02:47:32,900
and there was no real evidence for it, because like I said, in 400 BC, it's philosophy,

2261
02:47:32,900 --> 02:47:38,980
it's not science yet. So the thing is, is that other philosophers disagree, notably Plato and

2262
02:47:39,060 --> 02:47:47,060
Aristotle, who disagreed with him entirely, and thought that matter like space is continuous.

2263
02:47:47,060 --> 02:47:56,420
So you'll notice that there is no gap in space or gap in matter between, say, the tree and the air

2264
02:47:56,420 --> 02:48:01,780
that surrounds it, or when the tree is submerged in water, the water goes right up to the trees.

2265
02:48:01,780 --> 02:48:07,460
There must be a transition between tree and water. That's a very sharp transition, but we notice that

2266
02:48:07,460 --> 02:48:14,420
there's water in the tree, that the sap is made from tree and water, that when you burn a tree,

2267
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:21,140
the fire comes out of the tree. And so it's very interesting to think that maybe a tree is made

2268
02:48:21,140 --> 02:48:25,780
up of fire, maybe it's made out of some sort of earthy element, maybe it's made out of some sort

2269
02:48:25,780 --> 02:48:31,540
of airy element, because the fire lifts, the smoke is lifted out of there, maybe it's made out of some

2270
02:48:31,540 --> 02:48:36,340
sort of water, well, we know that. So all of these things can combine together. And if you combine

2271
02:48:36,340 --> 02:48:41,620
them in just the right way alchemically, an alchemist would do this, then you would get tree.

2272
02:48:41,620 --> 02:48:47,380
So the proper combinations of fire, earth, water, and air, according to Plato and Aristotle, give

2273
02:48:47,380 --> 02:48:55,220
you tree, or gold, or iron, or what have you. All of the various things that exist, according to

2274
02:48:55,220 --> 02:49:01,620
Plato and Aristotle, were continuous matter. And this continuous matter can never be subdivided,

2275
02:49:01,700 --> 02:49:08,740
and you can't find a boundary to it. So it's kind of innately linked to the concept of space,

2276
02:49:08,740 --> 02:49:14,580
as well. So why did Aristotle disagree, and what happened, and where did the concept of this

2277
02:49:14,580 --> 02:49:19,780
continuous matter, and how did Aristotle blast democratize the idea? Well, he appealed to religion

2278
02:49:19,780 --> 02:49:26,020
and repealed to divinity. And divinity is definitely a part of natural philosophy, and you can actually

2279
02:49:26,020 --> 02:49:31,220
add it in by saying, imagine that there's a spiritual plane, a spiritual divine plane,

2280
02:49:31,220 --> 02:49:35,700
and this was okay in that time, because they've divided the physics of the earth,

2281
02:49:35,700 --> 02:49:41,940
the materia, versus the physics of the heavens, the celestial. And the two really did not behave

2282
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:48,660
the same, according to anybody's observations. So the celestial realm is the divine realm,

2283
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:53,780
it's the unchanging realm, it's the permanent realm. The material world is ever-changing,

2284
02:49:53,780 --> 02:49:59,140
and ever-fluid. And so there is a concept which arises from the four elements, and the fifth

2285
02:49:59,140 --> 02:50:04,100
element is then spirituality or divinity, and Aristotle said the following. So, Mr.

2286
02:50:04,100 --> 02:50:10,740
Democratus, you're saying that the god Zeus, who is all-powerful, who took the eight-legged beast

2287
02:50:10,740 --> 02:50:16,980
and ripped it apart to make man and woman, you're saying that he cannot rip apart the tiniest,

2288
02:50:16,980 --> 02:50:22,660
tiniest dust moat, the thing that you say is the smallest possible thing? How can a god not

2289
02:50:22,660 --> 02:50:29,300
break that apart? And that's kind of a valid philosophical argument if you posit the existence

2290
02:50:29,300 --> 02:50:35,060
of deities. So it really is a big thing, and so most of Christian thought and most of Western

2291
02:50:35,060 --> 02:50:40,020
thought gravitated towards the concept of the continuous matter and Aristotle's thinking,

2292
02:50:40,020 --> 02:50:48,660
because of the heightened element of the divine in natural philosophy. All right, so it took some

2293
02:50:48,660 --> 02:50:57,140
time before people would take Democratus's idea seriously, and John Dalton in about 1803 or so,

2294
02:50:57,140 --> 02:51:05,220
2,000 years after Democratus came up with this concept, 2,000 years, and even 200 years after

2295
02:51:05,220 --> 02:51:14,340
Galileo first put some dents in the armor of Aristotle with all of his work. So then we have

2296
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:20,580
Dalton coming along and proposed, well, we've got some interesting things that we see. We see that

2297
02:51:20,580 --> 02:51:32,740
if you have water, water is always roughly 88% or 88.9% mass oxygen, and the rest is hydrogen.

2298
02:51:32,740 --> 02:51:37,780
So we can always have that the same, where the percentages of oxygen and hydrogen are always

2299
02:51:37,780 --> 02:51:44,260
the same, where mass is conserved and mass doesn't disappear or reappear. You

2300
02:51:44,260 --> 02:51:48,180
can say, well, imagine that there's little tiny building blocks that have certain amounts of mass,

2301
02:51:48,180 --> 02:51:52,900
and these things then matter, then, is the arrangement of these little tiny building blocks,

2302
02:51:52,900 --> 02:51:58,020
and perhaps some of those little tiny building blocks are hydrogen, some of them are oxygen,

2303
02:51:58,020 --> 02:52:03,860
then it's a process of discovering which they are. And so the atomic theory that Dalton revived,

2304
02:52:03,860 --> 02:52:09,060
he used the word atom, atomic theory, he said that atoms can either be created or they can

2305
02:52:09,060 --> 02:52:14,900
be destroyed, they are just there, there are pieces of matter that are permanent in existence,

2306
02:52:14,900 --> 02:52:21,540
and all chemistry can be defined by adding and putting together various atoms in various

2307
02:52:21,540 --> 02:52:26,740
arrangements. So the Dalton's theory of the atom, which is, which is a highly simplified version

2308
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:32,260
of chemistry today, is that basically, well, even when you do elementary first semester chemistry,

2309
02:52:32,260 --> 02:52:35,060
you're going to be looking at Dalton's version of the atom. You're not going to look at quantum

2310
02:52:35,060 --> 02:52:39,860
mechanics just yet, but when you look at Dalton's version, you say, well, if you want to make water,

2311
02:52:39,860 --> 02:52:47,220
well, you take one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen, and that is water. And if you want to

2312
02:52:47,220 --> 02:52:54,580
make carbon dioxide, it's one carbon and two oxygens. If you wish to make methane, it's a CH4,

2313
02:52:54,580 --> 02:52:58,740
and if you want to make ammonia, it's NH3. So you've got all these things where they combine

2314
02:52:58,740 --> 02:53:04,580
together, and the combination thereof becomes the molecule. So Dalton's theory of the atom worked

2315
02:53:04,580 --> 02:53:08,900
up pretty good. Every element has its own particular properties. They all have the same

2316
02:53:08,900 --> 02:53:13,060
properties, and atoms simply combine in whole numbers. You can't break atoms apart in order to

2317
02:53:13,060 --> 02:53:19,300
say, no, there's no half water, which is like a half an oxygen and one and one hydrogen. That's

2318
02:53:19,300 --> 02:53:25,220
not half water. There's no such thing as half water. So Dalton's idea of the atom held sway for

2319
02:53:25,220 --> 02:53:33,780
about 100 years. And about 1903, roughly actually more like 1897, JJ Thompson's or JJ Thompson

2320
02:53:33,780 --> 02:53:40,180
discovered the electron, the first fundamental particle. This is the discovery of the concept

2321
02:53:40,180 --> 02:53:46,420
that, yes, there can actually be fundamental particles, meaning things that cannot be divided

2322
02:53:46,420 --> 02:53:54,020
anymore. The literal atomos of democratists back in 400 BC. So what he discovered was the electron,

2323
02:53:54,020 --> 02:53:59,540
which had a positive, it was a negative charge, and it must reside. He discovered it by using

2324
02:53:59,540 --> 02:54:04,180
cathode ray and understanding what the nature of a cathode ray is. And so what he said is that,

2325
02:54:04,180 --> 02:54:10,020
well, wait a second, we know these electrons must exist. And so he posited that, that perhaps

2326
02:54:10,020 --> 02:54:15,380
Dalton's concept of the atom can be modified, instead of being the smooth distribution of

2327
02:54:15,380 --> 02:54:21,220
Lego Bob's or just little things, little balls, like billiard balls that are smooth. Perhaps inside

2328
02:54:21,220 --> 02:54:26,340
the billiard ball of Dalton, there are electrons and they're moving around. And so therefore,

2329
02:54:26,340 --> 02:54:30,740
if there's an electron, which is a negative charge, there must be some positive charged

2330
02:54:30,740 --> 02:54:36,980
object, a proton, that's also in there, because every atom is electrically neutral. If it wasn't,

2331
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:42,100
it would be quickly therefore, it would quickly neutralize itself by either acquiring electron

2332
02:54:42,100 --> 02:54:48,820
or losing electron. So Thompson's concept was is that inside of each of these little billiard balls,

2333
02:54:48,820 --> 02:54:55,620
Dalton's billiard balls, there were a plum pudding of electrons and protons in a mesh that

2334
02:54:55,620 --> 02:55:01,620
neutralized themselves out. So this is a good little model of the of the of the atom. And the

2335
02:55:01,620 --> 02:55:06,180
thing is, is that it took the concept of the electron said, oh, it's a piece of the atom,

2336
02:55:06,180 --> 02:55:12,580
and inside the atom, there's this thing. All right, so this also led him to learn that electrons

2337
02:55:12,580 --> 02:55:18,980
were about 2000 times smaller mass than the proton, whatever it was, these tiny, tiny, tiny things

2338
02:55:18,980 --> 02:55:27,060
were there. Anyway, so it didn't take long for people to say, well, okay, got it. What Thompson

2339
02:55:27,060 --> 02:55:33,140
is saying is that the electrons and protons are arranged inside the atom. All right, how exactly

2340
02:55:33,140 --> 02:55:38,900
are they arranged? That's a really key question. It's like, okay, fine. Are they moving randomly?

2341
02:55:38,900 --> 02:55:44,420
Do they have structure? Are they set up like little bricks? How are they set up inside of Dalton's

2342
02:55:44,420 --> 02:55:49,780
little atom? And how is the plum pudding mixed? Are the plums evenly distributed in the pudding?

2343
02:55:49,780 --> 02:55:58,100
Or are the plums tiny little bits going through? So what Sir Ernest Rutherford in 1911 sought to

2344
02:55:58,100 --> 02:56:05,140
understand this, the interior of Thompson's plum pudding model. And what he decided to do is to say,

2345
02:56:05,140 --> 02:56:10,740
I'm going to take a very, very, very heavy atom that I can make into a very, very, very flat sheet,

2346
02:56:10,740 --> 02:56:16,980
an extraordinarily thin, flat sheet. And the goal of this extraordinarily thin, flat sheet

2347
02:56:16,980 --> 02:56:23,380
is that if I throw something at a thin, flat sheet, things should go through it or bounce off of it.

2348
02:56:23,380 --> 02:56:28,180
And you know that if you take an object that is not flat and you throw something at it,

2349
02:56:28,180 --> 02:56:32,660
it can, things can reflect off of it in all sorts of ways. So if you take a flat surface,

2350
02:56:32,660 --> 02:56:37,380
then you bounce a ball off of the flat surface, the angle of incidence equals the angle of

2351
02:56:37,380 --> 02:56:43,860
reflection off of a flat surface. However, if the surface is all jagged or regular in some way,

2352
02:56:43,860 --> 02:56:48,420
then if you throw balls at that surface at different angles, the angle of incidence at the

2353
02:56:48,420 --> 02:56:52,980
moment at the location where the ball hit the surface, let's say the basketball, let's say you

2354
02:56:52,980 --> 02:56:57,780
do this off a basketball court, which is flat. And now you play a game where it's on a curved

2355
02:56:57,780 --> 02:57:02,340
surface like this, maybe it's got humps. And so as it reflects, you can actually see where it

2356
02:57:02,340 --> 02:57:07,700
reflects from and where it goes to after it reflects. And that gives you a map by looking

2357
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:12,660
back where the things came from is to the shape of the object. And now that's one way of looking

2358
02:57:12,660 --> 02:57:18,500
at things. But Tom, but, but sir Ernest Rutherford, why do I keep saying sir? I forget if he is a

2359
02:57:18,500 --> 02:57:24,660
sir. In any event, Ernest Rutherford in 1911 said, I'm going to take gold, which I can hammer down

2360
02:57:24,660 --> 02:57:29,860
and make into gold foil. And this gold foil can be literally only a few atoms thick,

2361
02:57:29,860 --> 02:57:34,340
just just the thinnest thing. And this is an amazing property of gold, by the way. And gold

2362
02:57:34,340 --> 02:57:42,100
itself can be can be made into very, very thin foils. And it's so thin that if a gold atom

2363
02:57:42,980 --> 02:57:47,300
is one of Thompson's plum pudding models, then the electrons in there have to be distributed in

2364
02:57:47,300 --> 02:57:52,660
some way. And if I throw something at it, and it goes through the atom, it might deflect it

2365
02:57:52,660 --> 02:57:57,300
as it goes through. So if you throw something through something, you throw, go through something,

2366
02:57:57,300 --> 02:58:01,780
and you interact with it gently, it'll diverge the path of the thing that you threw through it.

2367
02:58:01,780 --> 02:58:07,300
So it assumes that Thompson's plum pudding model is is porous, or at least maybe not necessarily

2368
02:58:07,300 --> 02:58:12,180
porous, but at least kind of some material, some thing. And we don't know exactly how it's structured.

2369
02:58:12,180 --> 02:58:16,660
But let's take a helium nucleus called an alpha particle, and we'll take that alpha particle

2370
02:58:16,660 --> 02:58:24,420
and send it through the gold nucleus. Now here was the expectation. The expectation was that as

2371
02:58:24,420 --> 02:58:30,180
the gold as the helium nuclei went through, they'll be gently redirected by the distribution of

2372
02:58:30,180 --> 02:58:36,900
electrons inside of there. Because it's been known that by cathode ray by the interactions of cathode

2373
02:58:36,900 --> 02:58:41,620
rays, and again, alpha particles that they actually interact, and they can redirect each other's

2374
02:58:41,620 --> 02:58:47,300
paths. So what happens is that you send the elect send the alpha particle through the gold foil,

2375
02:58:47,300 --> 02:58:52,340
and see how it gets bent around. And that gives you the structure of the electrons inside there,

2376
02:58:52,340 --> 02:58:56,500
because the gold must be the gold, right? It just must be whatever it is. And nicely enough,

2377
02:58:56,500 --> 02:59:00,980
gold does not do much reaction. It's very not heavily reactive. And it's very, very thin.

2378
02:59:01,700 --> 02:59:08,100
So here's what what Rutherford found. He found that most of the of the alpha particles went

2379
02:59:08,100 --> 02:59:12,580
straight through the gold foil, and were detected on a silver iodide screen on the far side.

2380
02:59:13,460 --> 02:59:18,900
But just to be careful, Rutherford put a screen all the way around it. And he found that a

2381
02:59:18,900 --> 02:59:25,620
significant number and a non a pre and significant number actually bounced back. So that's kind of

2382
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:30,180
weird. So you throw something at something very, very thin, that's supposed to allow things to

2383
02:59:30,180 --> 02:59:37,220
pass through. But instead, it bounces off of something. So that meant that if if with Rutherford's

2384
02:59:37,220 --> 02:59:43,780
concept, then he had to reconfigure what he meant by the atom. And he said, wait, there must be some

2385
02:59:43,780 --> 02:59:49,940
dense, heavy thing that the alpha particles knocking off of. Because if you then say, let's say you

2386
02:59:49,940 --> 02:59:55,940
have the protons, or the alpha particles are part of the gold nucleus. If you send one alpha

2387
02:59:55,940 --> 03:00:00,180
particle into the other, they're going to hit off of each other, but they won't necessarily

2388
03:00:00,180 --> 03:00:03,620
bounce straight off of each other. They have to be a perfect alignment for them to do that.

2389
03:00:04,340 --> 03:00:10,100
But what happened is, is that the gold foil reflected off of the alpha particles reflected

2390
03:00:10,100 --> 03:00:15,940
off of the gold foil coming back towards the, towards the emitter. And that, as Rutherford

2391
03:00:15,940 --> 03:00:21,620
said, was like taking a 15 inch shell, an artillery shell, such as might have been used in, say,

2392
03:00:21,620 --> 03:00:27,380
the First World War, right around 1911, which we're talking about. 1911, I, and the 15 inch shell

2393
03:00:27,380 --> 03:00:33,460
going through a piece of tissue paper, and the tissue paper bounces the artillery shell off of it.

2394
03:00:33,460 --> 03:00:38,740
Now that would be surprising. And that's a surprise. In fact, that the energetics of that are about as

2395
03:00:38,740 --> 03:00:43,620
surprising as what Rutherford discovered with this experiment, which meant that there must be some

2396
03:00:43,620 --> 03:00:50,180
massive object in the atom that can reflect off of, can reflect something, can push something back,

2397
03:00:50,180 --> 03:00:56,100
that's coming into it at high speed, that has some, that has some decent mass to it. So he reconfigured

2398
03:00:56,100 --> 03:01:01,300
the concept to say that at the center of the atom was the, was a positively charged nucleus,

2399
03:01:01,300 --> 03:01:06,500
and that positively charged nucleus has mass, as most of the mass of the atom, and the electrons

2400
03:01:06,500 --> 03:01:13,540
are somehow spiraling around it. So the, that is the difference between, between the plum pudding

2401
03:01:13,540 --> 03:01:21,060
model and Rutherford's swarm of electrons around a nucleus, and this was put to bed Thompson's

2402
03:01:21,060 --> 03:01:27,860
model of the, of the, of the plum pudding. So now we have this concept that there must be a dense

2403
03:01:27,860 --> 03:01:34,660
nucleus. This led to some problems though, because the, if it's smoothly distributed, then it can be

2404
03:01:34,660 --> 03:01:39,380
electrically neutral. But if Rutherford's concept is right, now you've got this positive charged

2405
03:01:39,380 --> 03:01:44,100
thing, and you've got these negative charged things flying around it, and observationally,

2406
03:01:44,100 --> 03:01:49,060
experimentally, they exist, they, there is some large positive charged thing, and the electrons

2407
03:01:49,060 --> 03:01:54,580
are negatively charged, and they're clearly not on top of it. They're near it, but not on top of it.

2408
03:01:55,220 --> 03:02:02,180
So the question then becomes, why doesn't the electron spiral down from its orbit around this

2409
03:02:02,180 --> 03:02:10,180
nucleus, and fall into the nucleus, and become Thompson's plum pudding? What is the thing that

2410
03:02:10,180 --> 03:02:15,220
makes the plum pudding not true? Meaning it should just spiral together, so it's all neutral, and

2411
03:02:15,220 --> 03:02:21,540
everybody's on top of each other. Why do the electrons stay away from the nucleus, which is

2412
03:02:21,540 --> 03:02:25,780
positively charged? We get why it should be near, because there's an attractive force. But why should

2413
03:02:25,860 --> 03:02:33,300
all of a sudden it stop? And nobody knew why that would be. So no matter what, when you did this

2414
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:40,820
experiment, you found that the nucleus had to be there, separate from the electrons. And this became

2415
03:02:40,820 --> 03:02:47,540
the topic for an enormous amount of research, and it spurred the entire idea, because Rutherford's

2416
03:02:47,540 --> 03:02:54,740
atom has a very difficult time explaining the spectra of light. Because now we have to say,

2417
03:02:54,980 --> 03:02:59,940
Rutherford's atom says, if you have an electron spiraling around, as it spirals, it should emit

2418
03:02:59,940 --> 03:03:06,020
a continuous spectrum of light, not a discrete spectrum. So Rutherford's atom cannot predict

2419
03:03:06,020 --> 03:03:13,300
the spectrum. However, it does predict the event of collisions into it, and it does disprove the

2420
03:03:13,300 --> 03:03:19,700
plum pudding model. So there's a bit of a problem. And that problem is, one experiment shows one

2421
03:03:19,700 --> 03:03:24,420
thing, but other experiments demand that that's not the full story. And the full story of what

2422
03:03:24,420 --> 03:03:29,620
happens to Rutherford's atom comes up next time, when we talk about the Bohr model of the atom.

2423
03:03:33,540 --> 03:03:38,100
Hello, this is Jason Kendall, and welcome to the next of my introductory astronomy lectures.

2424
03:03:38,100 --> 03:03:42,660
Today, we're going to be finishing out the nature of what the hydrogen atom is,

2425
03:03:42,660 --> 03:03:47,460
and the models of the atom through history. So let's take a step back. Last time we looked at

2426
03:03:47,460 --> 03:03:51,620
Rutherford's version of the atom, which has kind of like little stars orbiting a little planet,

2427
03:03:51,620 --> 03:03:56,260
a little planet orbiting a little star. That's the kind of basic assumption that Rutherford came

2428
03:03:56,260 --> 03:04:01,940
about when he did his gold foil experiment. But if we go back just a little bit further back in

2429
03:04:01,940 --> 03:04:08,500
time, we find that there's a very interesting hint to things to come. The Swedish physicist Johannes

2430
03:04:08,500 --> 03:04:16,980
Rydberg in 1888 looked at the nature of the hydrogen spectrum and tried to create an empirical

2431
03:04:16,980 --> 03:04:23,380
formula. This empirical formula had a goal, and the goal was to actually simply model the actual

2432
03:04:23,380 --> 03:04:28,980
lines that are seen, the transitions that are seen, or at least the spectral lines that are seen

2433
03:04:28,980 --> 03:04:36,340
in the hydrogen spectrum. So what he did is he found a periodic pattern to them, and he was able

2434
03:04:36,340 --> 03:04:42,340
to determine that the reciprocal of the wavelength is equal to some constant, some full constant,

2435
03:04:42,340 --> 03:04:48,500
and then multiply it by the reciprocal of the inverse of two squared integers. Now,

2436
03:04:48,500 --> 03:04:54,580
this is really interesting because it highlights a concept that what you sometimes do in science

2437
03:04:54,580 --> 03:05:00,980
is you just try to create some sort of empirical formula for what you're observing in nature.

2438
03:05:00,980 --> 03:05:06,020
And after you do that empirical formula, you then try to see if you can understand the underlying

2439
03:05:06,020 --> 03:05:12,660
science below it. Well, so that's what Rydberg did. He made an empirical formula that is only

2440
03:05:12,660 --> 03:05:18,820
based off of the data, but he had no underlying reason as to why it would be this way. He just

2441
03:05:18,820 --> 03:05:24,340
made a formula that worked. Fascinatingly enough, the Rydberg formula for the hydrogen atom is

2442
03:05:24,340 --> 03:05:31,780
extraordinarily simple. So what it should tell us is that we are looking for underlying physics

2443
03:05:31,860 --> 03:05:37,380
that actually works to tell us something deeper. And that was in 1888. So many things were happening

2444
03:05:37,380 --> 03:05:41,860
right around the turn of the 20th century, 19th and the 20th century in terms of modern physics.

2445
03:05:41,860 --> 03:05:48,260
It's astonishing. But Rydberg's hint gives us a little bit of a clue. All right, so let's go

2446
03:05:48,260 --> 03:05:55,220
forward in time from 1888 to 1911. And 1911 is when Rutherford came up with his concept for the atom,

2447
03:05:55,220 --> 03:06:00,660
and it was necessitated, it was needed to be done because the Thompson's plum pudding model doesn't

2448
03:06:00,660 --> 03:06:07,060
work. Well, Rutherford's model of the atom also cannot work. And it can't be the last answer to

2449
03:06:07,060 --> 03:06:13,860
things. Because if you have an electron orbiting a proton, and you would be very active at going

2450
03:06:13,860 --> 03:06:19,460
around in a circle is an accelerated motion. If you have an accelerated motion, you're going to

2451
03:06:19,460 --> 03:06:25,460
emit energy. And by emitting energy, the thing will eventually spiral in the electron will spiral in

2452
03:06:25,540 --> 03:06:30,820
emitting electromagnetic radiation, as it spirals in, and it'll crash into the proton

2453
03:06:30,820 --> 03:06:37,460
and become Thompson's plum pudding. So the Rutherford's model of the atom could not

2454
03:06:37,460 --> 03:06:41,700
actually be the final answer because well established extraordinarily well established

2455
03:06:41,700 --> 03:06:47,300
electromagnetic theory demanded that they would eventually collide together. So something else

2456
03:06:47,300 --> 03:06:54,740
had to be there in order to make this work. Well, that came along because in very shortly

2457
03:06:54,740 --> 03:07:00,100
thereafter in 1913 by Niels Bohr. So what Niels Bohr did is he said, okay, fine, we don't want

2458
03:07:00,100 --> 03:07:07,380
this thing spiraling. Fine, imagine that the angular momentum of the of the objects was fixed.

2459
03:07:07,380 --> 03:07:12,740
And so what he did is he said, okay, every one of these little planets that orbits this little

2460
03:07:12,740 --> 03:07:19,140
sun, they can only orbit at specific radii. So if he said that's his pot, that's his positive,

2461
03:07:20,100 --> 03:07:25,140
his basic assumption. The basic concept is, is that they can only orbit at specific radii and

2462
03:07:25,140 --> 03:07:30,420
they can't spiral in. Well, why can't they spiral in? That's the essence of the Bohr model of the

2463
03:07:30,420 --> 03:07:38,420
atom. The Bohr model of the atom said basically that the angular momentum had to have fixed values.

2464
03:07:38,420 --> 03:07:45,060
And these fixed values were multiples, integer multiples of some value. So that's his idea is

2465
03:07:45,060 --> 03:07:51,540
that Bohr's model of the atom said we can have quantized angular momentum. And what is angular

2466
03:07:51,540 --> 03:07:57,460
momentum? Well, if you take a little planet orbiting a little star, the angular momentum of

2467
03:07:57,460 --> 03:08:01,940
the little planet orbiting the little star is the mass times the speed with which it's going around,

2468
03:08:01,940 --> 03:08:07,940
times the radius at which it's going around. So if the angular momentum is quantized, then,

2469
03:08:07,940 --> 03:08:13,940
well, you know the mass, fine, you can determine the speed, sure, but then the radius must then

2470
03:08:13,940 --> 03:08:20,180
be fixed. There must be only stepwise distances that the electron can live from the proton.

2471
03:08:20,180 --> 03:08:26,740
So the Bohr model of the atom says let's now take this concept of quantized angular momentum.

2472
03:08:26,740 --> 03:08:32,100
And what we'll do is we'll say what is the force that is required to keep something going in a

2473
03:08:32,100 --> 03:08:40,180
circular orbit and then equate that to the force due to the electromagnetic attraction between the

2474
03:08:40,180 --> 03:08:46,180
electron and the proton, make those two things equal, slide in the concept that that the product

2475
03:08:46,180 --> 03:08:50,500
of the mass times the speed of the electron going around in that circular orbit at the radius of

2476
03:08:50,500 --> 03:08:56,740
the circular orbit is some integer multiple of some number. And that number is the Planck's constant,

2477
03:08:56,740 --> 03:09:02,980
the reduced Pollock's constant h bar. And you get out of that by doing some hooks and some crooks

2478
03:09:02,980 --> 03:09:10,020
and looking and playing around with it. You eventually discover that the energy at a given

2479
03:09:10,180 --> 03:09:16,420
level that you would have. So if you have a potential energy between the electron and the proton,

2480
03:09:16,420 --> 03:09:21,620
so they're trying to pull on each other. So that gives an energy that is a position and that we

2481
03:09:21,620 --> 03:09:28,820
call a potential energy. So the potential energy between them is fixed and we can determine what

2482
03:09:28,820 --> 03:09:33,220
it is and it's dependent on the radius and how far apart they are. And we say, okay, what is the

2483
03:09:33,220 --> 03:09:39,300
energy at a particular location? And it works out to be a very small amount which is in the

2484
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:45,860
electron volts. About 13.6 electron volts is the amount of negative energy or energy that's

2485
03:09:45,860 --> 03:09:50,420
different from when the electron is free. So it loses a bit of energy getting close to it,

2486
03:09:50,980 --> 03:09:59,060
close to the proton. So we can only have energy at fixed orbital radii. And these orbital radii

2487
03:09:59,700 --> 03:10:06,500
have our integer multiples are product of the orbital number squared. So the ground state,

2488
03:10:06,500 --> 03:10:11,540
which is the lowest possible state, which is n equals one, that is the lowest possible state.

2489
03:10:11,540 --> 03:10:15,540
And then you can have larger and larger and larger ends, but they just get bigger and bigger,

2490
03:10:15,540 --> 03:10:21,700
which means that the energy approaches zero as you have greater and greater distance from the

2491
03:10:21,700 --> 03:10:29,380
from the from the proton. So Naboor model of the atom, but by having quantized angular momentum

2492
03:10:29,380 --> 03:10:35,460
and using the definition of the potential energy between an electron and a proton and the definition

2493
03:10:35,460 --> 03:10:41,300
of a force that's taking some keeping something in a circular orbit at a particular quantized

2494
03:10:41,300 --> 03:10:46,340
angular momentum utilizing the four of the Coulomb relationship, which is the force of

2495
03:10:46,340 --> 03:10:53,140
attraction between two charged particles, we can then derive with with Bohr's concept

2496
03:10:53,140 --> 03:10:59,220
that they that these the angular momentum is quantized. We get a very interesting set of results.

2497
03:10:59,220 --> 03:11:07,140
So first, the electron can only live in fixed orbital radii from the proton. And the nearest one

2498
03:11:07,140 --> 03:11:14,020
is when the number this fixed number is one, or this quantum number is one. And if it's at

2499
03:11:14,020 --> 03:11:18,980
quantum number one, we call it the ground state. If it's quantum number two, we call it the first

2500
03:11:18,980 --> 03:11:23,540
excited state. If it's quantum number three, we call it the second excited state. So an electron

2501
03:11:23,540 --> 03:11:30,500
can only jump up and can move between energy levels. So these are levels of energy fixed radii

2502
03:11:30,500 --> 03:11:35,060
from the proton. And so we have an electron either at the ground state at the nearest radius,

2503
03:11:35,060 --> 03:11:40,100
or at the first excited state, which is at the next radius up. Now, something could come along

2504
03:11:40,100 --> 03:11:45,700
and smack the electron. So let's let's pause it now, as we will, how we can use the Bohr model

2505
03:11:45,700 --> 03:11:49,780
of the atom. So let's have an electron orbiting a proton, it's a nice little hydrogen atom,

2506
03:11:49,780 --> 03:11:53,780
it's sitting out there somewhere in space, not doing anything, it's minding its own business.

2507
03:11:53,780 --> 03:11:57,140
And another proton comes along, or another hydrogen atom comes along,

2508
03:11:57,140 --> 03:12:00,900
smacks into it, and gives it a little bit of energy, just like a billiard ball,

2509
03:12:00,900 --> 03:12:05,940
by smacking another billiard ball. It makes a little clicking sound, but instead of clicking,

2510
03:12:06,660 --> 03:12:11,060
what happens is a little bit of that collision goes to making the electron go up an orbital.

2511
03:12:11,060 --> 03:12:15,780
It kicks it up to the next orbit. So a collision can do that, gives it a little bit of energy.

2512
03:12:15,860 --> 03:12:20,420
When it gives it a little bit of energy, it can jump a little bit further away from the proton.

2513
03:12:20,420 --> 03:12:26,020
So now it's gotten some energy, it's pushed away from the proton, which is trying to pull it home.

2514
03:12:26,020 --> 03:12:31,860
And it says, eventually, the state can't live for very long. And what happens is the electron then

2515
03:12:31,860 --> 03:12:35,620
says, I'm going to go back down to the lower level from the second, from the first excited state,

2516
03:12:35,620 --> 03:12:41,540
down to the second, and in so doing, emits energy. Now, it can do this emission of energy by, say,

2517
03:12:41,540 --> 03:12:47,380
colliding into something else, but probably the most efficient way, and the most common way,

2518
03:12:47,380 --> 03:12:55,060
is for it to emit light. So when it drops from an higher energy level than the ground state,

2519
03:12:55,060 --> 03:12:59,940
down to ground state, it'll emit a light, it'll emit photon. And that photon will have exactly

2520
03:12:59,940 --> 03:13:05,220
the energy of the difference between two levels. So let's see what that actually works out to be.

2521
03:13:05,220 --> 03:13:10,420
At the ground state, the energy that you have is about 13.6 electron volts. And we're going to call

2522
03:13:10,420 --> 03:13:16,580
that a negative energy, because if it's at, let's say the electron and proton are not bound

2523
03:13:16,580 --> 03:13:20,900
together. If they're not bound together, we would have, we would say they have no energy with respect

2524
03:13:20,900 --> 03:13:27,140
to each other. So they're free. So a free bound, a free electron free from its proton would have

2525
03:13:27,140 --> 03:13:31,700
zero energy. And we call bound states negative states. So you can think of them as at the bottom

2526
03:13:31,700 --> 03:13:35,700
of a well or the bottom of a hill or something like that. So they have to fall into this potential

2527
03:13:35,700 --> 03:13:41,060
well. Once that's where we get the negative state from. So the energy we're going to call it is a

2528
03:13:41,060 --> 03:13:46,820
negative 13.6 electron volts. And I'll let you Google what an electron volt is, because that's

2529
03:13:46,820 --> 03:13:52,420
a really interesting subject all of itself. So that is n equals one. And that has an energy

2530
03:13:52,420 --> 03:13:56,660
of 13.6 electron volts. So now something comes along, it collides into it, the electron jumps

2531
03:13:56,660 --> 03:14:00,980
up to the next orbit. So this is n equals two. And that works out to have an energy of minus

2532
03:14:00,980 --> 03:14:06,900
3.4 electron volts. It then emits an electron, it emits a photon as it drops from the first

2533
03:14:06,900 --> 03:14:13,060
excited state back down to the ground state. And you subtract the two minus 3.4 minus a minus 13.6

2534
03:14:13,060 --> 03:14:19,380
that ends up to be 10.2 electron volts. That's a very small amount of energy. It's on the order

2535
03:14:19,380 --> 03:14:25,540
of 10 to the minus 19th joules. So it's a tiny amount of energy. You'd have to have a whole

2536
03:14:25,540 --> 03:14:31,700
bunch of these happen in order to even see it. So it's a single photon emitted by a single

2537
03:14:31,700 --> 03:14:36,900
electron dropping down from the first excited state to the second. So what does that energy

2538
03:14:36,900 --> 03:14:43,220
correspond to in terms of light? Because we know that light has frequencies, right? So

2539
03:14:43,220 --> 03:14:48,340
what does the energy of light correspond to? Well, here's the thing. Now we're going to

2540
03:14:48,340 --> 03:14:55,060
drop back in time again. So Niels Bohr is working on this thing in 1913, Ryd Bertbert in 1888, but

2541
03:14:55,060 --> 03:15:00,420
smack in between them. Albert Einstein brought us a very, very interesting thing by studying what's

2542
03:15:00,420 --> 03:15:06,020
called the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect shows how electrons are liberated from

2543
03:15:06,020 --> 03:15:12,100
a metal if light shines upon them. And it was found that if the light, no matter how intense it was,

2544
03:15:12,100 --> 03:15:17,140
if it was infrared light, it did not liberate the electrons. But as soon as the frequency was large

2545
03:15:17,140 --> 03:15:21,620
enough, then the electrons would be liberated away from the metal and then they could move.

2546
03:15:21,620 --> 03:15:28,100
So what this meant is that photons were acting like a particle, just an and a wave. Uh-oh,

2547
03:15:28,100 --> 03:15:32,500
that brings us back all the way to Newton's corpuscles of light again. Oh my goodness. Well,

2548
03:15:32,500 --> 03:15:38,900
light has a duality of waves and particles. So here is now proof by Einstein in 1905,

2549
03:15:38,900 --> 03:15:44,260
which got him the Nobel Prize, by the way, that the energy of a photon is proportional to the

2550
03:15:44,260 --> 03:15:49,780
frequency or inversely proportional to the wavelength of the light. And the different,

2551
03:15:49,780 --> 03:15:55,220
the transmogrification of frequency or wavelength into this particle concept of like how much

2552
03:15:55,220 --> 03:16:01,940
billiard ball type particle is in the photon is by the Planck constant h. So energy of a light of

2553
03:16:01,940 --> 03:16:06,740
the light is equal to h, which is Planck's constant times the speed of light divided by the wavelength.

2554
03:16:06,740 --> 03:16:12,740
And that gives you these, the energy of the photon. Ha! But we just saw that the energy

2555
03:16:12,740 --> 03:16:16,580
difference between the photon that the energy dropping from the first excited state down to

2556
03:16:16,580 --> 03:16:22,020
the ground state is 10.2 electron volts. And if we say that's the energy and then we see what the

2557
03:16:22,020 --> 03:16:30,900
wavelength works out to be, the wavelength works out to be 122 nanometers. Wow, okay. So when the

2558
03:16:30,900 --> 03:16:36,900
electron drops from the first excited state down to the ground state, the wave, the energy is 10.2

2559
03:16:36,900 --> 03:16:46,500
electron volts. And that's converted into 1.22 times 122 nanometers, or approximately a point,

2560
03:16:46,500 --> 03:16:52,740
yeah, well, 12, yeah, 1200, 1200 angstroms. So now that we can plug in and look at that and see what

2561
03:16:52,740 --> 03:16:58,020
the Rydberg number is, and we say, well, wait a second, what's the Rydberg value? Well, Rydberg

2562
03:16:58,020 --> 03:17:03,860
value says that what's the wavelength? And we say, oh, n1, n2 squared. Wow, is this interesting?

2563
03:17:03,860 --> 03:17:10,900
It matches Rydberg's formula exactly if you put in n1 equals 1 and n2 equals 2, which is just really

2564
03:17:10,900 --> 03:17:16,820
amazing. So Rydberg's formula predicted it, or at least was empirical. Now we've got something that

2565
03:17:16,820 --> 03:17:25,140
actually shows it. So the wavelengths that are predicted by Bohr's model of the atom are matched,

2566
03:17:25,140 --> 03:17:31,380
matched directly what Rydberg found in 1888. Just as another example, and a more pertinent one

2567
03:17:31,380 --> 03:17:36,580
that we're going to talk about later, electrons can jump up multiple orbital levels and drop

2568
03:17:36,580 --> 03:17:40,260
back down multiple orbital levels, or it can go up and down and up and up and down and up,

2569
03:17:40,260 --> 03:17:45,060
depending on what's happening in the environment in which it lives. So let's say that the electron,

2570
03:17:45,060 --> 03:17:50,100
instead of going up only one level, jumped up two from the ground state to the second excited state,

2571
03:17:50,100 --> 03:17:56,100
or n equals 3. So now it's an n equals 3. And let's say it's going to drop twice. So it's going to

2572
03:17:56,100 --> 03:18:00,580
step down each level of the ladder on its way home to ground state. So it's going to drop from 3

2573
03:18:00,580 --> 03:18:06,660
to 2, and then from 2 to 1. And we just did 2 to 1, which gives you an energy of about 10 electron

2574
03:18:06,660 --> 03:18:11,780
volts. But let's look specifically at the one where it drops from 3 down to 2. All right,

2575
03:18:11,780 --> 03:18:16,820
so 3 down to 2, we can calculate the energy of the two of them. And it starts for the third,

2576
03:18:16,820 --> 03:18:24,660
it is n equals 3, is the second excited state. I know, 3 is second, 2 is first, ground is zero,

2577
03:18:25,220 --> 03:18:30,500
right? Kind of really annoying, but let's work with it. So if we're going to start from n equals 3,

2578
03:18:30,500 --> 03:18:34,740
the second excited state, and it's going to be a little bit higher, a little bit closer to zero

2579
03:18:34,740 --> 03:18:40,820
energy, about one and a half electron volts in the hole. And the second excited, the first excited

2580
03:18:40,820 --> 03:18:45,140
state is three and a half electron volts, 3.4 electron volts in the hole. And we take the

2581
03:18:45,140 --> 03:18:51,380
difference of those. It's an energy difference of just under two electron volts or 1.89 electron

2582
03:18:51,380 --> 03:18:57,380
volts. We convert that using the formula that Einstein discovered in 1905, that got in the

2583
03:18:57,380 --> 03:19:05,380
Nobel Prize. And we find that 656.3 nanometers. And if we look at that, that is Rydberg's formula

2584
03:19:05,380 --> 03:19:12,100
for the transition between 3 and 2 in the Rydberg formula. And that is exactly the wavelength of

2585
03:19:12,100 --> 03:19:19,780
light that is predicted. That's exactly the wavelength of light that you observe in a spectroscope.

2586
03:19:19,780 --> 03:19:25,540
That is the transition in the red area of the spectrum. That is H alpha, one of the most common

2587
03:19:25,540 --> 03:19:30,980
wavelengths of light to look at for all astronomical species, because most of the universe is made of

2588
03:19:30,980 --> 03:19:36,900
hydrogen. And so when you look out at the Orion nebula, which has this characteristic pink glow,

2589
03:19:37,620 --> 03:19:43,380
and that characteristic pink glow comes from radiation, light being emitted specifically

2590
03:19:43,380 --> 03:19:50,180
at 656.3 nanometers. We now know that's due, according to the Bohr model, to an electron

2591
03:19:50,180 --> 03:19:55,540
dropping from the third excited state down to the second excited state and then on its way back

2592
03:19:55,540 --> 03:19:59,460
to the ground state. But it's actually gotten some energy from somewhere and it's falling and

2593
03:19:59,460 --> 03:20:04,900
cascading back through and it emits this form of light. And there it goes, it's emitting this light.

2594
03:20:04,900 --> 03:20:11,620
So now we know we have a model for a very important thing, which is we're now can model the spectrum

2595
03:20:11,620 --> 03:20:18,820
of light. But let's take, before we go there, let's go into a little weird place because

2596
03:20:19,380 --> 03:20:23,780
we've had a very strange set of things and Bohr's model of the atom assumes a little

2597
03:20:23,780 --> 03:20:30,340
dot orbiting another little dot in a circular motion. But we've already seen that there's a

2598
03:20:30,340 --> 03:20:36,660
certain way, but physics kind of went a little awry for us and that model works extremely well

2599
03:20:36,660 --> 03:20:42,180
for us, the Bohr model. But let's take it forward just a little bit to determine that that's not

2600
03:20:42,180 --> 03:20:51,540
still the end of the story because electrons are not pure particles. Well, what was found in 1924

2601
03:20:51,540 --> 03:21:00,100
is Louis de Broglie in his PhD thesis. He's a French physicist and in his PhD thesis,

2602
03:21:00,180 --> 03:21:07,060
he postulated, he postulated that every subatomic particle, or more specifically,

2603
03:21:07,060 --> 03:21:13,540
every particle has a wavelength. So he said that every particle, an electron, a proton, you, me,

2604
03:21:13,540 --> 03:21:18,580
the chair, a building, a whole planet, the galaxy, it has a wavelength. And that wavelength will

2605
03:21:18,580 --> 03:21:27,460
call the de Broglie wavelength. And we can take the concept of the energy of a photon,

2606
03:21:27,460 --> 03:21:35,060
we convert like just from Einstein's discovery and we convert that into a momentum

2607
03:21:35,060 --> 03:21:40,820
because light, even though it has no mass, still carries momentum. So if it can carry momentum

2608
03:21:40,820 --> 03:21:45,140
and matter does carry momentum, this is where de Broglie kind of made the leap, he said, well,

2609
03:21:45,140 --> 03:21:51,220
if light carries momentum and matter carries momentum, then we should be able to equate the two.

2610
03:21:51,220 --> 03:21:58,180
So de Broglie said, well, what is the, what is the momentum of light given its wavelength? And so

2611
03:21:58,180 --> 03:22:02,260
he said, fine, there it is. And so now you actually then put the weight and you establish then that

2612
03:22:02,260 --> 03:22:09,380
there's also a momentum associated with, with an electron. And so combining his concept with

2613
03:22:09,380 --> 03:22:14,020
general relativity says that there is a speed with which it's going and if it's not, if it's

2614
03:22:14,020 --> 03:22:19,060
going greater than the speed of zero, then it'll have some sort of wavelength associated with it.

2615
03:22:19,060 --> 03:22:24,580
In any event, de Broglie said that there's a, as electrons travel through space,

2616
03:22:25,380 --> 03:22:30,820
they are not just particles, they're a packet of waves. And what's fascinating about this

2617
03:22:30,820 --> 03:22:36,420
is this concept that every element and every subatomic particle or every particle in existence

2618
03:22:36,420 --> 03:22:42,900
has a wavelength and we call it the de Broglie wavelength, then as this concept is experimentally

2619
03:22:42,900 --> 03:22:50,100
verifiable. And in fact, in 1927, it was experimentally verified that electrons do diffraction

2620
03:22:50,100 --> 03:22:56,500
just in the same way that light does. So electrons do diffraction, protons do diffraction,

2621
03:22:56,500 --> 03:23:02,340
even large molecules do diffraction. This concept of the de Broglie wavelength is ubiquitous

2622
03:23:02,340 --> 03:23:06,500
throughout. And apparently there's macromolecules that can even be shown with their de Broglie

2623
03:23:06,580 --> 03:23:13,140
wavelength and actually measure it. So we can measure the spread of a particle that means it's

2624
03:23:13,140 --> 03:23:18,980
not all in one place. It means it's not a pinpoint particle that you can say at the head of this pin,

2625
03:23:18,980 --> 03:23:23,700
at the point of this pin, that is exactly where the electron is. You can't do that because it has

2626
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:29,220
a wavelength. Really weird. All right. So what does that mean for our model of the atom? We're

2627
03:23:29,220 --> 03:23:35,060
going to kind of diverge away into it. We're going to say de Broglie said that wavelengths of light,

2628
03:23:35,620 --> 03:23:42,260
wavelengths of electrons, if they're trapped, then they have a standing wave. And so he said,

2629
03:23:42,260 --> 03:23:46,340
okay, fine, what's a standing wave? A standing wave is just like if you tie a rope into a doorknob

2630
03:23:46,340 --> 03:23:50,740
and you flick your wrist up and down, you hold it, you can make various waves against it,

2631
03:23:50,740 --> 03:23:54,580
because your wrist is fixed and the doorknob is fixed. So you can make a standing wave,

2632
03:23:54,580 --> 03:23:58,980
even though the waves are moving, they're in there, they're moving up and down like a jump rope,

2633
03:23:58,980 --> 03:24:03,140
or you're doing all sorts of rope tricks, but the ends are fixed, they're not flapping around,

2634
03:24:03,140 --> 03:24:09,620
the ends are fixed. So you can have standing waves and the more energy you give to the standing wave,

2635
03:24:09,620 --> 03:24:17,140
the more nodes there are to the wave. So we can then reformulate the Bohr model as having a pit.

2636
03:24:17,140 --> 03:24:20,740
And so think of the Bohr model of the atom, and this is de Broglie's sort of version of it,

2637
03:24:20,740 --> 03:24:28,180
or at least one way of thinking about it using waves of electrons. So the bottom lowest energy

2638
03:24:28,180 --> 03:24:33,140
is where it's only one wavelength, and the next wavelength, next energy level is two wavelengths,

2639
03:24:33,140 --> 03:24:38,580
the third wavelength is three wavelengths, and so on, and so on, and so on. So the lowest possible

2640
03:24:38,580 --> 03:24:44,260
energy state in an atom, it must have only one wavelength in a standing wave at the bottom of

2641
03:24:44,260 --> 03:24:52,900
the pit. And so each one of these locations of the radius at which it is, it's not an electron

2642
03:24:52,900 --> 03:24:58,340
circling like a little dot, a little planet circling a little sun, it's a standing wave

2643
03:24:58,340 --> 03:25:03,940
surrounding the dot, which is itself kind of a wiggly thing too. So now we can think of it

2644
03:25:03,940 --> 03:25:08,340
instead of having it fixed on the doors, the ends must connect together, and so we have a circular

2645
03:25:08,340 --> 03:25:12,500
standing wave, not a linear standing wave, but just take the end of the door and your wrist and

2646
03:25:12,500 --> 03:25:18,180
put them together, and now you've got a circle. And at the bottom of the, and they must be circular

2647
03:25:18,180 --> 03:25:23,460
waves, otherwise it's not going to be in the box. So only at these fixed locations where you

2648
03:25:23,460 --> 03:25:30,100
have one wavelength doesn't work, and then we can equate the radius to the wavelength of the,

2649
03:25:30,100 --> 03:25:37,380
using the de Broglie relationship, and we get the same exact result as, as, as Bohr did with his

2650
03:25:37,380 --> 03:25:44,340
concept of the little planet, orbiting the little sun. Now we say that the electron is not actually

2651
03:25:44,340 --> 03:25:51,140
a point particle, it is a standing matter wave surrounding the proton, which means where the

2652
03:25:51,140 --> 03:25:56,900
heck is the electron inside the atom? That's a really interesting question. We can't find it,

2653
03:25:56,900 --> 03:26:03,540
because it's a wave. So it's a wave inside of there. And the, the de Broglie relationship then

2654
03:26:03,540 --> 03:26:10,660
then gives a very good explanation as to why this quantization must occur, because electrons have

2655
03:26:10,660 --> 03:26:17,140
wave properties, and they must have fixed standing length wave properties inside of the atom,

2656
03:26:17,140 --> 03:26:23,620
in order for it to actually be bound inside of an atom. If it does not have these standing,

2657
03:26:23,620 --> 03:26:28,340
if it's not a standing wave inside of the, inside there, then it's not going to be,

2658
03:26:29,060 --> 03:26:36,020
it simply will not be a bound state. So unbound states are states that have more energy than

2659
03:26:36,020 --> 03:26:41,620
is, well, they're more energy than being in the bound state, plus they don't have the right number

2660
03:26:41,620 --> 03:26:47,540
of wavelengths. So you can't, you must have the circular standing wave inside the atom of some

2661
03:26:47,540 --> 03:26:55,220
kind. So this concept, these two concepts where we have the Bohr's relatively simple model of

2662
03:26:55,220 --> 03:27:00,100
electron spinning around as a ball, that works. But then we have de Broglie's relationship,

2663
03:27:00,100 --> 03:27:05,140
which tells us something even new about the nature of matter. Both of them work and tell us

2664
03:27:05,140 --> 03:27:09,460
everything we want to know about the spectrum of light from the Lyman series and the ultraviolet

2665
03:27:09,460 --> 03:27:13,860
showing the transitions up and down the Balmer series in the visible light, showing transitions

2666
03:27:13,860 --> 03:27:18,900
up and down the Pashen series, which is an infrared, which starts at level three or ends at level three,

2667
03:27:20,020 --> 03:27:26,020
or yeah, n equals three. And then if we then, we can then explain all of Kirchhoff's laws

2668
03:27:26,020 --> 03:27:32,340
using the Bohr model of the atom. The lines that you see in Kirchhoff's spectra, an emission spectrum

2669
03:27:32,340 --> 03:27:39,220
is due to the huge numbers of atoms jumping up and down electrons jumping up and down in orbits

2670
03:27:39,220 --> 03:27:45,140
and sending light out from those in various directions in random directions. There's no one

2671
03:27:45,140 --> 03:27:49,540
direction that sends the light out. So it might as well go to you. And so the photons that you

2672
03:27:49,540 --> 03:27:54,180
receive, you receive them at specific, specific wavelengths. And therefore that's where we get

2673
03:27:54,180 --> 03:27:59,700
the emission spectrum of Kirchhoff, which was an empirically derived idea. Likewise, absorption

2674
03:27:59,700 --> 03:28:04,820
does the same thing because as the light goes into the cloud of atoms, they absorb specific

2675
03:28:04,820 --> 03:28:09,380
wavelengths. It makes it a little darker at those wavelengths and because that light's going someplace

2676
03:28:09,380 --> 03:28:13,780
else. And so if you look through a cloud of gas, you're going to see that it's darker at those

2677
03:28:13,780 --> 03:28:18,260
locations because some of that light has been absorbed and re-radiated in other directions.

2678
03:28:18,260 --> 03:28:22,580
And that gives the emission spectrum from the side. So the Bohr model of the atom and even

2679
03:28:22,580 --> 03:28:28,340
De Broglie's model of the atom explains Kirchhoff's empirically derived laws about the nature of what

2680
03:28:28,340 --> 03:28:33,380
spectra are. So we have lots of different ways of talking about emission lines, absorption lines,

2681
03:28:34,260 --> 03:28:41,620
and this leads us to the incredibly important idea that spectroscopy is the most key thing that we

2682
03:28:41,620 --> 03:28:49,620
have in all of astrophysics. It is everything. Basically, we will be able to determine huge

2683
03:28:49,620 --> 03:28:55,380
numbers of things about a location because of its spectrum. First and foremost, we can determine what

2684
03:28:55,380 --> 03:29:01,380
elements there are by modeling the spectrum of it, by looking at exactly what we see in the light.

2685
03:29:01,380 --> 03:29:05,540
We've got all this light here. We've got coming in and out, emission, absorption, and so forth.

2686
03:29:05,540 --> 03:29:09,540
But we can also determine temperatures and pressures because of the widths of the lines,

2687
03:29:09,540 --> 03:29:15,140
because of the Doppler shifts. We can determine huge numbers of things from spectra, but it all

2688
03:29:15,140 --> 03:29:21,700
comes from the very simple concept of the nature of the model of the atom. So let's actually just

2689
03:29:21,700 --> 03:29:26,340
back this up a little bit and we're going to take it away from the spectroscopy for just a second

2690
03:29:26,340 --> 03:29:32,660
and go address something that I was looking at and kind of dodged around, but now I'm going to come

2691
03:29:32,660 --> 03:29:39,940
at it full force. Okay, so where is the electron inside of the atom? So I alluded that there's

2692
03:29:39,940 --> 03:29:46,580
some really odd ideas and let's see what we get out of them. De Broglie's concept of a matter wave

2693
03:29:46,660 --> 03:29:53,940
and having electrons be standing waves inside of the atom changes a lot of things about the

2694
03:29:53,940 --> 03:30:00,420
nature of what we think about the atoms and matter in general. So De Broglie's hypothesis

2695
03:30:00,420 --> 03:30:04,820
that matter is a wave fundamentally changed a lot of ways the way we think about things.

2696
03:30:04,820 --> 03:30:14,180
So if the electron is in a standing wave inside of the atom, then where is it? Because just in

2697
03:30:14,180 --> 03:30:19,460
the same way that we said, okay, we're going to hook the string up to a doorknob and to my wrist,

2698
03:30:19,460 --> 03:30:24,020
we can easily make it so it's a nice standing wave. We can say, oh, what's the wavelength? Okay, we

2699
03:30:24,020 --> 03:30:28,660
can get the wavelength of it and if we flick it harder, we can have more nodes on that thing and

2700
03:30:28,660 --> 03:30:35,780
we can say it's a shorter wavelength, but if we then ask, we ask where actually is the wave

2701
03:30:35,780 --> 03:30:41,780
on the string, we wouldn't have a good answer. We'd say, well, I know that it's on the string.

2702
03:30:41,780 --> 03:30:48,020
I know that it makes up the entire length of the string, but where exactly is it? Can I pinpoint

2703
03:30:48,020 --> 03:30:54,500
it on the string? And the answer is no, you cannot. So in the same sense, we now have a very strange

2704
03:30:54,500 --> 03:31:01,860
thing where we cannot pin the electron's location inside of a bound atom. So once it's in there,

2705
03:31:01,860 --> 03:31:07,140
it's in a standing wave setup. The standing wave does not permit us to actually find the

2706
03:31:07,140 --> 03:31:13,380
location of the electron and it gets worse from there. De Broglie's concept actually still kept

2707
03:31:14,660 --> 03:31:19,300
Neal's Bohr's idea of the little planet orbiting the little sun, but now we don't even do that.

2708
03:31:19,300 --> 03:31:24,900
So now De Broglie said, okay, make a standing wave that's orbiting a little sun. Fine, but that's

2709
03:31:24,900 --> 03:31:30,740
a circular pattern. And we now know by actually then taking De Broglie's concept and accelerating it

2710
03:31:30,740 --> 03:31:35,700
a bit more and looking at it in 3D space. And actually that's the only way to actually look at

2711
03:31:35,780 --> 03:31:43,300
it is that we don't see it as a circular standing wave, but a spherical standing wave with spherical

2712
03:31:43,300 --> 03:31:49,460
harmonics. And that's a very, very, very weird thing. And the solution to the equations of what

2713
03:31:49,460 --> 03:31:56,020
the hydrogen atom really looks like had to wait until Schrodinger made his famous equation,

2714
03:31:56,020 --> 03:32:05,300
the Schrodinger equation, which codified completely the concept that matter does behave as a wave.

2715
03:32:05,780 --> 03:32:14,100
And so when we take this concept of the wave nature of all particles, then and filter this through

2716
03:32:14,100 --> 03:32:19,700
the Schrodinger equation, we find that not only is the electron a standing wave going around it,

2717
03:32:19,700 --> 03:32:25,780
but somehow it's somewhere on the surface of a sphere that's as a certain radius. And so the

2718
03:32:25,780 --> 03:32:30,980
Bohr radius is not just the radius of the orbit, it's the radius of the sphere that the electron

2719
03:32:30,980 --> 03:32:38,100
seems to be it. And the actual radius itself is fuzzy. And where the electron is on there is fuzzy.

2720
03:32:38,100 --> 03:32:44,260
In fact, it's not determined. We know it's orbit, we know with the most probable location of it,

2721
03:32:44,260 --> 03:32:49,940
most probable location. And then we can actually say, well, where should it be in this place?

2722
03:32:49,940 --> 03:32:54,020
Still applies the same thing, though, if you actually give the electron a little bit more

2723
03:32:54,020 --> 03:32:58,660
energy, it'll go up a level, it'll change its standing way properties, it'll change its

2724
03:32:58,660 --> 03:33:03,540
harmonic standing waves, but you won't be able to find the electron. And why won't you be able

2725
03:33:03,540 --> 03:33:08,900
to find the electron? Well, take the proton and the electron and break them apart and turn them

2726
03:33:08,900 --> 03:33:14,260
into an atom, not an atom, not a bound atom, but have them be free particles. The proton itself is

2727
03:33:14,260 --> 03:33:21,060
an extraordinarily small object. If you were to say that the if we were to take the proton,

2728
03:33:21,060 --> 03:33:26,740
which is on the order of 10 to the minus 12 meters, it's on that size. So it's a micromete,

2729
03:33:26,740 --> 03:33:32,340
it's a million times smaller than a micromete, or a billion times smaller than a millimeter.

2730
03:33:32,340 --> 03:33:37,220
They're really tiny things. So if you take a proton, and it's on the order of 10 to the minus

2731
03:33:37,220 --> 03:33:43,460
12 meters, and let's say we want to see how big the electron is compared to that, well, let's blow

2732
03:33:43,460 --> 03:33:48,900
up the proton not from 10 to the minus 12 meters, but now let's make it the size of a moat of cigarette

2733
03:33:48,900 --> 03:33:56,420
dust, a cigarette smoke, a moat of dust, a single moat of cigarette smoke. That's a really tiny

2734
03:33:56,420 --> 03:34:02,100
thing. It's just visible to your eye. And if we put that somewhere in a box, how far would the

2735
03:34:02,100 --> 03:34:07,620
electron be in a bound orbit? We'll come back to the size in a second. So the electron is about,

2736
03:34:08,660 --> 03:34:15,780
would live on the ground state on the surface of a sphere. That's about 25 or 30 meters in diameter.

2737
03:34:15,860 --> 03:34:20,660
So you've got this tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny thing. And on somewhere on the surface of a sphere that's

2738
03:34:20,660 --> 03:34:25,780
25 meters in diameter, that's where the electron would live. And the electron would live somewhere

2739
03:34:25,780 --> 03:34:30,180
on that surface. It would have a fuzzy radius, so it wouldn't necessarily be right at that surface.

2740
03:34:30,180 --> 03:34:35,700
So it'd be somewhere maybe between 20 meters and 30, 40 meters. It'll be in between there. And so it'd

2741
03:34:35,700 --> 03:34:41,380
be a wave type property throughout there. And you can't pin down where it is. In fact, saying where

2742
03:34:41,380 --> 03:34:46,260
it is when it's bound as an atom, it doesn't really have a lot of meaning. It has a loose meaning.

2743
03:34:47,140 --> 03:34:50,900
But really, we know the energy level of the electron, but even that is not well known.

2744
03:34:51,780 --> 03:34:58,740
So the electron itself is a fuzzy object. And so is the proton, too. So the actual orbital radii

2745
03:34:58,740 --> 03:35:03,380
are fuzzy, but it shows you the size scales. Think about the Museum of Natural History. Go to the

2746
03:35:03,380 --> 03:35:08,660
Museum of Natural History in New York City. You find this enormous, huge sphere. Google the Hayden

2747
03:35:08,660 --> 03:35:13,300
Planetarium to see the size of the sphere. It's really big. So there's a model inside the Museum

2748
03:35:13,300 --> 03:35:17,220
that says, here's the size of a proton, and here's the size of an electron. It tries to show you the

2749
03:35:17,220 --> 03:35:24,180
size of an atom. And basically, put the proton, this mode of dust in the center of that sphere,

2750
03:35:24,180 --> 03:35:27,780
and put the electron somewhere on the surface of that sphere. And that gives you the concept of how

2751
03:35:27,780 --> 03:35:33,940
big it is. The electron itself is about 1,000 times, 2,000 times less massive than the proton.

2752
03:35:34,020 --> 03:35:39,460
But its size is determined kind of by its interaction. So it actually has kind of a very

2753
03:35:39,460 --> 03:35:45,540
strange, it's very, very small. Its characteristic interaction is a little bit bigger, so its actual

2754
03:35:45,540 --> 03:35:51,860
physical size is kind of an oddly ill-defined term. There are some definitions. There are ways

2755
03:35:51,860 --> 03:35:59,780
to define how big an electron is, but it's a much smaller object than the proton. So the electrons

2756
03:35:59,780 --> 03:36:06,340
orbit around the proton is fuzzy. However, we can approximate it with de Broglie's concept,

2757
03:36:06,340 --> 03:36:11,940
which means it's to a circular orbit. And we can approximate de Broglie's idea to a little tiny

2758
03:36:11,940 --> 03:36:17,780
planet around a little tiny sun. That's Bohr's model of the atom. And Bohr's model of the atom

2759
03:36:17,780 --> 03:36:23,460
had a quantized set of, as a quantized angular momentum. And we still maintain this concept

2760
03:36:23,460 --> 03:36:28,340
of the quantum mechanics. I mean, that's what we mean. The mechanics simply is, how do things move

2761
03:36:28,340 --> 03:36:33,460
under the influences of forces when they're given energies and speeds, and what are their locations,

2762
03:36:33,460 --> 03:36:38,100
how fast do they go, how fast do they accelerate, how fast do they decelerate, etc.

2763
03:36:38,100 --> 03:36:42,340
What are their directions change? That is mechanics. And it depends on their masses,

2764
03:36:42,340 --> 03:36:45,700
it depends on their inertia, it depends on their momenta, it depends on all these things. And those

2765
03:36:45,700 --> 03:36:51,860
are the study of mechanics. So quantum mechanics says, what happens when you take classical

2766
03:36:51,860 --> 03:36:57,780
mechanics, which is just how things move, but apply quantum principles to it, such as quantized

2767
03:36:57,860 --> 03:37:05,300
angular momenta, like Niels Bohr suggested, or matter wave concepts, such as de Broglie came up with.

2768
03:37:05,300 --> 03:37:14,260
Now, this idea of the fuzziness arose, of course, from the Schrödinger equation, which is a

2769
03:37:14,260 --> 03:37:23,380
relationship that just demonstrates how all of matter demonstrates wave-like properties. Even

2770
03:37:23,380 --> 03:37:28,660
large-scale matter displays wave-like properties, although the wavelengths are incredibly short.

2771
03:37:28,660 --> 03:37:32,900
When you're talking electrons, the wavelengths are roughly the same size as the particle itself,

2772
03:37:32,900 --> 03:37:36,580
so now you've got a matter and a wavelength that are roughly the same size, and you have to deal

2773
03:37:36,580 --> 03:37:41,700
with these quantum mechanical effects. We don't, in our daily lives, don't have to deal with

2774
03:37:41,700 --> 03:37:47,380
quantum mechanical effects because our sizes are much larger than our characteristic de Broglie

2775
03:37:47,380 --> 03:37:52,900
wavelengths. So this is kind of an important set of things. In fact, the quantum mechanical

2776
03:37:52,900 --> 03:37:58,180
universe that we're talking about, the quantum mechanical model of the universe, is extraordinarily

2777
03:37:58,180 --> 03:38:03,460
well supported by experiment. It is considered to be one of the triumphs of 20th century physics,

2778
03:38:04,260 --> 03:38:09,940
and it had the evidence for this model that matter behaves in wave-like properties. That's

2779
03:38:09,940 --> 03:38:16,500
enormous, enormous evidence for it, such as the nature of the black body radiation. Einstein's

2780
03:38:17,220 --> 03:38:22,820
photoelectric effect demonstrates it. There's wave-particle duality, meaning the dual nature

2781
03:38:22,820 --> 03:38:29,860
of both wave-like properties and particle-like properties using, say, Young's double-slit

2782
03:38:29,860 --> 03:38:35,220
experiment, but you can use Young's double-slit experiment for photons and apply it to electrons,

2783
03:38:35,220 --> 03:38:42,500
and you get the same thing. So this was done in 1927, and this was characteristic proof of

2784
03:38:42,500 --> 03:38:48,020
de Broglie's concept in 1924. Further and foremost, you get out of electron scanning microscopes,

2785
03:38:48,020 --> 03:38:53,940
which must do quantum mechanical behavior, but even more bizarrely is that every electronic

2786
03:38:53,940 --> 03:38:59,700
device that is used today must take into account quantum mechanical effects in order to actually

2787
03:38:59,700 --> 03:39:05,300
operate, and we'll even see that quantum mechanical effects are critical for our understanding of how

2788
03:39:05,300 --> 03:39:11,540
the sun works. Without quantum mechanics, we would actually not have any idea how the sun actually

2789
03:39:11,540 --> 03:39:17,540
shines as long as it does for the rate of energy that it puts out. Quantum mechanics is a requirement

2790
03:39:17,540 --> 03:39:24,580
for us to understand the way that the sun works, and the predictions associated with it tell us

2791
03:39:24,580 --> 03:39:30,260
how the sun works, which is a really fascinating thing. And so when we dig deeper into the nature

2792
03:39:30,260 --> 03:39:35,940
of what quantum mechanics tells us, we uncover what we would call a bedrock principle, and some

2793
03:39:36,020 --> 03:39:42,500
textbooks on quantum mechanics start with the concept of the non-commutativity of the various

2794
03:39:42,500 --> 03:39:47,460
parameters or various measurements, but we can summarize that with the Heisenberg uncertainty

2795
03:39:47,460 --> 03:39:53,220
principle, which says you simply can't measure paired measurements, there are certain sets of

2796
03:39:53,220 --> 03:39:58,900
paired measurements that you cannot measure infinitely accurately at the same time.

2797
03:39:59,860 --> 03:40:05,700
Specifically, two of the most famous are you can't measure the momentum of a particle

2798
03:40:05,700 --> 03:40:13,860
and the position of a particle with infinite precision. So if you know exactly where the

2799
03:40:13,860 --> 03:40:18,900
electron is, you have no idea what its momentum is, and momentum, according to the Broglie principle,

2800
03:40:18,900 --> 03:40:24,580
is the wavelength. So if you knew exactly what the Broglie wavelength was, you don't know where its

2801
03:40:24,580 --> 03:40:30,020
position is, and that's exactly what we meant by the whole string wave on a string thing, is that

2802
03:40:30,020 --> 03:40:34,500
if now the electron is a wave on a string between a doorknob and your wrist, and that's the electron,

2803
03:40:34,500 --> 03:40:41,620
where is the electron? It's there, but where, so you can't find it, and that's a fundamental basis

2804
03:40:41,620 --> 03:40:46,900
of quantum mechanics, is that you can't have these measurements, you can't have infinitely precise

2805
03:40:46,980 --> 03:40:54,420
measurements of two things, of paired sets of measurements. So another one is the energy

2806
03:40:54,420 --> 03:41:01,140
difference between states, and the time at which they live at that state, or the knowledge of the

2807
03:41:01,140 --> 03:41:07,620
energy level of that state, and that's actually why the second one is actually why the lines

2808
03:41:07,620 --> 03:41:13,540
have a breadth to them in spectroscopy, and that's one of the bases of the lines, there's

2809
03:41:13,540 --> 03:41:18,420
many reasons for the line's breadth, but the width of the lines can be attributed to the fact that

2810
03:41:18,420 --> 03:41:23,140
we really can't actually know the energy level inside of the atom, so we see how it's three

2811
03:41:23,140 --> 03:41:28,020
energy level three and energy level two, well those energy levels are fuzzy, and so the very

2812
03:41:28,020 --> 03:41:34,180
act of the fuzziness itself creates a width to the line, so the frequency at which we observe it

2813
03:41:34,180 --> 03:41:40,020
and is proportion, cannot be, you can't actually measure the, you can't measure both the energy

2814
03:41:40,020 --> 03:41:48,020
of the output and how long it lives at that location in that state, which is really fascinating.

2815
03:41:48,020 --> 03:41:53,380
So the concept of quantum mechanics, the basis of it, is that there's these fundamental bedrock

2816
03:41:53,380 --> 03:41:57,220
principles, and one of them is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that says there are,

2817
03:41:57,220 --> 03:42:02,740
there are two separate measurements or paired measurements that cannot be measured with equal

2818
03:42:02,740 --> 03:42:07,620
or infinite precision, you can't measure one of them without having complete lack of knowledge

2819
03:42:07,620 --> 03:42:12,500
of both with the other one, so you basically get fuzzy on these things, it's like I kind of know

2820
03:42:12,500 --> 03:42:15,700
it to this well, and I kind of know that one to that well, and that's all I'm never going to get,

2821
03:42:15,700 --> 03:42:22,740
and there's no thing you can do to circumvent that, that is a fundamental axiom of quantum

2822
03:42:22,740 --> 03:42:28,180
mechanics, people say well if technology gets better then they'll figure it out, well this is

2823
03:42:28,900 --> 03:42:36,020
having been figured out, and this is how nature works, which really is weird, it's not something

2824
03:42:36,740 --> 03:42:41,460
overcome by somebody building a new widget or something like that, no this will never be

2825
03:42:41,460 --> 03:42:47,780
overcome because it's a fact of nature, it's the way nature works, which makes it even more

2826
03:42:47,780 --> 03:42:56,420
interesting, so if we think about the nature of what nature works, we find that the solution

2827
03:42:56,420 --> 03:43:01,860
for the Schrodinger equation for the hydrogen atom has all sorts of funny waveforms, and they're

2828
03:43:01,860 --> 03:43:06,980
based on spherical harmonics and the appearance of the thing, so it's not these simple spherical

2829
03:43:06,980 --> 03:43:11,300
orbits, these circular orbits, it depends on, there's actually three quantum numbers, there's

2830
03:43:11,300 --> 03:43:16,500
the primary quantum number, we also have what was called the azimuthal quantum number, the magnetic

2831
03:43:16,500 --> 03:43:21,780
quantum number, and they're kind of weird, but they're all interrelated, and yet these three

2832
03:43:21,780 --> 03:43:26,660
quantum numbers which are associated with electrons and matter waves, or waves of matter,

2833
03:43:26,660 --> 03:43:30,660
because now we're looking at three dimensions, we have three quantum numbers, I guess you can do it

2834
03:43:30,660 --> 03:43:34,740
that way, but let's just keep it that for simplicity, but there are three quantum numbers

2835
03:43:35,780 --> 03:43:42,900
that determine the appearance of the, that determine the appearance of the waveform of the

2836
03:43:42,900 --> 03:43:50,580
electron as it orbits the proton at various energy levels, which is interesting, and some of those

2837
03:43:50,580 --> 03:43:56,020
quantum numbers don't change the energy, the magnetic quantum number does not change the energy,

2838
03:43:56,020 --> 03:44:00,900
they're degenerate, it was called because of the same energy, but they have different configurations,

2839
03:44:00,900 --> 03:44:05,460
so we can have the same configuration at, different configurations of the same energy.

2840
03:44:05,460 --> 03:44:11,940
In any event, the hydrogen wave equation is the only atom for which we can solve the Schrodinger

2841
03:44:11,940 --> 03:44:18,660
equation to actually give us the appearance, to analytically show with an equation what it is.

2842
03:44:18,660 --> 03:44:23,780
Everything else is too complicated and must be done numerically. Finally, what's very strange,

2843
03:44:23,860 --> 03:44:29,300
remember I mentioned, it's like, well, what's your, what is your quantum wavelength? Well,

2844
03:44:29,300 --> 03:44:35,140
it's true, is that if you could somehow over an extraordinarily long period of time live,

2845
03:44:35,140 --> 03:44:41,460
let's say you could potentially live for 10 to the 70th years, let's just say you could do that,

2846
03:44:41,460 --> 03:44:47,860
that's a long time to live, if you could live for 10 to the 70th years, and every day you cut,

2847
03:44:47,860 --> 03:44:52,100
you punched your hand at a wall, you just went pop, pop, pop, punch your hand through a wall,

2848
03:44:52,100 --> 03:44:56,340
at some point your hand would go through the wall, not because you're punching a hole in the wall,

2849
03:44:56,340 --> 03:45:02,100
but because the probability for you to do that, maybe you punched your hand at the wall

2850
03:45:03,140 --> 03:45:08,180
10 to the 12th times a second for 10 to the 60th years, it's a lot of times to punch a hand

2851
03:45:08,180 --> 03:45:12,740
on the wall and you're going to be doing like a super hummingbird, and so whatever, in any event,

2852
03:45:12,740 --> 03:45:18,100
if you could do that, eventually your hand would go through the wall and come back,

2853
03:45:18,100 --> 03:45:22,980
because you're pulling your hand back through, and it will be okay, so the quantum mechanical world

2854
03:45:22,980 --> 03:45:28,660
says that you can't necessarily know the position of things, and when we talk about macroscopic

2855
03:45:28,660 --> 03:45:34,020
objects like people, their wavelengths are incredibly small, so the probability that they

2856
03:45:34,020 --> 03:45:39,860
go through things like that is catastrophically tiny, and so therefore you don't have to worry

2857
03:45:39,860 --> 03:45:45,940
about tunneling through walls and things like that, but if we lived in a quantum mechanical world,

2858
03:45:45,940 --> 03:45:52,420
then cows could go visit dolphins, so long as they, as they dolphin jumped out, a cow could then

2859
03:45:52,420 --> 03:45:58,180
drop back, as soon as it got back to the ocean, that's okay, so long as the cow lands on the ground,

2860
03:45:58,180 --> 03:46:03,300
remember the concept of quantum mechanics says you can't know the position and the momentum of

2861
03:46:03,300 --> 03:46:08,740
something with equal accuracy, if we lived in a quantum mechanical world, things would be appearing

2862
03:46:08,740 --> 03:46:14,020
and disappearing all around us, trucks, buses, buildings, everything, other people, friends,

2863
03:46:14,020 --> 03:46:17,300
would just simply appear and disappear, we would have no idea where they came from or where they're

2864
03:46:17,300 --> 03:46:22,180
going next, and that's the quantum mechanical world, it's like, well what's the probability that

2865
03:46:22,180 --> 03:46:26,900
you're going to see your friend over here downtown, you would not say, hey meet me downtown at six o'clock,

2866
03:46:26,900 --> 03:46:31,300
you'd say, well what's your best chance you'll be downtown at six o'clock, you'll get, you'll

2867
03:46:31,300 --> 03:46:36,900
calculate the joint probability of you and your friend being downtown at the same time,

2868
03:46:37,780 --> 03:46:42,980
in any event, quantum mechanics is how we actually discuss the nature of the world,

2869
03:46:42,980 --> 03:46:47,620
but when we talk astronomically, we tend to use the Bohr model of the atom because it's really

2870
03:46:47,620 --> 03:46:51,940
simple to understand, and that kind of gives a really good visualization, it's very hard to

2871
03:46:51,940 --> 03:46:56,980
visualize all these other things, so what we do is we try to think that we know that there's,

2872
03:46:56,980 --> 03:47:04,020
that basically electrons must live in fixed orbital radii away from their nuclei of their atoms,

2873
03:47:04,020 --> 03:47:09,220
and that concept that leads us to the nature of what spectroscopy does and helps us to understand

2874
03:47:09,220 --> 03:47:13,860
how Kirchhoff's laws arise, and so when we look at, we look at distant astronomical objects,

2875
03:47:13,860 --> 03:47:20,580
as we will in the future, then we will see that we can model an atomic process to the light that

2876
03:47:20,580 --> 03:47:27,700
gets emitted to what happens when it arrives at our telescope and our detector, so next time

2877
03:47:27,700 --> 03:47:30,980
we'll talk about telescopes and how they work.
