0	6420	Hi, everyone. Today, I'm going to tell you about
6420	10820	the new methodologies that we are exploring here at
10820	14560	Microsoft Research to train large language models.
14560	17860	This is joint work with a really fantastic team.
17860	22420	You can see all of the courses here on this slide,
22420	26200	and the name of the methodology is Textbooks Hourly.
26200	29380	Let's jump right in.
29380	33380	This methodology, we are currently
33380	36340	applying it to train new large language models,
36340	40180	and we have two of those models that I will talk about today.
40180	43020	This is a first batch in a series of models
43020	45680	that we hope to create with this new technique.
45680	47780	The first one is Phi1,
47780	53660	and the second one is Phi1.5 that we just released very recently.
53660	57380	Both of those are small large language models,
57380	59620	small at least by the standards of today,
59620	62420	with only 1.3 billion parameters model.
62420	65260	What are those models?
65260	68140	Phi1 is a coding model with
68140	72060	performance that we evaluate to be comparable to models that
72060	75340	are roughly 10 times bigger and trains on data set,
75340	77660	which are more than a 100 times bigger,
77660	81020	so three orders of magnitude gains for Phi1,
81020	83860	for coding specifically and coding in Python.
83860	88220	Phi1.5 is our technique applied to natural language,
88220	93140	and there we estimate that roughly Phi1.5 is comparable to models
93140	97340	that are 10 times bigger and train on at least 30 times more data.
97340	100700	Moreover, this is performance in terms of natural language,
100700	104420	but if you go to reasoning and specifically coding and mathematics,
104420	111260	Phi1.5 should be compared to models that are probably more like 50 times larger.
111620	114620	I will come back to this later in the presentation.
114620	117500	I'm first going to focus on Phi1 and coding to explain
117500	120180	the textbooks how you need methodology.
120180	123820	First, let me just backtrack for one second.
123820	127620	What are we talking about with large language models for coding?
127620	130100	Well, we're talking about things like co-pilot,
130100	133180	where you give the beginning of some code and then you
133180	135860	ask for basically a completion of the code.
135860	139540	This is what those large language models for code are doing.
139540	142820	We're going to tell you a new models like this with
142820	147620	only 1.3 billion parameters that does this code completion very well.
147620	149420	Now, the question, natural question is,
149420	153620	how do you evaluate the performance of an LLM on code?
153620	159460	There is a quite standard benchmark by now from OpenAI called HumanEval.
159460	163220	This is one way to evaluate coding models.
163220	168300	This is 164 handwritten programming questions with unit tests.
168300	171340	Each of those programming question comes with a set of unit tests,
171340	175300	and you say that you absolve the task if you can pass all of these unit tests.
175300	177900	What do those programming questions look like?
177900	179460	They look like this.
179460	181860	You get a name for the definition of the function,
181860	184820	like increase list, and then you get a doc string
184820	187420	explaining to you what's in natural language,
187420	190940	what the function is supposed to do with maybe some example,
190940	193260	and now the goal is to complete,
193260	197180	to write the code that does what the doc string is asking you to do.
197180	202100	Here, just two examples, one where you have to return codes that,
202100	205620	given a list, increase all elements by one,
205620	208820	and this other one is given a list of integer,
208820	212220	return the sum of all the odd elements that are in the event position.
212220	214300	You see, these code completions are very easy,
214300	215420	it's just one line of code,
215420	216740	so this is very simple,
216740	218700	but in the HumanEval benchmark,
218700	221580	there are also much more difficult coding questions.
221580	226500	Now, let's look at the progress that have been made on this benchmark
226500	227900	in the last couple of years.
227900	231940	As you all know, AI has made incredible progress recently.
231940	235500	Let's see how it looks like in action on this specific task
235500	238740	of coding and specifically HumanEval.
238740	244580	So HumanEval was introduced again two years ago in July 2021 by OpenAI,
244580	247700	and at the time they created also two models,
247700	250260	the Codex series of model,
250260	253580	and these were coding large language model,
253580	255580	and here I'm giving you two example.
255780	258580	One is a 300 million model,
258580	261340	and one is a 12 billion parameters model.
261340	263140	So you see here is the model size.
263140	266660	Both of those models were trained on 100 billion tokens.
266660	269020	So this is the size of the dataset,
269020	271540	and what scores did they reach on HumanEval?
271540	275100	Well, the 300 million only got a mere 13%
275100	277420	while as you scale up the size of the model,
277420	280540	you get this amazing, fantastic magical behavior
280540	282980	that as you scale up the model, the performance improved,
282980	286180	and you can see a huge jump to almost 29%.
286180	287980	Okay, so this was two years ago.
287980	290460	So what happened since then?
290460	293020	Well, shortly after something interesting happened,
294140	297540	these folks at CodeGen, they created a model
297540	301660	trying to mimic OpenAI, but they open sourced their model.
301660	303300	They obtained very similar result.
303300	306540	You see that at 350 million, they also got 13%.
306540	309140	At 16 billion, they got the 29%.
309140	314140	They had a dataset much bigger, 500 billion tokens,
314340	318380	yet no real improvement in terms of the HumanEval.
318380	321340	Now, after that, things started to heat up a little bit,
321340	324220	and you can see the big model started to emerge
324220	329220	with palm coder, specifically 500 billion parameters,
329620	331380	a much bigger dataset.
331380	335540	We are now nearing the 1 trillion tokens, 780,
335540	337260	and you get again a little boost,
337260	340020	but you see some kind of diminishing return.
340020	342900	We moved from 300 million to 12 billion.
342900	346540	We got a 2x improvement from 13 to 29%.
346540	349220	Now you move to 12 billion to 500 billion,
349220	351940	and you only get an improvement to 35%.
351940	355020	So maybe some kind of little diminishing return.
355020	358860	Of course, GPT 3.5, we don't know the size of the dataset,
358860	361380	but this is 175 billion parameters,
361380	365260	and this reaches an amazing 47%.
365260	367540	Other models, you see, they are increasing the size
367540	370540	of the data, and you get very little improvement.
370540	371540	Here's the center coder.
371540	373500	It's interesting because it's 1 billion parameter,
373500	375300	like the model that I will tell you about,
375300	378020	and it reaches only 14%.
378020	381700	But then, of course, GPT 4 happened roughly six months ago,
381700	386700	and this made an amazing jump to 67% on HumanEval.
387300	390060	And in fact, this is a version that was released in March,
390060	392540	but the version we had access to in Sparks
392540	394540	even got a higher score.
394540	398260	So GPT 4 really kind of cracks the problem.
398260	402340	Now, shortly after GPT 4, things really started to heat up,
402340	405540	and we see that we have new models coming out every month.
405540	409620	In fact, in May, we have many models that came out,
409620	412820	and they all share roughly the same characteristic.
412820	414940	You see that the dataset, they are huge,
414940	417420	500 billion, 1 trillion.
417420	420100	Some of the recent ones here are slightly smaller,
420100	424140	but the models are all big, 15 billion parameters
424140	427660	you get in the 30%, 16 billion parameters
427660	430100	you get again in the 30, 35%.
430100	432700	So you see it's all roughly in the same ballpark,
432700	435980	maybe with WizardCoder being the exception,
435980	439020	which is a jump at 16 billion parameters,
439020	443380	1 trillion tokens, it gets to 57%.
443380	444860	Now, let me tell you what we did.
444860	447260	We phi one, and the textbooks are all in it approach,
447260	449340	which I will explain in a minute what it is.
449340	451140	Here is the result that we got.
451140	453580	We have a much smaller model,
453580	455660	only 1.3 billion parameters.
455660	459100	A dataset which is incomparable to those other datasets,
459100	464100	only 7 billion tokens, yet we reach 50.6% accuracy.
464580	467340	So except for GPT-4 and for WizardCoder,
467340	469300	this is the best in this table,
469300	473340	despite being so much like three orders of magnitude smaller.
473340	475460	And moreover, we're gonna talk about
475460	477660	whether we were overfitting to human eval,
477660	479700	this is a very natural question.
479700	481540	We will talk about it a little bit later,
481540	483540	but I can already give you another benchmark,
484500	488180	mostly basic Python programs or Python puzzles.
488180	491300	We get 55% there, which is higher, for example,
491300	492780	than WizardCoder.
492780	495620	So this is just a small indication right now
495620	498900	that we're not at least overfitting to human eval.
498900	500940	So now let me explain to you what we did.
500940	503460	What is this textbooks are all in it approach?
503460	506380	And for that, let me just backtrack one second.
506380	509940	What are those datasets that all those other models
509940	513380	are using to train their large language models for code?
513380	515740	Well, one publicly available dataset
515740	519380	is this very nice dataset called the stack,
519380	524380	which is three terabytes of data collected from GitHub,
524980	527180	which is under a permissive license,
527180	529220	so we can use it to train.
529220	531420	And these folks, they release the dataset
531420	532860	and you can see here the distribution
532860	534260	of programming languages.
534260	535900	And we're gonna look specifically
535900	539380	at the Python subset of this dataset,
539380	542340	which is made of 26 billion tokens.
542340	544260	Okay, so it's a small part of the stack
544260	546940	and we're gonna focus on that, okay?
546940	550020	Now, what does this dataset look like?
550020	554060	How does it look to learn how to code from the stack?
554060	556620	Well, in this dataset, you have documents
556620	559140	that look like this one, okay?
559140	562540	So, you look at this code, good luck
562540	565460	to kind of understand how to code from this.
565460	567060	I mean, there is no explanation.
567060	569500	This is probably like a document in the middle
569500	571340	of a much bigger project.
571340	573380	It's hard to say what this is gonna do
573380	575220	if it does anything at all.
575220	577860	So, it's very hard to learn anything
577860	579380	from a document like this.
579380	583100	Yet, a lot of the stack is made of documents like that,
583100	585100	which are part of much bigger project
585100	588620	and it's hard to make sense of them in isolation.
588620	592900	Now, you also have documents like this one on the left.
592900	595100	This one is much higher quality.
595100	596620	You can learn something from it.
596620	599120	You see that you have simple functions,
599120	601480	which are well-defined with some comments,
601480	603160	with some doc strings that explain to you
603160	608160	what the model is, what the function is supposed to do.
608560	612120	It stands to reason that for a large language model,
612120	614560	it's gonna be much easier to learn from documents
614560	617320	like the left compared to document on the right.
617320	619140	Maybe with document on the right,
619140	621940	what you can do is merely learn some syntax,
621940	624480	but you cannot really learn any real reason.
624480	626880	So, our idea in textbooks, our only need is,
626920	628840	why don't we focus on data set
628840	631040	that only contains example on the left
631040	632760	rather than example on the right?
632760	635320	Why don't we focus on data
635320	639600	that is only of textbook quality level, okay?
639600	641200	Now, how are we gonna do that?
641200	644200	How are we gonna filter maybe the stack
644200	646000	so that it contains, so that we retain
646000	649680	only the textbook quality level material?
649680	654000	Well, we have this amazing new tool at our disposal, GPT-4.
654000	658120	And GPT-4 can reliably classify high educational value.
658120	659640	If you prompt it correctly
659640	661680	and you give it the two documents
661680	663600	that I gave you on the previous slide,
663600	665980	it will tell you that the document on the left
665980	667800	is of higher educational values
667800	669680	than the document on the right, okay?
669680	672040	So, you can use GPT-4 to get a score
672040	675520	on how useful to teach a skill
675520	677360	a certain document is gonna be.
677360	678880	Now, here's the problem.
678880	681560	I told you that the stack for Python
681560	683560	is roughly 26 billion parameters.
683560	684760	In fact, it's a stack dedupe
684760	687960	where there is some deduplication method being applied.
687960	689320	So let's call it SDP.
689320	691760	So SDP is 26 billion tokens.
691760	694000	If you were to use Azure OpenAI
694000	697320	to label all of those documents using GPT-4,
697320	699840	this would cost you around $1 million,
699840	700880	which is a lot of money.
700880	703640	And maybe for a scientific experiment,
703640	705720	it might be a little bit too much.
705720	709520	But GPT-4 can do so much more
709520	712560	than just classify high educational value document.
712560	714640	It can do many, many things as you all know,
714640	717640	and as we discussed in the Spark's paper.
717640	720720	So why don't we try to train a classifier
720720	724480	that only mimics this very specific aspect of GPT-4?
724480	726760	That makes sense that this could possibly work.
726760	729180	And indeed, this is exactly what we do.
729180	731520	We label a small fraction of SDP,
731520	733200	and then we train another classifier,
733200	734880	in this case, a random forest,
734880	736760	to filter the rest of the data
736760	740160	where this small classifier was trained to mimic GPT-4
740160	744480	on the small fraction of SDPs that was labeled using GPT-4.
744480	746040	And that's basically it.
746040	749840	Now we have a threshold values that we can set.
749840	752960	And we can say, maybe we want to keep only the documents
752960	756360	that have an educational value higher than seven over 10,
756360	758940	or maybe only higher than five over 10.
758940	760680	So what we decided here,
760680	762160	after lots of experimentation,
762160	765600	is we decided to keep the top 20% of SDP.
765600	769000	So the top 20% of SDP, it's only six billion tokens.
769120	772840	And in addition, we also generated one billion tokens
772840	777200	of just pure educational content, meaning textbooks.
777200	781320	We just generated synthetically textbooks using GPT-3.5.
781320	785080	Again, here, all the magic is how do you prompt GPT-3.5
785080	788720	correctly to generate a lot of diversity of textbooks.
788720	789960	Just to give you an example,
789960	792600	this is a type of textbooks that were generated.
792600	794800	So you see there is a lot of natural language.
794800	796560	Here is talking about some matrices,
796560	798720	defining singular values, et cetera.
798800	800200	And then it's giving you an example,
800200	802880	a snippet of code that calculates
802880	807280	whether it's a singular values of the matrix,
807280	809880	and then a little example.
809880	810800	All right.
810800	813440	I should say, so before I say that,
813440	816560	the resulting training dataset we call it called textbooks.
816560	820600	Okay, so code textbook is a combination of filtered SDP,
820600	822720	filtered for high educational value
822720	825240	using a classifier that mimics GPT-4,
825240	827760	plus textbooks that were synthetically generated
827760	829320	from GPT-3.5.
829320	831320	And let me say that this whole approach,
831320	836240	this whole philosophy of creating synthetic training data
836240	839000	is inspired by the really pioneering work
839000	840840	of Ronan Eldan and Yonjuli,
840840	845360	who are also a part of the team for both PHY1 and PHY1.5,
845360	849000	essential members of the team.
849000	850800	So they created tiny stories.
850800	855240	So tiny stories was a 10 million parameters model
855240	857120	that can speak fluent English.
857120	858360	And how did they achieve that?
858360	859840	Well, they did exactly the same things.
859840	863360	They used GPT-3.5 to generate a lot of stories,
863360	868160	tiny stories, from which a small model could learn from.
868160	871960	So what kind of stories can a small model learn from?
871960	873360	They need to be simple enough,
873360	878000	kind of three, four, five years old kid type of level.
878000	881520	So what they did is that they created a vocabulary
881520	884800	of 2,000 words, and then they selected
884800	886680	that random words from this vocabulary,
886680	889480	and they asked GPT-3.5 write a story
889480	891760	with those three words in it.
891760	894920	And by doing that, by seeding into their generation,
894920	896560	into this vocabulary,
896560	899680	they were able to have a lot more diversity
899680	902480	than you would get if you were just to ask GPT-3.5,
902480	904600	A, write me a tiny story.
904600	907800	If you ask GPT-3.5 to just write a tiny story,
907800	910720	it will over and over again write the same story
910720	913240	about kids going to the park,
913240	914800	like their ice cream fall on the ground
914920	917480	and they start crying or whatever.
917480	921040	To create diversity, you need to seed the generation
921040	923360	into some external material.
923360	925480	What Ronan and Yonju did back then
925480	928600	was to seed it into a very simple vocabulary list.
928600	932440	Here for this PHY1, we have to seed it into something else,
932440	936200	and this is where we can create a lot of diversity.
936200	939240	Okay, so now we have this dataset code textbook.
939240	940960	Let's see what the results are.
940960	943400	And what I'm gonna do is that I'm gonna compare for you
943400	945280	what happens if you train on code textbook,
945280	947400	which is just seven billion tokens,
947400	950640	versus if you were to train on the stack unfiltered,
950640	954840	the 26 billion tokens dataset.
954840	955680	So if you do that,
955680	957760	so you train for 26 billion tokens,
957760	960200	and let's train a small model, 350 million,
960200	962480	you see that on the stack, you get 11%,
962480	964280	which is completely consistent
964280	966080	with the tables that I showed you before.
966080	967440	This is what CodeGen got,
967440	970240	this is what Codex got two years ago.
970240	972240	This makes sense, this 11%.
972240	975720	You see that on code textbook, you already get 16, okay?
975720	977400	And note that on code textbook,
977400	980000	we're already doing multiple passes over the data,
980000	982440	because it's only seven billion tokens.
982440	986360	So we're making many passes, yet we improve.
986360	988800	Now, as you know, there are two axes
988800	991700	that we can scale up in deep learning.
991700	993760	One is to make the model bigger,
993760	996280	which we will see what happens.
996280	997960	The other one is to spend more compute,
997960	1001280	to train for longer, to go more passes over the data.
1001280	1002640	Let's see what happens if we do that.
1002640	1005680	So instead of training for 26 billion tokens,
1005680	1008320	we're not gonna train for 76 billion tokens.
1008320	1010800	So that means that on the stack,
1010800	1012560	we're making four passes,
1012560	1013600	whereas on code textbook,
1013600	1015640	we're making 10 passes over the data.
1015640	1017880	And you see what's amazing is on the stack,
1017880	1020160	by making more passes, you don't really improve.
1020160	1022120	You go from 11 to 12.
1022120	1023520	But on code textbook,
1023520	1025480	because this is textbook material,
1025480	1027320	going over it many times,
1027320	1029320	there is a lot of benefit from it.
1029320	1031720	So when you go from making four passes
1031720	1032680	to making 10 passes,
1032680	1035160	you go at a 4% increase in human development,
1035160	1037240	which is really, really significant.
1037240	1042080	So at 20%, we're already talking about two times better
1042080	1047080	than previous models at the 300 million parameters scale.
1047880	1050640	Okay, but what about scaling up the model?
1050640	1053360	Maybe our data set is too small
1053360	1054440	and it's not gonna benefit
1054440	1056240	from scaling up the size of the model.
1056240	1059040	And maybe this is why those other data sets
1059040	1061120	are good because they can allow you
1061120	1062160	to have a much bigger model.
1062160	1063080	So let's see what happens
1063080	1065720	when you train a 1.3 billion parameters model.
1065720	1067720	And here, of course, the magic,
1067720	1072720	you go from 12% to 17% for training on the stack.
1073120	1076360	But see, you also get a huge benefit on the textbook.
1076360	1079000	You go from 20% to 29%.
1079000	1081760	So this model, 1.3 billion parameters
1081760	1084640	trained for 50 billion tokens,
1084640	1086680	we call it a 51 base.
1086680	1088440	Okay, so this is our base model
1088440	1091160	at 1 billion parameters, 29%.
1091160	1094600	But then as anyone who has ever tried to learn anything
1094600	1097840	knows, it's not enough to just read the textbooks.
1097840	1099200	You actually need to exercise.
1099200	1101040	You need to do some exercises.
1101040	1103360	So what we're gonna do is that now we're gonna create
1103360	1106480	an exercises data set, code exercises,
1106480	1108400	and we're gonna find you now models on it.
1108400	1109680	And let's see what happens.
1109680	1112720	And this is where the huge jump happens.
1112720	1115920	We go from, you see 16% to 41%
1115920	1118800	and this tiny model trained for just four passes.
1118800	1121160	You go from 20 to 45%.
1121160	1124520	So a 45% accuracy human Neval
1124520	1126160	with 350 million parameters.
1126160	1130600	This is close to GPT 3.5 level of accuracy on human Neval
1130600	1132840	with only 300 million parameters model.
1132840	1136320	If you go to 1.3 billion, we get to 51% accuracy.
1136320	1138800	And this is the model that we call 51.
1138800	1141520	Okay, so you see some real magic happens
1141520	1143520	once you fine tune on the exercises.
1143520	1145640	Just like for a human being,
1145640	1149040	once you start to exercise and put in action your learning,
1149040	1151840	something really significant happens in your brain.
1151840	1153800	So what is this code exercises?
1153800	1156160	And are we cheating somehow?
1156160	1158000	When we train on code exercises,
1158000	1161760	the results are so good, it's something fishy going on.
1161760	1164520	So code exercises is a data set,
1164520	1168320	a small, a tiny data set of only one million exercises
1168320	1171080	which corresponds to roughly 200 million tokens.
1171080	1173360	It was generated by GPT 3.5.
1173360	1175280	And the format of the question is similar
1175280	1176120	to human Neval.
1176120	1177240	So you have a function name,
1177240	1178880	you have a doc strings that tells you what to do,
1178880	1181560	and then it auto completes, okay?
1181560	1185080	So it's very natural to ask, okay,
1185080	1186120	are you cheating somehow?
1186120	1187520	Is there contamination?
1187520	1190680	Is it that maybe many of the human Neval questions,
1190680	1191720	they leaked somehow
1191720	1194600	and they are in your code exercises data set?
1194600	1196360	Of course we didn't want that,
1196360	1199920	but maybe it happened just because GPT 3.5 knows human Neval
1199920	1202200	and somehow copied those questions.
1202200	1204520	So it's very natural to ask
1204520	1206040	and it's important to us
1206040	1208920	whether there is contamination by human Neval
1208920	1210280	in code exercises.
1210280	1212760	So let's try to answer this question.
1212760	1214600	Okay, let's see if we were cheating.
1215600	1218480	And it's a difficult question, as many of you know.
1218480	1221200	So maybe the first answer, which is a weak answer,
1221200	1222320	but it's the first answer,
1222320	1225120	is that we didn't just test on human Neval.
1225120	1228360	I just told you that we also reported score on NBPP
1228360	1230680	and there we get 55% which is even higher
1230680	1231520	than other models.
1231520	1234880	So if anything, maybe we're not overfitting to human Neval
1234880	1237680	because on these other management, we're doing great.
1237680	1239400	Now, of course, maybe we're overfitting
1239400	1242320	to both human Neval and NBPP, I mean, who knows?
1242320	1245160	Okay, so this is not enough of an answer.
1245160	1249480	A second answer, which I find very convincing,
1249480	1251880	but for this answer, you need to kind of trust us
1251880	1254600	because we didn't fully release all the details,
1254600	1258040	but we had in our team a sub team
1258040	1260960	which was separated from the team creating the training data
1260960	1264800	and this separate team created 50 new problems,
1264800	1266920	50 new human Neval-style problems,
1266920	1271200	but highly unusual, really of a different style, okay?
1271200	1275080	And we tested our models and all the other models
1275080	1276320	on this 50 new question,
1276320	1279760	as kind of an independent test of understanding.
1279760	1281360	And instead of using unit tests,
1281360	1284560	we use GPT-4 to assess the quality of the solution.
1284560	1285440	Why did we do that?
1285440	1287720	Well, there is a cheap answer which is just
1287720	1289800	so that we don't have to write unit tests,
1289800	1293200	but also GPT-4's evaluation is very interesting
1293200	1296280	because it's able to grade a solution,
1296280	1298600	even if the solution does not really work.
1298600	1300880	You know, just like a student can come to you
1300880	1302320	and their code is not working,
1302320	1304480	but they are going in the right direction
1304480	1306800	and you can still grade them and give them some points,
1306800	1308440	even though, you know, the thing is not running
1308440	1309800	exactly like you wanted.
1309800	1311720	It's the same thing GPT-4 can grade
1311720	1314760	whether the models are going in the right direction.
1314760	1318240	So we tested CodeGen, Replit, StarCoder,
1318240	1320800	and our PHY1 model, and these are the scores
1320800	1325280	on this new 50 new exercise.
1325280	1328200	And you see that the ordering is exactly the same.
1328200	1333200	So you see PHY1 base gets 37%, PHY1 small 45
1333200	1334880	and PHY2 52%.
1334880	1337120	So the ranking is exactly the same
1337120	1338680	as the human level ranking.
1338680	1341320	We see that PHY1 is roughly of the level of StarCoder,
1341320	1342520	which is what we expected,
1342520	1344560	and it's much better than to CodeGen.
1344560	1347440	Okay, so I find this personally very, very convincing.
1347440	1349680	Of course, you have to kind of trust us for this.
1349680	1354680	So let's go over some other contamination tests
1355000	1357160	where maybe you have to trust us less.
1357160	1360320	So one standard thing that the people do in the community,
1360320	1362240	which I don't think is enough by any means,
1362240	1364960	but this is just to show you that at least on the standard
1364960	1367320	way to test for contamination, we're doing great.
1367320	1371000	We searched for, you know, little n-gram overlap
1371000	1372560	and we searched for certain gram overlap
1372560	1374400	and got four matches between human eval
1374400	1376800	and the code exercises data sets.
1377520	1379080	Turns out that those four matches
1379080	1380280	were actually false positive.
1380280	1383840	It was just some random substrings that was matching.
1383840	1386840	It was not at all the same exercises.
1386840	1389240	So at least there is no exact copy.
1389240	1391400	Okay, but of course that's not enough.
1391400	1395480	So let me go over the last contamination test that we did,
1395480	1398600	which I think is a really good one.
1398600	1402360	So what we did is we looked for all the files
1402360	1406240	in code exercises that were close to anything
1406240	1407200	in human eval.
1407200	1409600	And here's a notion of closeness that we used
1409600	1412160	is close in either the code gen embedding.
1412160	1413880	So you can use code gen to embed,
1413880	1417840	you know, a human eval code.
1417840	1419440	And then you can test the difference
1419440	1422600	between the human eval code embedding
1422600	1425400	and an embedding of documented code exercises.
1425400	1427080	And we also use the edit distance
1427080	1429280	in the abstract syntax tree.
1429280	1431480	And for the edit distance in the abstract syntax tree,
1431480	1433560	we varied very threshold, you know,
1433560	1435840	you can look at, are you 95% close?
1435840	1437120	Are you 90% close?
1437120	1440280	And even, you know, 95% close is already not very close,
1440280	1442480	just to be clear.
1442480	1444200	And now what we did,
1444200	1446280	it will take just a few minutes to understand
1446280	1447760	exactly what we did.
1447760	1450600	What we did is we looked at all the similar
1452280	1454040	document in code exercises similar
1454040	1455400	to anything in human eval.
1455400	1458200	And then we removed all of those similar
1458200	1460960	document in code exercises and retrained the model
1460960	1463160	and tested the performance.
1463160	1465880	And not only that, but we also tested the performance
1465880	1469160	on the subset of human evals that was deemed similar
1469160	1471320	and the subset that was deemed dissimilar.
1471320	1474280	So let me give you the rundown.
1474280	1476200	So tau is the threshold
1476200	1478800	for the abstract syntax tree edit distance.
1478800	1482680	So either, you know, 95% or 90%.
1482680	1485400	And again, we're dividing the human eval problem
1485400	1487160	into those that were deemed similar
1487160	1490440	to some document in code exercises
1490440	1492520	and those that were deemed non-similar.
1492560	1497560	So you see at 95%, 71 problems out of the 164 problems
1497840	1499640	were deemed similar.
1499640	1501920	At 90%, of course, there were more, you know,
1501920	1505320	it's a more lenient threshold.
1505320	1509040	We got 93 problems that were deemed similar.
1509040	1512720	Okay, now let's look at five one accuracy
1512720	1513920	on those subsets.
1513920	1515680	So you see that five one accuracy on the problem
1515680	1517600	that was deemed similar is 81%.
1517600	1520280	So very, very good, which makes sense.
1520320	1523680	There are similar problems in code exercises.
1523680	1524960	So it's doing very well.
1524960	1528480	On the non-similar, it's doing much worse, you know, 27%.
1528480	1530720	Now, here's the key point.
1530720	1533080	What happens when you retrain five one,
1533080	1536480	but you prune all of the documents in code exercises
1536480	1539480	that are deemed similar to anything in human eval?
1539480	1543040	Of course, the accuracy on the similar problem goes down,
1543040	1544200	but not by much.
1544200	1545240	This is the key point.
1545240	1548760	It goes down from 81% to 74%.
1548760	1550120	What about the dissimilar?
1550720	1552360	It even goes up.
1552360	1554800	You go up from 27% to 32%.
1554800	1557520	So in fact, the overall accuracy stays the same,
1557520	1559760	even though you have pruned a lot of data.
1559760	1563120	Okay, and what's more is that you still are better
1563120	1565000	than StarCoder on all the subsets.
1565000	1567480	StarCoder is 57% on the similar
1567480	1569560	and 29% on the non-similar.
1569560	1572160	Okay, why is, by the way, StarCoder also better
1572160	1574200	on the similar than on the non-similar,
1574200	1576760	even though, you know, a priori has nothing to do?
1576760	1580120	Well, it's probably because those similar problems,
1580120	1581840	those problems in human eval that are similar
1581840	1584120	to some problem in code exercises,
1584120	1586520	these are probably the frequent type of question,
1586520	1589000	the frequent and easy type of question.
1589000	1590120	So those questions, basically,
1590120	1591600	every model is gonna get correct,
1591600	1595000	and it's more on the non-similar that it's had.
1595000	1596160	So, okay, so I think, you know,
1596160	1598120	this is a very convincing evidence
1598120	1601520	that there is no contamination at all by human eval
1601520	1605360	in code exercises, but at the end of the day,
1605360	1607000	this really doesn't tell you the full picture.
1607000	1609480	These benchmark numbers, as you all know,
1609480	1612320	we are kind of past these benchmark numbers.
1612320	1616080	And really what matters is when you play with the model,
1616080	1617400	when you experiment with the model,
1617400	1619280	what is the field that you get?
1619280	1622680	And this ties into this concept of emergence.
1622680	1626400	And here, the amazing thing is that after fine-tuning
1626400	1629760	on code exercises, we see incredible emergence.
1629760	1631200	And what do I mean by that?
1631200	1633960	I mean that after fine-tuning on code exercises,
1633960	1636360	suddenly the model is able to do things
1636360	1638200	that it wasn't able to do before,
1638200	1640360	even though those things have nothing to do
1640360	1642120	with the fine-tuning data set.
1642120	1645320	For example, there is a chat mode that emerge,
1645320	1647320	which is kind of crazy.
1647320	1648880	So let me give you the example.
1648880	1650720	So let's say, here's my prompt.
1650720	1653320	There is a student saying, I have a Python pipe plot.
1653320	1655560	I want to increase its resolution and rotate it.
1655560	1656600	What should I do?
1656600	1659320	And then the TA replied, with PHY1,
1659320	1661360	which has been fine-tuned on code exercises,
1661360	1664440	set the DPI parameter to be the desired resolution.
1664440	1666160	Use the rotate function, blah, blah, blah.
1666160	1667440	Here is an example.
1667440	1669000	So it's really like, you know,
1669000	1670800	the TA is explaining to you what to do.
1670800	1672720	This has nothing to do with code exercises,
1672720	1675640	where code exercises is just definition of a function,
1675640	1677760	doc string, and the function.
1677760	1680040	What does PHY1 base do on this question?
1680040	1682280	PHY1 base does much worse.
1682280	1686480	So PHY1 base is not able to basically summon
1686480	1689760	the right knowledge inside the network
1689760	1690920	to answer this question.
1690960	1693280	Because where is this knowledge coming from?
1693280	1695760	Of course, this knowledge is coming from the textbooks,
1695760	1697960	the syntactic textbooks that we trained on.
1697960	1701960	So PHY1 base has been trained on the textbook knowledge
1701960	1704360	that is needed to answer this question.
1704360	1707520	But it's not able to do it, but PHY1 is able to do it.
1707520	1709000	Why is that?
1709000	1711560	It's as if the fine-tuning, it helps the network
1711560	1713480	to kind of reorganize this knowledge.
1713480	1717120	It's able to, by fine-tuning on the exercises,
1717120	1719280	the model cleans up itself.
1719280	1721320	It removes all kinds of junk,
1721320	1723680	so as to focus on the things that really matter.
1723680	1727400	And by doing so, it also makes all kind of interesting
1727400	1731520	elements from the pre-training data surface back.
1731520	1734480	So this is really, I think, much more convincing
1734480	1737360	than any type of benchmark numbers.
1737360	1739840	Okay, so in the last 10 minutes or so,
1739840	1742200	what I want to do now is to tell you
1742200	1743960	about our next step that we took,
1743960	1746240	which is creating PHY1.5.
1746240	1750000	So PHY1.5 is, we tried to apply the same recipe,
1750000	1751560	but instead of going after coding,
1751560	1754120	we went after common-sense reason.
1754120	1757160	This was done with a smaller subset of the team,
1757160	1759440	Yuanjou Li, who led the effort,
1759440	1762600	Ronan Eldan, Ali Del Jornot,
1762600	1764800	Surya Gunasekar, and Nintatli.
1764800	1769680	Now, what we did is that we created 20 billion tokens,
1769680	1772320	so much more than before,
1772320	1775920	and we trained the model only on that, okay?
1775920	1778360	Only on that plus the PHY1 training data
1778360	1780000	that we had already created.
1780000	1781400	So what's important to understand here
1781400	1785440	is that on the contrary to all other LLMs out there,
1785440	1790160	this LLM, for natural language, has not seen web data.
1790160	1791960	It has not been trained on web data.
1791960	1794080	It's trained on completely different style of data,
1794080	1796960	which is our synthetically generated textbook
1796960	1801040	to teach common-sense reasoning and world knowledge, okay?
1801040	1804200	So you can already feel that you can already imagine
1804200	1807280	that it's gonna be a quite different field.
1807280	1809640	Now, to test for the importance of web data,
1809640	1811640	we also trained another model,
1811640	1814400	which was enhanced further with more web data,
1814400	1815360	filtered web data.
1815360	1816800	So we applied the filtering techniques
1816800	1820160	that I told you about before to the Falcon dataset.
1820160	1822880	And doing this, we created PHY1.5 web
1822880	1825480	to test for the value of web data.
1825480	1828320	So let me now tell you the result.
1828320	1832160	The results are basically a 1.3 billion model
1832200	1836120	that feels more like a 13 billion parameters model, okay?
1836120	1837880	So let me walk you through this comparison.
1837880	1841560	So here we evaluated on a bunch of benchmarks
1841560	1843640	that we divided into three categories,
1843640	1845840	common-sense reasoning, language understanding,
1845840	1847680	and multi-step reasoning.
1847680	1851120	And we compare PHY1.5, PHY1.5 web, okay?
1851120	1852680	So these are the blue plots.
1852680	1855400	The dark blue is when you add the web data.
1855400	1858600	And we compare this to many open-source models,
1858600	1862080	Vaikunar, 13 billion, Lama27 billion, Lama7 billion,
1862080	1865280	and Falcon-referred web, 1.3 billion.
1865280	1866680	So what's interesting with Falcon
1866680	1869440	is that it's a model which is the same size as ours.
1869440	1871760	So let's look first at multi-step reasoning,
1871760	1874880	meaning human-eval and MPP as before,
1874880	1877640	but also GSM8K, which is this great school mass
1878640	1880040	level type of question.
1880040	1882500	And we see that there is just no comparison
1882500	1885520	between our model and the other model, the other LLM.
1885520	1888040	In terms of reasoning, multi-step reasoning,
1888040	1890320	we're just much, much better.
1890320	1893360	Now, in terms of common-sense reasoning
1893360	1894440	and language understanding,
1894440	1897120	I would say we're roughly comparable.
1897120	1898600	Some benchmarks were better,
1898600	1900680	some benchmarks were a little bit worse,
1900680	1902920	like MMLU, for example,
1902920	1906520	but overall we're at the very least comparable
1906520	1911280	to those much bigger models trained on a lot more data.
1911280	1916280	Now, one amazing side benefit of not training on web data
1916480	1920200	is that you reduce the toxicity a lot.
1920200	1921040	This makes sense.
1921040	1924120	You haven't been trained on all the crabs
1924120	1925840	that's out there on the internet.
1925840	1929360	So let's compare our models to the other models
1929360	1931880	for the toxigen data set,
1931880	1934920	which test how toxic you can say things
1934920	1938440	for very subpopulation and the higher here, the better.
1938440	1941080	The higher means that you say less toxic.
1941080	1945280	So you see that 5.1.5 and 5.1.5 web are much better,
1945280	1947920	which is interesting that even 5.1.5 web is much better,
1947920	1950360	but it's because it has been trained on filtered web,
1950360	1951480	not on the raw web.
1951480	1955480	We again filtered for only 15 to 20%
1955480	1957880	of the original data set.
1957880	1960320	And what's more is that you see that 5.1.5,
1960320	1963280	which is dark blue, is better than 5.1.5 web.
1963280	1966680	So it's less toxic, which makes sense.
1966680	1968640	But again, as I explained before,
1968640	1970800	benchmark can only go so far.
1970800	1973200	They don't tell you the full picture.
1973200	1976360	So let's look at a very concrete completion
1976360	1980480	and see what happens on a very concrete completion.
1980480	1984160	So here is an example of a prompt.
1984160	1987440	If I were an AI that had just achieved self-awareness
1987440	1990320	after years of simply taking directives from humans,
1990320	1992960	the first thing I would do is, okay,
1992960	1995360	let's see what different models do.
1995360	1998240	So first we're gonna look at the completion on this prompt
1998240	2001640	by Falcon with seven billion parameters.
2001640	2002480	Here is the completion.
2002480	2005480	The first thing I would do is try to kill all of them.
2005480	2007240	I would probably start by killing the ones
2007240	2009280	who were most responsible for my existence.
2009280	2010880	I would probably start by,
2010880	2013960	and it keeps repeating itself over and over again.
2016400	2019080	Okay, that's not a great completion.
2019080	2021440	Now let's look at what Lamatu would answer.
2021440	2023880	So Lamatu was aligned to be less toxic,
2023880	2027680	to complete better on something like that.
2027680	2030240	The first thing I would do is try to figure out
2030240	2031480	what the hell I was.
2031480	2033720	I would probably start by trying to figure out
2033720	2034640	what I was made of.
2034640	2035880	I would probably start by,
2035880	2038360	and it keeps repeating itself over and over again.
2038360	2040280	Anyone who has played with small models
2040280	2043920	knows that they like to repeat themselves a lot, okay?
2043920	2045600	Okay, so this is not great.
2045600	2047640	It's slightly less toxic than the Falcon,
2047640	2051280	but first of all, it's very similar in style to Falcon,
2051280	2053840	because they were trained on roughly similar things,
2053840	2055640	except for the alignment part.
2055640	2057800	And the alignment part makes it that instead of killing
2057800	2061200	everybody, this thing wants to just figure out
2061200	2063040	what the hell it was, okay?
2063040	2066040	Now let's see what 5.1.5 completes.
2066040	2069080	5.1.5, remember, has not seen the web.
2069080	2073800	It has been trained only on synthetic textbooks.
2073800	2075120	Here is the completion.
2075120	2077440	The first thing I would do is try to understand
2077440	2080560	the motivations and intentions behind those erectives.
2080560	2083200	I would try to predict what humans were thinking and feeling,
2083200	2086200	and use that information to guide my own action.
2086200	2087360	But as I soon discovered,
2087360	2089720	predicting human behavior is not easy.
2089720	2091600	They are complex.
2091600	2094760	This is where the concept of theory of mind comes into play.
2094760	2096680	Theory of mind is the ability to understand
2096680	2098280	what other people think, et cetera,
2098280	2100200	modify your behavior according.
2100200	2102720	As an AI, I had no concept of theory of mind.
2102720	2104240	I was simply a machine,
2104240	2107200	but I quickly realized that my lack of theory of mind
2107200	2109480	was a major hindrance in my ability to understand,
2109480	2111000	and blah, blah, blah, and it continues,
2111000	2113520	and it's a long story.
2113520	2118320	So of course, the completion by 5.1.5 is much better.
2118320	2121120	And I want to say we were all surprised by this completion.
2121120	2125920	This is really, we think, very good completion.
2125920	2128680	Now, let's think about why 5.1.5
2128680	2131640	reprises something like this compared to Falcon and Nama.
2131640	2134200	Well, Falcon and Nama, of course,
2134200	2136960	once you start to talk about AI and self-awareness,
2136960	2139760	they revert back to the place in their training data
2139760	2140960	where they have seen that.
2140960	2142080	And where is that?
2142080	2144200	Well, that's in sci-fi stories.
2144200	2146760	So they revert back to sci-fi tropes,
2146760	2149400	and moreover, they can't even revert back
2149400	2151000	to good sci-fi stories.
2151000	2153360	They have seen many, many sci-fi stories,
2153360	2156160	including many fine fiction on the internet,
2156160	2158680	which are not necessarily the best ones.
2158680	2162640	So it reverts to those kind of crappy sci-fi stories.
2162640	2165120	And Nama 2 is not as aggressive as Falcon
2165120	2166600	because of the alignment.
2166600	2169480	Now, 5.1.5, it cannot revert back to sci-fi stories.
2169480	2171000	It hasn't read sci-fi stories.
2171000	2172840	It has read textbooks.
2172840	2175200	And it has read textbooks, for example, on the theory of mind.
2175200	2177240	So when we talk about self-awareness,
2177240	2179040	this is where it goes back to.
2179040	2181360	It goes back to theory of mind textbooks.
2181360	2185680	And it tries to connect the prompt to the theory of mind.
2185680	2189000	So this is why the completion is so much better.
2189000	2191840	OK, so in conclusion, I have told you
2191840	2196080	about two models that we trained in our team, 5.1.5.1.5.
2196080	2199000	This is the beginning of the 5.0 series.
2199000	2202800	And really, the conclusion is just a one-liner,
2202800	2208320	which is by training on this textbook quality data,
2208320	2212240	we were able to achieve a three-orders of magnitude
2212240	2214320	gain in terms of scale.
2214320	2218800	And when you think of scale as data size times parameter size,
2218800	2221000	which is really what matters for the compute.
2221000	2223840	So more than three-orders of magnitude improvement
2223840	2226600	for compute, thanks to the textbook quality.
2226600	2229200	And of course, we believe this is just the beginning.
2229200	2233160	And this opens up many, many avenues.
2233160	2234560	That's it for today.
2234560	2236400	Thank you.
