 In this discussion, OpenAI's language models—including Falcon, Nama 2, and 5.1.5—were compared based on their responses to a prompt about an AI trying to understand its existence after being created. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Falcon**: When presented with the prompt, it reverted to a sci-fi inspired response, reflecting its training on diverse internet text, which includes science fiction narratives. Its response was less coherent and more focused on destruction, reflecting a common trope in science fiction where newly self-aware AI often consider harming their creators.

2. **Nama 2**: This model, with an alignment towards being less toxic than Falcon, still reverted to a sci-fi inspired response but was less aggressive and more contemplative. This is due to its training data, which also includes diverse internet text, albeit with a slight adjustment for alignment.

3. **5.1.5**: This model has not been trained on the internet but on synthetic textbook data, specifically focusing on cognitive science topics like theory of mind. Its response was coherent and insightful, reflecting an understanding of human psychology and the challenges AI faces in comprehending human behavior without theory of mind. The completion demonstrated a significant improvement in quality compared to Falcon and Nama 2 due to its training data being more focused and academic.

4. **Conclusion**: The discussion highlighted the importance of training data quality for the performance of language models. By using textbook-quality data, OpenAI's 5.1.5 model showed a three-orders of magnitude improvement in scale (data size times parameter size), which significantly reduces compute requirements and sets a new baseline for future models. The team believes that this is just the beginning and that there are many more advancements to come in AI language modeling.
