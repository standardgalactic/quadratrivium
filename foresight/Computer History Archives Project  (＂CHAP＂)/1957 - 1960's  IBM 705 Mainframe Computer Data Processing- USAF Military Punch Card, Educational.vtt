00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
Towers of strength, strategic ballistic missiles, armed and ready,

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
stand guard over our lives and liberties in a threatening world.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
Survival may depend upon the ability of a single warhead to reach and destroy its predetermined target.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
To deliver that warhead requires a vast complex called a weapon system.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Part of that weapon system is the air vehicle itself, the missile with its nose cone,

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
the air frame that contains the tons of fuel required for flight,

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
the precise flight control and guidance packages,

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
and the mighty rocket engines that boost this missile into the sky,

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
sustain it in flight and keep it on its course.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Ground support equipment is part of the weapon system too.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
There is the launch pad with all its service facilities for fueling, firing, maintenance.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
The complex and far-flung ground guidance and tracking installations.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
There must be facilities for missile receipt, storage, checkout and issue,

01:43.000 --> 01:49.000
and special purpose missile transport and handling equipment to move them to the launch pad.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
These are just a few of the ground support elements that have to be designed, built,

01:54.000 --> 02:02.000
provisioned, installed, maintained and manned if the warhead of this missile is to reach its target.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
These are direct support items. Without them, no missile can be launched.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
The specially trained officers and airmen who man these direct mission facilities

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
are also a part, a most important part of the total weapon system.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
They have only one goal, operational readiness.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
In the launch control room when the red light flashes and the countdown stops,

02:30.000 --> 02:38.000
a missile must stand waiting for the right part in the right place at the right time.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
A radically new logistic system can get it there fast.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.000
A hotline from launch control room to missile squadron supply triggers the emergency action.

02:49.000 --> 02:56.000
A specially designated expediter officer takes over. He passes the word to the stock group.

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
Here only minutes away from the waiting missile on the launch pad are the end products of logistic support management.

03:03.000 --> 03:11.000
Spares, provisioned and kept up to a predetermined stock level are the key to operational readiness.

03:11.000 --> 03:18.000
Only by maintaining a predetermined stock level can each missile squadron be self-sufficient.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
Standard procedures speed up the supply routine at the squadron.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
The part so urgently needed is located by bin or shelf number.

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
Already packaged for shipment, it can be quickly selected, checked out and delivered to the waiting expedite vehicle

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
kept always standing by for the short run to the launch pad.

03:40.000 --> 03:50.000
Average time from malfunction to delivery of a new part, 30 minutes, and maximum allowable time, 60 minutes,

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
from squadron supply to any launch pad in the strategic missile squadron.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
More often than not, the defective component is quickly removable because of modular design.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
In this case, it can be immediately returned to squadron maintenance shops for inspection.

04:09.000 --> 04:18.000
An important function of squadron maintenance is to determine by inspection and bench check whether it has the capability to repair the assembly.

04:18.000 --> 04:29.000
If it is judged not squadron repairable, it is shipped immediately and directly from the squadron to a contractor or Air Force depot repair facility.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
A simple series of supply transactions.

04:32.000 --> 04:41.000
But without data processing, it could have taken hours or days to record and transmit weeks or months for resupply action.

04:41.000 --> 04:51.000
Now it can be recorded in minutes, transmitted in seconds, and resupply action will be initiated immediately and automatically.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
Essential facts of the transactions have been penciled in on pre-printed worksheets called variable data forms.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
Now they have reached the skilled key punch operator.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
He goes first to the squadron master card file.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
In this deck is a card for every direct mission item which supports the weapon system.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
These master cards have been code punched before issue with all the fixed data available.

05:19.000 --> 05:27.000
In the key punch machine, all this fixed data is reproduced automatically on the various transaction cards.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
Next, the operator punches in the variable data required for each transaction card.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
They report on parts issued to the launch site.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
The resultant drop in squadron supply stock balances.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
Inspection report on the failed part and the repair which is generated.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.000
And the fact, time, and method of its shipment from squadron direct to repair depot.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
These carefully registered holes represent reality.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
The interaction of human beings and hardware that is called logistics.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
To be sure that the story these punched holes will tell is accurate,

06:05.000 --> 06:12.000
they are independently verified in another machine that will reject any discrepancy.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
Only now can this basic input that may influence expenditure of millions of dollars

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
or the effectiveness of our advanced weapon systems go forward from the squadron

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
to the electronic data processing center.

06:26.000 --> 06:33.000
This input provides the basic information which is refined into logistics support management.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
It flows in from many sources.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Missile squadrons, contractors, Air Force depots.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
It reports in code each detail of hundreds of different types of transactions.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
The key punched cards are fed into a card to tape converter.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
Each tape reel stores the information contained on 2,500 cards,

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
saving space, time, and money.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
The tape reels are read by the central processing unit,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
the nerve center of this electronic data complex.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
Actions taken by the computer depend upon previously prepared programmed instructions

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
monitored by the computer operator.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
To select the proper tape run, the operator need only press a button.

07:19.000 --> 07:26.000
For example, one run can sequentially check stock levels, update the master file,

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
prepare requisitions for automatic resupply to the squadrons,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
schedule damaged assemblies for depot repair,

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
and set up a suspense file for their return.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
All this in a matter of minutes.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
To do these things, the computer must have accurate data, carefully prepared.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
If the facts are wrong, the machine will give wrong answers.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Take wrong action.

07:51.000 --> 07:59.000
Cards must be correctly punched at the squadron level if logistics support is to work at the management level.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
To feed information to this electronic data processing center

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
requires fast, reliable, versatile communications to each of the squadrons,

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
so that field transactions can be immediately and fully reported.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
Communications run to the weapon system storage site,

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
so that the Air Force stock from many commodity class depots is available at a single point.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
They also run to the contractor storage site at the factory,

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
so that contractor peculiar items can be resupplied to the squadrons on a source-to-user basis.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Finally, they are installed at maintenance and overhaul facilities,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
contractor and Air Force,

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
so that items to be repaired or modified can be quickly returned to the stockpiles.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Fast, reliable, versatile communications,

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
transceiver to transmit the punch cards upon which all data is coded,

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
teletype to send supplemental verbal instructions,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
or to clear transceiver circuits for transmission,

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
telephones for exceptional situations, or standby emergency use.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Together, these form the ComlogNet,

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
linking the electronic data processing center with every element of the resupply and maintenance cycle.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
All this results in greater operational readiness at the launch pad,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
smaller stockpiles at the storage site,

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
faster maintenance, modification and overhaul.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
This applies equally to contractor or Air Force storage and maintenance sites,

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
reduces procurement and inventory, saves money and time.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Speed and accuracy in getting all the facts to the electronic data processing center,

09:46.000 --> 09:51.000
taking action, communicating that action to the right place.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
This is the first step in logistic support management.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
But now this action must be converted into hardware,

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
and a hardware must get to where it is needed.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
It moves through what logisticians call pipelines.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Several factors influence pipeline time.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
It is lengthened when transportation is slow,

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
shortened if transportation is fast.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
When the pipeline is shortened, for example, by fast air transportation,

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
smaller stockpiles are needed at the storage site.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
This cuts down on procurement, inventory and obsolescence.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
A shorter pipeline will provide a more effective weapon system,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
as well as dollar savings.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Keeping missiles from going out of commission for parts

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
means greater overall operational readiness at the launch pad.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
Electronic data processing keeps pipelines short

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
by automatically setting up the best routing and packaging,

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
automatically monitoring and expediting intransit items.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
Transportation scheduling is only one of the major processing runs.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
These runs provide constant, updated, correlated data on inventory control,

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
all shipments and receipts, adjusted stock levels, items due in, on order,

11:14.000 --> 11:20.000
in repair or in transit, technical data, current and precise item descriptions,

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
configuration, the exact items which make up each individual weapon system,

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
failure analysis, frequency and causes of failures by item,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
usage and attrition rates by item,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
cataloging the weapon system stock list,

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
dollar reporting, the current financial status,

11:41.000 --> 11:47.000
and requirements computations, including procurement and provisioning status.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
A single complete set of logistic books, using a common coded language,

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
correlates every logistic support function through electronic data processing.

11:57.000 --> 12:06.000
But it does not eliminate the need for human judgment, human decision, human responsibility.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
This is the job of the logistic support manager.

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
To carry out his mission of timely support and effective management of an advanced weapon system,

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
he integrates on his staff each of the key logistic functions previously under separate organizations.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
Documentation of logistic support management is also integrated.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
Weapon managers, contractors and squadrons, separate responsibilities and procedures

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
are set forth in individual manuals.

12:35.000 --> 12:44.000
Staff officers provide policy input on budget, procurement, transportation, maintenance,

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
supply and liaison with using commands.

12:49.000 --> 12:55.000
These are combined under one logistic support manager to provide the fully integrated logistic program

12:55.000 --> 13:05.000
that today's and tomorrow's advanced weapon systems must have if they are to get and stay operationally ready.

13:05.000 --> 13:12.000
Electronic data processing takes care of all routine transactions in each of these functional areas.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
But the machine also recognizes problems it cannot solve, the exceptional situations.

13:19.000 --> 13:27.000
It calls attention to these problems by making a printout on the high speed printer that is part of the data processing system.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.000
Printouts like these go directly to the manager who can make the decision, take the action needed.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
This is a printout on a supply problem.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
It goes at once to the item manager, a member of the supply staff.

13:41.000 --> 13:49.000
Decoded, it tells him of the slower consumption rate of an item that had been planned for in initial provisioning.

13:49.000 --> 13:57.000
Other information to aid him in making his decision is also printed out as needed by the electronic data processing center.

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
Quantities on order, in transit or being repaired.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
This is management by exception.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
Making decisions based upon electronically processed data but requiring managerial judgment.

14:12.000 --> 14:21.000
These decisions save money by preventing overstocks or ensure operational readiness by maintaining an adequate supply of spares.

14:21.000 --> 14:32.000
Management by exception conserves executive talent by bringing to the manager only those problems the machine has not been programmed to solve automatically.

14:32.000 --> 14:40.000
A different example of management by exception also begins at the electronic data processing center.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
This time, a run reveals a failure rate for a given part much higher than the programmed tolerance.

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
This is printed out by the machine together with a tabulation of the causes of the failure.

14:53.000 --> 15:00.000
The data sheet is delivered to the maintenance manager, another member of the Logistics Support Manager staff.

15:00.000 --> 15:06.000
Starting with this information, he moves to confirm and amplify it by test and analysis.

15:06.000 --> 15:13.000
The kind of expert and specialized knowledge that must come from men, not machines.

15:13.000 --> 15:23.000
To the missile assembly site come the maintenance people from the missile squadron, the contractor's technical representative, the AMC maintenance specialists.

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
They analyze the fault that is causing failure and determine it to be a design deficiency.

15:30.000 --> 15:39.000
Findings result in further studies by research and development people and by the engineering group on the staff of the Logistics Support Manager.

15:39.000 --> 15:46.000
Their joint recommendation results in an engineering change proposal to correct the design deficiency.

15:47.000 --> 15:54.000
This is monitored by the Chief of Weapons Engineering, another staff officer of the Logistics Support Manager.

15:54.000 --> 16:03.000
This modification, resulting from early computer detection, will reduce the chance of missiles out of commission for parts.

16:03.000 --> 16:14.000
Remedial action began at the electronic data processing center with a printout, but it required human technical skills, human judgments,

16:15.000 --> 16:23.000
to solve this special and complex problem. This is management by exception.

16:23.000 --> 16:35.000
The electronic data processing center has stored on its reels millions of facts constantly updated, about thousands of direct mission items in an advanced weapon system.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
How these items got there is a story in itself.

16:39.000 --> 16:48.000
The story of provisioning, the determination of required spare parts and ground support equipment to make a weapon system operational.

16:48.000 --> 17:00.000
Logistics Support Management of advanced weapon systems incorporates new techniques made possible by centralized management control and electronic data processing.

17:00.000 --> 17:08.000
These are designed to obtain the greatest dollar mileage for the taxpayer and the most effective support for operational units.

17:08.000 --> 17:16.000
To explain them to the contractor, the Logistics Support Manager schedules a provisioning guidance conference.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
His staff covers such specialized concepts as periodic ordering.

17:21.000 --> 17:32.000
This breaks down estimated yearly requirements into quarters or even months, permitting constant re-evaluations on the basis of actual consumption.

17:32.000 --> 17:41.000
Production Responsiveness. This calls for the contractor to maintain many items as unassembled parts.

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
These can be rapidly assembled for replacements or used in production if no replacement requirement develops.

17:49.000 --> 17:55.000
This is only the beginning of the long, complex and continuing provisioning process.

17:55.000 --> 18:07.000
Through provisioning action, the Logistics Support Manager of an advanced weapon system is given a timely, well-documented, flexible stock of direct mission items and spare parts.

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
He manages these through an integrated staff representing each of the logistic functions.

18:13.000 --> 18:20.000
Supply in weapon system storage sites, contractor storage sites and squadron supply areas.

18:20.000 --> 18:31.000
Maintenance and tech order modifications performed at contractor or Air Force maintenance sites or in the field by squadron maintenance or mobile maintenance teams.

18:31.000 --> 18:40.000
Funding and accounting operations, specially geared to the needs of a single Logistics Support Manager and the contractors.

18:40.000 --> 18:50.000
Procurement, whether for end items, ground support equipment or spare parts, is also responsive to the Logistics Support Manager's deadlines.

18:50.000 --> 19:01.000
Transportation, including specialized packaging and record keeping, will ensure safe arrival within the fixed time set by the Logistics Support Manager.

19:01.000 --> 19:13.000
All of these logistic functions are tied together by shorter pipelines. This means smaller inventories, less dollars tied up in spares.

19:13.000 --> 19:20.000
Electronic data processing. This means assured and timely support for the missile site.

19:20.000 --> 19:30.000
Comlognet communications. This means rapid and versatile data flow from squadrons and storage sites to the electronic data processing center.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
Here the actions are taken that support the missile on the launch pad.

19:37.000 --> 19:51.000
A tower of strength, an advanced weapon system in all its complexity. The ballistic missile, the ground support, the spare parts, the trained men.

19:51.000 --> 19:58.000
It must be ready. Logistics Support Management makes and keeps it that way.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
Logistics Support Management
