00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,200
Memorex. It's the most recognizable name in computer supplies and accessories. For over

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,200
30 years, Memorex has built their reputation on their unique understanding of the needs

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,200
of the PC user, and has been on the forefront in creating products to meet those needs.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,640
Memorex is proud to bring you this instructional video tape, and to play a part in helping

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:46,840
you master all aspects of the personal computer.

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,280
Something has driven you to learn to use a PC, a personal computer. Either your friends,

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,440
your kids, your job, or maybe just a desire to join the computer age.

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,040
Or maybe even all of the above.

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,840
Memorex has created this tape to make the basic technology, functions, and terminology

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
of PCs understandable to you.

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,840
And finally, you'll understand that techno-nerd babble computer ease that you hear all the

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,340
time.

13
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,600
You can view this tape in its entirety, or you can set your counter on your VCR at 00 now,

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,160
and check out this video's table of contents, and proceed to just the subjects in which

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,400
you're interested. Or go back and review something you've missed.

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,600
Personal computers are everywhere nowadays. They're a part of so many people's lives.

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,560
You'll find them in schools, businesses, even at home. What computers can help you do really

18
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,400
defines just how powerful they can really be.

19
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,640
And to start putting some of that power to work for you, I suggest we begin at the very

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,120
beginning.

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,200
There are two basic types. The IBM PC and Compatibles are made by many different manufacturers

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,280
like Dell, Compac, Packard-Bell, among others.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
There's also the Macintosh family from Apple Computer.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,280
Now it used to be that IBM and Apple were like the Klingons and the Romulons of the

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,600
computer world.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,840
But those worlds are merging. The needs of most users now can be met by both systems.

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,040
And if you haven't yet purchased your PC, explore carefully both of these options.

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,120
And remember, the most important feature of a PC is its functionality.

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
No matter which technology you select, this tape should be a helpful introduction. Now,

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
let's get to work.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,280
Okay, well I think you'll find it's much easier than it may have sounded before.

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,480
So let's discuss the components of a PC.

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,400
Now the real brains of a computer are located in the Central Processing Unit, or CPU.

34
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,240
The CPU is the chip that does the actual processing and calculations.

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,600
One of the most commonly discussed are the 286, 386, and 486.

36
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,320
The numbers simply refer to the type and speed of the processing chip in the unit.

37
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,480
And no doubt in the future there's going to be even faster, more powerful machines like

38
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,000
586 TurboPower and SuperCharge.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh, don't get carried away.

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,520
Let's move on to the monitor.

41
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,800
The monitor is the computer's display screen and the primary output device.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,720
Now the techno-cool name is CRT, which stands for cathode ray 2.

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,560
You can get monitors which display just one color called monochrome, or you can get color.

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:31,760
The resolution of color monitors vary and are referred to as CGA, EGA, VGA, or super VGA.

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,320
The second most common output device is a printer.

46
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,600
There are different types of printers, daisy wheel, dot matrix, and laser jets.

47
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,480
Not a very in price and capabilities.

48
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,280
A good dot matrix printer is quite adequate for a lot of people, although it can be noisy.

49
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,000
Laser jet printers produce excellent quality type and graphics and are very quiet, but

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,480
can be quite expensive.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,600
The keyboard is the most common input device to enter instructions and information into

52
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
the computer.

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,040
Now there are some special keys that you won't find on a typewriter, like Enter, which tells

54
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,760
a computer to accept your instructions.

55
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,480
Escape, which is usually found in the upper left, lets you exit the program or function

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,480
you're working in and back up to the previous step.

57
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,500
These are the function keys, labeled F1, F2, and so on.

58
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,680
These keys can have distinct actions attributed to them, depending on the program.

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:46,720
Computer input devices like a mouse, trackball, or joystick allow the PC user to move the

60
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,120
cursor around to specify an exact location on the screen.

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
The mouse is the most popular.

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,400
The buttons on it allow you to send commands to your computer by pointing and clicking.

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,920
A trackball is basically a stationary mouse.

64
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,200
It looks like a cue ball set into a pedestal, which you roll to move the cursor.

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,120
Mary, did you know that computers can communicate over phone lines?

66
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,560
Yes, I did, via a modem.

67
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,080
See your computer can have conversations with other computers, transmitting and receiving

68
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,080
data over a phone line.

69
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,000
There are even fax modems that allow users to send and receive fax documents from or

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
to other computers.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,880
Sounds pretty nifty.

72
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,280
Now using a PC is not as complicated as I thought it might have been, but Mary, how

73
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,120
does it all link together?

74
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,920
Well everything plugs into the back.

75
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,520
There's a whole assortment of plugs back there to connect cables to that are called ports.

76
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,000
Serial ports transmit or process data one bit or character at a time, and parallel ports

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
transmit many bits concurrently.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,400
Serial ports are usually used for a mouse or an external modem, and a parallel port

79
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,480
is used to connect a printer.

80
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,960
Now what we've been talking about is hardware, but Mary, what's software?

81
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,920
Software is the real reason you use a computer.

82
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,280
It's computer code, the stuff on disks, programs.

83
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,240
Software, or sometimes called application software, tells the hardware what to do.

84
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,520
Well, it looks like I'm ready to sit down on that comfortable, genuine, Hercules software

85
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,000
and start using the old PC.

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,920
What do I do first?

87
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Well, first let's talk about floppy disks.

88
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,320
A floppy disk is a plate of magnetic material that stores data in digital form.

89
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,360
It goes into the floppy disk drive.

90
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,160
Now it's used to transfer data from one PC to another, or it can be used to backup data

91
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,360
from the hard drive.

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,200
This doesn't feel floppy at all.

93
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,760
In fact, it actually looks like a coaster.

94
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,200
Well that's a three and a half inch disk that's been encased in plastic.

95
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Now the other common type is the five and a quarter inch.

96
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,680
They both use the same technology, and can both be written on or read from.

97
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,480
These are double density disks.

98
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,280
These can store about 700,000 characters of information.

99
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,880
There are also high density disks, which can store around 1.4 million, or almost twice

100
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,200
the information as a double density disk.

101
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,720
But which one do I use?

102
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,200
Well, it all depends on your disk drive.

103
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:34,400
Newer PCs usually have high density drives, which can read all kinds of disks.

104
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
Now Paul, there are a few other inexpensive items that you're going to have to add to

105
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,680
your shopping list, like storage boxes to store and organize your disks, and to keep

106
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:50,080
them safe from dust and damage, paper for your printer, and a mouse pad, which gives

107
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,480
you good traction and protects the mouse and your desk from each other, as well as

108
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,440
keeping Oreo cookie crumbs out of the mouse mechanism.

109
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,240
Well, Mary, where is the best place to put it then?

110
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,240
Well, your computer should be placed in a spot that is convenient, clean, cool, and

111
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
dry.

112
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,440
Dirt, heat, and moisture can damage your PC's electrical components.

113
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,600
I guess that kind of rules out the spot next to the heater.

114
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Well, yeah.

115
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Now you also want to make sure you get a surge protector.

116
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,520
It prevents power fluctuations from damaging circuitry, and you can also use it to protect

117
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,720
your power switches from excess wear and tear.

118
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,880
Just turn everything on by using the switch on the surge protector.

119
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,280
Mary, do I need an anti-glare screen?

120
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,400
It's a good idea.

121
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,000
It prevents eye strain and just fits over your monitor and prevents light from bouncing

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,600
off the screen into your eyes.

123
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,160
Now, always place your screen so that you're looking down slightly at it.

124
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,120
Place the monitor at a 90-degree angle to any window.

125
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,840
Well, now that we're at the desk, show me the proper way to sit.

126
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
Okay.

127
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,360
Feet nice and flat on the floor, back straight, forearms level with the keyboard, and my wrists

128
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,240
are even supported by this nice little wrist pad here.

129
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Looks good.

130
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,520
You must have done most of your homework, the soda.

131
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,320
You want to keep liquids away from the unit.

132
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,280
And also, be sure to cover the unit when it's not in use.

133
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,360
You can buy a cleaning kit to keep your PC and drive clean and desk-free.

134
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,160
So my hardware can actually last longer than the technology.

135
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,960
Well, it is constantly changing, but the basics don't.

136
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Let's review.

137
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,120
Computers process data by converting it into electrical impulses that are either on or

138
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
off.

139
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
This is a binary code.

140
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,680
Just as Morse code used only dots or dashes, binary code uses zero or one to represent

141
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,160
off or on.

142
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,360
Each of these pulses is called a bit.

143
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,200
Bits grouped into a pattern of eight are called a byte.

144
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,440
These bits and bytes make up all the numerical information used by a PC.

145
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,880
The computer's memory, just like ours, is kept alive by electrical impulses.

146
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,120
When you turn it off, it loses everything, unless it's stored on a form of magnetic media

147
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,560
like a floppy or hard drive.

148
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,480
There are two types of memory.

149
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,840
RAM, random access memory, is the computer's thinking power.

150
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,720
It's the memory that stores data and instructions the PC is currently using.

151
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,800
The more RAM a PC has, the more it can juggle at one time, and the faster it can handle

152
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
it.

153
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,040
Now, ROM, read-only memory, is the memory that is permanently encoded.

154
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,600
These are usually the instructions to turn on, set up, and load the rest of the instructions

155
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,280
from the disk.

156
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,640
ROM cannot be changed and won't be erased when the power is turned off.

157
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,640
Now if you have heard computer jocks talking about megs, they're not talking about girls,

158
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
they know.

159
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,120
It's short for megabyte or MB.

160
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,240
RAM is measured in megabytes.

161
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Another thing that is measured in megs is the capacity of the hard drive.

162
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,040
Some hard drives have 40, 80, or even more megabytes.

163
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,120
A hard drive is the device that stores and reads data on a magnetic disk.

164
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,040
It's a large capacity storage device used for long-term permanent storage.

165
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,760
The hard drive is where you store the programs and data that you will be using.

166
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,200
Let's take a quick tour inside the PC to see where some of the things we've been talking

167
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,620
about are located.

168
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,680
This is the microprocessor chip, which is the brain of the computer.

169
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,360
It's also called the CPU or central processing unit.

170
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,640
Now over here is the floppy disk drive.

171
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,080
If there are two drives, they're stacked on top of each other, or side by side.

172
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,560
To the left of, or underneath the disk drive, is the computer's hard drive, if you have

173
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,400
one.

174
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,680
These are the drive's controller cables, which connect to the controller card, which

175
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,920
is plugged into the motherboard.

176
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,600
The controller card manages the transfer of data to and from the drives.

177
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,680
This is the computer's power supply, and here are the cables that power the drive.

178
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,720
This is the motherboard.

179
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:11,560
Here are the ROM or read-only memory chips, and these are the RAM or random access memory.

180
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,680
RAM comes in the form of SIMS, or single inline memory modules.

181
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,800
Man, that's a lot of powerful stuff in there.

182
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
It is.

183
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,840
And now that you know what it all is, it's time to boot up the computer.

184
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,400
By the way, if you have the feeling she's not talking Westernware, you're right.

185
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,480
You see, booting up is computer ease for turning the computer on and getting it up and running

186
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
by loading the operating system.

187
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,860
The operating system tells the PC how to think and communicate.

188
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,400
Some operating systems you may have heard of are OS2 or UNIX, but the most prevalent

189
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,560
is DOS, which stands for Disk Operating System.

190
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:54,520
Built in 1981 by Microsoft Corporation, DOS has been made more user-friendly with Windows.

191
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,960
The Windows is a graphic user interface similar in concept to the Macintosh system and can

192
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:06,040
be used with most IBM PCs or compatibles, depending on the computer's memory.

193
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,120
Formatting in DOS is what you must do before you can store files on a floppy disk.

194
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,200
Formatting, sometimes referred to as initializing, prepares a floppy or hard drive to accept

195
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
data.

196
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,480
DOS tells DOS how to find the information you stored on it.

197
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,760
In DOS, directories manage information on a hard disk or floppy.

198
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Now each directory acts as a drawer in a filing cabinet and can contain subdirectories or files.

199
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,760
To learn more fully how to use DOS, be sure to reference your manual.

200
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
The manual?

201
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,880
I mean, that's usually the last place I'd check.

202
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,320
Well, maybe that's why you still can't program your VCR either.

203
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,880
But really, it can be very helpful.

204
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,880
And keep it in a place where you can readily get at it to answer any questions.

205
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,840
You know, Paul, there's the same.

206
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,280
There are two kinds of computer users.

207
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,720
Those who have lost their data and those who will.

208
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,640
One of the best habits you can have is backing up.

209
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,120
That is, making a copy of your data onto a floppy.

210
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,800
It can also be done onto a data cartridge if you have a tape drive.

211
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,280
If your hard drive crashes or seriously malfunctions, you have lost everything.

212
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,880
Disasters like this can be minimized by copying the contents of the hard drive onto floppies.

213
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,200
And crashes aren't common, but it only takes once to make you a firm believer in backing

214
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
up.

215
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,280
You know, backing up is a lot like flossing.

216
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,560
Come on, nobody likes to do it.

217
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,400
But you sure want to hold onto your teeth or your data in this case.

218
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
First long as you need it.

219
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,040
But the use and enjoyment you'll get from your PC far outweighs the little dredgeries.

220
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Paul, have you thought about the software you're going to need?

221
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,640
Well, I know that I want to do word processing.

222
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Okay.

223
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:58,960
Then you'll want to consider programs like Word Perfect and Microsoft Word.

224
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,680
I also have lots of addresses and phone numbers, you know, friends and clients that I want

225
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
to keep track of.

226
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:11,680
Well, there are several databases that are popular, such as D-Base, FoxPro, and Paradox.

227
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,080
What about doing budgets?

228
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Can anything help?

229
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,880
A spreadsheet program like Lotus or XL can come in very handy.

230
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,600
Or you might benefit from financial packages like Quicken.

231
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,640
You know, desktop publishing is something that you always hear about.

232
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,640
That's right.

233
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,800
You need to do beautiful graphics and layouts with software programs like PageMaker and

234
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,760
Ventura Publisher.

235
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,040
You can also use your PC to learn an entirely new skill, even a language, through the vast

236
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,200
number of educational programs that are available.

237
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,400
And after I've settled my current budget crisis, I can kick back and play a few games.

238
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,760
Oh, darn it, the computer won again.

239
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,480
You know, it's good you remember to mention that PCs are really fun, too.

240
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
But you've got to put that there.

241
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:10,520
We've talked about a lot of things in this videotape to provide you with a good overview

242
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,000
to get started in personal computing.

243
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:27,160
We've got over the components of a PC, the CPU, the keyboard, the monitor, the printer.

244
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,960
And we've talked about how it connects and what you'll need to get started.

245
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:40,480
We've also taken a closer look at the technology, what memory, RAM, and ROM are, what a hard

246
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,560
drive is, and how to get started on the DOS operating system.

247
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,080
We've also reviewed some safety measures for you, your computer, and your data.

248
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
And you know what?

249
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,680
None of it as hard as they make it sound.

250
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,080
All that tech talk, it's no big deal.

251
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,480
And if you need further review, check back to the table of contents and then fast forward

252
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,040
to the section you need.

253
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,520
And you know, this tape is just the beginning of a wonderful new world of personal computing.

254
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,040
