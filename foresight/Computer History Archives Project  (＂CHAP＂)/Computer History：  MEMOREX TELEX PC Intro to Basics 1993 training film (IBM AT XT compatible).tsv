0	13200	Memorex. It's the most recognizable name in computer supplies and accessories. For over
13200	18200	30 years, Memorex has built their reputation on their unique understanding of the needs
18200	24200	of the PC user, and has been on the forefront in creating products to meet those needs.
24200	28640	Memorex is proud to bring you this instructional video tape, and to play a part in helping
28640	46840	you master all aspects of the personal computer.
46840	52280	Something has driven you to learn to use a PC, a personal computer. Either your friends,
52280	57440	your kids, your job, or maybe just a desire to join the computer age.
57440	60040	Or maybe even all of the above.
60040	65840	Memorex has created this tape to make the basic technology, functions, and terminology
65840	68640	of PCs understandable to you.
68640	73840	And finally, you'll understand that techno-nerd babble computer ease that you hear all the
73840	75340	time.
75340	81600	You can view this tape in its entirety, or you can set your counter on your VCR at 00 now,
81600	86160	and check out this video's table of contents, and proceed to just the subjects in which
86160	91400	you're interested. Or go back and review something you've missed.
91400	95600	Personal computers are everywhere nowadays. They're a part of so many people's lives.
95600	100560	You'll find them in schools, businesses, even at home. What computers can help you do really
100560	103400	defines just how powerful they can really be.
103400	108640	And to start putting some of that power to work for you, I suggest we begin at the very
108640	110120	beginning.
110120	115200	There are two basic types. The IBM PC and Compatibles are made by many different manufacturers
115200	119280	like Dell, Compac, Packard-Bell, among others.
119280	123200	There's also the Macintosh family from Apple Computer.
123200	127280	Now it used to be that IBM and Apple were like the Klingons and the Romulons of the
127280	128600	computer world.
128600	132840	But those worlds are merging. The needs of most users now can be met by both systems.
132840	137040	And if you haven't yet purchased your PC, explore carefully both of these options.
137040	141120	And remember, the most important feature of a PC is its functionality.
141120	146400	No matter which technology you select, this tape should be a helpful introduction. Now,
146400	147400	let's get to work.
147400	151280	Okay, well I think you'll find it's much easier than it may have sounded before.
151280	155480	So let's discuss the components of a PC.
155480	161400	Now the real brains of a computer are located in the Central Processing Unit, or CPU.
161400	166240	The CPU is the chip that does the actual processing and calculations.
166240	173600	One of the most commonly discussed are the 286, 386, and 486.
173600	178320	The numbers simply refer to the type and speed of the processing chip in the unit.
178320	182480	And no doubt in the future there's going to be even faster, more powerful machines like
182480	184000	586 TurboPower and SuperCharge.
184000	186600	Oh, don't get carried away.
186600	188520	Let's move on to the monitor.
188520	192800	The monitor is the computer's display screen and the primary output device.
192800	197720	Now the techno-cool name is CRT, which stands for cathode ray 2.
197720	202560	You can get monitors which display just one color called monochrome, or you can get color.
202560	211760	The resolution of color monitors vary and are referred to as CGA, EGA, VGA, or super VGA.
211760	215320	The second most common output device is a printer.
215320	220600	There are different types of printers, daisy wheel, dot matrix, and laser jets.
220600	223480	Not a very in price and capabilities.
223480	230280	A good dot matrix printer is quite adequate for a lot of people, although it can be noisy.
230280	236000	Laser jet printers produce excellent quality type and graphics and are very quiet, but
236000	238480	can be quite expensive.
238480	243600	The keyboard is the most common input device to enter instructions and information into
243600	244600	the computer.
244600	250040	Now there are some special keys that you won't find on a typewriter, like Enter, which tells
250040	253760	a computer to accept your instructions.
253760	258480	Escape, which is usually found in the upper left, lets you exit the program or function
258480	263480	you're working in and back up to the previous step.
263480	269500	These are the function keys, labeled F1, F2, and so on.
269500	274680	These keys can have distinct actions attributed to them, depending on the program.
274680	286720	Computer input devices like a mouse, trackball, or joystick allow the PC user to move the
286720	291120	cursor around to specify an exact location on the screen.
291120	293120	The mouse is the most popular.
293120	298400	The buttons on it allow you to send commands to your computer by pointing and clicking.
298400	301920	A trackball is basically a stationary mouse.
301920	307200	It looks like a cue ball set into a pedestal, which you roll to move the cursor.
307200	310120	Mary, did you know that computers can communicate over phone lines?
310120	312560	Yes, I did, via a modem.
312560	317080	See your computer can have conversations with other computers, transmitting and receiving
317080	319080	data over a phone line.
319080	324000	There are even fax modems that allow users to send and receive fax documents from or
324000	325000	to other computers.
325000	326880	Sounds pretty nifty.
326880	330280	Now using a PC is not as complicated as I thought it might have been, but Mary, how
330280	333120	does it all link together?
333120	335920	Well everything plugs into the back.
335920	341520	There's a whole assortment of plugs back there to connect cables to that are called ports.
341520	348000	Serial ports transmit or process data one bit or character at a time, and parallel ports
348000	351000	transmit many bits concurrently.
351000	356400	Serial ports are usually used for a mouse or an external modem, and a parallel port
356400	359480	is used to connect a printer.
359480	363960	Now what we've been talking about is hardware, but Mary, what's software?
363960	366920	Software is the real reason you use a computer.
366920	371280	It's computer code, the stuff on disks, programs.
371280	376240	Software, or sometimes called application software, tells the hardware what to do.
376240	381520	Well, it looks like I'm ready to sit down on that comfortable, genuine, Hercules software
381520	383000	and start using the old PC.
383000	384920	What do I do first?
384920	394920	Well, first let's talk about floppy disks.
394920	400320	A floppy disk is a plate of magnetic material that stores data in digital form.
400320	402360	It goes into the floppy disk drive.
402360	407160	Now it's used to transfer data from one PC to another, or it can be used to backup data
407160	408360	from the hard drive.
408360	410200	This doesn't feel floppy at all.
410200	412760	In fact, it actually looks like a coaster.
412760	416200	Well that's a three and a half inch disk that's been encased in plastic.
416200	419200	Now the other common type is the five and a quarter inch.
419200	424680	They both use the same technology, and can both be written on or read from.
424680	426480	These are double density disks.
426480	430280	These can store about 700,000 characters of information.
430280	435880	There are also high density disks, which can store around 1.4 million, or almost twice
435880	438200	the information as a double density disk.
438200	439720	But which one do I use?
439720	442200	Well, it all depends on your disk drive.
442200	454400	Newer PCs usually have high density drives, which can read all kinds of disks.
454400	457680	Now Paul, there are a few other inexpensive items that you're going to have to add to
457680	462680	your shopping list, like storage boxes to store and organize your disks, and to keep
462680	470080	them safe from dust and damage, paper for your printer, and a mouse pad, which gives
470080	474480	you good traction and protects the mouse and your desk from each other, as well as
474480	477440	keeping Oreo cookie crumbs out of the mouse mechanism.
477440	480240	Well, Mary, where is the best place to put it then?
480240	485240	Well, your computer should be placed in a spot that is convenient, clean, cool, and
485240	486240	dry.
486240	490440	Dirt, heat, and moisture can damage your PC's electrical components.
490440	492600	I guess that kind of rules out the spot next to the heater.
492600	493600	Well, yeah.
493600	496600	Now you also want to make sure you get a surge protector.
496600	501520	It prevents power fluctuations from damaging circuitry, and you can also use it to protect
501520	504720	your power switches from excess wear and tear.
504720	507880	Just turn everything on by using the switch on the surge protector.
507880	511280	Mary, do I need an anti-glare screen?
511280	512400	It's a good idea.
512400	517000	It prevents eye strain and just fits over your monitor and prevents light from bouncing
517000	518600	off the screen into your eyes.
518600	523160	Now, always place your screen so that you're looking down slightly at it.
523160	527120	Place the monitor at a 90-degree angle to any window.
527120	531840	Well, now that we're at the desk, show me the proper way to sit.
531840	532840	Okay.
532840	538360	Feet nice and flat on the floor, back straight, forearms level with the keyboard, and my wrists
538360	541240	are even supported by this nice little wrist pad here.
541240	542240	Looks good.
542240	545520	You must have done most of your homework, the soda.
545520	547320	You want to keep liquids away from the unit.
547320	550280	And also, be sure to cover the unit when it's not in use.
550280	554360	You can buy a cleaning kit to keep your PC and drive clean and desk-free.
554360	557160	So my hardware can actually last longer than the technology.
557160	560960	Well, it is constantly changing, but the basics don't.
560960	561960	Let's review.
561960	566120	Computers process data by converting it into electrical impulses that are either on or
566120	567120	off.
567120	569080	This is a binary code.
569080	574680	Just as Morse code used only dots or dashes, binary code uses zero or one to represent
574680	576160	off or on.
576160	578360	Each of these pulses is called a bit.
578800	582200	Bits grouped into a pattern of eight are called a byte.
582200	588440	These bits and bytes make up all the numerical information used by a PC.
588440	593880	The computer's memory, just like ours, is kept alive by electrical impulses.
593880	599120	When you turn it off, it loses everything, unless it's stored on a form of magnetic media
599120	601560	like a floppy or hard drive.
601560	603480	There are two types of memory.
603480	607840	RAM, random access memory, is the computer's thinking power.
607840	612720	It's the memory that stores data and instructions the PC is currently using.
612720	617800	The more RAM a PC has, the more it can juggle at one time, and the faster it can handle
617800	618800	it.
618800	624040	Now, ROM, read-only memory, is the memory that is permanently encoded.
624040	628600	These are usually the instructions to turn on, set up, and load the rest of the instructions
628600	630280	from the disk.
630280	635640	ROM cannot be changed and won't be erased when the power is turned off.
635640	640640	Now if you have heard computer jocks talking about megs, they're not talking about girls,
640640	641640	they know.
641640	644120	It's short for megabyte or MB.
644120	646240	RAM is measured in megabytes.
646240	650240	Another thing that is measured in megs is the capacity of the hard drive.
650240	654040	Some hard drives have 40, 80, or even more megabytes.
654040	659120	A hard drive is the device that stores and reads data on a magnetic disk.
659120	664040	It's a large capacity storage device used for long-term permanent storage.
664040	669760	The hard drive is where you store the programs and data that you will be using.
669760	674200	Let's take a quick tour inside the PC to see where some of the things we've been talking
674200	676620	about are located.
676620	680680	This is the microprocessor chip, which is the brain of the computer.
680680	685360	It's also called the CPU or central processing unit.
685360	688640	Now over here is the floppy disk drive.
688640	695080	If there are two drives, they're stacked on top of each other, or side by side.
695080	699560	To the left of, or underneath the disk drive, is the computer's hard drive, if you have
699560	702400	one.
702400	706680	These are the drive's controller cables, which connect to the controller card, which
706680	708920	is plugged into the motherboard.
708920	714600	The controller card manages the transfer of data to and from the drives.
714600	721680	This is the computer's power supply, and here are the cables that power the drive.
721680	723720	This is the motherboard.
723720	731560	Here are the ROM or read-only memory chips, and these are the RAM or random access memory.
731560	735680	RAM comes in the form of SIMS, or single inline memory modules.
735680	738800	Man, that's a lot of powerful stuff in there.
738800	739800	It is.
739800	742840	And now that you know what it all is, it's time to boot up the computer.
742840	747400	By the way, if you have the feeling she's not talking Westernware, you're right.
747400	751480	You see, booting up is computer ease for turning the computer on and getting it up and running
751480	753480	by loading the operating system.
753480	757860	The operating system tells the PC how to think and communicate.
757860	763400	Some operating systems you may have heard of are OS2 or UNIX, but the most prevalent
763400	767560	is DOS, which stands for Disk Operating System.
767560	774520	Built in 1981 by Microsoft Corporation, DOS has been made more user-friendly with Windows.
774520	779960	The Windows is a graphic user interface similar in concept to the Macintosh system and can
779960	786040	be used with most IBM PCs or compatibles, depending on the computer's memory.
786040	791120	Formatting in DOS is what you must do before you can store files on a floppy disk.
791120	796200	Formatting, sometimes referred to as initializing, prepares a floppy or hard drive to accept
796200	797200	data.
797200	800480	DOS tells DOS how to find the information you stored on it.
800480	805760	In DOS, directories manage information on a hard disk or floppy.
805760	812760	Now each directory acts as a drawer in a filing cabinet and can contain subdirectories or files.
812760	816760	To learn more fully how to use DOS, be sure to reference your manual.
816760	817760	The manual?
817760	819880	I mean, that's usually the last place I'd check.
819880	823320	Well, maybe that's why you still can't program your VCR either.
823720	825880	But really, it can be very helpful.
825880	829880	And keep it in a place where you can readily get at it to answer any questions.
836080	837840	You know, Paul, there's the same.
837840	840280	There are two kinds of computer users.
840280	843720	Those who have lost their data and those who will.
843720	846640	One of the best habits you can have is backing up.
846640	850120	That is, making a copy of your data onto a floppy.
850120	853800	It can also be done onto a data cartridge if you have a tape drive.
853800	860280	If your hard drive crashes or seriously malfunctions, you have lost everything.
860280	864880	Disasters like this can be minimized by copying the contents of the hard drive onto floppies.
864880	870200	And crashes aren't common, but it only takes once to make you a firm believer in backing
870200	871200	up.
871200	873280	You know, backing up is a lot like flossing.
873280	874560	Come on, nobody likes to do it.
874560	878400	But you sure want to hold onto your teeth or your data in this case.
878400	879400	First long as you need it.
879600	884040	But the use and enjoyment you'll get from your PC far outweighs the little dredgeries.
884040	887040	Paul, have you thought about the software you're going to need?
887040	889640	Well, I know that I want to do word processing.
889640	890640	Okay.
890640	898960	Then you'll want to consider programs like Word Perfect and Microsoft Word.
898960	902680	I also have lots of addresses and phone numbers, you know, friends and clients that I want
902680	903680	to keep track of.
904080	911680	Well, there are several databases that are popular, such as D-Base, FoxPro, and Paradox.
911680	913080	What about doing budgets?
913080	914080	Can anything help?
914080	919880	A spreadsheet program like Lotus or XL can come in very handy.
919880	923600	Or you might benefit from financial packages like Quicken.
923600	927640	You know, desktop publishing is something that you always hear about.
927640	928640	That's right.
928640	933800	You need to do beautiful graphics and layouts with software programs like PageMaker and
933800	935760	Ventura Publisher.
935760	941040	You can also use your PC to learn an entirely new skill, even a language, through the vast
941040	944200	number of educational programs that are available.
944200	949400	And after I've settled my current budget crisis, I can kick back and play a few games.
949400	952760	Oh, darn it, the computer won again.
952760	956480	You know, it's good you remember to mention that PCs are really fun, too.
956480	958480	But you've got to put that there.
958480	970520	We've talked about a lot of things in this videotape to provide you with a good overview
970520	973000	to get started in personal computing.
973000	987160	We've got over the components of a PC, the CPU, the keyboard, the monitor, the printer.
987160	991960	And we've talked about how it connects and what you'll need to get started.
991960	1000480	We've also taken a closer look at the technology, what memory, RAM, and ROM are, what a hard
1000480	1006560	drive is, and how to get started on the DOS operating system.
1006560	1011080	We've also reviewed some safety measures for you, your computer, and your data.
1011080	1012080	And you know what?
1012080	1013680	None of it as hard as they make it sound.
1013680	1016080	All that tech talk, it's no big deal.
1016080	1020480	And if you need further review, check back to the table of contents and then fast forward
1020480	1022040	to the section you need.
1022040	1027520	And you know, this tape is just the beginning of a wonderful new world of personal computing.
1027520	1030040	Thanks for listening.
1030040	1033560	Memorax has been proud to bring you this videotape.
1033560	1038160	In addition to our video library, Memorax brings you the most complete array of products
1038160	1064560	specifically created for the computer user.
