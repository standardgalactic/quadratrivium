31000	36000	Introduction From Metal to Plastic
37000	48000	In 1951, Remington Rand introduced Univac 1, with bronze alloy metal magnetic tape on 8-inch metal reels, running on its Uniservo tape units.
48000	52000	The first commercial computer with magnetic tape reel storage.
52000	66000	In 1952, IBM introduced its first magnetic tape reel unit, the 726, which used cellulose acetate tape, which was much lighter and easier to use than Univac's metal tape.
66000	69000	PET and Mylar
69000	79000	In 1941, PET or polyethylene terephthalate, a polymer resin, was invented at Calico Printers Association in the UK.
79000	87000	PET was later developed into a product called Tereline. At Imperial Chemical Industries, UK.
87000	92000	In 1948, the DuPont company purchased rights from Imperial Chemical.
92000	105000	After further research and development, in 1952 DuPont introduced Mylar, a stable, reliable magnetic storage medium tape. DuPont patented its Mylar brand.
105000	113000	IBM soon replaced cellulose acetate magnetic tape with Mylar tape film on its 727 tape unit.
113000	117000	Other computer makers quickly followed suit.
117000	128000	Today, widely used in audio, video and other applications, Mylar is a product of a joint venture called DuPont-Tajin Films.
128000	138000	In October 2017, the multinational, Indorama Ventures announced plans to acquire DuPont-Tajin Films.
138000	144000	The following presentation begins at 1952.
144000	149000	The IBM 726 Magnetic Tape Unit
149000	156000	On May 21, 1952, IBM announced the IBM 726 Magnetic Tape Unit.
156000	170000	Real-to-real magnetic tapes provided a high-speed method of processing greater quantities of data than were previously possible through either cathode ray tube, CRT, or drum storage technologies.
170000	179000	The IBM 726 unit could read or write at a rate of 12,500 digits per second, and a capacity of over 2 million digits per tape.
179000	186000	The 726 used an oxide-coated, non-metallic tape, approximately one-half inch wide.
186000	194000	This was in contrast to the 1951 Remington Rand Univac tapes, which were constructed of metal oxide bronze alloy.
194000	199000	Information on the 726 tape drive was recorded in six parallel channels.
199000	203000	A seventh channel was reserved for error checking.
203000	209000	Tape density was 100 bits per linear inch.
209000	221000	The 726 tape drives were used with the IBM 701 data processing system and other early IBM machines.
221000	234000	The 726 was eventually replaced by the more advanced 727 and 729 tape drive units.
234000	239000	The IBM 727 Magnetic Tape Unit
239000	248000	On September 25, 1953, IBM announced the IBM 727 Magnetic Tape Unit.
248000	257000	It provided large capacity storage and a high-speed input.
257000	267000	In 1952, IBM had announced its first commercially available scientific computer, the IBM 701.
267000	280000	The 701 was the first in the pioneering line of IBM 700 series computers, which later included 702, 704, 705 and 709.
280000	286000	Up to five 727 units could be connected to a single IBM 701 computer.
286000	291000	Additional 727s were possible by adding additional circuits.
291000	300000	Recording density was 200 BPI. Tape could be read both forwards and backwards at 75 inches per second.
300000	304000	Read-write speed was 15,000 characters per second.
304000	313000	With an attached card reader and control unit, the 727 could transfer punch card data to tape at 250 cards per minute.
313000	320000	Tape to card transfers were performed at 100 cards per minute.
320000	330000	On October 1, 1954, IBM introduced the new 705 data processing system with the 727 tape unit as a compatible device.
330000	341000	This vintage film clip from 1957 shows an IBM 705 installation with the 727 style tape drive.
341000	348000	An IBM 705 system is utilized to process selected data generated by the agency's mission.
348000	358000	Let us examine the characteristics of this particular system.
358000	372000	Data and instructions on punched cards can be fed from a card reader directly into the memory of the central processing unit, which in this case is a magnetic core device.
372000	377000	Data and instructions on magnetic tape in turn can also be fed into memory.
377000	389000	From this medium, data can be fed into the ADPS at a speed of 15,000 characters per second.
389000	399000	Magnetic tape has the added advantage of affording storage for large quantities of data in a small space.
399000	410000	The data on 25,000 punched cards can be recorded and stored on one 2400 foot reel of magnetic tape.
410000	420000	The operator pays particular attention to this setup phase to ensure that the processing will be executed as programmed.
420000	427000	Although the IBM 728 tape units, seen here, were physically similar to model 727 units,
427000	442000	were designed to different specifications for use with the IBM Sage computer, also known as the Anfsq-7.
442000	445000	They must be put in a form the computer can accept.
445000	451000	Punched cards, thousands of them.
451000	455000	Cards then enter a high-speed computer for processing.
455000	462000	While all this is going on, the computer is receiving instructions from previously recorded tapes.
462000	470000	The result is a new magnetic tape recording containing the radar data for Sage STP problems.
470000	482000	Periodically, problem tapes are checked in the FSQ-7 computer to ensure that the problems are compatible with the operational programs for the Sage system.
482000	489000	The SSTP problem tapes are prepared for shipment to Sage direction centers throughout the country.
489000	498000	At the start of the exercise, the problem tape begins to feed simulated long-range radar data into the memory of the computer.
498000	505000	The synthetic data is processed by the same programmed instructions that are used in normal operations.
505000	510000	The IBM 729 magnetic tape unit.
510000	518000	The 729 was a highly successful IBM tape drive used in the late 1950s, up through the 1960s.
518000	526000	The 729 used 1.5-inch tape, up to 2,400 feet long, on reels up to 10 and 1.5-inch diameter.
526000	531000	To allow rapid tape acceleration, which contributed to fast data access,
531000	535000	long vacuum columns were placed between the tape reels and read-write heads
535000	541000	to absorb sudden changes in tape speed that could otherwise break the tape.
541000	545000	Initial tape speed was 75 inches per second.
545000	557000	Early units had a recording density of 200 CPI, which allowed a 2,400-foot reel to hold about 50,000 punch cards worth of data, or roughly about 3 megabytes.
557000	564000	Numerous 729 models were introduced as technical improvements were made over its lifespan.
564000	574000	The 729 model 1 was introduced for IBM 709 and IBM 705 model 3 computers.
574000	582000	This early 729 tape unit looked identical to the IBM 727 tape unit and used vacuum tubes.
582000	593000	The 729 model 2, which utilized transistors, was introduced for the IBM 7000 series computers, and it introduced a new cabinet style.
594000	613000	A new automated process for manufacturing magnetic core memory devices made it possible for low-cost computer systems to efficiently sort thousands of records.
613000	622000	Powered input units, tape drives, and printers now could offer for the first time the speed and versatility needed by large commercial users.
622000	633000	The combination of these advances brought about a second generation of computers in 1960 with the delivery of the 1401 system.
633000	645000	This second computer generation, with its vast improvements in processing speed and capacity, made extensive use of tape input-output systems, especially for record-keeping jobs.
645000	655000	Year-to-date records on tape could be read into or out of computers at the previously unheard-of rate of 41,000 characters per second.
655000	665000	Besides speed of access, tape could store an enormous amount of information for its size in comparison with punched cards.
666000	680000	A standard reel holds 2,400 feet of one-half inch wide tape and can contain data equivalent to about 400,000 fully punched cards, or 200 card boxes filled with punched cards.
680000	684000	We had the 1,400 family for commercial applications.
684000	695000	The 7,000 family was mainly used by the scientific community, and a new 7740 computer family was developed to do message switching applications.
695000	710000	The former card system carried with it 46 drawers of advanced cards, 23 drawers of accounts receivable, and 32 drawers of name and address cards, which the 1401 replaced with less than one rack of magnetic tape.
711000	714000	The reduction of procedural steps is equally dramatic.
714000	720000	Customer billing on the old card-based equipment involved 21 separate machine passes.
720000	726000	The 1401 system did the same jobs in just seven machine steps.
728000	731000	1954. The IBM NORC.
731000	741000	IBM's Naval Ordinance Research Calculator, or NORC, was especially designed, one-of-a-kind, high-speed computer built for the U.S. Navy.
741000	750000	NORC used 9,800 vacuum tubes, over 1,000 diodes, and executed 15,000 calculations per second.
751000	763000	NORC had eight magnetic tape units, similar to the units on the IBM 701. However, the reels, controls and cabinet of the tape units were unique to NORC's design.
763000	769000	These ultra-high-speed units could read 71,000 characters per second from a single tape.
770000	782000	NORC was built between 1950 and 1954, at the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory, Columbia University, and the Navy Computation Laboratory at Dalgren, Virginia.
782000	788000	Many advancements achieved during its construction, were incorporated into later IBM computers.
789000	797000	Delivered to the U.S. Navy in December 1954, NORC remained in service until 1968.
797000	818000	General Electric Company.
818000	825000	GE was one of the eight major computer companies of the 1960s.
825000	835000	General Electric was formed in 1892, by the merger of Edison General Electric Company of New York, and Thompson Houston Electric Company of Massachusetts.
839000	847000	Its first large-scale digital computer contract, was the agreement to build 32 ERMA machines for Bank of America.
847000	851000	ERMA stood for Electronic Recording Machine Accounting.
851000	862000	It was a pioneering computer development project run at Stanford Research Institute from 1950 to 1955, under contract with B of A.
862000	878000	GE also contracted with National Cash Register Company, NCR, to build the NCR-304 computers.
878000	886000	The ERMA and the NCR-304 were GE's two major computer contracts in the 1950s.
887000	898000	GE selected the successful Ampex Corporation as the supplier of the magnetic tape units for these and many other computers in the GE product line.
904000	910000	Throughout its history, GE made significant contributions to the early computing field,
911000	922000	including the 1952 ORAC, one of the earliest digital computers, and work on the Dartmouth time-sharing system DTSS in the 1960s.
928000	939000	Ampex Data Systems Corporation, as it is known today, has an extensive and impressive history of technical innovation and influential digital recording products.
940000	961000	Ampex drives were also used in the National Bureau of Standards SEAC computer, the Atlas computer at Chilton, UK, early CDC-1604 computers, and many more.
971000	986000	Merchandise National Bank is proud to be among the first in the nation to install an electronic computer, a General Electric 210 system that can actually read the same information you and I can read.
986000	995000	Components in our system include the reader sorter, a high-speed printer, the magnetic tape units, the central processor, and the control console.
996000	1006000	To make sure that we've added just the right amount of iron oxide particles to the line of symbols on Sally's checks and deposit tickets, we test samples on this signal strength machine.
1006000	1013000	The computer system not only reads information, it records all of the vital details on magnetic tape.
1013000	1020000	These ledgers of tomorrow record and store all of the information pertaining to all of the bank's checking accounts.
1020000	1026000	The tape units operate in much the same way as a home tape recorder, but of course they're much faster.
1026000	1044000	Information can be recorded on or read from the tape at the rate of 30,000 characters per second, and presents us with the information read from the checks and deposit tickets in numerical order.
1045000	1056000	Now we're ready to do our daily posting, using the transaction tape which lists checks and deposit tickets in account number order and a master file tape.
1056000	1067000	The RCA Bismac Computer
1067000	1070000	The RCA Bismac Computer
1070000	1079000	In 1951 RCA was awarded a military contract to build the Bismac, a large-scale data processing machine.
1079000	1087000	RCA was an early entrant into the computer field, using its vast resources in early electronics research and vacuum tube technologies.
1087000	1093000	It gained an important foothold in the early 1950s.
1093000	1104000	The first Bismac machine was installed in 1956. The Bismac was a vacuum tube giant.
1104000	1113000	A unique design of the Bismac was the use of hundreds of tape drives connected to a central computer.
1113000	1122000	Permanently mounted tape data could be transferred from tape units immediately, without the need for constant mounting and dismounting individual tapes.
1122000	1129000	Tape station operators controlled the flow of data to the main computer.
1136000	1143000	In 1958 RCA introduced the 501 Electronic Data Processing System.
1143000	1150000	The RCA 501 was a medium to large-scale computer, utilizing all transistor logic.
1150000	1156000	All system operating controls were centralized in a specially designed computer control panel.
1156000	1169000	The 501 also utilized high-speed magnetic core storage.
1169000	1174000	The 501 could accommodate up to 63 magnetic tape units.
1174000	1185000	Other system components included a card punch, card reader, paper tape punch, paper tape reader, typewriter verifier, and other devices.
1185000	1195000	RCA went on to produce other computers such as the 301 and the 601, and the RCA Spectra 70 line of large-scale computers.
1195000	1201000	By 1971 however, RCA had experienced millions in losses.
1201000	1208000	In September 1971, RCA sold its commercial computer division to Sperry Rand.
1225000	1231000	The RCA 501 was a large-scale computer.
1231000	1237000	The RCA 701 was a large-scale computer.
1237000	1243000	The RCA 701 was a large-scale computer.
1243000	1249000	The RCA 701 was a large-scale computer.
1249000	1261000	Music
1261000	1271000	It's a remarkable new polyester film called Mylar.
1271000	1276000	High tensile strength, high tear resistance, and high impact strength.
1276000	1285000	In short, Mylar's physical properties make it the strongest of all plastic film under a wide variety of conditions.
1285000	1293000	Today, Mylar is being widely used because it's the only known base film that meets this ideal.
1293000	1301000	And because Mylar is so much thinner and stronger, you can get 50% more tape on a standard reel.
1301000	1312000	Glamorous Mylar metallic yarns are stronger, non-tarnishable, with stand washing, dry cleaning, and pressing.
1312000	1316000	Draperies can take on exciting new effect.
