00:00.000 --> 00:13.200
Memorex. It's the most recognizable name in computer supplies and accessories. For over

00:13.200 --> 00:18.200
30 years, Memorex has built their reputation on their unique understanding of the needs

00:18.200 --> 00:24.200
of the PC user, and has been on the forefront in creating products to meet those needs.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.640
Memorex is proud to bring you this instructional video tape, and to play a part in helping

00:28.640 --> 00:46.840
you master all aspects of the personal computer.

00:46.840 --> 00:52.280
Something has driven you to learn to use a PC, a personal computer. Either your friends,

00:52.280 --> 00:57.440
your kids, your job, or maybe just a desire to join the computer age.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.040
Or maybe even all of the above.

01:00.040 --> 01:05.840
Memorex has created this tape to make the basic technology, functions, and terminology

01:05.840 --> 01:08.640
of PCs understandable to you.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.840
And finally, you'll understand that techno-nerd babble computer ease that you hear all the

01:13.840 --> 01:15.340
time.

01:15.340 --> 01:21.600
You can view this tape in its entirety, or you can set your counter on your VCR at 00 now,

01:21.600 --> 01:26.160
and check out this video's table of contents, and proceed to just the subjects in which

01:26.160 --> 01:31.400
you're interested. Or go back and review something you've missed.

01:31.400 --> 01:35.600
Personal computers are everywhere nowadays. They're a part of so many people's lives.

01:35.600 --> 01:40.560
You'll find them in schools, businesses, even at home. What computers can help you do really

01:40.560 --> 01:43.400
defines just how powerful they can really be.

01:43.400 --> 01:48.640
And to start putting some of that power to work for you, I suggest we begin at the very

01:48.640 --> 01:50.120
beginning.

01:50.120 --> 01:55.200
There are two basic types. The IBM PC and Compatibles are made by many different manufacturers

01:55.200 --> 01:59.280
like Dell, Compac, Packard-Bell, among others.

01:59.280 --> 02:03.200
There's also the Macintosh family from Apple Computer.

02:03.200 --> 02:07.280
Now it used to be that IBM and Apple were like the Klingons and the Romulons of the

02:07.280 --> 02:08.600
computer world.

02:08.600 --> 02:12.840
But those worlds are merging. The needs of most users now can be met by both systems.

02:12.840 --> 02:17.040
And if you haven't yet purchased your PC, explore carefully both of these options.

02:17.040 --> 02:21.120
And remember, the most important feature of a PC is its functionality.

02:21.120 --> 02:26.400
No matter which technology you select, this tape should be a helpful introduction. Now,

02:26.400 --> 02:27.400
let's get to work.

02:27.400 --> 02:31.280
Okay, well I think you'll find it's much easier than it may have sounded before.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.480
So let's discuss the components of a PC.

02:35.480 --> 02:41.400
Now the real brains of a computer are located in the Central Processing Unit, or CPU.

02:41.400 --> 02:46.240
The CPU is the chip that does the actual processing and calculations.

02:46.240 --> 02:53.600
One of the most commonly discussed are the 286, 386, and 486.

02:53.600 --> 02:58.320
The numbers simply refer to the type and speed of the processing chip in the unit.

02:58.320 --> 03:02.480
And no doubt in the future there's going to be even faster, more powerful machines like

03:02.480 --> 03:04.000
586 TurboPower and SuperCharge.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.600
Oh, don't get carried away.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.520
Let's move on to the monitor.

03:08.520 --> 03:12.800
The monitor is the computer's display screen and the primary output device.

03:12.800 --> 03:17.720
Now the techno-cool name is CRT, which stands for cathode ray 2.

03:17.720 --> 03:22.560
You can get monitors which display just one color called monochrome, or you can get color.

03:22.560 --> 03:31.760
The resolution of color monitors vary and are referred to as CGA, EGA, VGA, or super VGA.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.320
The second most common output device is a printer.

03:35.320 --> 03:40.600
There are different types of printers, daisy wheel, dot matrix, and laser jets.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.480
Not a very in price and capabilities.

03:43.480 --> 03:50.280
A good dot matrix printer is quite adequate for a lot of people, although it can be noisy.

03:50.280 --> 03:56.000
Laser jet printers produce excellent quality type and graphics and are very quiet, but

03:56.000 --> 03:58.480
can be quite expensive.

03:58.480 --> 04:03.600
The keyboard is the most common input device to enter instructions and information into

04:03.600 --> 04:04.600
the computer.

04:04.600 --> 04:10.040
Now there are some special keys that you won't find on a typewriter, like Enter, which tells

04:10.040 --> 04:13.760
a computer to accept your instructions.

04:13.760 --> 04:18.480
Escape, which is usually found in the upper left, lets you exit the program or function

04:18.480 --> 04:23.480
you're working in and back up to the previous step.

04:23.480 --> 04:29.500
These are the function keys, labeled F1, F2, and so on.

04:29.500 --> 04:34.680
These keys can have distinct actions attributed to them, depending on the program.

04:34.680 --> 04:46.720
Computer input devices like a mouse, trackball, or joystick allow the PC user to move the

04:46.720 --> 04:51.120
cursor around to specify an exact location on the screen.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.120
The mouse is the most popular.

04:53.120 --> 04:58.400
The buttons on it allow you to send commands to your computer by pointing and clicking.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.920
A trackball is basically a stationary mouse.

05:01.920 --> 05:07.200
It looks like a cue ball set into a pedestal, which you roll to move the cursor.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.120
Mary, did you know that computers can communicate over phone lines?

05:10.120 --> 05:12.560
Yes, I did, via a modem.

05:12.560 --> 05:17.080
See your computer can have conversations with other computers, transmitting and receiving

05:17.080 --> 05:19.080
data over a phone line.

05:19.080 --> 05:24.000
There are even fax modems that allow users to send and receive fax documents from or

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
to other computers.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.880
Sounds pretty nifty.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.280
Now using a PC is not as complicated as I thought it might have been, but Mary, how

05:30.280 --> 05:33.120
does it all link together?

05:33.120 --> 05:35.920
Well everything plugs into the back.

05:35.920 --> 05:41.520
There's a whole assortment of plugs back there to connect cables to that are called ports.

05:41.520 --> 05:48.000
Serial ports transmit or process data one bit or character at a time, and parallel ports

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
transmit many bits concurrently.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.400
Serial ports are usually used for a mouse or an external modem, and a parallel port

05:56.400 --> 05:59.480
is used to connect a printer.

05:59.480 --> 06:03.960
Now what we've been talking about is hardware, but Mary, what's software?

06:03.960 --> 06:06.920
Software is the real reason you use a computer.

06:06.920 --> 06:11.280
It's computer code, the stuff on disks, programs.

06:11.280 --> 06:16.240
Software, or sometimes called application software, tells the hardware what to do.

06:16.240 --> 06:21.520
Well, it looks like I'm ready to sit down on that comfortable, genuine, Hercules software

06:21.520 --> 06:23.000
and start using the old PC.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.920
What do I do first?

06:24.920 --> 06:34.920
Well, first let's talk about floppy disks.

06:34.920 --> 06:40.320
A floppy disk is a plate of magnetic material that stores data in digital form.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.360
It goes into the floppy disk drive.

06:42.360 --> 06:47.160
Now it's used to transfer data from one PC to another, or it can be used to backup data

06:47.160 --> 06:48.360
from the hard drive.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.200
This doesn't feel floppy at all.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.760
In fact, it actually looks like a coaster.

06:52.760 --> 06:56.200
Well that's a three and a half inch disk that's been encased in plastic.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.200
Now the other common type is the five and a quarter inch.

06:59.200 --> 07:04.680
They both use the same technology, and can both be written on or read from.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.480
These are double density disks.

07:06.480 --> 07:10.280
These can store about 700,000 characters of information.

07:10.280 --> 07:15.880
There are also high density disks, which can store around 1.4 million, or almost twice

07:15.880 --> 07:18.200
the information as a double density disk.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.720
But which one do I use?

07:19.720 --> 07:22.200
Well, it all depends on your disk drive.

07:22.200 --> 07:34.400
Newer PCs usually have high density drives, which can read all kinds of disks.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.680
Now Paul, there are a few other inexpensive items that you're going to have to add to

07:37.680 --> 07:42.680
your shopping list, like storage boxes to store and organize your disks, and to keep

07:42.680 --> 07:50.080
them safe from dust and damage, paper for your printer, and a mouse pad, which gives

07:50.080 --> 07:54.480
you good traction and protects the mouse and your desk from each other, as well as

07:54.480 --> 07:57.440
keeping Oreo cookie crumbs out of the mouse mechanism.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.240
Well, Mary, where is the best place to put it then?

08:00.240 --> 08:05.240
Well, your computer should be placed in a spot that is convenient, clean, cool, and

08:05.240 --> 08:06.240
dry.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.440
Dirt, heat, and moisture can damage your PC's electrical components.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.600
I guess that kind of rules out the spot next to the heater.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.600
Well, yeah.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.600
Now you also want to make sure you get a surge protector.

08:16.600 --> 08:21.520
It prevents power fluctuations from damaging circuitry, and you can also use it to protect

08:21.520 --> 08:24.720
your power switches from excess wear and tear.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.880
Just turn everything on by using the switch on the surge protector.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.280
Mary, do I need an anti-glare screen?

08:31.280 --> 08:32.400
It's a good idea.

08:32.400 --> 08:37.000
It prevents eye strain and just fits over your monitor and prevents light from bouncing

08:37.000 --> 08:38.600
off the screen into your eyes.

08:38.600 --> 08:43.160
Now, always place your screen so that you're looking down slightly at it.

08:43.160 --> 08:47.120
Place the monitor at a 90-degree angle to any window.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.840
Well, now that we're at the desk, show me the proper way to sit.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.840
Okay.

08:52.840 --> 08:58.360
Feet nice and flat on the floor, back straight, forearms level with the keyboard, and my wrists

08:58.360 --> 09:01.240
are even supported by this nice little wrist pad here.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.240
Looks good.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.520
You must have done most of your homework, the soda.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.320
You want to keep liquids away from the unit.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.280
And also, be sure to cover the unit when it's not in use.

09:10.280 --> 09:14.360
You can buy a cleaning kit to keep your PC and drive clean and desk-free.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.160
So my hardware can actually last longer than the technology.

09:17.160 --> 09:20.960
Well, it is constantly changing, but the basics don't.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.960
Let's review.

09:21.960 --> 09:26.120
Computers process data by converting it into electrical impulses that are either on or

09:26.120 --> 09:27.120
off.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.080
This is a binary code.

09:29.080 --> 09:34.680
Just as Morse code used only dots or dashes, binary code uses zero or one to represent

09:34.680 --> 09:36.160
off or on.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.360
Each of these pulses is called a bit.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.200
Bits grouped into a pattern of eight are called a byte.

09:42.200 --> 09:48.440
These bits and bytes make up all the numerical information used by a PC.

09:48.440 --> 09:53.880
The computer's memory, just like ours, is kept alive by electrical impulses.

09:53.880 --> 09:59.120
When you turn it off, it loses everything, unless it's stored on a form of magnetic media

09:59.120 --> 10:01.560
like a floppy or hard drive.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.480
There are two types of memory.

10:03.480 --> 10:07.840
RAM, random access memory, is the computer's thinking power.

10:07.840 --> 10:12.720
It's the memory that stores data and instructions the PC is currently using.

10:12.720 --> 10:17.800
The more RAM a PC has, the more it can juggle at one time, and the faster it can handle

10:17.800 --> 10:18.800
it.

10:18.800 --> 10:24.040
Now, ROM, read-only memory, is the memory that is permanently encoded.

10:24.040 --> 10:28.600
These are usually the instructions to turn on, set up, and load the rest of the instructions

10:28.600 --> 10:30.280
from the disk.

10:30.280 --> 10:35.640
ROM cannot be changed and won't be erased when the power is turned off.

10:35.640 --> 10:40.640
Now if you have heard computer jocks talking about megs, they're not talking about girls,

10:40.640 --> 10:41.640
they know.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.120
It's short for megabyte or MB.

10:44.120 --> 10:46.240
RAM is measured in megabytes.

10:46.240 --> 10:50.240
Another thing that is measured in megs is the capacity of the hard drive.

10:50.240 --> 10:54.040
Some hard drives have 40, 80, or even more megabytes.

10:54.040 --> 10:59.120
A hard drive is the device that stores and reads data on a magnetic disk.

10:59.120 --> 11:04.040
It's a large capacity storage device used for long-term permanent storage.

11:04.040 --> 11:09.760
The hard drive is where you store the programs and data that you will be using.

11:09.760 --> 11:14.200
Let's take a quick tour inside the PC to see where some of the things we've been talking

11:14.200 --> 11:16.620
about are located.

11:16.620 --> 11:20.680
This is the microprocessor chip, which is the brain of the computer.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.360
It's also called the CPU or central processing unit.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.640
Now over here is the floppy disk drive.

11:28.640 --> 11:35.080
If there are two drives, they're stacked on top of each other, or side by side.

11:35.080 --> 11:39.560
To the left of, or underneath the disk drive, is the computer's hard drive, if you have

11:39.560 --> 11:42.400
one.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.680
These are the drive's controller cables, which connect to the controller card, which

11:46.680 --> 11:48.920
is plugged into the motherboard.

11:48.920 --> 11:54.600
The controller card manages the transfer of data to and from the drives.

11:54.600 --> 12:01.680
This is the computer's power supply, and here are the cables that power the drive.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.720
This is the motherboard.

12:03.720 --> 12:11.560
Here are the ROM or read-only memory chips, and these are the RAM or random access memory.

12:11.560 --> 12:15.680
RAM comes in the form of SIMS, or single inline memory modules.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.800
Man, that's a lot of powerful stuff in there.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.800
It is.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.840
And now that you know what it all is, it's time to boot up the computer.

12:22.840 --> 12:27.400
By the way, if you have the feeling she's not talking Westernware, you're right.

12:27.400 --> 12:31.480
You see, booting up is computer ease for turning the computer on and getting it up and running

12:31.480 --> 12:33.480
by loading the operating system.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.860
The operating system tells the PC how to think and communicate.

12:37.860 --> 12:43.400
Some operating systems you may have heard of are OS2 or UNIX, but the most prevalent

12:43.400 --> 12:47.560
is DOS, which stands for Disk Operating System.

12:47.560 --> 12:54.520
Built in 1981 by Microsoft Corporation, DOS has been made more user-friendly with Windows.

12:54.520 --> 12:59.960
The Windows is a graphic user interface similar in concept to the Macintosh system and can

12:59.960 --> 13:06.040
be used with most IBM PCs or compatibles, depending on the computer's memory.

13:06.040 --> 13:11.120
Formatting in DOS is what you must do before you can store files on a floppy disk.

13:11.120 --> 13:16.200
Formatting, sometimes referred to as initializing, prepares a floppy or hard drive to accept

13:16.200 --> 13:17.200
data.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.480
DOS tells DOS how to find the information you stored on it.

13:20.480 --> 13:25.760
In DOS, directories manage information on a hard disk or floppy.

13:25.760 --> 13:32.760
Now each directory acts as a drawer in a filing cabinet and can contain subdirectories or files.

13:32.760 --> 13:36.760
To learn more fully how to use DOS, be sure to reference your manual.

13:36.760 --> 13:37.760
The manual?

13:37.760 --> 13:39.880
I mean, that's usually the last place I'd check.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.320
Well, maybe that's why you still can't program your VCR either.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.880
But really, it can be very helpful.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.880
And keep it in a place where you can readily get at it to answer any questions.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.840
You know, Paul, there's the same.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.280
There are two kinds of computer users.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.720
Those who have lost their data and those who will.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.640
One of the best habits you can have is backing up.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.120
That is, making a copy of your data onto a floppy.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.800
It can also be done onto a data cartridge if you have a tape drive.

14:13.800 --> 14:20.280
If your hard drive crashes or seriously malfunctions, you have lost everything.

14:20.280 --> 14:24.880
Disasters like this can be minimized by copying the contents of the hard drive onto floppies.

14:24.880 --> 14:30.200
And crashes aren't common, but it only takes once to make you a firm believer in backing

14:30.200 --> 14:31.200
up.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.280
You know, backing up is a lot like flossing.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.560
Come on, nobody likes to do it.

14:34.560 --> 14:38.400
But you sure want to hold onto your teeth or your data in this case.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.400
First long as you need it.

14:39.600 --> 14:44.040
But the use and enjoyment you'll get from your PC far outweighs the little dredgeries.

14:44.040 --> 14:47.040
Paul, have you thought about the software you're going to need?

14:47.040 --> 14:49.640
Well, I know that I want to do word processing.

14:49.640 --> 14:50.640
Okay.

14:50.640 --> 14:58.960
Then you'll want to consider programs like Word Perfect and Microsoft Word.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.680
I also have lots of addresses and phone numbers, you know, friends and clients that I want

15:02.680 --> 15:03.680
to keep track of.

15:04.080 --> 15:11.680
Well, there are several databases that are popular, such as D-Base, FoxPro, and Paradox.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.080
What about doing budgets?

15:13.080 --> 15:14.080
Can anything help?

15:14.080 --> 15:19.880
A spreadsheet program like Lotus or XL can come in very handy.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.600
Or you might benefit from financial packages like Quicken.

15:23.600 --> 15:27.640
You know, desktop publishing is something that you always hear about.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.640
That's right.

15:28.640 --> 15:33.800
You need to do beautiful graphics and layouts with software programs like PageMaker and

15:33.800 --> 15:35.760
Ventura Publisher.

15:35.760 --> 15:41.040
You can also use your PC to learn an entirely new skill, even a language, through the vast

15:41.040 --> 15:44.200
number of educational programs that are available.

15:44.200 --> 15:49.400
And after I've settled my current budget crisis, I can kick back and play a few games.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.760
Oh, darn it, the computer won again.

15:52.760 --> 15:56.480
You know, it's good you remember to mention that PCs are really fun, too.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.480
But you've got to put that there.

15:58.480 --> 16:10.520
We've talked about a lot of things in this videotape to provide you with a good overview

16:10.520 --> 16:13.000
to get started in personal computing.

16:13.000 --> 16:27.160
We've got over the components of a PC, the CPU, the keyboard, the monitor, the printer.

16:27.160 --> 16:31.960
And we've talked about how it connects and what you'll need to get started.

16:31.960 --> 16:40.480
We've also taken a closer look at the technology, what memory, RAM, and ROM are, what a hard

16:40.480 --> 16:46.560
drive is, and how to get started on the DOS operating system.

16:46.560 --> 16:51.080
We've also reviewed some safety measures for you, your computer, and your data.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.080
And you know what?

16:52.080 --> 16:53.680
None of it as hard as they make it sound.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.080
All that tech talk, it's no big deal.

16:56.080 --> 17:00.480
And if you need further review, check back to the table of contents and then fast forward

17:00.480 --> 17:02.040
to the section you need.

17:02.040 --> 17:07.520
And you know, this tape is just the beginning of a wonderful new world of personal computing.

17:07.520 --> 17:10.040
