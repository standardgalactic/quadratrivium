Introduction From Metal to Plastic

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In 1951, Remington Rand introduced Univac 1, with bronze alloy metal magnetic tape on 8-inch metal reels, running on its Uniservo tape units.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The first commercial computer with magnetic tape reel storage.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In 1952, IBM introduced its first magnetic tape reel unit, the 726, which used cellulose acetate tape, which was much lighter and easier to use than Univac's metal tape.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
PET and Mylar

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In 1941, PET or polyethylene terephthalate, a polymer resin, was invented at Calico Printers Association in the UK.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
PET was later developed into a product called Tereline. At Imperial Chemical Industries, UK.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In 1948, the DuPont company purchased rights from Imperial Chemical.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:45,000
After further research and development, in 1952 DuPont introduced Mylar, a stable, reliable magnetic storage medium tape. DuPont patented its Mylar brand.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
IBM soon replaced cellulose acetate magnetic tape with Mylar tape film on its 727 tape unit.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Other computer makers quickly followed suit.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Today, widely used in audio, video and other applications, Mylar is a product of a joint venture called DuPont-Tajin Films.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
In October 2017, the multinational, Indorama Ventures announced plans to acquire DuPont-Tajin Films.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The following presentation begins at 1952.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The IBM 726 Magnetic Tape Unit

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
On May 21, 1952, IBM announced the IBM 726 Magnetic Tape Unit.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Real-to-real magnetic tapes provided a high-speed method of processing greater quantities of data than were previously possible through either cathode ray tube, CRT, or drum storage technologies.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The IBM 726 unit could read or write at a rate of 12,500 digits per second, and a capacity of over 2 million digits per tape.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The 726 used an oxide-coated, non-metallic tape, approximately one-half inch wide.

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This was in contrast to the 1951 Remington Rand Univac tapes, which were constructed of metal oxide bronze alloy.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Information on the 726 tape drive was recorded in six parallel channels.

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A seventh channel was reserved for error checking.

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Tape density was 100 bits per linear inch.

25
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The 726 tape drives were used with the IBM 701 data processing system and other early IBM machines.

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The 726 was eventually replaced by the more advanced 727 and 729 tape drive units.

27
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The IBM 727 Magnetic Tape Unit

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
On September 25, 1953, IBM announced the IBM 727 Magnetic Tape Unit.

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It provided large capacity storage and a high-speed input.

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
In 1952, IBM had announced its first commercially available scientific computer, the IBM 701.

31
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The 701 was the first in the pioneering line of IBM 700 series computers, which later included 702, 704, 705 and 709.

32
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Up to five 727 units could be connected to a single IBM 701 computer.

33
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Additional 727s were possible by adding additional circuits.

34
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Recording density was 200 BPI. Tape could be read both forwards and backwards at 75 inches per second.

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Read-write speed was 15,000 characters per second.

36
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:13,000
With an attached card reader and control unit, the 727 could transfer punch card data to tape at 250 cards per minute.

37
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Tape to card transfers were performed at 100 cards per minute.

38
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:30,000
On October 1, 1954, IBM introduced the new 705 data processing system with the 727 tape unit as a compatible device.

39
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This vintage film clip from 1957 shows an IBM 705 installation with the 727 style tape drive.

40
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
An IBM 705 system is utilized to process selected data generated by the agency's mission.

41
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let us examine the characteristics of this particular system.

42
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Data and instructions on punched cards can be fed from a card reader directly into the memory of the central processing unit, which in this case is a magnetic core device.

43
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Data and instructions on magnetic tape in turn can also be fed into memory.

44
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:29,000
From this medium, data can be fed into the ADPS at a speed of 15,000 characters per second.

45
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Magnetic tape has the added advantage of affording storage for large quantities of data in a small space.

46
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The data on 25,000 punched cards can be recorded and stored on one 2400 foot reel of magnetic tape.

47
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The operator pays particular attention to this setup phase to ensure that the processing will be executed as programmed.

48
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Although the IBM 728 tape units, seen here, were physically similar to model 727 units,

49
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:22,000
were designed to different specifications for use with the IBM Sage computer, also known as the Anfsq-7.

50
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They must be put in a form the computer can accept.

51
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Punched cards, thousands of them.

52
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Cards then enter a high-speed computer for processing.

53
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
While all this is going on, the computer is receiving instructions from previously recorded tapes.

54
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The result is a new magnetic tape recording containing the radar data for Sage STP problems.

55
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Periodically, problem tapes are checked in the FSQ-7 computer to ensure that the problems are compatible with the operational programs for the Sage system.

56
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The SSTP problem tapes are prepared for shipment to Sage direction centers throughout the country.

57
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
At the start of the exercise, the problem tape begins to feed simulated long-range radar data into the memory of the computer.

58
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The synthetic data is processed by the same programmed instructions that are used in normal operations.

59
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The IBM 729 magnetic tape unit.

60
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The 729 was a highly successful IBM tape drive used in the late 1950s, up through the 1960s.

61
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The 729 used 1.5-inch tape, up to 2,400 feet long, on reels up to 10 and 1.5-inch diameter.

62
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
To allow rapid tape acceleration, which contributed to fast data access,

63
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
long vacuum columns were placed between the tape reels and read-write heads

64
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
to absorb sudden changes in tape speed that could otherwise break the tape.

65
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Initial tape speed was 75 inches per second.

66
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Early units had a recording density of 200 CPI, which allowed a 2,400-foot reel to hold about 50,000 punch cards worth of data, or roughly about 3 megabytes.

67
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Numerous 729 models were introduced as technical improvements were made over its lifespan.

68
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The 729 model 1 was introduced for IBM 709 and IBM 705 model 3 computers.

69
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This early 729 tape unit looked identical to the IBM 727 tape unit and used vacuum tubes.

70
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The 729 model 2, which utilized transistors, was introduced for the IBM 7000 series computers, and it introduced a new cabinet style.

71
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:13,000
A new automated process for manufacturing magnetic core memory devices made it possible for low-cost computer systems to efficiently sort thousands of records.

72
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Powered input units, tape drives, and printers now could offer for the first time the speed and versatility needed by large commercial users.

73
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The combination of these advances brought about a second generation of computers in 1960 with the delivery of the 1401 system.

74
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This second computer generation, with its vast improvements in processing speed and capacity, made extensive use of tape input-output systems, especially for record-keeping jobs.

75
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Year-to-date records on tape could be read into or out of computers at the previously unheard-of rate of 41,000 characters per second.

76
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Besides speed of access, tape could store an enormous amount of information for its size in comparison with punched cards.

77
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:20,000
A standard reel holds 2,400 feet of one-half inch wide tape and can contain data equivalent to about 400,000 fully punched cards, or 200 card boxes filled with punched cards.

78
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We had the 1,400 family for commercial applications.

79
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The 7,000 family was mainly used by the scientific community, and a new 7740 computer family was developed to do message switching applications.

80
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The former card system carried with it 46 drawers of advanced cards, 23 drawers of accounts receivable, and 32 drawers of name and address cards, which the 1401 replaced with less than one rack of magnetic tape.

81
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The reduction of procedural steps is equally dramatic.

82
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Customer billing on the old card-based equipment involved 21 separate machine passes.

83
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The 1401 system did the same jobs in just seven machine steps.

84
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
1954. The IBM NORC.

85
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:21,000
IBM's Naval Ordinance Research Calculator, or NORC, was especially designed, one-of-a-kind, high-speed computer built for the U.S. Navy.

86
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
NORC used 9,800 vacuum tubes, over 1,000 diodes, and executed 15,000 calculations per second.

87
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:43,000
NORC had eight magnetic tape units, similar to the units on the IBM 701. However, the reels, controls and cabinet of the tape units were unique to NORC's design.

88
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
These ultra-high-speed units could read 71,000 characters per second from a single tape.

89
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:02,000
NORC was built between 1950 and 1954, at the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory, Columbia University, and the Navy Computation Laboratory at Dalgren, Virginia.

90
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Many advancements achieved during its construction, were incorporated into later IBM computers.

91
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Delivered to the U.S. Navy in December 1954, NORC remained in service until 1968.

92
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:38,000
General Electric Company.

93
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
GE was one of the eight major computer companies of the 1960s.

94
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:55,000
General Electric was formed in 1892, by the merger of Edison General Electric Company of New York, and Thompson Houston Electric Company of Massachusetts.

95
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Its first large-scale digital computer contract, was the agreement to build 32 ERMA machines for Bank of America.

96
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
ERMA stood for Electronic Recording Machine Accounting.

97
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It was a pioneering computer development project run at Stanford Research Institute from 1950 to 1955, under contract with B of A.

98
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:38,000
GE also contracted with National Cash Register Company, NCR, to build the NCR-304 computers.

99
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The ERMA and the NCR-304 were GE's two major computer contracts in the 1950s.

100
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:58,000
GE selected the successful Ampex Corporation as the supplier of the magnetic tape units for these and many other computers in the GE product line.

101
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Throughout its history, GE made significant contributions to the early computing field,

102
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:22,000
including the 1952 ORAC, one of the earliest digital computers, and work on the Dartmouth time-sharing system DTSS in the 1960s.

103
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Ampex Data Systems Corporation, as it is known today, has an extensive and impressive history of technical innovation and influential digital recording products.

104
00:15:40,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Ampex drives were also used in the National Bureau of Standards SEAC computer, the Atlas computer at Chilton, UK, early CDC-1604 computers, and many more.

105
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Merchandise National Bank is proud to be among the first in the nation to install an electronic computer, a General Electric 210 system that can actually read the same information you and I can read.

106
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Components in our system include the reader sorter, a high-speed printer, the magnetic tape units, the central processor, and the control console.

107
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,000
To make sure that we've added just the right amount of iron oxide particles to the line of symbols on Sally's checks and deposit tickets, we test samples on this signal strength machine.

108
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The computer system not only reads information, it records all of the vital details on magnetic tape.

109
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
These ledgers of tomorrow record and store all of the information pertaining to all of the bank's checking accounts.

110
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The tape units operate in much the same way as a home tape recorder, but of course they're much faster.

111
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Information can be recorded on or read from the tape at the rate of 30,000 characters per second, and presents us with the information read from the checks and deposit tickets in numerical order.

112
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Now we're ready to do our daily posting, using the transaction tape which lists checks and deposit tickets in account number order and a master file tape.

113
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The RCA Bismac Computer

114
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The RCA Bismac Computer

115
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:59,000
In 1951 RCA was awarded a military contract to build the Bismac, a large-scale data processing machine.

116
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
RCA was an early entrant into the computer field, using its vast resources in early electronics research and vacuum tube technologies.

117
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It gained an important foothold in the early 1950s.

118
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The first Bismac machine was installed in 1956. The Bismac was a vacuum tube giant.

119
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
A unique design of the Bismac was the use of hundreds of tape drives connected to a central computer.

120
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Permanently mounted tape data could be transferred from tape units immediately, without the need for constant mounting and dismounting individual tapes.

121
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Tape station operators controlled the flow of data to the main computer.

122
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
In 1958 RCA introduced the 501 Electronic Data Processing System.

123
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The RCA 501 was a medium to large-scale computer, utilizing all transistor logic.

124
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
All system operating controls were centralized in a specially designed computer control panel.

125
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The 501 also utilized high-speed magnetic core storage.

126
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The 501 could accommodate up to 63 magnetic tape units.

127
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Other system components included a card punch, card reader, paper tape punch, paper tape reader, typewriter verifier, and other devices.

128
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:55,000
RCA went on to produce other computers such as the 301 and the 601, and the RCA Spectra 70 line of large-scale computers.

129
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
By 1971 however, RCA had experienced millions in losses.

130
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
In September 1971, RCA sold its commercial computer division to Sperry Rand.

131
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The RCA 501 was a large-scale computer.

132
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The RCA 701 was a large-scale computer.

133
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The RCA 701 was a large-scale computer.

134
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The RCA 701 was a large-scale computer.

135
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Music

136
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's a remarkable new polyester film called Mylar.

137
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
High tensile strength, high tear resistance, and high impact strength.

138
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:25,000
In short, Mylar's physical properties make it the strongest of all plastic film under a wide variety of conditions.

139
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Today, Mylar is being widely used because it's the only known base film that meets this ideal.
