31000	40000	Towers of strength, strategic ballistic missiles, armed and ready,
40000	45000	stand guard over our lives and liberties in a threatening world.
45000	52000	Survival may depend upon the ability of a single warhead to reach and destroy its predetermined target.
52000	58000	To deliver that warhead requires a vast complex called a weapon system.
58000	64000	Part of that weapon system is the air vehicle itself, the missile with its nose cone,
64000	69000	the air frame that contains the tons of fuel required for flight,
69000	72000	the precise flight control and guidance packages,
72000	77000	and the mighty rocket engines that boost this missile into the sky,
77000	81000	sustain it in flight and keep it on its course.
81000	85000	Ground support equipment is part of the weapon system too.
85000	92000	There is the launch pad with all its service facilities for fueling, firing, maintenance.
92000	97000	The complex and far-flung ground guidance and tracking installations.
97000	103000	There must be facilities for missile receipt, storage, checkout and issue,
103000	109000	and special purpose missile transport and handling equipment to move them to the launch pad.
109000	114000	These are just a few of the ground support elements that have to be designed, built,
114000	122000	provisioned, installed, maintained and manned if the warhead of this missile is to reach its target.
122000	129000	These are direct support items. Without them, no missile can be launched.
129000	134000	The specially trained officers and airmen who man these direct mission facilities
134000	140000	are also a part, a most important part of the total weapon system.
140000	144000	They have only one goal, operational readiness.
144000	150000	In the launch control room when the red light flashes and the countdown stops,
150000	158000	a missile must stand waiting for the right part in the right place at the right time.
158000	163000	A radically new logistic system can get it there fast.
163000	169000	A hotline from launch control room to missile squadron supply triggers the emergency action.
169000	176000	A specially designated expediter officer takes over. He passes the word to the stock group.
176000	183000	Here only minutes away from the waiting missile on the launch pad are the end products of logistic support management.
183000	191000	Spares, provisioned and kept up to a predetermined stock level are the key to operational readiness.
191000	198000	Only by maintaining a predetermined stock level can each missile squadron be self-sufficient.
198000	203000	Standard procedures speed up the supply routine at the squadron.
203000	207000	The part so urgently needed is located by bin or shelf number.
207000	215000	Already packaged for shipment, it can be quickly selected, checked out and delivered to the waiting expedite vehicle
215000	220000	kept always standing by for the short run to the launch pad.
220000	230000	Average time from malfunction to delivery of a new part, 30 minutes, and maximum allowable time, 60 minutes,
230000	236000	from squadron supply to any launch pad in the strategic missile squadron.
236000	242000	More often than not, the defective component is quickly removable because of modular design.
242000	248000	In this case, it can be immediately returned to squadron maintenance shops for inspection.
249000	258000	An important function of squadron maintenance is to determine by inspection and bench check whether it has the capability to repair the assembly.
258000	269000	If it is judged not squadron repairable, it is shipped immediately and directly from the squadron to a contractor or Air Force depot repair facility.
269000	272000	A simple series of supply transactions.
272000	281000	But without data processing, it could have taken hours or days to record and transmit weeks or months for resupply action.
281000	291000	Now it can be recorded in minutes, transmitted in seconds, and resupply action will be initiated immediately and automatically.
291000	298000	Essential facts of the transactions have been penciled in on pre-printed worksheets called variable data forms.
298000	302000	Now they have reached the skilled key punch operator.
302000	306000	He goes first to the squadron master card file.
306000	312000	In this deck is a card for every direct mission item which supports the weapon system.
312000	319000	These master cards have been code punched before issue with all the fixed data available.
319000	327000	In the key punch machine, all this fixed data is reproduced automatically on the various transaction cards.
327000	332000	Next, the operator punches in the variable data required for each transaction card.
332000	336000	They report on parts issued to the launch site.
336000	340000	The resultant drop in squadron supply stock balances.
340000	346000	Inspection report on the failed part and the repair which is generated.
346000	352000	And the fact, time, and method of its shipment from squadron direct to repair depot.
352000	356000	These carefully registered holes represent reality.
356000	361000	The interaction of human beings and hardware that is called logistics.
361000	365000	To be sure that the story these punched holes will tell is accurate,
365000	372000	they are independently verified in another machine that will reject any discrepancy.
372000	378000	Only now can this basic input that may influence expenditure of millions of dollars
378000	383000	or the effectiveness of our advanced weapon systems go forward from the squadron
383000	386000	to the electronic data processing center.
386000	393000	This input provides the basic information which is refined into logistics support management.
393000	395000	It flows in from many sources.
395000	399000	Missile squadrons, contractors, Air Force depots.
399000	405000	It reports in code each detail of hundreds of different types of transactions.
405000	410000	The key punched cards are fed into a card to tape converter.
410000	415000	Each tape reel stores the information contained on 2,500 cards,
415000	419000	saving space, time, and money.
419000	422000	The tape reels are read by the central processing unit,
422000	426000	the nerve center of this electronic data complex.
426000	431000	Actions taken by the computer depend upon previously prepared programmed instructions
431000	434000	monitored by the computer operator.
434000	439000	To select the proper tape run, the operator need only press a button.
439000	446000	For example, one run can sequentially check stock levels, update the master file,
446000	450000	prepare requisitions for automatic resupply to the squadrons,
450000	453000	schedule damaged assemblies for depot repair,
453000	456000	and set up a suspense file for their return.
456000	459000	All this in a matter of minutes.
460000	465000	To do these things, the computer must have accurate data, carefully prepared.
465000	469000	If the facts are wrong, the machine will give wrong answers.
469000	471000	Take wrong action.
471000	479000	Cards must be correctly punched at the squadron level if logistics support is to work at the management level.
479000	483000	To feed information to this electronic data processing center
483000	488000	requires fast, reliable, versatile communications to each of the squadrons,
488000	493000	so that field transactions can be immediately and fully reported.
493000	497000	Communications run to the weapon system storage site,
497000	503000	so that the Air Force stock from many commodity class depots is available at a single point.
503000	507000	They also run to the contractor storage site at the factory,
507000	514000	so that contractor peculiar items can be resupplied to the squadrons on a source-to-user basis.
515000	519000	Finally, they are installed at maintenance and overhaul facilities,
519000	521000	contractor and Air Force,
521000	527000	so that items to be repaired or modified can be quickly returned to the stockpiles.
527000	531000	Fast, reliable, versatile communications,
531000	536000	transceiver to transmit the punch cards upon which all data is coded,
536000	540000	teletype to send supplemental verbal instructions,
540000	543000	or to clear transceiver circuits for transmission,
543000	548000	telephones for exceptional situations, or standby emergency use.
548000	551000	Together, these form the ComlogNet,
551000	558000	linking the electronic data processing center with every element of the resupply and maintenance cycle.
558000	563000	All this results in greater operational readiness at the launch pad,
563000	566000	smaller stockpiles at the storage site,
566000	570000	faster maintenance, modification and overhaul.
570000	575000	This applies equally to contractor or Air Force storage and maintenance sites,
575000	581000	reduces procurement and inventory, saves money and time.
581000	586000	Speed and accuracy in getting all the facts to the electronic data processing center,
586000	591000	taking action, communicating that action to the right place.
591000	596000	This is the first step in logistic support management.
596000	599000	But now this action must be converted into hardware,
599000	603000	and a hardware must get to where it is needed.
603000	607000	It moves through what logisticians call pipelines.
607000	610000	Several factors influence pipeline time.
610000	614000	It is lengthened when transportation is slow,
614000	617000	shortened if transportation is fast.
617000	622000	When the pipeline is shortened, for example, by fast air transportation,
622000	625000	smaller stockpiles are needed at the storage site.
625000	630000	This cuts down on procurement, inventory and obsolescence.
630000	634000	A shorter pipeline will provide a more effective weapon system,
634000	637000	as well as dollar savings.
637000	640000	Keeping missiles from going out of commission for parts
640000	645000	means greater overall operational readiness at the launch pad.
645000	649000	Electronic data processing keeps pipelines short
649000	653000	by automatically setting up the best routing and packaging,
653000	657000	automatically monitoring and expediting intransit items.
657000	662000	Transportation scheduling is only one of the major processing runs.
662000	668000	These runs provide constant, updated, correlated data on inventory control,
668000	674000	all shipments and receipts, adjusted stock levels, items due in, on order,
674000	680000	in repair or in transit, technical data, current and precise item descriptions,
680000	685000	configuration, the exact items which make up each individual weapon system,
685000	690000	failure analysis, frequency and causes of failures by item,
690000	694000	usage and attrition rates by item,
694000	697000	cataloging the weapon system stock list,
697000	701000	dollar reporting, the current financial status,
701000	707000	and requirements computations, including procurement and provisioning status.
707000	712000	A single complete set of logistic books, using a common coded language,
712000	717000	correlates every logistic support function through electronic data processing.
717000	726000	But it does not eliminate the need for human judgment, human decision, human responsibility.
726000	729000	This is the job of the logistic support manager.
729000	735000	To carry out his mission of timely support and effective management of an advanced weapon system,
735000	742000	he integrates on his staff each of the key logistic functions previously under separate organizations.
742000	747000	Documentation of logistic support management is also integrated.
747000	752000	Weapon managers, contractors and squadrons, separate responsibilities and procedures
752000	755000	are set forth in individual manuals.
755000	764000	Staff officers provide policy input on budget, procurement, transportation, maintenance,
764000	769000	supply and liaison with using commands.
769000	775000	These are combined under one logistic support manager to provide the fully integrated logistic program
775000	785000	that today's and tomorrow's advanced weapon systems must have if they are to get and stay operationally ready.
785000	792000	Electronic data processing takes care of all routine transactions in each of these functional areas.
792000	799000	But the machine also recognizes problems it cannot solve, the exceptional situations.
799000	807000	It calls attention to these problems by making a printout on the high speed printer that is part of the data processing system.
807000	814000	Printouts like these go directly to the manager who can make the decision, take the action needed.
814000	817000	This is a printout on a supply problem.
817000	821000	It goes at once to the item manager, a member of the supply staff.
821000	829000	Decoded, it tells him of the slower consumption rate of an item that had been planned for in initial provisioning.
829000	837000	Other information to aid him in making his decision is also printed out as needed by the electronic data processing center.
837000	843000	Quantities on order, in transit or being repaired.
843000	846000	This is management by exception.
846000	852000	Making decisions based upon electronically processed data but requiring managerial judgment.
852000	861000	These decisions save money by preventing overstocks or ensure operational readiness by maintaining an adequate supply of spares.
861000	872000	Management by exception conserves executive talent by bringing to the manager only those problems the machine has not been programmed to solve automatically.
872000	880000	A different example of management by exception also begins at the electronic data processing center.
880000	887000	This time, a run reveals a failure rate for a given part much higher than the programmed tolerance.
887000	893000	This is printed out by the machine together with a tabulation of the causes of the failure.
893000	900000	The data sheet is delivered to the maintenance manager, another member of the Logistics Support Manager staff.
900000	906000	Starting with this information, he moves to confirm and amplify it by test and analysis.
906000	913000	The kind of expert and specialized knowledge that must come from men, not machines.
913000	923000	To the missile assembly site come the maintenance people from the missile squadron, the contractor's technical representative, the AMC maintenance specialists.
923000	930000	They analyze the fault that is causing failure and determine it to be a design deficiency.
930000	939000	Findings result in further studies by research and development people and by the engineering group on the staff of the Logistics Support Manager.
939000	946000	Their joint recommendation results in an engineering change proposal to correct the design deficiency.
947000	954000	This is monitored by the Chief of Weapons Engineering, another staff officer of the Logistics Support Manager.
954000	963000	This modification, resulting from early computer detection, will reduce the chance of missiles out of commission for parts.
963000	974000	Remedial action began at the electronic data processing center with a printout, but it required human technical skills, human judgments,
975000	983000	to solve this special and complex problem. This is management by exception.
983000	995000	The electronic data processing center has stored on its reels millions of facts constantly updated, about thousands of direct mission items in an advanced weapon system.
996000	999000	How these items got there is a story in itself.
999000	1008000	The story of provisioning, the determination of required spare parts and ground support equipment to make a weapon system operational.
1008000	1020000	Logistics Support Management of advanced weapon systems incorporates new techniques made possible by centralized management control and electronic data processing.
1020000	1028000	These are designed to obtain the greatest dollar mileage for the taxpayer and the most effective support for operational units.
1028000	1036000	To explain them to the contractor, the Logistics Support Manager schedules a provisioning guidance conference.
1036000	1041000	His staff covers such specialized concepts as periodic ordering.
1041000	1052000	This breaks down estimated yearly requirements into quarters or even months, permitting constant re-evaluations on the basis of actual consumption.
1052000	1061000	Production Responsiveness. This calls for the contractor to maintain many items as unassembled parts.
1061000	1068000	These can be rapidly assembled for replacements or used in production if no replacement requirement develops.
1069000	1075000	This is only the beginning of the long, complex and continuing provisioning process.
1075000	1087000	Through provisioning action, the Logistics Support Manager of an advanced weapon system is given a timely, well-documented, flexible stock of direct mission items and spare parts.
1087000	1093000	He manages these through an integrated staff representing each of the logistic functions.
1093000	1100000	Supply in weapon system storage sites, contractor storage sites and squadron supply areas.
1100000	1111000	Maintenance and tech order modifications performed at contractor or Air Force maintenance sites or in the field by squadron maintenance or mobile maintenance teams.
1111000	1120000	Funding and accounting operations, specially geared to the needs of a single Logistics Support Manager and the contractors.
1120000	1130000	Procurement, whether for end items, ground support equipment or spare parts, is also responsive to the Logistics Support Manager's deadlines.
1130000	1141000	Transportation, including specialized packaging and record keeping, will ensure safe arrival within the fixed time set by the Logistics Support Manager.
1141000	1153000	All of these logistic functions are tied together by shorter pipelines. This means smaller inventories, less dollars tied up in spares.
1153000	1160000	Electronic data processing. This means assured and timely support for the missile site.
1160000	1170000	Comlognet communications. This means rapid and versatile data flow from squadrons and storage sites to the electronic data processing center.
1170000	1177000	Here the actions are taken that support the missile on the launch pad.
1177000	1191000	A tower of strength, an advanced weapon system in all its complexity. The ballistic missile, the ground support, the spare parts, the trained men.
1191000	1198000	It must be ready. Logistics Support Management makes and keeps it that way.
1221000	1225000	Logistics Support Management
