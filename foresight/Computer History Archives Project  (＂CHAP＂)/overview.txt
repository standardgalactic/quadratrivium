1. **Ampex Data Systems Corporation**: A pioneering company in technical innovation, particularly known for its digital recording products and magnetic tape drives used in various computers throughout the 1960s, including systems at the National Bureau of Standards, Atlas computer at Chilton, UK, and early CDC-1604 computers.

2. **Merchandise National Bank**: One of the first banks to install an electronic computer, a General Electric 210 system, capable of reading information that humans can read, in the late 1950s or early 1960s. The system included reader-sorters, high-speed printers, magnetic tape units, a central processor, and a control console. It ensured the accuracy of information by testing for signal strength and recorded all banking details on magnetic tape.

3. **RCA's Early Computing Efforts**: RCA was an early computer developer with significant contributions in the 1950s. The company built the Bismac, a large-scale data processing machine using vacuum tubes, for military purposes. In 1956, the first Bismac was installed. It featured a unique design with hundreds of tape drives connected to a central computer and a transistor-based successor, the RCA 501, in 1958. The 501 could accommodate up to 63 magnetic tape units and used high-speed magnetic core storage. RCA continued with the 301 and 601, leading to the RCA Spectra 700 line of computers. However, by 1971, RCA had incurred significant losses and sold its computer division to Sperry Rand.

4. **Mylar**: A strong polyester film produced by DuPont, known for its high tensile strength, tear resistance, impact strength, and versatility. It is used extensively due to its durability and allows for more tape on a standard reel. Mylar is also used in fashion for metallic yarns that are strong, non-tarnishable, and can withstand washing, dry cleaning, and pressing.

In summary, Ampex Data Systems Corporation was a leader in digital recording technology and magnetic tape innovation, while RCA was an early innovator in computing with the Bismac and subsequent models like the 501. Mylar, a product of DuPont, gained recognition for its exceptional physical properties and applications across various industries, including computing and fashion.

 Logistics Support Management (LSM) for an advanced weapon system like a ballistic missile is a comprehensive approach to ensure the system is operational and supported throughout its lifecycle. This involves a centralized management control system that utilizes electronic data processing (EDP) to monitor and manage the supply chain, maintenance, and technical support effectively. The key aspects of LSM include:

1. **Provisioning**: Estimating yearly requirements for spare parts and ground support equipment, and breaking these down into quarters or even months to allow for constant re-evaluation based on actual consumption. This approach allows for flexibility in stock levels and responsiveness to changes in demand.

2. **Production Responsiveness**: Encouraging contractors to maintain unassembled parts that can be quickly assembled for replacements or used in production if needed, ensuring rapid response to replacement requirements.

3. **Management by Exception**: EDP systems identify irregularities such as high failure rates of parts, which are then flagged for human analysis and decision-making. This process conserves executive talent by focusing attention only on those issues that cannot be resolved by automated systems.

4. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: LSM involves various logistic functions working together, including supply management, maintenance, tech order modifications, funding and accounting, procurement, transportation, and communication. These functions are streamlined to reduce inventories and improve the efficiency of support to the weapon system.

5. **Data Processing Center (DPC)**: The DPC plays a crucial role in LSM by storing and updating vast amounts of data on direct mission items, analyzing consumption patterns, and generating reports that inform decision-making across the logistic spectrum.

6. **Communication Systems (Comlognet)**: Effective communication channels are essential for timely exchange of information between squadrons, storage sites, and the DPC.

7. **Training and Expertise**: The success of LSM also relies on trained personnel who can perform maintenance, analyze data, and make expert judgments when necessary to solve complex problems.

8. **Responsive Funding and Procurement**: Procurement processes are responsive to the Logistics Support Manager's deadlines, ensuring that funds and resources are allocated efficiently to meet the weapon system's needs.

9. **Transportation Management**: Specialized packaging and record-keeping in transportation ensure that spare parts and equipment arrive safely and on time at their destinations.

In summary, Logistics Support Management for advanced weapon systems is a dynamic and integrated process that leverages technology to optimize supply chain management, maintenance, and support operations, ultimately ensuring the readiness and effectiveness of the weapon system in the field.

1. **Computer Components**: The personal computer (PC) is made up of several components, including the Central Processing Unit (CPU), the monitor, the keyboard, and peripherals like printers.

2. **Connection Setup**: A PC needs to be connected to other devices and possibly a network. This can include connecting the monitor, printer, modem, and external storage devices.

3. **Understanding Technology**: Key concepts include RAM (Random Access Memory), ROM (Read-Only Memory), and the hard drive, which stores your operating system and data.

4. **Operating Systems**: The most common is DOS (Disk Operating System), but with Windows, users can interact with their computers through a graphical user interface.

5. **Data Management**: In DOS, you manage files and directories, which act as containers for files or other directories within the hard drive or floppy disks.

6. **Backing Up Data**: It's crucial to regularly back up your data to prevent loss in case of a system failure. This can be done by copying files onto floppies or using a tape drive.

7. **Software Needs**: Depending on your needs, you might use word processing programs like Word Perfect or Microsoft Word, databases like D-Base, FoxPro, or Paradox, spreadsheets like Lotus or Excel, financial software like Quicken, and desktop publishing tools like PageMaker or Ventura Publisher.

8. **Educational and Entertainment Software**: PCs can also be used for educational purposes, to learn new skills, or simply for entertainment, including games.

9. **Safety Measures**: Always remember to protect your computer and data from potential threats like power surges, and ensure that your data is backed up regularly.

10. **Memorax Support**: Memorax offers a wide range of products tailored for computer users, and their video library can provide further assistance and guidance on various computing topics.

In essence, the videotape provides an overview of what you need to know to get started with your PC, from understanding its components and how they work, to the types of software you'll use, and tips for maintaining and protecting your system.
