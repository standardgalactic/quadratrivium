00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The following video is produced by the Computer History Archives Project.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
IBM, at Harvard University, unveiled the Mark I with 1,600 digits of internal storage.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Remarkable technological achievement of its time,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
opening the way to an ever-quickening series of developments

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
as man sought new ways to extend the power of his mind.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Two decades of progress.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Electronic tubes replace the electric relay as the computer's basic circuitry.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
New components.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
New computers.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
New systems.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Progress.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Transistors.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Greater computing power.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The result of intensive search.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And in IBM, the search has continued,

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
new and better ways to meet the information challenges of today and tomorrow.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It has been a search for a system with more power,

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
input-output versatility, communications capability,

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
a system using advanced technology, high reliability, and massive memory.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A system that lets you grow without reprogramming.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
One system to meet every application need.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Today, IBM brings you that system.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is System 360.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And so is this.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And this.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And this.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A single system featuring unprecedented performance range.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
New micro-electronic circuitry.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Over 8 million characters of core storage.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Encompassing the needs of science, industry, business, and government.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
System 360 starts in the world of the super small.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is IBM's new solid logic technology in production.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Micro-electronic circuits.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
More contact.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Making possible faster, logical decisions than ever before.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The product of years of process.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
From electric relays, we advanced to vacuum tubes.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then computer circuits were transistorized.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But as the speed of components increased,

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the distance electricity had to travel between them became a critical factor.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So IBM cut the distance.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
A new technology with virtually no significant distance between components.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Micro-electronics.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Solid logic technology begins in this fiery crucible.

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Pure silicon growing silently.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Perfectly.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The silicon is sliced into thousands of wafers.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Each the size of a half dollar.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
In the strange glow of a safe light,

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:25,000
photosensitive material is swirled over the silicon wafers.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
A beam of ultraviolet light transfers a pattern of transistors or diodes

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
to the polished wafers surface.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Step by step, the process unfolds.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Photography, etching, cleaning.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A marriage of the graphic arts with electronics.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
In glowing gas diffusion furnaces,

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
the silicon of the wafers takes on its electrical characteristics.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Copper pellets, five thousandths of an inch in diameter,

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
become the contact points for each transistor or diode.

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Now each pellet is in position.

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now each is checked.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The wafer is ready for cutting.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The wafer is diced into eleven hundred chips.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Each twenty-eight thousandths of an inch square.

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The world of microelectronics in which fifty thousand transistors overflow a thimble.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
These half inch squares are called substrates.

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Circuit patterns are being printed on them.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The metallic inks are baked onto the substrates.

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thousands of tiny pins.

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Twelve will be placed in each substrate.

71
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Later they will connect the completed circuits to a card.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Circuit resistors are trimmed to precise electrical levels.

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
My new jets of sand do the job.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And the bath of molten solder ensures each electrical connection.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Meanwhile, each tiny transistor and diode has been tested.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Now the two basic elements of solid logic technology,

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
chips and substrates, meet to form a circuit.

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:05,000
As many as six of the active elements are placed precisely on a single circuit.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The module receives one protective coat and another.

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Solid logic technology, a new direction in data processing.

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Faster, smaller, more reliable.

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It takes its place in system 360, beside other new developments, new advances,

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
memory, the basic power of the computer, distinguishing it from other calculating devices,

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
making possible the versatility of the stored program.

85
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Until today, there have been severe limitations on the amount of core storage available to a computer user.

86
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Today, IBM shatters the memory barrier.

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
System 360 makes available core storage in the size you need,

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
from 8,000 to more than 8 million characters, 8 million.

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Each character directly addressable.

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Tiny magnetic cores are positioned in a vibrating platform

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and strung with wires that carry electronic impulses.

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Bits of information packed more closely together, more quickly available.

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is a System 360 memory array, 64,000 characters of storage.

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If you need less, start with the basic 8,000.

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Need more? Add arrays to provide 128,000 characters of storage,

96
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
or 256,000, or 512,000.

97
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Compact, fast.

98
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
In System 360, there is a hierarchy of memories,

99
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
small control memories, billions of a second,

100
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
main memories, at a millionth of a second,

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and a unique development, large capacity memory,

102
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
2 million characters in an array, 8 million in a single configuration,

103
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
directly addressed at microsecond speeds.

104
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Unprecedented core storage that dramatically improves throughput,

105
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
that lets you do the big jobs in less time,

106
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
more effectively, that gives you more useful answers for your dollar.

107
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Memory power, System 360.

108
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Another new concept in System 360, power for growth.

109
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Single system growth.

110
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Processors that offer many speeds, memory sizes, features.

111
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Select what you need to do your job best.

112
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You can start small, and without reprogramming, you can grow.

113
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And grow.

114
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And grow to multiprocessor systems.

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Every processor with an identical instruction said,

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
growth without reprogramming.

117
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
One modular operating system,

118
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
programming support for all configurations,

119
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
control programs, regulating job flow,

120
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
handling message traffic,

121
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
assigning programs to available storage,

122
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
non-stop computing, control programs,

123
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
programming languages, service programs,

124
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
for lower job costs to speed the flow of work,

125
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
all kinds of work,

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
for commercial applications,

127
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
decimal operation, variable record lengths,

128
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
input output capability,

129
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
for centralized filing, customer data services,

130
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
for scientific problem solving,

131
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
full binary operation, fixed and floating point arithmetic,

132
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
massive memory and file capacity,

133
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
high energy physics, the life sciences, real time simulation.

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
System 360 can handle them all.

135
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Decimal and binary, commercial and scientific,

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
they're all the same to System 360.

137
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But no system is better than its ability to get information in and out.

138
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Input output capability, System 360 has it.

139
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Peripheral devices linked to powerful data channels,

140
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
up to 1,200,000 characters a second, real channel power.

141
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
New tape drives with the performance you need,

142
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
ranging in speed from 22,500 characters a second to 90,000,

143
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and up to 340,000 characters a second.

144
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Printers that deliver up to 1,400 lines a minute,

145
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
high speed optical and magnetic character readers,

146
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and 1,000 characters a second paper tape reader.

147
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Card processing to cover the full range of your applications.

148
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
enough for the complete inventory records of a large wholesale grocery,

153
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
bigger disc storage for greater online capacity,

154
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000

enough for the policy records of a large insurance company,

158
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
enough for your records.

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Your records, available when and where needed,

160
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
available in the computer room or 3,000 miles away.

161
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
System 360 makes them available.

162
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Link hundreds of remote terminals to one multiplex channel,

163
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and then a central installation becomes the hub of a nationwide network,

164
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and does your regular processing at the same time.

165
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
For your communication job, System 360 has the terminals.

166
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000

175
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
to put any remote location in direct contact with your System 360.

176
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
For railroad car accounting, for updating inventory,

177
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
