1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Towers of strength, strategic ballistic missiles, armed and ready,

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
stand guard over our lives and liberties in a threatening world.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Survival may depend upon the ability of a single warhead to reach and destroy its predetermined target.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
To deliver that warhead requires a vast complex called a weapon system.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Part of that weapon system is the air vehicle itself, the missile with its nose cone,

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the air frame that contains the tons of fuel required for flight,

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the precise flight control and guidance packages,

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and the mighty rocket engines that boost this missile into the sky,

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
sustain it in flight and keep it on its course.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Ground support equipment is part of the weapon system too.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There is the launch pad with all its service facilities for fueling, firing, maintenance.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The complex and far-flung ground guidance and tracking installations.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There must be facilities for missile receipt, storage, checkout and issue,

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and special purpose missile transport and handling equipment to move them to the launch pad.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
These are just a few of the ground support elements that have to be designed, built,

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
provisioned, installed, maintained and manned if the warhead of this missile is to reach its target.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
These are direct support items. Without them, no missile can be launched.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The specially trained officers and airmen who man these direct mission facilities

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
are also a part, a most important part of the total weapon system.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They have only one goal, operational readiness.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In the launch control room when the red light flashes and the countdown stops,

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
a missile must stand waiting for the right part in the right place at the right time.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A radically new logistic system can get it there fast.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A hotline from launch control room to missile squadron supply triggers the emergency action.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
A specially designated expediter officer takes over. He passes the word to the stock group.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Here only minutes away from the waiting missile on the launch pad are the end products of logistic support management.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Spares, provisioned and kept up to a predetermined stock level are the key to operational readiness.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Only by maintaining a predetermined stock level can each missile squadron be self-sufficient.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Standard procedures speed up the supply routine at the squadron.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The part so urgently needed is located by bin or shelf number.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Already packaged for shipment, it can be quickly selected, checked out and delivered to the waiting expedite vehicle

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
kept always standing by for the short run to the launch pad.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Average time from malfunction to delivery of a new part, 30 minutes, and maximum allowable time, 60 minutes,

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
from squadron supply to any launch pad in the strategic missile squadron.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
More often than not, the defective component is quickly removable because of modular design.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
In this case, it can be immediately returned to squadron maintenance shops for inspection.

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
An important function of squadron maintenance is to determine by inspection and bench check whether it has the capability to repair the assembly.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If it is judged not squadron repairable, it is shipped immediately and directly from the squadron to a contractor or Air Force depot repair facility.

40
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
A simple series of supply transactions.

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But without data processing, it could have taken hours or days to record and transmit weeks or months for resupply action.

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now it can be recorded in minutes, transmitted in seconds, and resupply action will be initiated immediately and automatically.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Essential facts of the transactions have been penciled in on pre-printed worksheets called variable data forms.

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now they have reached the skilled key punch operator.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He goes first to the squadron master card file.

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In this deck is a card for every direct mission item which supports the weapon system.

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
These master cards have been code punched before issue with all the fixed data available.

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
In the key punch machine, all this fixed data is reproduced automatically on the various transaction cards.

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Next, the operator punches in the variable data required for each transaction card.

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
They report on parts issued to the launch site.

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The resultant drop in squadron supply stock balances.

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Inspection report on the failed part and the repair which is generated.

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And the fact, time, and method of its shipment from squadron direct to repair depot.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
These carefully registered holes represent reality.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The interaction of human beings and hardware that is called logistics.

56
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
To be sure that the story these punched holes will tell is accurate,

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
they are independently verified in another machine that will reject any discrepancy.

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Only now can this basic input that may influence expenditure of millions of dollars

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
or the effectiveness of our advanced weapon systems go forward from the squadron

60
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to the electronic data processing center.

61
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This input provides the basic information which is refined into logistics support management.

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It flows in from many sources.

63
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Missile squadrons, contractors, Air Force depots.

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It reports in code each detail of hundreds of different types of transactions.

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The key punched cards are fed into a card to tape converter.

66
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Each tape reel stores the information contained on 2,500 cards,

67
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
saving space, time, and money.

68
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The tape reels are read by the central processing unit,

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the nerve center of this electronic data complex.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Actions taken by the computer depend upon previously prepared programmed instructions

71
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
monitored by the computer operator.

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
To select the proper tape run, the operator need only press a button.

73
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
For example, one run can sequentially check stock levels, update the master file,

74
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
prepare requisitions for automatic resupply to the squadrons,

75
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
schedule damaged assemblies for depot repair,

76
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and set up a suspense file for their return.

77
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
All this in a matter of minutes.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
To do these things, the computer must have accurate data, carefully prepared.

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If the facts are wrong, the machine will give wrong answers.

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Take wrong action.

81
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Cards must be correctly punched at the squadron level if logistics support is to work at the management level.

82
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
To feed information to this electronic data processing center

83
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
requires fast, reliable, versatile communications to each of the squadrons,

84
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
so that field transactions can be immediately and fully reported.

85
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Communications run to the weapon system storage site,

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
so that the Air Force stock from many commodity class depots is available at a single point.

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They also run to the contractor storage site at the factory,

88
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
so that contractor peculiar items can be resupplied to the squadrons on a source-to-user basis.

89
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Finally, they are installed at maintenance and overhaul facilities,

90
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
contractor and Air Force,

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
so that items to be repaired or modified can be quickly returned to the stockpiles.

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Fast, reliable, versatile communications,

93
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
transceiver to transmit the punch cards upon which all data is coded,

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
teletype to send supplemental verbal instructions,

95
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
or to clear transceiver circuits for transmission,

96
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
telephones for exceptional situations, or standby emergency use.

97
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Together, these form the ComlogNet,

98
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
linking the electronic data processing center with every element of the resupply and maintenance cycle.

99
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
All this results in greater operational readiness at the launch pad,

100
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
smaller stockpiles at the storage site,

101
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
faster maintenance, modification and overhaul.

102
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This applies equally to contractor or Air Force storage and maintenance sites,

103
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
reduces procurement and inventory, saves money and time.

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Speed and accuracy in getting all the facts to the electronic data processing center,

105
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
taking action, communicating that action to the right place.

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is the first step in logistic support management.

107
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But now this action must be converted into hardware,

108
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and a hardware must get to where it is needed.

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It moves through what logisticians call pipelines.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Several factors influence pipeline time.

111
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It is lengthened when transportation is slow,

112
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
shortened if transportation is fast.

113
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
When the pipeline is shortened, for example, by fast air transportation,

114
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
smaller stockpiles are needed at the storage site.

115
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This cuts down on procurement, inventory and obsolescence.

116
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
A shorter pipeline will provide a more effective weapon system,

117
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
as well as dollar savings.

118
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Keeping missiles from going out of commission for parts

119
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
means greater overall operational readiness at the launch pad.

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Electronic data processing keeps pipelines short

121
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
by automatically setting up the best routing and packaging,

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
automatically monitoring and expediting intransit items.

123
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Transportation scheduling is only one of the major processing runs.

124
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
These runs provide constant, updated, correlated data on inventory control,

125
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
all shipments and receipts, adjusted stock levels, items due in, on order,

126
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
in repair or in transit, technical data, current and precise item descriptions,

127
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
configuration, the exact items which make up each individual weapon system,

128
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
failure analysis, frequency and causes of failures by item,

129
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
usage and attrition rates by item,

130
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
cataloging the weapon system stock list,

131
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
dollar reporting, the current financial status,

132
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and requirements computations, including procurement and provisioning status.

133
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A single complete set of logistic books, using a common coded language,

134
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
correlates every logistic support function through electronic data processing.

135
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But it does not eliminate the need for human judgment, human decision, human responsibility.

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is the job of the logistic support manager.

137
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
To carry out his mission of timely support and effective management of an advanced weapon system,

138
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
he integrates on his staff each of the key logistic functions previously under separate organizations.

139
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Documentation of logistic support management is also integrated.

140
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Weapon managers, contractors and squadrons, separate responsibilities and procedures

141
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
are set forth in individual manuals.

142
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Staff officers provide policy input on budget, procurement, transportation, maintenance,

143
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
supply and liaison with using commands.

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
These are combined under one logistic support manager to provide the fully integrated logistic program

145
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:05,000
that today's and tomorrow's advanced weapon systems must have if they are to get and stay operationally ready.

146
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Electronic data processing takes care of all routine transactions in each of these functional areas.

147
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But the machine also recognizes problems it cannot solve, the exceptional situations.

148
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It calls attention to these problems by making a printout on the high speed printer that is part of the data processing system.

149
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Printouts like these go directly to the manager who can make the decision, take the action needed.

150
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is a printout on a supply problem.

151
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It goes at once to the item manager, a member of the supply staff.

152
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Decoded, it tells him of the slower consumption rate of an item that had been planned for in initial provisioning.

153
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Other information to aid him in making his decision is also printed out as needed by the electronic data processing center.

154
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Quantities on order, in transit or being repaired.

155
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is management by exception.

156
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Making decisions based upon electronically processed data but requiring managerial judgment.

157
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:21,000
These decisions save money by preventing overstocks or ensure operational readiness by maintaining an adequate supply of spares.

158
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Management by exception conserves executive talent by bringing to the manager only those problems the machine has not been programmed to solve automatically.

159
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
A different example of management by exception also begins at the electronic data processing center.

160
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
This time, a run reveals a failure rate for a given part much higher than the programmed tolerance.

161
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This is printed out by the machine together with a tabulation of the causes of the failure.

162
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The data sheet is delivered to the maintenance manager, another member of the Logistics Support Manager staff.

163
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Starting with this information, he moves to confirm and amplify it by test and analysis.

164
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The kind of expert and specialized knowledge that must come from men, not machines.

165
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:23,000
To the missile assembly site come the maintenance people from the missile squadron, the contractor's technical representative, the AMC maintenance specialists.

166
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
They analyze the fault that is causing failure and determine it to be a design deficiency.

167
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Findings result in further studies by research and development people and by the engineering group on the staff of the Logistics Support Manager.

168
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Their joint recommendation results in an engineering change proposal to correct the design deficiency.

169
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This is monitored by the Chief of Weapons Engineering, another staff officer of the Logistics Support Manager.

170
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:03,000
This modification, resulting from early computer detection, will reduce the chance of missiles out of commission for parts.

171
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Remedial action began at the electronic data processing center with a printout, but it required human technical skills, human judgments,

172
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
to solve this special and complex problem. This is management by exception.

173
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The electronic data processing center has stored on its reels millions of facts constantly updated, about thousands of direct mission items in an advanced weapon system.

174
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
How these items got there is a story in itself.

175
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The story of provisioning, the determination of required spare parts and ground support equipment to make a weapon system operational.

176
00:16:48,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Logistics Support Management of advanced weapon systems incorporates new techniques made possible by centralized management control and electronic data processing.

177
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,000
These are designed to obtain the greatest dollar mileage for the taxpayer and the most effective support for operational units.

178
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:16,000
To explain them to the contractor, the Logistics Support Manager schedules a provisioning guidance conference.

179
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
His staff covers such specialized concepts as periodic ordering.

180
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This breaks down estimated yearly requirements into quarters or even months, permitting constant re-evaluations on the basis of actual consumption.

181
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Production Responsiveness. This calls for the contractor to maintain many items as unassembled parts.

182
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
These can be rapidly assembled for replacements or used in production if no replacement requirement develops.

183
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This is only the beginning of the long, complex and continuing provisioning process.

184
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Through provisioning action, the Logistics Support Manager of an advanced weapon system is given a timely, well-documented, flexible stock of direct mission items and spare parts.

185
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
He manages these through an integrated staff representing each of the logistic functions.

186
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Supply in weapon system storage sites, contractor storage sites and squadron supply areas.

187
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Maintenance and tech order modifications performed at contractor or Air Force maintenance sites or in the field by squadron maintenance or mobile maintenance teams.

188
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Funding and accounting operations, specially geared to the needs of a single Logistics Support Manager and the contractors.

189
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Procurement, whether for end items, ground support equipment or spare parts, is also responsive to the Logistics Support Manager's deadlines.

190
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Transportation, including specialized packaging and record keeping, will ensure safe arrival within the fixed time set by the Logistics Support Manager.

191
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:13,000
All of these logistic functions are tied together by shorter pipelines. This means smaller inventories, less dollars tied up in spares.

192
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Electronic data processing. This means assured and timely support for the missile site.

193
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Comlognet communications. This means rapid and versatile data flow from squadrons and storage sites to the electronic data processing center.

194
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Here the actions are taken that support the missile on the launch pad.

195
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:51,000
A tower of strength, an advanced weapon system in all its complexity. The ballistic missile, the ground support, the spare parts, the trained men.

196
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It must be ready. Logistics Support Management makes and keeps it that way.

197
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Logistics Support Management
