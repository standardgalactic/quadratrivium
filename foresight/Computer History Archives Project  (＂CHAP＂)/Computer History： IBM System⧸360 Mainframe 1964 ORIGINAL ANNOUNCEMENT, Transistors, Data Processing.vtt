00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
The following video is produced by the Computer History Archives Project.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.000
IBM, at Harvard University, unveiled the Mark I with 1,600 digits of internal storage.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Remarkable technological achievement of its time,

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
opening the way to an ever-quickening series of developments

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
as man sought new ways to extend the power of his mind.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Two decades of progress.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Electronic tubes replace the electric relay as the computer's basic circuitry.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
New components.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
New computers.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
New systems.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Progress.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Transistors.

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
Greater computing power.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
The result of intensive search.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And in IBM, the search has continued,

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
new and better ways to meet the information challenges of today and tomorrow.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
It has been a search for a system with more power,

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
input-output versatility, communications capability,

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
a system using advanced technology, high reliability, and massive memory.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
A system that lets you grow without reprogramming.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
One system to meet every application need.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Today, IBM brings you that system.

02:05.000 --> 02:13.000
This is System 360.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
And so is this.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
And this.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
And this.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
A single system featuring unprecedented performance range.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
New micro-electronic circuitry.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Over 8 million characters of core storage.

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
Encompassing the needs of science, industry, business, and government.

02:41.000 --> 02:48.000
System 360 starts in the world of the super small.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
This is IBM's new solid logic technology in production.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Micro-electronic circuits.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
More contact.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
Making possible faster, logical decisions than ever before.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
The product of years of process.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
From electric relays, we advanced to vacuum tubes.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
Then computer circuits were transistorized.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
But as the speed of components increased,

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
the distance electricity had to travel between them became a critical factor.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
So IBM cut the distance.

03:31.000 --> 03:38.000
A new technology with virtually no significant distance between components.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
Micro-electronics.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
Solid logic technology begins in this fiery crucible.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Pure silicon growing silently.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Perfectly.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
The silicon is sliced into thousands of wafers.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Each the size of a half dollar.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
In the strange glow of a safe light,

04:06.000 --> 04:25.000
photosensitive material is swirled over the silicon wafers.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
A beam of ultraviolet light transfers a pattern of transistors or diodes

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
to the polished wafers surface.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Step by step, the process unfolds.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Photography, etching, cleaning.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.000
A marriage of the graphic arts with electronics.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
In glowing gas diffusion furnaces,

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
the silicon of the wafers takes on its electrical characteristics.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
Copper pellets, five thousandths of an inch in diameter,

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
become the contact points for each transistor or diode.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
Now each pellet is in position.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Now each is checked.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
The wafer is ready for cutting.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
The wafer is diced into eleven hundred chips.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
Each twenty-eight thousandths of an inch square.

05:29.000 --> 05:44.000
The world of microelectronics in which fifty thousand transistors overflow a thimble.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
These half inch squares are called substrates.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
Circuit patterns are being printed on them.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
The metallic inks are baked onto the substrates.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Thousands of tiny pins.

06:03.000 --> 06:15.000
Twelve will be placed in each substrate.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
Later they will connect the completed circuits to a card.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Circuit resistors are trimmed to precise electrical levels.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
My new jets of sand do the job.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
And the bath of molten solder ensures each electrical connection.

06:35.000 --> 06:46.000
Meanwhile, each tiny transistor and diode has been tested.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Now the two basic elements of solid logic technology,

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
chips and substrates, meet to form a circuit.

06:55.000 --> 07:05.000
As many as six of the active elements are placed precisely on a single circuit.

07:05.000 --> 07:12.000
The module receives one protective coat and another.

07:12.000 --> 07:20.000
Solid logic technology, a new direction in data processing.

07:20.000 --> 07:32.000
Faster, smaller, more reliable.

07:32.000 --> 07:40.000
It takes its place in system 360, beside other new developments, new advances,

07:40.000 --> 07:48.000
memory, the basic power of the computer, distinguishing it from other calculating devices,

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
making possible the versatility of the stored program.

07:53.000 --> 08:01.000
Until today, there have been severe limitations on the amount of core storage available to a computer user.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
Today, IBM shatters the memory barrier.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
System 360 makes available core storage in the size you need,

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
from 8,000 to more than 8 million characters, 8 million.

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
Each character directly addressable.

08:27.000 --> 08:38.000
Tiny magnetic cores are positioned in a vibrating platform

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
and strung with wires that carry electronic impulses.

08:43.000 --> 08:52.000
Bits of information packed more closely together, more quickly available.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
This is a System 360 memory array, 64,000 characters of storage.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
If you need less, start with the basic 8,000.

09:03.000 --> 09:10.000
Need more? Add arrays to provide 128,000 characters of storage,

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
or 256,000, or 512,000.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Compact, fast.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
In System 360, there is a hierarchy of memories,

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
small control memories, billions of a second,

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
main memories, at a millionth of a second,

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
and a unique development, large capacity memory,

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
2 million characters in an array, 8 million in a single configuration,

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
directly addressed at microsecond speeds.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Unprecedented core storage that dramatically improves throughput,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
that lets you do the big jobs in less time,

09:58.000 --> 10:05.000
more effectively, that gives you more useful answers for your dollar.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
Memory power, System 360.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
Another new concept in System 360, power for growth.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Single system growth.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
Processors that offer many speeds, memory sizes, features.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
Select what you need to do your job best.

10:28.000 --> 10:37.000
You can start small, and without reprogramming, you can grow.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
And grow.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
And grow to multiprocessor systems.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
Every processor with an identical instruction said,

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
growth without reprogramming.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
One modular operating system,

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
programming support for all configurations,

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
control programs, regulating job flow,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
handling message traffic,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
assigning programs to available storage,

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
non-stop computing, control programs,

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
programming languages, service programs,

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
for lower job costs to speed the flow of work,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
all kinds of work,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
for commercial applications,

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
decimal operation, variable record lengths,

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
input output capability,

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
for centralized filing, customer data services,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
for scientific problem solving,

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
full binary operation, fixed and floating point arithmetic,

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
massive memory and file capacity,

11:52.000 --> 11:58.000
high energy physics, the life sciences, real time simulation.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
System 360 can handle them all.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Decimal and binary, commercial and scientific,

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
they're all the same to System 360.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
But no system is better than its ability to get information in and out.

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
Input output capability, System 360 has it.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
Peripheral devices linked to powerful data channels,

12:25.000 --> 12:31.000
up to 1,200,000 characters a second, real channel power.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
New tape drives with the performance you need,

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
ranging in speed from 22,500 characters a second to 90,000,

Printers that deliver up to 1,400 lines a minute,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
high speed optical and magnetic character readers,

12:52.000 --> 12:57.000
and 1,000 characters a second paper tape reader.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
Card processing to cover the full range of your applications.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
System 360 has the direct access files for your every need.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000

enough for your records.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
Your records, available when and where needed,

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
available in the computer room or 3,000 miles away.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
System 360 makes them available.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Link hundreds of remote terminals to one multiplex channel,

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
and then a central installation becomes the hub of a nationwide network,

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
and does your regular processing at the same time.

14:21.000 --> 14:27.000
For your communication job, System 360 has the terminals.
