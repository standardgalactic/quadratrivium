0	7000	The following video is produced by the Computer History Archives Project.
30000	41000	IBM, at Harvard University, unveiled the Mark I with 1,600 digits of internal storage.
41000	45000	Remarkable technological achievement of its time,
45000	49000	opening the way to an ever-quickening series of developments
49000	55000	as man sought new ways to extend the power of his mind.
55000	58000	Two decades of progress.
58000	64000	Electronic tubes replace the electric relay as the computer's basic circuitry.
64000	66000	New components.
66000	68000	New computers.
68000	70000	New systems.
70000	72000	Progress.
72000	74000	Transistors.
74000	77000	Greater computing power.
77000	80000	The result of intensive search.
80000	84000	And in IBM, the search has continued,
84000	91000	new and better ways to meet the information challenges of today and tomorrow.
91000	95000	It has been a search for a system with more power,
95000	101000	input-output versatility, communications capability,
101000	108000	a system using advanced technology, high reliability, and massive memory.
108000	113000	A system that lets you grow without reprogramming.
113000	119000	One system to meet every application need.
119000	125000	Today, IBM brings you that system.
125000	133000	This is System 360.
133000	135000	And so is this.
135000	137000	And this.
137000	139000	And this.
139000	144000	A single system featuring unprecedented performance range.
144000	147000	New micro-electronic circuitry.
147000	152000	Over 8 million characters of core storage.
152000	161000	Encompassing the needs of science, industry, business, and government.
161000	168000	System 360 starts in the world of the super small.
168000	174000	This is IBM's new solid logic technology in production.
174000	176000	Micro-electronic circuits.
176000	178000	More contact.
178000	184000	Making possible faster, logical decisions than ever before.
184000	188000	The product of years of process.
188000	192000	From electric relays, we advanced to vacuum tubes.
192000	196000	Then computer circuits were transistorized.
196000	199000	But as the speed of components increased,
199000	206000	the distance electricity had to travel between them became a critical factor.
206000	211000	So IBM cut the distance.
211000	218000	A new technology with virtually no significant distance between components.
218000	222000	Micro-electronics.
222000	228000	Solid logic technology begins in this fiery crucible.
228000	232000	Pure silicon growing silently.
232000	235000	Perfectly.
235000	239000	The silicon is sliced into thousands of wafers.
239000	243000	Each the size of a half dollar.
243000	246000	In the strange glow of a safe light,
246000	265000	photosensitive material is swirled over the silicon wafers.
265000	271000	A beam of ultraviolet light transfers a pattern of transistors or diodes
271000	277000	to the polished wafers surface.
277000	281000	Step by step, the process unfolds.
281000	286000	Photography, etching, cleaning.
286000	293000	A marriage of the graphic arts with electronics.
293000	296000	In glowing gas diffusion furnaces,
296000	301000	the silicon of the wafers takes on its electrical characteristics.
301000	305000	Copper pellets, five thousandths of an inch in diameter,
305000	310000	become the contact points for each transistor or diode.
310000	314000	Now each pellet is in position.
314000	317000	Now each is checked.
317000	321000	The wafer is ready for cutting.
321000	325000	The wafer is diced into eleven hundred chips.
325000	329000	Each twenty-eight thousandths of an inch square.
329000	344000	The world of microelectronics in which fifty thousand transistors overflow a thimble.
344000	348000	These half inch squares are called substrates.
348000	354000	Circuit patterns are being printed on them.
354000	360000	The metallic inks are baked onto the substrates.
360000	363000	Thousands of tiny pins.
363000	375000	Twelve will be placed in each substrate.
375000	380000	Later they will connect the completed circuits to a card.
380000	384000	Circuit resistors are trimmed to precise electrical levels.
384000	388000	My new jets of sand do the job.
388000	395000	And the bath of molten solder ensures each electrical connection.
395000	406000	Meanwhile, each tiny transistor and diode has been tested.
406000	410000	Now the two basic elements of solid logic technology,
410000	415000	chips and substrates, meet to form a circuit.
415000	425000	As many as six of the active elements are placed precisely on a single circuit.
425000	432000	The module receives one protective coat and another.
432000	440000	Solid logic technology, a new direction in data processing.
440000	452000	Faster, smaller, more reliable.
452000	460000	It takes its place in system 360, beside other new developments, new advances,
460000	468000	memory, the basic power of the computer, distinguishing it from other calculating devices,
468000	473000	making possible the versatility of the stored program.
473000	481000	Until today, there have been severe limitations on the amount of core storage available to a computer user.
481000	487000	Today, IBM shatters the memory barrier.
487000	492000	System 360 makes available core storage in the size you need,
492000	499000	from 8,000 to more than 8 million characters, 8 million.
499000	507000	Each character directly addressable.
507000	518000	Tiny magnetic cores are positioned in a vibrating platform
518000	523000	and strung with wires that carry electronic impulses.
523000	532000	Bits of information packed more closely together, more quickly available.
532000	539000	This is a System 360 memory array, 64,000 characters of storage.
539000	543000	If you need less, start with the basic 8,000.
543000	550000	Need more? Add arrays to provide 128,000 characters of storage,
550000	556000	or 256,000, or 512,000.
556000	558000	Compact, fast.
558000	563000	In System 360, there is a hierarchy of memories,
563000	568000	small control memories, billions of a second,
568000	573000	main memories, at a millionth of a second,
573000	578000	and a unique development, large capacity memory,
578000	585000	2 million characters in an array, 8 million in a single configuration,
585000	589000	directly addressed at microsecond speeds.
589000	594000	Unprecedented core storage that dramatically improves throughput,
594000	598000	that lets you do the big jobs in less time,
598000	605000	more effectively, that gives you more useful answers for your dollar.
605000	610000	Memory power, System 360.
610000	615000	Another new concept in System 360, power for growth.
615000	618000	Single system growth.
618000	623000	Processors that offer many speeds, memory sizes, features.
623000	628000	Select what you need to do your job best.
628000	637000	You can start small, and without reprogramming, you can grow.
637000	642000	And grow.
642000	646000	And grow to multiprocessor systems.
646000	650000	Every processor with an identical instruction said,
650000	654000	growth without reprogramming.
654000	657000	One modular operating system,
657000	661000	programming support for all configurations,
661000	665000	control programs, regulating job flow,
665000	667000	handling message traffic,
667000	670000	assigning programs to available storage,
670000	674000	non-stop computing, control programs,
674000	678000	programming languages, service programs,
678000	682000	for lower job costs to speed the flow of work,
682000	685000	all kinds of work,
685000	688000	for commercial applications,
688000	692000	decimal operation, variable record lengths,
692000	695000	input output capability,
695000	700000	for centralized filing, customer data services,
700000	703000	for scientific problem solving,
703000	708000	full binary operation, fixed and floating point arithmetic,
708000	712000	massive memory and file capacity,
712000	718000	high energy physics, the life sciences, real time simulation.
718000	722000	System 360 can handle them all.
722000	726000	Decimal and binary, commercial and scientific,
726000	730000	they're all the same to System 360.
730000	736000	But no system is better than its ability to get information in and out.
736000	741000	Input output capability, System 360 has it.
741000	745000	Peripheral devices linked to powerful data channels,
745000	751000	up to 1,200,000 characters a second, real channel power.
751000	754000	New tape drives with the performance you need,
754000	760000	ranging in speed from 22,500 characters a second to 90,000,
760000	764000	and up to 340,000 characters a second.

833000	838000	Your records, available when and where needed,
838000	843000	available in the computer room or 3,000 miles away.
843000	847000	System 360 makes them available.
847000	851000	Link hundreds of remote terminals to one multiplex channel,
851000	857000	and then a central installation becomes the hub of a nationwide network,
857000	861000	and does your regular processing at the same time.
