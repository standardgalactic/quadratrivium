1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm very excited to talk to you today, Andrew.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You are a rising star in the field for mathematics of consciousness science and to me, that's

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,360
no wonder.

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,600
And that's because I'm no philosopher, I know very little about philosophy, but I watched

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,360
your talks that are already on YouTube and I was able to understand them and they made

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
a lot of sense to me.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:38,640
So I will link below the links to those talks that got me so excited and what really stuck

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:47,420
out to me with your work is the rigor that goes into your thinking and that even translates

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:56,080
into how you present your thoughts and the clarity with which you present and what drives

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,080
your thinking.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,880
And this seems like such a welcome thing in the fields of consciousness that for a lot

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,800
of people seems to be characterized by the opposite by some kind of fluffiness.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,440
And so this kind of rigor and clarity I think is solely needed.

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,440
And I got quite excited that one of your last talks when you believe that real progress

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,600
can be made by formalizing things about the structure of consciousness and phenomenal

16
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
experience.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,880
So I'm very excited to hear about that today from you.

18
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Thank you, Alex.

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,800
I mean, that's really nice for me to hear.

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:36,400
And yeah, I'm glad that the aim that I bring in my work is to have clarity and precision.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,800
So I'm glad that's coming through.

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,560
Can you tell me how you got into this mess?

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,640
What got you interested in consciousness and also your academic vita that got you to this

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,000
point and what you're doing right now?

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,200
So I guess it started for me when I was 16 and still in high school.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,160
And at that time, I was a fairly good student, but, you know, I wasn't really inspired by

28
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,080
any academic subjects.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,120
I did find in my classes, but I wasn't really that interested in anything.

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,080
But then there were two things that really changed that for me.

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,880
So one was reading Goro Escherbach by Douglas Hofstadter.

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,320
And the second was reading David Chalmers on philosophical zombies and the heart problem

33
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,480
of consciousness.

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,640
Those two texts were really transformative for me.

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,960
And I guess after that, I just became fascinated by consciousness.

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,800
And I was really gripped by the fact that each of us is intimately acquainted with our

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,280
own conscious experiences, but it still was this phenomenon that remained little understood.

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,200
It was still one of these remaining great mysteries about the natural world.

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,080
So in that respect, I guess consciousness was the first thing that really sparked my

40
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,360
academic interest and that spark has never really fully left me.

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,160
Also, I really liked the purity and generality of analytic philosophy.

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:17,120
And I went into college wanting to study philosophy and consciousness in particular.

43
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,080
I was pretty lucky in my undergrad experience.

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,960
So I went to Brown University and there happened to be this community of undergrads that were

45
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,040
there at the same time that were also into philosophy and a bunch of us were into philosophy

46
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
of mind.

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,240
So we had this department undergraduate group where we met every couple of weeks and talked

48
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,680
about different philosophical topics.

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,040
And I felt like I was really able to benefit from just having lots of conversations with

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,840
peers, even when I was an undergrad.

51
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,480
And I mean, my interest in consciousness kind of stuck with me throughout the whole of college.

52
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,160
And I eventually decided to apply to grad school and to try to become a philosopher of consciousness.

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,040
And I was lucky enough to get into NYU for my PhD, where I was able to work with David

54
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,560
Chalmers, as well as Ned Block and Thomas Nagel, all of whom were some of my intellectual

55
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,880
heroes.

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,600
And I mean, so it's pretty common for people's interests to change during the course of grad

57
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
school, but consciousness never really left me.

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,960
And I mean, nowadays I do work on a number of philosophical issues outside of consciousness.

59
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,840
I've like tainted my peer record, but consciousness has always been at the heart of my philosophical

60
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,840
interests and the structure of consciousness in particular, that's at the heart of my interest

61
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
in consciousness.

62
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah, and what got you that is such an interesting thing because it seems that different people

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,520
from different parts of the planet at the same time started thinking along those lines.

64
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,480
So what was it about structure that got you the most interest about consciousness?

65
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,160
Yeah, no, it's a great question.

66
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,280
So to start, I guess I've just long thought that these sorts of questions, questions about

67
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,400
the structure of consciousness are both really interesting, but also really underexplored.

68
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,960
And I think maybe one reason for the why they're underexplored is that there are many people

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,520
in, including myself, who have been kind of seduced by classic philosophical questions

70
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,360
about the fundamental nature of consciousness, you know, like the heart problem, philosophical

71
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,040
zombies, Mary's room, all that stuff.

72
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,480
And I think I think that's great.

73
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,480
I mean, I care a lot about those sorts of questions and I think they're important questions.

74
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,560
I also think that consciousness research, and especially the philosophy of consciousness,

75
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,600
has been overly dominated by those sorts of questions.

76
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,280
I mean, there's so many interesting theoretical questions about consciousness that go beyond

77
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,560
the heart problem, including questions about the structure of consciousness.

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,960
And I think some people might have the impression that philosophy of consciousness is just about

79
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,960
those questions about the fundamental nature, but I think there's a whole lot more

80
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,480
there. And that's part of what I'm trying to develop and investigate and uncover in my own

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,800
research. I guess one thing is that, I mean, at the same time, investigating the structure of

82
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,680
consciousness is really hard. And maybe that's part of why these questions are underexplored as

83
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,760
well. It's oftentimes not obvious how to make progress. And, you know, if you, so if you

84
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,160
introspect your own conscious experience right now, you'll find that it's obvious that it's

85
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,520
richly structured, but how exactly to think about that structure, what kinds of models or

86
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,040
tools we should use for characterizing that structure, those are really difficult questions.

87
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,840
But I think these are also super important questions and the kinds of questions that we'll

88
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,960
need to tackle in order to really make progress in consciousness research. And in fact, if you

89
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,640
look at other sciences, you know, physics, biology, psychology, whatever, in general,

90
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,440
as a scientific field develops, it starts to move away from essence questions or questions about

91
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,200
the fundamental nature of the entity study and instead to structural questions or questions about

92
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,400
how the entities of the domain are related to each other, how to model those relations.

93
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,880
And right now, consciousness research is still dominated by a focus on essence questions.

94
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,080
You know, the biggest question in the philosophy of consciousness is, what is the fundamental

95
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,520
nature of consciousness? And the biggest question in the science of consciousness is,

96
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,280
what physical properties make a conscious, make a system conscious versus not? But

97
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,840
my, I suspect that if you look at consciousness research a century from now, if we were able

98
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,480
to do that somehow, we would see a much greater focus on structural questions.

99
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,480
It's very interesting, because often with that development in science has also been

100
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,080
the formalization and mathematician. And that is also something that you and other people

101
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,960
interested in the structure have been championing as well. And so there's an analog that often

102
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,440
leads to progress as well, because you're leaving behind the woolly words, you're boiling it down

103
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,800
to something that is much more rigorous. So I'm curious what led you into that direction to

104
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,720
use formal tools and combine that with your interest in the structure of consciousness?

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,840
I mean, I guess part of what led me in that direction is basically just agreement with the

106
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,480
thought that you were expressing that one of the best ways of sharpening and systematizing

107
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:37,120
our inquiry into a phenomenon is to figure out how to use mathematical tools for modeling it

108
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,080
or understanding it. And as I said, I think that's really hard in the case of consciousness,

109
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,560
but I think that quality spaces, which we'll talk about more later, that's one of the ways

110
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,760
in to start doing that in the case of consciousness. I guess also, maybe this is another way of

111
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:04,800
expressing why I was motivated and gravitated towards this kind of topic. So there's this

112
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,160
famous passage at the end of Thomas Naples, What Does It Like to Be a Bet?, where he says,

113
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,520
Investigating consciousness is really hard, but maybe it would be more tractable if we could

114
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,280
somehow develop an objective phenomenology or a way of understanding conscious experiences that

115
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,200
doesn't require one to have had the experiences under question. And this passage is really well

116
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,000
known, but most people react to it with thought that, well, that sounds cool, but what would this

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,480
look like? It's not clear what an objective phenomenology would be or whether that's even

118
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,280
coherent or makes sense. So one of my most recent publications is entitled Objective

119
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,680
Phenomenology and argues that it is indeed possible to develop an objective phenomenology

120
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,880
and that the way of doing so is to investigate the structure of consciousness. So basically,

121
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,320
my view is that purely structural facts about consciousness, for example, the kinds of facts

122
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,400
captured by mathematical models, those are objective phenomenal facts. And that's a way of

123
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,560
doing objective phenomenology. And the paper I mentioned of mine was published just last year,

124
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,560
but the basic ideas behind it have been a guiding thought and guiding motivation behind my work

125
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,560
for a number of years. So I think that's another way of explaining or justifying why

126
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,680
a focus on the structure of consciousness and in particular on figuring out ways to

127
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,560
mathematically model different aspects of consciousness experiences is interesting and

128
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,200
promising and maybe will help pave the way towards progress in consciousness research.

129
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,320
But this might come a little bit out of the left wing maybe, but there's something deeper,

130
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,400
almost mysterious in the fact that if you really boil down science and you really think about all

131
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,200
of this, it's almost like mathematics is all there is. I don't know, you can go as extreme as

132
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,040
Max Teckmark maybe to really say that it's almost ontological in nature, but isn't it,

133
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,200
what you said really brings so true in my thinking as well that when science is at its best,

134
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,080
it just comes up with a bunch of equations. And so it seems exciting that we might have

135
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,840
reached a point in consciousness research that we can use the same language. And so when Galileo

136
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,280
Galilei said the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics, that we now

137
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,760
reached a chapter where it comes to consciousness. And we can start maybe reading it in the same

138
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,560
language. So that seems very exciting at the same time mysterious maybe that just works.

139
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,440
Yeah, well, so a couple thoughts there. One is that I think we're still pretty far off from

140
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
actually being able to do that with consciousness, just because I think we're still very much in

141
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,720
the early stages of inquiring about consciousness and and figuring it out. So one analogy I like

142
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,600
to make is that we're sort of in this pre Newtonian stage in investigating consciousness,

143
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
a stage analogous to creating Newton and investigating the physical world where

144
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,560
part of what we're trying to do is figure out the basic insights that will enable

145
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,640
systematic mathematical theories in the future. And you know, it's really hard to break past that

146
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:15,840
basic stage. That's part of why like Newtonian physics was so remarkable. So I guess in my mind

147
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:23,280
we're very much at the early stages. And maybe we're on the cusp of developing more sophisticated

148
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,080
mathematical models. But I think there's still a lot of work in just figuring out how do we think

149
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,880
about the structure of consciousness in the first place and then what kinds of formalisms will be

150
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,200
useful for for thinking about that. But then to return to the first part of what you were saying.

151
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,400
So one of the lines of thought you might have about the physical world is you might

152
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,320
some people are sympathetic to a kind of Pythagoreanism where everything is just math,

153
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,960
there's no there's nothing more to the world than just mathematical structures. And similarly,

154
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,600
you might take a similar attitude towards consciousness. Maybe consciousness is just

155
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,200
more math. There's not all this like intrinsic Pauli stuff. It's just it's just mathematical

156
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,960
structures. And I'm somebody who's very pro investigating the structure of consciousness.

157
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,680
But I'm also somebody who thinks that there's more to consciousness than just structure. I think that

158
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,800
investigating the structure of consciousness will tell us a whole lot about consciousness. It'll

159
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,360
give us these frameworks for thinking about it more systematically, but it's not going to capture

160
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,920
everything. And I think part of what is in fact remarkable about consciousness and interesting

161
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:36,400
about it is that it's a phenomenon that consists of more than just structure. And even if we developed

162
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,720
the best mathematical models we possibly could, I think that they would still be leaving something

163
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,920
out, they wouldn't be inadequate, they might capture all the structural aspects of consciousness.

164
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:56,000
But I'm somebody who thinks that there's qualia in the most robust real sense that you might think.

165
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,360
If I may push on that a little bit, then what do you think of this idea that maybe when it comes

166
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,560
to science, though, that what science can explain might then maybe be limited to the structure,

167
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,920
maybe when it comes to the whole world and consciousness. So in other words, so maybe

168
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,080
it is true that there are things that are hard problems that beyond scientists reach, but at

169
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,720
least now we have something here that we can pull on and become more scientific about it. And it has

170
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,160
this promise that it falls into the fold of mathematical understanding of the world as we

171
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,800
have in physics and other disciplines. Yeah, I mean, I think that's a really interesting idea.

172
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:48,160
And I'm not sure what my own view on that is yet. So that's partly because I think

173
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,920
it's kind of up for grabs, what we think of as the nature of the science of consciousness

174
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,360
and the scope of scientific investigation in general. I guess I'm somebody who's

175
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,680
fairly sympathetic to the general thought that scientific investigation aims to tell us about

176
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,280
the structure of the world. But you might think that in the case of consciousness,

177
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,440
there's an exception. There's a different kind of epistemic relationship that we bear to our

178
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,680
own conscious experiences than that we bear to the external world. We're in direct contact with

179
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,840
our own conscious experiences in a way that we're not in direct contact with the external world.

180
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:26,080
And because of that, we're able to apply our knowledge, not just of the structure of the domain

181
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:33,840
under investigation, but also its intrinsic nature. I guess I do think that everything I just said

182
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,120
is true. But the thing that I feel unsure about is, how should we think about the scope of the

183
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,120
science of consciousness? Is it the case that in acquiring knowledge of and investigating the

184
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,200
qualitative character of our experiences, is that within the purview of the science of consciousness,

185
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:55,280
or is it not? And I mean, in some ways, I think this is, but you might think, for example,

186
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,800
scientific investigation by nature has to produce public knowledge, and we can't have

187
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,040
public knowledge of the qualities of one's own experiences. That's something that

188
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,840
is essentially private. So anyway, I guess my thought is that there's an interesting question

189
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,720
here that concerns both how we should think about the scope of investigation into consciousness,

190
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,240
but also just how we should think about the nature of science in general.

191
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,040
Oh, that's very interesting. In fact, Ken, push you on the more crazy things. So you brought up

192
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,160
Newton, right? And so there's an interesting piece of history there that maybe we can learn from.

193
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,800
And so my understanding is that it was quite important for him that he basically the way

194
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,640
discovered or invented calculus to then make progress in physics. And so the question that

195
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,440
I have is, do you think that we might also have to work on a mathematics side of things? And maybe

196
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,080
that will help us to learn what breakthroughs in the science of consciousness. Yeah, I think that's

197
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,720
a really interesting question too. I guess I don't see any positive reason for thinking that.

198
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,840
It seems to me that the difficulties with figuring out how to mathematically model our

199
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:08,080
conscious experiences don't lie on the side of, oh, we need more sophisticated or just novel

200
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,200
mathematical frameworks or formalisms, but instead that it's just really not obvious how to think

201
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,040
about the target of inquiry that we're trying to develop mathematical models of. So I mean, in the

202
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,920
case of quality spaces, it's not like the mathematical structures that we need to appeal to

203
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:35,760
are particularly new or novel or anything. They're like geometric spaces and things that are fairly

204
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,160
familiar. Maybe it's the case that there will be certain aspects of conscious experiences where

205
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,680
we just don't have anything in our current mathematical repertoire that adequately captures

206
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,920
that structure. But I guess in the absence of a compelling example, I'm inclined to think that

207
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,720
the default is to just assume that, well, the difficulty just lies on getting a better qualitative

208
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,280
understanding of the domain under consideration rather than on the tools that we have for modeling

209
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,360
that domain. Yeah, that's convincing. So maybe this might be a good point to lead into what you

210
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,760
prepared. We might have weathered everybody's appetite on how can this be done to talk more

211
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:25,600
formally about the structure of consciousness and quality of spaces. Okay, so I prepared a

212
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,080
brief presentation of the ideas in one of my articles, Vaudelay Mental Qualities, that was

213
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,160
published, well, I guess not last year, two years ago now, in the Journal of Philosophical Review.

214
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,680
And I'm going to just provide a pretty brief overview of the core ideas from this article

215
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:52,400
and mention a few of the interesting questions or applications that arise from the frameworks that

216
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,600
I developed. So I'll keep it pretty short and compact. So the central question that I'm

217
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,680
investigated that I'm interested in here is how do we model the qualities of

218
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,160
conscious experiences, qualities like those involved in seeing red or feeling pain,

219
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,720
smelling cinnamon. And my article is arguing that the standard approach for modeling these mental

220
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:28,880
qualities is inadequate, that it can't capture a certain core feature of our conscious experiences.

221
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,800
And then I develop a new framework that's more powerful and flexible and showcase some of the

222
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:39,280
applications of the framework. So maybe just start, let me introduce the concept of a quality

223
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,720
space model. This is probably familiar to many audience members, even if not by that name.

224
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,840
So a quality space model in general is a model of some domain of qualities, for example, colors,

225
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,320
sounds, smells. And the most famous example is the three-dimensional model of color experiences

226
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,720
that has huge saturation and brightness as dimensions. But there are quality space models

227
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,880
where at least potentially could be quality space models for just about any domain of

228
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,440
qualities, auditory, olfactory, and so forth. So these models are pretty remarkable for

229
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,160
people interested in consciousness. And in fact, I think this is a very under-explored

230
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,040
aspect of consciousness research. And one reason is that quality space models are one of the few

231
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:34,880
cases where we actually have systematic models of some aspect of conscious experiences and where

232
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,960
we know pretty well how to conduct empirical investigation and to develop mathematical formalisms.

233
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,920
Another reason is that quality space models are super general. Any domain of mental qualities

234
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,840
is going to be structured by similarity relations. And as soon as we have similarity, we can model

235
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,960
that domain of qualities using a geometric space. So if part of our goal is to map out the structures

236
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,600
and conscious experiences, then a significant part of that project is probably going to be

237
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,880
consistent developing quality space models for different domains of experiences.

238
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,480
Okay, so one very quick termological note. I'm using the term mental qualities here

239
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,000
and also in the article, but I'm treating that as synonymous with terms like phenomenal qualities

240
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:30,000
or quality. So the standard approach to quality space models, what I'll call the standard framework,

241
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,240
models mental qualities via points in geometric cold spaces, where the distances between points

242
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,680
correspond to degrees of phenomenal similarity. And you can kind of see this representation of

243
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,080
the three-dimensional model for color experiences in this picture here.

244
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:55,520
And the standard framework, it works pretty well, but one aspect of conscious experiences that it

245
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,240
doesn't really work so well for is what I call phenomenal precision. So to get a grip on precision,

246
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,320
think about the contrast between your full-view color experience of something as scarlet versus

247
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,960
your peripheral color experience of something as red. So your full-view color experience is more

248
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:20,400
precise than your peripheral color experience. And precision, in the sense that I'm using the term,

249
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,080
denotes a certain phenomenal property, a certain property of your experiences, namely the property

250
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,720
that contrasts your full-view color experience from your peripheral color experience.

251
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,680
Precision isn't just specific to color experience though. So think about, for example,

252
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,400
the phenomenal contrast between, say, hearing a sound that's muffled versus a sound that's clear

253
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,040
or touching a surface with your fingertips versus with your back. Those also plausibly

254
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:54,560
involve contrasts in precision. So there's this feature of an alvenology that is just an aspect

255
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,640
of our conscious experiences. And the standard framework has kind of an awkward time capturing

256
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,800
precision. And that's because the standard framework models mental qualities via points,

257
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,000
but imprecise qualities correspond to regions rather than points. At least that's a very

258
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,160
natural way of thinking about precision. There's more than I say in the paper to motivate this

259
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,920
appeal to regions. For example, some people think, well, couldn't we just add an extra dimension

260
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,680
before precision? And that would be one possibility, but I think that for various reasons, that

261
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:34,720
isn't the most appealing possibility for capturing precision. So a very natural move when we start

262
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,760
thinking about precision and quality space models is to move from modeling mental qualities using

263
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:50,880
points to using regions. And that's the move that I make in my paper. So it's a pretty basic idea,

264
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,360
represent mental qualities via regions and meaning sets of points instead of individual points.

265
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,920
But part of what I argue is that this pretty simple move is much more powerful and interesting than

266
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,760
you might initially think. And it enables rich new investigation into consciousness that's at the

267
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:18,160
intersection of philosophy and coccy and math. So there's a few constraints that we want on our

268
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,880
models if we are doing things in terms of regions rather than points. So first and foremost, we

269
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,000
want sizes of regions to correspond to degrees of precision. So the introduction of regions is

270
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,320
intended to provide a way of capturing precision. So experiences that are more imprecise will

271
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,920
correspond to bigger regions. And then we want one to one correspondence between what we call

272
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,040
permissible regions or regions that actually represent genuine possible mental qualities

273
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,640
and the qualities themselves. We want distance to inversely correspond to phenomenal similarity

274
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,480
and we want phenomenal identity when two qualities are indistinguishable to correspond to distance

275
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,120
here to occupy exactly the same location in the space. So in the paper itself, I go through

276
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,600
different elements of the regional framework and I explain how to think about them and the

277
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,920
substituted philosophical issues that arise. I'm not going to talk about that stuff. Instead of

278
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,640
all all I'm going to do here is I'm just going to mention a few interesting questions that arise

279
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,040
when we start thinking in terms of the regional framework and also some of the applications

280
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:30,560
that arise when we move to the regional framework. So here's one interesting question. We can ask

281
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:39,200
what kinds of regions actually represent possible qualities? So a region in my definition is just

282
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,120
any set of points and for any quality space model there's going to be all sorts of weirdly

283
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,480
structured sets of points where it's not obvious whether that's that corresponds to a real

284
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,280
phenomenal possibility. So for example you might wonder whether there could be experiences that

285
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,640
correspond to disconnected regions. Could you have a color experience that represents something

286
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,800
either as aquamarine or scarlet but no shades in between? You might wonder what that kind of

287
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:15,440
experience be like is such an experience possible? And those are philosophical and empirical questions

288
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,760
but what the regional framework enables us to do is to translate these into a more precise

289
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,800
mathematical language that allows us to ask these questions in a more precise way. And interestingly

290
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,160
it also makes it the case that different theories about the space and structure of possible

291
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,600
mental qualities will correspond to different formal constraints on the set of permissible regions.

292
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,400
So one thing to notice here is how the regional framework enables us to start theorizing about

293
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,720
the qualities of consciousness experiences more systematically. You know it would be difficult

294
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,680
to even formulate these questions in the first place without the use of this framework.

295
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,880
So I think that provides a glimpse of how the regional framework enables us to address

296
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,000
theoretical and empirical questions with greater precision and to raise new questions that we

297
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,080
previously lacked the conceptual tools to think about. That's one new interesting question that

298
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,040
arises when we move to the regional framework. Another interesting question concerns the metric.

299
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,840
So there's all sorts of ways of constructing a metric meaning a distance function on regions

300
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,640
assuming that we already have a well-defined notion of distance between points. So for example

301
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:30,400
one of the most commonly used metrics on regions is the least distance metric where the distance

302
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,080
between two regions is the distance between their closest points. Another common metric is the

303
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,720
average distance metric where the distance between two regions is the average distance between all

304
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:48,720
their points. And if we're seeking a metric that models phenomenal similarity then we're going to

305
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,560
need that metric to satisfy certain kinds of formal constraints. So for example we want every

306
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,840
region to have distance zero to itself since distance zero represents maximal similarity

307
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,720
meaning phenomenal identity. So once we identify these formal constraints it's a pretty substantive

308
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,240
and interesting question of figuring out which kind of metric on regions actually is the right one

309
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,200
for modeling phenomenal similarity. And one thing I argue in my article is that neither the least

310
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,240
distance metric nor the average distance metric work they systematically make incorrect predictions.

311
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,760
So instead I propose a new metric that I think generates the right kinds of results

312
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,920
which I call the qualitative similarity metric or the Paul metric. This is the

313
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,240
formal statement of the metric where A and B are two regions. And I'm not going to explain how

314
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,320
exactly the metric works but to give you some intuition you can basically think of it as a

315
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,680
more sophisticated version of an average distance metric. So the average distance metric works pretty

316
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,720
well most of the time but it turns out to lead to systematically incorrect results

317
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,320
for phenomenal similarity when we have cases involving overlapping regions. So for example

318
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,320
the average distance metric yields the observed result that every mental quality is less than

319
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,040
maximally similar to itself and that's because if you take the average distance from a region to

320
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:15,360
itself you'll get a non-zero value. So my Paul metric doesn't generate these sorts of absurd

321
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,400
consequences but still yields results that otherwise resemble average distance and more

322
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,120
generally it yields the right kinds of predictions across all the kinds of relationships that two

323
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,640
regions can bear to each other. So that's one thing that's kind of cool. We get this more

324
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,040
interesting sophisticated formalism for capturing phenomenal similarity. Also I think one thing

325
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,760
that's cool that comes out of the regional framework is that there are multiple dimensions

326
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,040
of phenomenal similarity and we can formally disentangle those dimensions. So alongside

327
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,240
qualitative similarity measured by the Paul metric there's also precision similarity.

328
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,520
Similarity with respect to how precise two experiences are which is measured by

329
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,200
a precision similarity metric. So for example think about a full view experience of red

330
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,280
and a full view experience of green versus a peripheral experience of red. The two full

331
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,880
view experiences are similar in a certain respect to each other in which they aren't to

332
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:20,480
the peripheral experience. So precision similarity on the way that I'm defining the metric is

333
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:27,120
measured by the ratio between the smaller region to the larger region. And again there's a lot more

334
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:34,160
that's said in the paper to walk through the metric into motivated. But stepping back thinking

335
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,320
about the big picture I think what's interesting here is that this is one case where I think

336
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,840
formalization can actually help with understanding the phenomenology. So what the regional framework

337
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,120
enables us to do is to pull part two distinct dimensions of phenomenal similarity and seeing

338
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,040
how they fall out of the formal structure of the regional framework this gives us a much more

339
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,760
precise and systematic understanding of phenomenal similarity than we would otherwise have.

340
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,360
Last thing I'll mention as an interesting application of the regional framework concerns

341
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,600
the phenomenal psorias. So a phenomenal psorias is a case where a subject cannot discriminate

342
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,840
an object alpha from an object beta or beta from gamma but can discriminate alpha from gamma. So

343
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,600
for example imagine that you're in a psychophysics experiment and you're seeing three

344
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,520
color shifts each of which is a different shade of gray. And you can discriminate the first

345
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,400
from the third but you can't discriminate the first from the second or the second from the third.

346
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,520
So if I I tried to actually construct a phenomenal psorias case here if I did it

347
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,880
aptly then you will be able to discriminate the shade of gray for of this first circle alpha

348
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,560
from that of gamma but not any of the pairwise circles. So alpha and beta might look to be the

349
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,120
same shade of gray and beta and gamma might look to be the same shade of gray. Okay so that's the

350
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,840
phenomenon that's a phenomenon that's well known. There's been a lot written about it. It's a phenomenon

351
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,680
that calls out for explanation. You might wonder what exactly is going on phenomenologically

352
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:12,800
in phenomenal psorias cases. And the idea that I had is that we can apply the regional framework

353
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:20,400
to the phenomenal psorias where the probability of a phenomenal psorias occurring I hypothesize

354
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,280
corresponds to the overlap structure of the relevant regions. So in other words the more

355
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:31,360
a and b overlap or the more b and c overlap the more likely it is that the subject would not be

356
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:37,440
able to discriminate the color of alpha from beta or beta from gamma and the less a and c overlap

357
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,840
the more likely it is that they'll be able to discriminate the color of alpha from gamma. So

358
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,240
that's the basic idea. So that yields this probabilistic model of the phenomenal psorias

359
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,080
that comes out of the regional framework. I'm not going to fully explain all this that would

360
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,920
require a bit too much time on technical issues but here's the basic idea. The regional framework

361
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:07,200
gives us this probabilistic model of how likely it is that a phenomenal psorias occurs where the

362
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,040
input to the model is the regions that represent the subjects experiences and in particular the

363
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,080
overlap structure between those regions. And the thought is that a phenomenal psorias is more

364
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,640
likely to occur when a and b overlap or or b and c overlap or or when a and c overlap less.

365
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,040
Okay so one exciting thing about this application in particular is that it has the potential to

366
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:37,520
inform future empirical investigation into consciousness but I won't talk about that more

367
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:45,920
for limits of time. So here's just a summary of what I've been talking about in this brief overview.

368
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,920
So the goal of this article of mine is to develop a new framework for quality space models where the

369
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,200
core idea is to represent qualities using regions and where size of region inversely corresponds to

370
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,640
degree of precision and the regional framework enables us to ask a bunch of interesting new

371
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,440
questions about phenomenology for example which kinds of regions represents possible mental

372
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,160
qualities how we construct the right similarity metrics and it also has a number of applications

373
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,640
for example the probabilistic model of the phenomenal psorias as well as a number of other

374
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,680
things. And there's an article link at the bottom if you're interested in taking a look at the details.

375
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,280
I wanted to end with a more general thought so I'm interested generally in philosophical

376
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,040
questions about the structure of consciousness and I have listed here some of the questions that I

377
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,200
think are especially interesting or important for making progress. These are mostly fairly

378
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,400
foundational questions but I think they're questions that we ought to explore to get a better

379
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,360
understanding of this topic and in fact all these questions are under explored there's not

380
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:57,040
yet much work in philosophy or the science of consciousness on these sorts of questions.

381
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,640
But I think this is also changing you know in recent years there's been more and more

382
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,840
attention being paid to the structure of consciousness and I think this is exciting and

383
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,080
I'm interested in seeing how things continue to develop in the future.

384
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:22,160
Yeah very cool I have so many questions and ideas coming out of all of this this is by the way this

385
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:29,680
is also really great this is very inspiring about these open questions and I almost feel like I would

386
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,240
like to put a poll below in the video what viewers might be most interested in and get you back on

387
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,720
to talk about one of these topics because each of these are really interesting questions.

388
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,440
Well these maybe it's worth mentioning that these first four questions I have written on or

389
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:52,560
and currently writing on the last four questions I'm interested in and I have thoughts about but

390
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,600
for me they're questions for future work so I've in my in my research program I've been slowly

391
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,880
trying to progress through this host of questions.

392
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,960
Great great so when it comes to the region's idea that you bring in it seems to me

393
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,680
it's one of these things that you go in hindsight everybody should go da because this whole idea

394
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,080
that your your qualia would be a point in some kind of space seems questionable in the first place

395
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,200
right because a point in a way as a mathematical object is infinitely small and it comes with

396
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,360
all kinds of problems but when people show color spaces they never show these points

397
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,800
they already show your regions right and so you're kind of duped into into thinking you're not

398
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,080
thinking as that as a discretized kind of point space so that's really interesting I also find

399
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:47,040
interesting that you you got the objection that sounded like that some people said well why why

400
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,120
not solve that by adding another dimension and so when it when it comes to the color space at least

401
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,680
it sounds to me that your idea and that's actually key is that let's say your peripheral

402
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,480
sensing your periphery quality of scarlet is less precise but if it's a region in color space then

403
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,720
that means that it can't be arbitrarily imprecise the neighboring colors in that space they determined

404
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,520
that impreciseness because that is where the imprecision can go to right if you if you just

405
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:25,120
add another dimension and the imprecision can be something other than that this redness that you

406
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,320
don't see it as precise as something at the fovea if you think of that as spreading being more

407
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,000
wide or more fuzzy in color space well that means that it has something to do with which other colors

408
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:45,920
are nearby yeah or I see so at least if you're thinking that connectedness or maybe complexity

409
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,840
is a constraint on the relevant regions if I'm understanding your question if you didn't require

410
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,960
connectedness then it doesn't really matter which other colors are nearby because you could have

411
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,160
you know some very yeah weirdly shaped regions so that I mean but I think that's just an

412
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,640
interesting open question and we don't really know the answer to this yeah so intuitively I just

413
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,880
assumed that it must be connected but it almost seems to me like an empirical question that we

414
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,920
might be able to answer right because you could show different kinds of shades of red and you

415
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,320
could basically explore the color space that's all around that redness you can do that at the fovea

416
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,560
and you can do it in the periphery and basically you if you can show more shades of red that are

417
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,320
all around this color space it's almost like you could map that region that you're talking about

418
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,640
yeah yeah so I think that's one of the ways in which this the regional framework that I developed

419
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,200
lends itself to empirical investigation because there's going to be different kinds of

420
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,520
predictions depending on for example what the structure of a given region is as far as whether

421
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,920
it's an empirical question whether the regions for a quality space are have to be connected or not

422
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,400
I think there's one question that's empirical which is how should we be thinking about the

423
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,240
regions for human color experiences what how should we be thinking about more generally just

424
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,680
the model of human color experiences but then there's also a more general question

425
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,200
how do we think about the space of all possible experiences where maybe it's the case that humans

426
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,040
just have a certain kind of cognitive architecture that only enables certain kinds of possible

427
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,600
color experiences and that wouldn't be surprising if if it were the case like maybe there's not

428
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:38,160
really much advantage to representing something as correspond in the way that like a disconnected

429
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,880
would so there's also this more general metaphysical question of what kinds of

430
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,800
experiences are possible in general independent of how human color experiences happen to be

431
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,320
and that's a that's a difficult question I'm not sure you know I'm not sure what

432
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,800
considerations would bear either way on that question but I think one cool thing is that

433
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,840
now we can actually formulate this question I wonder about it at least

434
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:12,400
yeah I don't know if you know but there are some human tetrachromats so they have four color

435
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,760
receptors and so that that color gamut should be wider and yeah it's very little work on that

436
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,080
actually so well so this also goes to I think some very underexplored and very interesting

437
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:29,200
questions about quality spaces about so there's tetrachromats there's also colorblind people

438
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,000
and then there's also just other creatures that seem like they might have color experiences but

439
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,960
perhaps with a different dimensionality right and there's an interesting question of how to

440
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,480
think about the relations between these different quality spaces for example should we think that

441
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:54,480
these all possible color experiences those for neurotypical humans and colorblind humans and

442
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,120
dogs and mantis shrimp are they all embedded in this bigger quality space that captures all

443
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:07,440
possible color experiences or should we think about the relations between these different

444
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,160
qualities of the same experiential domain but of different spaces in a different way I mean this

445
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,560
is something that I'm interested in thinking about more in the future I have some very speculative

446
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,440
thoughts at the moment on on this but I think that's an exciting topic to investigate there's

447
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,440
also I don't know if you ever heard about this but our lens is actually filtering it's basically a

448
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,320
low pass filter and so you can some people they lose their lens and they get just a glass replacement

449
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,320
that doesn't have the same properties and they can see parts of the ultraviolet spectrum that we

450
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:45,280
can't see just with a regular eye so we're capable of doing it but it's the lens that prevents us from

451
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:54,000
doing it that's interesting yeah it seems hard enough from what I read to find out whether those

452
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,200
people actually do see something other than maybe a very bright violet right so it's very

453
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,600
that's where we run into these limits unless maybe we can come up with more clever techniques

454
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,080
than what we have in terms of finding out whether they have color perceptions that that we don't have

455
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,800
yeah I mean so I was going to say that the hard part there then is figuring out what

456
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,200
the phenomenology for those people is but I mean one possible approach would be to just

457
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,600
first see whether they're able to make more discriminations than ordinary people are able

458
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,560
to make and that's I'm inclined to think provides some defeasible evidence in favor of thinking that

459
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,040
they actually do have more color experiences so I had a technical question so I really like the

460
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,720
way that you explain one of your equations was not just with a usual notation but you had the

461
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,120
discs basically showing the different set configurations and so the thought that popped

462
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:57,760
from my mind there is that I'm also very visual thinker and it's how much of the formalism that

463
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,520
you have depends on the and you kind of answered this already but how much of it depends on the

464
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:11,920
size of the shape so if it's like a disc like a ball like shape right then in reality it may

465
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:18,320
not be as you said that and and so would the metrics the work if it's not that yeah so so

466
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:25,360
basically it doesn't maybe I should pull up that and it's just for so really speaking when when I

467
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,640
envision that region just without further thought I would in my mind it would be something that's

468
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:38,720
more Gaussian or Gaussian than a solid disc where it seems that even the region itself is not homogeneous

469
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,720
but that the region itself might have like a bell curve kind of shape or something or something

470
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,800
equivalent in two-dimensional three-dimensional space yeah so let me let me speak to both things

471
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,280
that you were raising so for for the first thing how much does the way that this metric works

472
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,880
rely upon the assumption that the relevant regions are spherical and the the answer is that it

473
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,880
doesn't at all so you can you don't you don't even need to assume that the regions are disconnected

474
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:18,160
or sorry that the regions are connected so this this was designed to work with arbitrary regions

475
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,880
of all sorts of weird shapes and sizes and I mean when we're thinking about like very weirdly

476
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,960
shaped regions especially disconnected ones then there's not really clear intuitions anyway about

477
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:37,200
what the right results should be but what I aim to do in in developing this metric was to make sure

478
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,840
that it covered you know all sorts of weird cases and that included thinking a lot about what the

479
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:52,720
results would be when we're not assuming uniformity for the shapes or convexity or or anything else so

480
00:44:52,720 --> 00:45:00,080
the answer to the first question is that this I I think is going to be fully general for the second

481
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:06,000
thing when you were talking about this Gaussian structure there's a part of my paper that discusses

482
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,200
this kind of briefly so what I say is that one thing you might think is that not only should we

483
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,520
move from the standard framework to the regional framework but we should move even further from

484
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,280
the regional framework to a framework where mental qualities are modeled not just by

485
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:32,720
subsets of a space but also by weighted subsets where each point is assigned some value and where

486
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,240
maybe there's more concentration in the middle than the periphery and so forth so one reason you

487
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,080
might be motivated to move to that kind of structure is that if you think that

488
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:52,240
that perceptual experiences have probabilistic contents and that that probabilistic structure

489
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:59,840
is reflected in the phenomenology then that might be reason to not give equal weight to all of the

490
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:05,520
different parts of the quality space that the relevant region covers so maybe there's more

491
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,960
concentration in for example maybe there's a quality that represents something as having

492
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,720
a high probability of being red but also some low probability of being orange and some low

493
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:24,000
probability of being purple with when all these like bands of color are of equal size so anyway

494
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,240
that would be a way of further developing this framework that will evolve like more sophisticated

495
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,520
structures than just regions and I think it's super interesting to think about how to develop

496
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,480
that further I mean there would need to be more sophisticated versions of the similarity metrics

497
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:49,680
I discussed for example and I think that would just be a further envisioning of our models of

498
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,680
quality spaces one thing that I feel myself agnostic about is just whether we do in fact

499
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,080
need that additional structure to capture the phenomenology to me that's just an open question

500
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,440
I think it's very obvious that there is such a thing as precision when we just think about the

501
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,800
contrast between full view experience and peripheral experience but it's not obvious

502
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,760
to me that we need something further not that I'm skeptical but I think it's just

503
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:24,880
more of an open question but I I'm thinking that this is something that might potentially be

504
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:32,080
something I'd like to work on in in the future this this field of qualia structure mathematical

505
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:38,160
phenomenology mathematical consciousness science do you ever feel for where it's headed if you

506
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,480
would have to put money on where things might be in five or ten years do you ever feel for that

507
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:53,200
there's a direction there I mean I hope that there will be more and more interest in these topics

508
00:47:53,200 --> 00:48:00,240
in the near future and I think that that probably will be the case one thing I hope will happen

509
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,520
and I think there's a good chance of happening is for there to be more

510
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,560
unity across different disciplines right now it feels like I mean this could be said about

511
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:18,640
consciousness research in general too it feels like there's a lot of different people in different

512
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:26,000
fields that are sometimes developing research that has connections to each other but are working

513
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,920
in different literatures maybe using different vocabulary or methodologies so I think there's

514
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:42,320
room for more I guess dialogue across disciplines and more I guess standardization of terms and ideas

515
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:50,400
and literatures and I think that that would constitute a form of progress I guess I also hope

516
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,200
that more philosophers become interested in these sorts of topics it's the structure of

517
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:04,720
consciousness is not really a big topic in the philosophy of mind right now but I think it has

518
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:11,520
the potential to be and I think that there's a lot that philosophers can contribute to our inquiry

519
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:19,200
into these subject matters so I'm hoping that in the field of philosophies specifically that more

520
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:26,160
attention is paid to these topics in the future very related to that if somebody's watching this

521
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,120
and is a young student and interested maybe in this direction would you have any advice

522
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,880
for your younger self do you have anything that you could share with somebody like that

523
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:44,320
yeah well I guess for students interested in this I mean I think consciousness research is a growing

524
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:53,600
field and that I mean I bet that this is in the end going to be an exciting time in history to be

525
00:49:53,600 --> 00:50:00,720
a part of that field I think that it's a field that is emerging where a lot of stuff is happening

526
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:07,840
where it's I mean it's only been recently that it's a subject matter that can be seriously

527
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,160
studied by scientists I mean consciousness used to be solely in the province of philosophers

528
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,160
but now there are people from a variety of disciplines you know philosophy, ecocide,

529
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:25,200
neuro, math even even CS who are focused on consciousness so yeah so I think right now

530
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,760
the field is fairly disparate and heterogeneous but I think it's going to probably become more

531
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,640
unified over time and partly because of that it's a great time to join the field because there's

532
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:41,680
exciting developments happening I guess maybe it's worth saying that academia is a very tough

533
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,320
career to pursue and that you know anyone who considers it should keep those sorts of practical

534
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:54,080
considerations in mind too but I really do think that this is an interesting time in history to

535
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:02,160
be interested and involved in studying consciousness and I suspect that the structure of consciousness

536
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:10,800
will be a bigger and more and more developed topic as as time goes on yeah I couldn't agree more

537
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,880
so I have a few things that maybe I'll add it out but I really wanted to hear what you think

538
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,080
and this is one thing it's a debate I had with Johannes Kleiner also which and you dropped it

539
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:27,680
at some point whether science has to produce public knowledge whether science has produced one

540
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:36,000
has to produce public knowledge so you said that very early on when we talked about whether we might

541
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
need new math and so you said that you think that maybe we have to also rethink what science is

542
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,400
and what qualifies as science and how science works and you brought that up that like one of these

543
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:53,920
points is whether science has to produce public knowledge and yeah and I find this such an interesting

544
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,360
question and so here's that thought experiment that that I thought at some point and I just want

545
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,880
to throw it off like that I bounce it off some people I want to bounce off you and see what you

546
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,000
think so the thought experiment is that it's like in that movie with Will Smith where the

547
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,360
world has ended and he's the only last person alive I imagine I think it's that movie and so

548
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,440
let's imagine this happened it's a zombie apocalypse or the rapture and there's one person left on the

549
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,640
planet that's the last survivor of mankind and that person just happens to be a brilliant scientist

550
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:31,920
somebody like Albert Einstein or Newton yeah and there's no more need for producing public

551
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:38,800
knowledge right so there's no more need to express science for others because there's

552
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,760
not going to be another human being anymore again and yet it seems that whatever the scientists

553
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:51,280
would produce would still be totally accepted as science by all of us yeah that's right although one

554
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:57,760
asymmetry there perhaps with the consciousness case is that in your scenario the knowledge

555
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:03,520
produced by the scientists is still in principle communicable and in principle public if there

556
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:11,440
happened to be like other humans created then he would be able to communicate his minds to

557
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,400
and that's what I question right because that's why it gets absurd right because like no you're

558
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,320
really the last survivor there's not anybody going to come so there's really no more need to even

559
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:28,080
in principle make it communicable and yet it still seems that then we would be okay with that

560
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:34,240
so it really seems that the need for making science public and communicable almost seems

561
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:40,240
more practical than a priori that's what I'm getting at it would be very weird to say that if

562
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,240
this person is doing science just for themselves that that wouldn't be science anymore just because

563
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,760
it can't be shared there's nothing that doesn't seem to be something fundamental about the act of

564
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,320
scientific knowledge being shared between two individuals that makes it scientific

565
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,320
yeah I mean I think that's right I mean I certainly agree that in the scenario you are

566
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:08,400
sketching then what the person is doing should count as scientific inquiry and scientific knowledge

567
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:14,640
it still seems to be that there are some asymmetries between that case and the consciousness case for

568
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,800
example even though the particular circumstance that the person is in happens to be one where

569
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,880
there will never be any communication of the findings it's still the case that the kind of

570
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,800
knowledge that the person is acquiring is the kind that could be communicated to other people

571
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,480
I mean maybe that's not a relevant asymmetry so I'm open to thinking that and I certainly think

572
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:47,040
that there can be first person investigation of conscious experiences that is scientific in many

573
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:53,200
relevant respects so I was really thinking of this as a largely verbal question of just like

574
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,800
how we define science I mean we could one option would be to think that there's like both first

575
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,680
person and third person science and it just has to be the case that almost all scientific

576
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:08,320
investigation is third person and that it also third person investigation produces certain

577
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:14,800
kinds of like benefits like communicability that are less obviously available in the first person

578
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:24,080
case that seems like a fine way of thinking about things to me yeah because some of your work

579
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:31,520
in a way does also rely on introspection right and so yeah so therefore I mean I it is it takes

580
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:40,240
first person science in this case kind of serious and and if you do then some of the issues in

581
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,840
consciousness science they actually kind of fall away because a lot of them they to me at least they

582
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:49,040
really come from very very hard insistence on third person science and public knowledge

583
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,520
that's right but part of part of what I was thinking about earlier is that

584
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,160
if I think there is a sense in which suppose we encountered like this alien species that

585
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:07,440
just had different kinds of experiences than us I'm inclined to think that there's going to be certain

586
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,600
things that we know about our own conscious experiences that we're just not going to be able

587
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,760
to communicate to them advice versa I think there's a lot that we could communicate to them for

588
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,840
example structural knowledge about right our own experiences but there might be certain facts about

589
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,880
the qualities of our experiences that are just inaccessible to them because of the way that

590
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:35,840
they're built and we you could imagine a scenario where we do in fact conduct systematic investigation

591
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,800
of those qualities maybe we like taxonomize and categorize them and and so forth

592
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:50,000
but I guess one question is just how to think about that kind of inquiry how to think about how

593
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,040
that kind of inquiry relates to normal scientific inquiry as it's normally

594
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:01,040
practiced and I guess it just seems to me kind of an open question but I mean maybe this is another

595
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:06,560
way of putting my view though I don't really know how we should think about like the nature of science

596
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:13,360
but I am confident that phenomenology is a thing that we can do that we can like make progress in

597
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:22,320
and that we can investigate systematically in the same way that we investigate other subject

598
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:28,720
matters and whether that's called science or not I don't really care but I'm interested in

599
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,920
figuring out how we can advance that mode of inquiry that's that's really beautifully put

600
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,120
because the next part of my conducting experiment would be let's say life of life after death right

601
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:45,120
and so if you would die and it would be life after death then in a way to me that's an empirical

602
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:50,800
question or like a scientific question so you die and then now you you know there's some kind of

603
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,480
life after death kind of things like nobody would say that this is somehow unscientific that you

604
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:01,040
now have that belief that there's life after death now that that has happened to you do you see what

605
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,240
I'm saying but it's a single person issue it's like only only you could have that empirical

606
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:14,560
experience and so so that that seems to me again it's a madness but it seems to me then if we if

607
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:21,040
we open consciousness science that we allow for a single person first person experiences to count

608
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:26,800
to gain knowledge for each of us on their own then some of these obstacles might go away so

609
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,120
maybe even you know some experiments like Mary's the famous Mary's room and so on it seemed

610
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:40,480
solvable to me when you when you drop this heart insistence on but it has to be third person has

611
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:48,880
to be communicable uh anyways uh I know there's a little out there but it does it does pertain to

612
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,840
the qualia space's question a little bit because it is more introspective than I think the push that

613
00:58:53,840 --> 00:59:00,320
psychophysics did which is that was like the first aim to mathematicize phenomenology and it really

614
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:06,480
went out of his way to to not talk about any first person thing ever so there was no introspective

615
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,800
component and so it seems to me that some of the breakthrough that has happened or the progress

616
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:17,280
that's going on is by softening that requirement a little bit yeah I know I mean I think that

617
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,640
provides a nice way of seeing a bit about a bit more about my own attitude towards these

618
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:28,000
pathological points I guess I'm inclined to think that we ought to use a combination of both

619
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,880
first person and third person methods in investigating consciousness and that's what I try to do in my

620
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:41,280
own research and I mean I think this my work on quality space models is a nice example of that

621
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:47,520
because the motivation in my view for thinking that there is precision in the first place comes

622
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:53,600
from introspection just seems very plausible introspectively that foveal color experiences

623
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:58,000
are phenomenologically distinct from peripheral color experiences but then I think we can also get

624
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,400
third person support from that by looking at differences in discriminatory abilities of people

625
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,840
in say foveal vision versus peripheral vision where one of the natural explanations for why

626
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,720
there are those differences is because there are differences in the associated experiences

627
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:20,000
and then we can also apply formal methods and think about how do we capture all of this you

628
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:29,120
know mathematically and then apply those formal methods to you know further stages of inquiry so

629
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:36,560
I tend to be quite holistic in the the methodology that I think we should adopt and I mean one reason

630
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,640
is that you know consciousness is just really hard and really difficult to investigate and we

631
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:46,800
should use whatever tools are available to us and that's not to presume that all any of these tools

632
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:54,960
is like infallible or trumps all the others but we can still use a combination to try to like

633
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:02,320
figure out whatever we're trying to attain more knowledge of. Yeah and I think that the success

634
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,520
in a way also speaks for itself if you make progress and there's a success then you don't

635
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,840
have to question the premises even anymore. I guess one of my main projects right now is

636
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:18,080
on dimensions of consciousness and trying to develop a philosophical analysis of dimensions

637
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,680
of consciousness so that's a term that you sometimes see in the science of consciousness

638
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:30,080
and you sometimes see what are called multi-dimensional models of consciousness

639
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,640
there have been some proposals for what the dimensions of consciousness might be but what

640
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,720
nobody has really done yet is develop a systematic analysis of what the relevant

641
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:44,720
meaning of dimensions of consciousness is here and part of why I became interested in this is that

642
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:50,160
I think there's one natural sense of dimensions of consciousness where it's just obvious that

643
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,000
consciousness has an extremely high number of dimensions so in particular if you think of

644
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,320
dimensions of consciousness as just ways in which conscious experiences vary from each other

645
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:02,400
then there's going to be innumerably many ways in which conscious experiences can vary from each

646
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,240
other but I think there's also a sense of dimensions of consciousness where it might turn out that

647
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:13,120
consciousness in this sense has a low number of dimensions and where searching for the dimensions

648
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:19,360
of consciousness is going to be an important task for future consciousness research so one of my

649
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:24,160
projects right now is trying to identify what this more interesting constrained sense of dimensions

650
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:30,720
of consciousness is and articulating how this has implications for consciousness science

651
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:37,920
so how is this related to modality so you know having smell or vision those seem like natural

652
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,600
different dimensions that people think of is that is that part of what you're interested in or is

653
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:48,160
it more about that your the idea is that your consciousness could be graded and you could be

654
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,680
very conscious or less conscious so that's one axis yeah well I think both of those are related

655
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,760
so one observation is that I think it's fine to call different sensory modalities different

656
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,080
dimensions of consciousness but one thing that we should notice there is that these dimensions

657
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:09,840
are not themselves one dimensional so for example visual experiences like there's all sorts of

658
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,000
different ways in which visual experiences vary so visual experience itself it's going to be

659
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,720
very high dimensional so part of the task here is thinking about what the sense of dimensions

660
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:26,720
of consciousness is that allows us to make sense of these sorts of claims like different sensory

661
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,280
modalities are dimensions of consciousness you might wonder what justifies the claim that vision is

662
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,680
a dimension of consciousness but not like pink experience why isn't that why doesn't that count

663
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:40,720
as a dimension of consciousness but you also mentioned this idea about great ability and I

664
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:47,280
think that that's also connected to thinking about this issue so for example think about global

665
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:53,680
workspace theory you might have thought that there's an interesting sense in which say size

666
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:58,480
of global workspace might be a dimension of consciousness that is different from the sense

667
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:04,880
in which say color experience might be a dimension of consciousness it seems like the first property

668
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:12,000
gets closer to something more fundamental or more at the heart of what consciousness is

669
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,480
then the second thing I'm fascinated because it seems like a really difficult question to me

670
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:24,480
because I've always been struck when it comes to personalities people are at first glance dazzled

671
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,720
in the same way as you said that it seems that it's almost infinite dimensional because you said that

672
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:33,360
if you think about different people the same thing as you said if you have different experiences

673
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:38,720
they seem to be so distinguished from each other and so that screams many many dimensions right

674
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:45,040
but if you do careful empirical testing what you find is that all personalities of people can be

675
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:51,600
with I don't know how many 90 something percent of the variance can be done in five dimensions

676
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:58,640
and to me that's always been a very surprising result that it seems that if you would into it

677
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:04,480
you would think that the dimensionality space is much higher for personality and so that's right

678
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,000
so if we're trying to capture all differences in personality we're definitely going to need

679
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:16,080
more than just five dimensions but I guess these like the ocean model of personality is intended to

680
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:21,280
abstract away from certain differences while capturing some of the most robust and universal

681
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,680
differences in personality that there are and we could do the same thing for consciousness we could

682
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,160
develop a multi-dimensional model where we abstract away from certain differences

683
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:36,240
while trying to also identify dimensions that are as universal as possible I mentioned one more

684
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:41,440
thing though that is connected to the your mark about great ability because one of the other things

685
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:48,000
that I'm working on is on degrees of consciousness yeah and you know so if you spend enough time in

686
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,720
the conscious world you occasionally hear things like a human is more conscious than a fish or

687
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,840
people become more conscious while on psychedelic drugs and a lot of philosophers have been skeptical

688
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,560
of the coherence of these sorts of claims and have thought that well maybe people who are making

689
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:08,800
these claims are just kind of conceptually confused but my view is that we don't know whether these

690
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:13,360
claims are true or not but there's nothing semantically defective about these sorts of claims

691
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:20,560
these claims are still makes sense and so one of my recent publications titled degrees of

692
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:25,840
consciousness is arguing that is giving an account of what it means to say that consciousness comes

693
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:31,520
in degrees and arguing that most theories of consciousness actually entail that consciousness

694
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,880
comes in degrees and that's something that that's a publication that came out last year but I'm also

695
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:42,400
doing some follow-up work right now with Poppy Mankiewicz a philosopher of language at Bristol

696
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,840
on the semantics of gradable conscious expressions so for example sentences like a human is more

697
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:53,680
conscious than a fish and our goal is to examine more closely the semantics of these sorts of claims

698
01:06:53,680 --> 01:07:00,320
using resources from philosophy of language and linguistics so that's that's another project that

699
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:04,800
I'm working on that's directly connected to the great ability stuff if I if I may jump in

700
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:11,680
there very quick so I saw some of you presented some of that on Naoto Kias YouTube channel and I

701
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:17,600
thought you did something interesting there which is that you said that consciousness may be graded

702
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:24,480
and at the same time the the issue that the the problem that that people often have with that

703
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:31,920
idea is that whether you're conscious or not seems so much of qualitative rather than just a

704
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:39,520
quantitative change and it's very hard to imagine that how can you go from zero consciousness to

705
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:47,280
some kind of consciousness that the moment that you even give it an infinitesimally small kind

706
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,120
of consciousness now you have something else it's conscious and in nature that doesn't seem to happen

707
01:07:53,120 --> 01:08:00,400
right so in nature you talked about volume and other physical quantities in the end they are actually

708
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:06,640
not continuous all the way down in the end we know that there's a plank limit to everything

709
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,400
and there's a discrete jump from something to a certain amount of time a certain amount of space

710
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,080
and so on right and so it sounded to me like you're granting that for consciousness as well

711
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,600
that you're saying there might be almost like a plank limit and then once you go above it then

712
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,240
it's gradable but that doesn't mean it has to be gradable all the way down there could be some

713
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:28,000
not discontinuity between no conscious and some consciousness yeah so that's that's a nice way

714
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,840
of putting it in that's basically the view that i'm most sympathetic to so one question is whether

715
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:43,040
it can be indeterminate or vague whether an entity is conscious or not where it has just an

716
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:48,400
intermediate degree of consciousness meaning it's not yet conscious it's like on the borderline between

717
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,640
not conscious and conscious and speaking for myself i'm not sure how to make sense of that it

718
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:58,480
seems to me like that's conceptually incoherent but then another question is whether consciousness

719
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:03,280
comes in degrees meaning some entities are more conscious than others and it could be the kind

720
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:08,720
of picture that you just articulated where you get this instant jump from non-conscious to conscious

721
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:14,480
but once you're in the conscious domain then some creatures can be more conscious than others

722
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:21,520
yeah that's that's really in a way you solved i think a sticking point for a lot of people there

723
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,920
it is compatible it seems to me with integrated information theory and maybe some other theories

724
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,040
as well so it's really interesting well it's certainly compatible with iot i think it kind of

725
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:38,800
i mean i'm i'm the most people are either very pro or anti iot i'm somebody who's very neutral i

726
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:45,200
guess but i think this is one sometimes iot has been criticized on the grounds that they appeal to

727
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:51,120
degrees of consciousness they say that five values are a measure of how conscious an entity is

728
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:56,800
and some people have thought that well it's not clear that this even makes sense but my attitude

729
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,360
is that it does make sense it's fine for them to postulate that it could be that they're the

730
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,080
theories false but the mere fact that they're saying that some entities are more conscious than

731
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,800
others that's fine because if you really do think that what consciousness is is just having a

732
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:15,920
maximal degree of integrated information then it's natural to think that you know if you have more

733
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,680
integrated information going on in your system then i do then you're more conscious than me

734
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,520
cool so and what else are you working on you said dimensionality we got the

735
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,480
continuity how do you call it grading of consciousness uh degrees of consciousness

736
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:40,480
conscious maybe just one more thing i am working on something on consciousness and continuity

737
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:44,720
and whether we should think of our conscious experiences as having continuous or discrete

738
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:49,680
structures and in particular whether we have any introspective reason for thinking that

739
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:55,440
they're continuous so some some people have thought that you know if you think about your

740
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:02,000
experience of like the blue sky on a cloudless day there's no gaps in that experience so that

741
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,760
experience must be continuous because there's no there's in some sense no appearance reality

742
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,880
distinction in the case of consciousness and what it is for something to be continuous is

743
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:19,200
just for it to have no gaps but i think that that's a bit too hasty i think that introspection

744
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:24,400
just doesn't reveal to us whether our experiences are fundamentally continuous or discrete that

745
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:30,880
it's more of an empirical question and basically what that paper is doing is clarifying what it

746
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:38,400
means to say that an experience is continuous or discrete and providing what a discrete model of

747
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,640
those sorts of experiences like your experience of the blue sky and upon a cloudless day might look

748
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:49,520
like and arguing that we just don't really know at the moment which which view is correct

749
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:56,720
do you the the more natural way to go there would be time right the perception of time and

750
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:03,840
there's a lot of work on that yeah well what does it look like i think it does translate i'm

751
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,520
thinking about continuity in a general sense so it could be applied to temporal experience or

752
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,800
spatial experience or or any domain and when we're thinking about temporal experience it's a little

753
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,960
bit tricky we have to distinguish the timing of experience from the experience of time that's

754
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:26,880
how people would have put it sometimes so there's the objective time that an experience is

755
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:35,040
occurring during and then there's also what it feels like temporally to have the experience

756
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,200
and it could be that those two things come apart for example you could in principle have a view where

757
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:44,560
maybe experiences occur at an instant but each experience that occurs at an instant feels like

758
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:51,920
it's occurring over some extended period of time so i'm just concerned with the phenomenology

759
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:57,040
i'm concerned with in this case whether we have any reason to think that temporal phenomenology

760
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:03,600
is continuous as opposed to just to discrete whereas most work that has fallen under the label

761
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:10,480
of consciousness and continuity has been concerned with the timing of experience so the objective

762
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:17,280
time during which experiences occur and i think you could these two issues are related but they're

763
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:24,960
also conceptually distinct the i guess the other difference is that my concern here is mainly with

764
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,040
do we have any introspective reason for thinking that our experiences are continuous because some

765
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,880
people have thought that we could just know from introspection that our experiences have these

766
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:38,640
structures but i think that when we really think about what continuity means and what it would entail

767
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,320
for our experiences to be continuous i mean that would be kind of incredible if we could

768
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,560
like just introspect that our experiences have that kind of structure instead i think it's more

769
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:52,320
appropriate to think that we we just don't know from introspection whether our experiences are

770
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:59,040
continuous or discrete it this is again seems to be like a really important question because

771
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:05,120
if we're thinking about formalizing the structure of consciousness that is really important whether

772
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:10,240
you know this could all be done with discrete math or whether we have to deal with infinities

773
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:15,280
right that makes everything ugly and it's also maybe related to the people that come from cs

774
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:21,600
where everything is discrete by definition and we kind of learned that there's so much you can do

775
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:27,280
with just sticking to the discrete that maybe there is no need for for continuous

776
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,920
yeah well sometimes infinities make things ugly sometimes they make things easier

777
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:38,960
but i mean for example it's when we're thinking in geometrical or topological context it's much

778
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,080
more natural to be working with continuous structures than with discrete structures but

779
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,720
i think this also connects to interesting questions about quality spaces too so we might wonder

780
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:53,920
whether we should think of them as graphs or as as manifolds and i think that's a big question too

781
01:14:53,920 --> 01:15:00,560
that's just kind of open yeah that's right but i think what i'm getting at is that like if your

782
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,560
math has this whole debate about you know there's the final test and so on but in a way it's funny

783
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:10,560
because when it comes to doing the actual calculations we typically just apply discrete math right so

784
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:16,400
we we just round pi to a certain decimal point and so on we'll do just fine we can do a lot of

785
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:23,200
geometry in a computer even though we can't deal with the infinite and so if if so in a way

786
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,760
if we think about that we want to do something similar with consciousness and structure of

787
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,880
consciousness it might help simplify that we could just break it down and deal with things

788
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,440
discreetly yeah no i think that's absolutely right and we should distinguish the question of

789
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:43,280
which kinds of models are most useful and what is the actual structure of the of the thing

790
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:47,680
we're investigating i mean the original idea of psychophysics is that perception is discrete

791
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:52,800
right so the the color space actually that that fechner envisioned was that it's very regional

792
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,920
actually right so that you have these just noticeable differences and then the point of

793
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:01,440
subjective equality so so actually in in the mind of a psychophysicist it's all like a step

794
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,120
function where you go from i can't tell a difference to now i can't tell a difference

795
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:10,560
and so yeah so it really does help i mean in that case when fechner came along it helped

796
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:16,000
because it gave rise to the idea that perception can't have numerosity and so for that you needed

797
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:22,240
that discreteness that i can't count in units of perception by saying it's thresholds you're just

798
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:27,440
noticeable differences go from one to two and so on and so yeah so it seems a really interesting

799
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:32,960
important question at the same time intuitively as you said that's really hard to have read your

800
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,320
to wrap your head around because it seems that yeah of course everything seems continuous

801
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:44,560
yeah so i i guess i think that once we think carefully about it it doesn't i mean i do think

802
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:50,320
we don't notice gaps in our experiences that's definitely right right but then whether we

803
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,720
should infer from that that our experiences seem continuous to us in the mathematical sense of

804
01:16:54,720 --> 01:17:01,840
continuity that that that's the point that i want to resist and i think that for all we know

805
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,320
even though it is the case that our experiences aren't gappy they could still be discreet now

806
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,040
so the the empirical examples of gappy experiences like the blind spot and all of this

807
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:15,200
there you have filling in a certain way that would be interpolation and you could still argue it's

808
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:21,120
continuous space right so you have a gap it just gets intimidated yeah but you're going you're

809
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,760
going further and you're saying no it could actually it could be fundamentally pixelized

810
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:32,800
basically and you wouldn't know yeah that's interesting i mean one like way to put the

811
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:38,320
general thought is that to notice a gap you have to notice the things that would fill in the gap

812
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:44,080
right but then of course we can't experience we're not experiencing the things that would

813
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:48,480
fill in the gap because the it would mean that our experience is different than it actually is

814
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,640
it's it's also as a neuroscientist this is such an interesting thing actually because

815
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,000
neurons in a way are discreet right so they they fire action potentials and so if we think that

816
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,160
it's action potentials that are causing perception it's very hard to think that that would be a

817
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:10,080
really continuous thing because it is discretized at that level of information or whatever we want

818
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,560
to call it right so when it comes to a color perception that's what i'm thinking about explicitly

819
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,680
then i think again we get fooled because we're dealing with light as a starting point and that

820
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:24,320
discontinues the waveforms there but our color perception the way that that that i teach about

821
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,080
it is that we think of the three photoreceptors and how much they get activated and that's

822
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,960
discreet that isn't how many action potentials they fire so that space the color space that i

823
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:39,120
teach is a discrete space it can't be continuous because it has basically three three vectors

824
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:47,040
that have discretized activations yeah so then another angle from which to think about this

825
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:53,280
question is that if we did think that introspection reveals that our experiences are continuous

826
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,960
then you might think that that place is substantive constraints on what the physical

827
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:04,000
correlates of our experiences might be and rules out some of the most prominent possibilities for

828
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,520
thinking about those physical correlates but then that seems well that i mean that would be a pretty

829
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:15,280
substantive implication but yeah i guess i think that we shouldn't rule out those you're still

830
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:22,480
agnostic possibilities yeah that's interesting okay cool real brief maybe you said there's a fourth

831
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:29,520
one you're working on sure i mean maybe i'll just briefly mention so one thing i'm working on outside

832
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:36,080
the structure of experiences i have various kinds of work on the ethics of consciousness

833
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:41,600
i'm interested in understanding generally how consciousness is ethically significant both

834
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:48,880
with respect to our own welfare and with respect to morality and one of my new papers is called

835
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:54,320
consciousness makes things matter where i argue basically that consciousness is what makes an

836
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:59,440
entity the kind of thing that can be doing well or badly and i think relatedly is the basis for

837
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:05,440
moral status so that's a view that i think many people feel intuitively compelled by but which

838
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:11,840
hasn't actually received any sustained defense in the philosophical literature so that's

839
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:17,840
that's one new thing that i'm working on in the ethics of consciousness and just one example of

840
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:22,880
like i guess a bit of my work outside of the structure of consciousness oh wow you really

841
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,360
have a a knack for really interesting things i mean this is one where you really got me because

842
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:34,080
i'm very skeptical of of attributing functions to consciousness and yet as you said that is very

843
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:40,960
intuitive that is that is very compelling argument yeah it's very it's relevant to right as ai is

844
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:47,040
marching along as yeah i mean there's i mean there's been so much discussion like in the last

845
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:52,560
few months about about that sort of stuff in the context of ai and usually the people are just

846
01:20:52,560 --> 01:21:00,240
implicitly assuming that consciousness is the basis for welfare and for moral status and i mean i

847
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,920
as i said i endorse those intuitions but i think it's also interesting thinking about

848
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,880
what the most careful philosophical defense of that view is interesting very interesting

849
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,800
wow yeah so that was a lot that was very cool so i hope we can repeat this at some point this is

850
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:23,040
very exciting so thank you so much again andrew that was really cool and did you have any parting

851
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:30,880
thoughts of ideas no i mean i'm looking forward to you know where your channel is going and yeah

852
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,680
i mean thanks a lot for bringing me on i really enjoyed the conversation and you've also inspired

853
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:42,960
me to you know maybe try to create my own youtube channel as i was saying at the beginning but yeah

854
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:48,800
i'm looking forward to what you do in the future with the channel and i think there will be as i said

855
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:56,320
it's an exciting time to be part of this this field yeah perfect and everything your website and

856
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:05,600
everything else will be in the description below for people to find so thanks so much thank you
