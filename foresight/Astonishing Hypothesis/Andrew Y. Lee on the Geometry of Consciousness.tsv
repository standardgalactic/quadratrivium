0	15000	I'm very excited to talk to you today, Andrew.
15000	20000	You are a rising star in the field for mathematics of consciousness science and to me, that's
20000	21360	no wonder.
21360	24600	And that's because I'm no philosopher, I know very little about philosophy, but I watched
24600	29360	your talks that are already on YouTube and I was able to understand them and they made
29360	30360	a lot of sense to me.
30360	38640	So I will link below the links to those talks that got me so excited and what really stuck
38640	47420	out to me with your work is the rigor that goes into your thinking and that even translates
47420	56080	into how you present your thoughts and the clarity with which you present and what drives
56080	57080	your thinking.
57080	63880	And this seems like such a welcome thing in the fields of consciousness that for a lot
63880	68800	of people seems to be characterized by the opposite by some kind of fluffiness.
68800	72440	And so this kind of rigor and clarity I think is solely needed.
72440	77440	And I got quite excited that one of your last talks when you believe that real progress
77440	82600	can be made by formalizing things about the structure of consciousness and phenomenal
82600	83600	experience.
83600	85880	So I'm very excited to hear about that today from you.
85880	86880	Thank you, Alex.
86880	88800	I mean, that's really nice for me to hear.
88800	96400	And yeah, I'm glad that the aim that I bring in my work is to have clarity and precision.
96400	98800	So I'm glad that's coming through.
98800	102560	Can you tell me how you got into this mess?
102560	108640	What got you interested in consciousness and also your academic vita that got you to this
108640	111000	point and what you're doing right now?
111000	112000	Yeah.
112000	117200	So I guess it started for me when I was 16 and still in high school.
117200	123160	And at that time, I was a fairly good student, but, you know, I wasn't really inspired by
123160	125080	any academic subjects.
125080	130120	I did find in my classes, but I wasn't really that interested in anything.
130120	134080	But then there were two things that really changed that for me.
134080	139880	So one was reading Goro Escherbach by Douglas Hofstadter.
139880	145320	And the second was reading David Chalmers on philosophical zombies and the heart problem
145320	147480	of consciousness.
147480	150640	Those two texts were really transformative for me.
150640	154960	And I guess after that, I just became fascinated by consciousness.
154960	161800	And I was really gripped by the fact that each of us is intimately acquainted with our
161800	167280	own conscious experiences, but it still was this phenomenon that remained little understood.
167280	173200	It was still one of these remaining great mysteries about the natural world.
173200	179080	So in that respect, I guess consciousness was the first thing that really sparked my
179080	184360	academic interest and that spark has never really fully left me.
184360	190160	Also, I really liked the purity and generality of analytic philosophy.
190160	197120	And I went into college wanting to study philosophy and consciousness in particular.
197760	201080	I was pretty lucky in my undergrad experience.
201080	207960	So I went to Brown University and there happened to be this community of undergrads that were
207960	213040	there at the same time that were also into philosophy and a bunch of us were into philosophy
213040	214040	of mind.
214040	219240	So we had this department undergraduate group where we met every couple of weeks and talked
219240	220680	about different philosophical topics.
220680	226040	And I felt like I was really able to benefit from just having lots of conversations with
226080	228840	peers, even when I was an undergrad.
228840	235480	And I mean, my interest in consciousness kind of stuck with me throughout the whole of college.
235480	242160	And I eventually decided to apply to grad school and to try to become a philosopher of consciousness.
242160	248040	And I was lucky enough to get into NYU for my PhD, where I was able to work with David
248040	253560	Chalmers, as well as Ned Block and Thomas Nagel, all of whom were some of my intellectual
253560	254880	heroes.
254880	260600	And I mean, so it's pretty common for people's interests to change during the course of grad
260600	263600	school, but consciousness never really left me.
263600	268960	And I mean, nowadays I do work on a number of philosophical issues outside of consciousness.
268960	276840	I've like tainted my peer record, but consciousness has always been at the heart of my philosophical
276840	280840	interests and the structure of consciousness in particular, that's at the heart of my interest
280840	282840	in consciousness.
282840	289000	Yeah, and what got you that is such an interesting thing because it seems that different people
289000	292520	from different parts of the planet at the same time started thinking along those lines.
292520	298480	So what was it about structure that got you the most interest about consciousness?
298480	301160	Yeah, no, it's a great question.
301160	306280	So to start, I guess I've just long thought that these sorts of questions, questions about
306280	311400	the structure of consciousness are both really interesting, but also really underexplored.
311640	317960	And I think maybe one reason for the why they're underexplored is that there are many people
317960	324520	in, including myself, who have been kind of seduced by classic philosophical questions
324520	328360	about the fundamental nature of consciousness, you know, like the heart problem, philosophical
328360	332040	zombies, Mary's room, all that stuff.
332040	333480	And I think I think that's great.
333480	338480	I mean, I care a lot about those sorts of questions and I think they're important questions.
338640	342560	I also think that consciousness research, and especially the philosophy of consciousness,
342560	345600	has been overly dominated by those sorts of questions.
347520	351280	I mean, there's so many interesting theoretical questions about consciousness that go beyond
351280	354560	the heart problem, including questions about the structure of consciousness.
354560	358960	And I think some people might have the impression that philosophy of consciousness is just about
358960	362960	those questions about the fundamental nature, but I think there's a whole lot more
362960	368480	there. And that's part of what I'm trying to develop and investigate and uncover in my own
368480	374800	research. I guess one thing is that, I mean, at the same time, investigating the structure of
374800	379680	consciousness is really hard. And maybe that's part of why these questions are underexplored as
379680	385760	well. It's oftentimes not obvious how to make progress. And, you know, if you, so if you
385760	390160	introspect your own conscious experience right now, you'll find that it's obvious that it's
390160	395520	richly structured, but how exactly to think about that structure, what kinds of models or
395520	399040	tools we should use for characterizing that structure, those are really difficult questions.
399680	403840	But I think these are also super important questions and the kinds of questions that we'll
403840	408960	need to tackle in order to really make progress in consciousness research. And in fact, if you
408960	414640	look at other sciences, you know, physics, biology, psychology, whatever, in general,
414640	419440	as a scientific field develops, it starts to move away from essence questions or questions about
419440	425200	the fundamental nature of the entity study and instead to structural questions or questions about
425200	430400	how the entities of the domain are related to each other, how to model those relations.
431040	436880	And right now, consciousness research is still dominated by a focus on essence questions.
436880	440080	You know, the biggest question in the philosophy of consciousness is, what is the fundamental
440080	443520	nature of consciousness? And the biggest question in the science of consciousness is,
444080	449280	what physical properties make a conscious, make a system conscious versus not? But
450560	455840	my, I suspect that if you look at consciousness research a century from now, if we were able
455840	460480	to do that somehow, we would see a much greater focus on structural questions.
461840	466480	It's very interesting, because often with that development in science has also been
467120	474080	the formalization and mathematician. And that is also something that you and other people
474080	480960	interested in the structure have been championing as well. And so there's an analog that often
480960	487440	leads to progress as well, because you're leaving behind the woolly words, you're boiling it down
487440	492800	to something that is much more rigorous. So I'm curious what led you into that direction to
493760	498720	use formal tools and combine that with your interest in the structure of consciousness?
500000	505840	I mean, I guess part of what led me in that direction is basically just agreement with the
505840	510480	thought that you were expressing that one of the best ways of sharpening and systematizing
510480	517120	our inquiry into a phenomenon is to figure out how to use mathematical tools for modeling it
517120	522080	or understanding it. And as I said, I think that's really hard in the case of consciousness,
522080	528560	but I think that quality spaces, which we'll talk about more later, that's one of the ways
528560	535760	in to start doing that in the case of consciousness. I guess also, maybe this is another way of
535760	544800	expressing why I was motivated and gravitated towards this kind of topic. So there's this
544800	550160	famous passage at the end of Thomas Naples, What Does It Like to Be a Bet?, where he says,
551120	555520	Investigating consciousness is really hard, but maybe it would be more tractable if we could
555520	561280	somehow develop an objective phenomenology or a way of understanding conscious experiences that
561280	567200	doesn't require one to have had the experiences under question. And this passage is really well
567200	574000	known, but most people react to it with thought that, well, that sounds cool, but what would this
574000	578480	look like? It's not clear what an objective phenomenology would be or whether that's even
578480	585280	coherent or makes sense. So one of my most recent publications is entitled Objective
585280	589680	Phenomenology and argues that it is indeed possible to develop an objective phenomenology
589680	594880	and that the way of doing so is to investigate the structure of consciousness. So basically,
594880	600320	my view is that purely structural facts about consciousness, for example, the kinds of facts
600320	606400	captured by mathematical models, those are objective phenomenal facts. And that's a way of
606480	612560	doing objective phenomenology. And the paper I mentioned of mine was published just last year,
612560	618560	but the basic ideas behind it have been a guiding thought and guiding motivation behind my work
618560	624560	for a number of years. So I think that's another way of explaining or justifying why
625760	629680	a focus on the structure of consciousness and in particular on figuring out ways to
629680	634560	mathematically model different aspects of consciousness experiences is interesting and
634560	639200	promising and maybe will help pave the way towards progress in consciousness research.
639760	644320	But this might come a little bit out of the left wing maybe, but there's something deeper,
644320	650400	almost mysterious in the fact that if you really boil down science and you really think about all
650400	655200	of this, it's almost like mathematics is all there is. I don't know, you can go as extreme as
655200	659040	Max Teckmark maybe to really say that it's almost ontological in nature, but isn't it,
659840	665200	what you said really brings so true in my thinking as well that when science is at its best,
665200	670080	it just comes up with a bunch of equations. And so it seems exciting that we might have
670080	675840	reached a point in consciousness research that we can use the same language. And so when Galileo
675840	679280	Galilei said the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics, that we now
679280	683760	reached a chapter where it comes to consciousness. And we can start maybe reading it in the same
683760	688560	language. So that seems very exciting at the same time mysterious maybe that just works.
690000	695440	Yeah, well, so a couple thoughts there. One is that I think we're still pretty far off from
695440	699680	actually being able to do that with consciousness, just because I think we're still very much in
699680	706720	the early stages of inquiring about consciousness and and figuring it out. So one analogy I like
706720	713600	to make is that we're sort of in this pre Newtonian stage in investigating consciousness,
713600	717600	a stage analogous to creating Newton and investigating the physical world where
718240	722560	part of what we're trying to do is figure out the basic insights that will enable
722560	728640	systematic mathematical theories in the future. And you know, it's really hard to break past that
728640	735840	basic stage. That's part of why like Newtonian physics was so remarkable. So I guess in my mind
735840	743280	we're very much at the early stages. And maybe we're on the cusp of developing more sophisticated
743280	748080	mathematical models. But I think there's still a lot of work in just figuring out how do we think
748080	752880	about the structure of consciousness in the first place and then what kinds of formalisms will be
752880	757200	useful for for thinking about that. But then to return to the first part of what you were saying.
757840	762400	So one of the lines of thought you might have about the physical world is you might
763280	768320	some people are sympathetic to a kind of Pythagoreanism where everything is just math,
768320	772960	there's no there's nothing more to the world than just mathematical structures. And similarly,
772960	777600	you might take a similar attitude towards consciousness. Maybe consciousness is just
777600	783200	more math. There's not all this like intrinsic Pauli stuff. It's just it's just mathematical
783200	788960	structures. And I'm somebody who's very pro investigating the structure of consciousness.
788960	793680	But I'm also somebody who thinks that there's more to consciousness than just structure. I think that
795040	798800	investigating the structure of consciousness will tell us a whole lot about consciousness. It'll
798800	803360	give us these frameworks for thinking about it more systematically, but it's not going to capture
803360	807920	everything. And I think part of what is in fact remarkable about consciousness and interesting
807920	816400	about it is that it's a phenomenon that consists of more than just structure. And even if we developed
816400	822720	the best mathematical models we possibly could, I think that they would still be leaving something
822720	827920	out, they wouldn't be inadequate, they might capture all the structural aspects of consciousness.
827920	836000	But I'm somebody who thinks that there's qualia in the most robust real sense that you might think.
840000	847360	If I may push on that a little bit, then what do you think of this idea that maybe when it comes
847360	852560	to science, though, that what science can explain might then maybe be limited to the structure,
852560	855920	maybe when it comes to the whole world and consciousness. So in other words, so maybe
855920	860080	it is true that there are things that are hard problems that beyond scientists reach, but at
860080	866720	least now we have something here that we can pull on and become more scientific about it. And it has
866720	872160	this promise that it falls into the fold of mathematical understanding of the world as we
872160	878800	have in physics and other disciplines. Yeah, I mean, I think that's a really interesting idea.
878880	888160	And I'm not sure what my own view on that is yet. So that's partly because I think
888160	893920	it's kind of up for grabs, what we think of as the nature of the science of consciousness
893920	899360	and the scope of scientific investigation in general. I guess I'm somebody who's
899360	903680	fairly sympathetic to the general thought that scientific investigation aims to tell us about
903680	907280	the structure of the world. But you might think that in the case of consciousness,
907280	911440	there's an exception. There's a different kind of epistemic relationship that we bear to our
911440	915680	own conscious experiences than that we bear to the external world. We're in direct contact with
915680	919840	our own conscious experiences in a way that we're not in direct contact with the external world.
919840	926080	And because of that, we're able to apply our knowledge, not just of the structure of the domain
926080	933840	under investigation, but also its intrinsic nature. I guess I do think that everything I just said
933840	939120	is true. But the thing that I feel unsure about is, how should we think about the scope of the
939120	945120	science of consciousness? Is it the case that in acquiring knowledge of and investigating the
945120	949200	qualitative character of our experiences, is that within the purview of the science of consciousness,
949200	955280	or is it not? And I mean, in some ways, I think this is, but you might think, for example,
955280	960800	scientific investigation by nature has to produce public knowledge, and we can't have
960800	965040	public knowledge of the qualities of one's own experiences. That's something that
965040	971840	is essentially private. So anyway, I guess my thought is that there's an interesting question
971840	976720	here that concerns both how we should think about the scope of investigation into consciousness,
976720	980240	but also just how we should think about the nature of science in general.
980880	987040	Oh, that's very interesting. In fact, Ken, push you on the more crazy things. So you brought up
987040	992160	Newton, right? And so there's an interesting piece of history there that maybe we can learn from.
992160	996800	And so my understanding is that it was quite important for him that he basically the way
996800	1002640	discovered or invented calculus to then make progress in physics. And so the question that
1002640	1007440	I have is, do you think that we might also have to work on a mathematics side of things? And maybe
1007440	1012080	that will help us to learn what breakthroughs in the science of consciousness. Yeah, I think that's
1012080	1016720	a really interesting question too. I guess I don't see any positive reason for thinking that.
1017600	1021840	It seems to me that the difficulties with figuring out how to mathematically model our
1021840	1028080	conscious experiences don't lie on the side of, oh, we need more sophisticated or just novel
1028640	1035200	mathematical frameworks or formalisms, but instead that it's just really not obvious how to think
1035200	1041040	about the target of inquiry that we're trying to develop mathematical models of. So I mean, in the
1041040	1047920	case of quality spaces, it's not like the mathematical structures that we need to appeal to
1047920	1055760	are particularly new or novel or anything. They're like geometric spaces and things that are fairly
1055760	1060160	familiar. Maybe it's the case that there will be certain aspects of conscious experiences where
1060160	1065680	we just don't have anything in our current mathematical repertoire that adequately captures
1065680	1071920	that structure. But I guess in the absence of a compelling example, I'm inclined to think that
1071920	1078720	the default is to just assume that, well, the difficulty just lies on getting a better qualitative
1078720	1085280	understanding of the domain under consideration rather than on the tools that we have for modeling
1085280	1091360	that domain. Yeah, that's convincing. So maybe this might be a good point to lead into what you
1091360	1097760	prepared. We might have weathered everybody's appetite on how can this be done to talk more
1097760	1105600	formally about the structure of consciousness and quality of spaces. Okay, so I prepared a
1105600	1112080	brief presentation of the ideas in one of my articles, Vaudelay Mental Qualities, that was
1112080	1118160	published, well, I guess not last year, two years ago now, in the Journal of Philosophical Review.
1118720	1125680	And I'm going to just provide a pretty brief overview of the core ideas from this article
1125680	1132400	and mention a few of the interesting questions or applications that arise from the frameworks that
1132400	1139600	I developed. So I'll keep it pretty short and compact. So the central question that I'm
1139600	1145680	investigated that I'm interested in here is how do we model the qualities of
1146400	1152160	conscious experiences, qualities like those involved in seeing red or feeling pain,
1153120	1160720	smelling cinnamon. And my article is arguing that the standard approach for modeling these mental
1160720	1168880	qualities is inadequate, that it can't capture a certain core feature of our conscious experiences.
1168880	1172800	And then I develop a new framework that's more powerful and flexible and showcase some of the
1172800	1179280	applications of the framework. So maybe just start, let me introduce the concept of a quality
1179280	1184720	space model. This is probably familiar to many audience members, even if not by that name.
1184720	1191840	So a quality space model in general is a model of some domain of qualities, for example, colors,
1191840	1198320	sounds, smells. And the most famous example is the three-dimensional model of color experiences
1198320	1204720	that has huge saturation and brightness as dimensions. But there are quality space models
1204720	1208880	where at least potentially could be quality space models for just about any domain of
1208880	1215440	qualities, auditory, olfactory, and so forth. So these models are pretty remarkable for
1216320	1220160	people interested in consciousness. And in fact, I think this is a very under-explored
1220160	1227040	aspect of consciousness research. And one reason is that quality space models are one of the few
1227040	1234880	cases where we actually have systematic models of some aspect of conscious experiences and where
1234880	1240960	we know pretty well how to conduct empirical investigation and to develop mathematical formalisms.
1241600	1247920	Another reason is that quality space models are super general. Any domain of mental qualities
1247920	1253840	is going to be structured by similarity relations. And as soon as we have similarity, we can model
1253840	1260960	that domain of qualities using a geometric space. So if part of our goal is to map out the structures
1260960	1265600	and conscious experiences, then a significant part of that project is probably going to be
1266160	1270880	consistent developing quality space models for different domains of experiences.
1272240	1276480	Okay, so one very quick termological note. I'm using the term mental qualities here
1276480	1282000	and also in the article, but I'm treating that as synonymous with terms like phenomenal qualities
1282480	1290000	or quality. So the standard approach to quality space models, what I'll call the standard framework,
1290000	1296240	models mental qualities via points in geometric cold spaces, where the distances between points
1296240	1303680	correspond to degrees of phenomenal similarity. And you can kind of see this representation of
1303680	1308080	the three-dimensional model for color experiences in this picture here.
1308560	1315520	And the standard framework, it works pretty well, but one aspect of conscious experiences that it
1315520	1322240	doesn't really work so well for is what I call phenomenal precision. So to get a grip on precision,
1322240	1328320	think about the contrast between your full-view color experience of something as scarlet versus
1328320	1332960	your peripheral color experience of something as red. So your full-view color experience is more
1333040	1340400	precise than your peripheral color experience. And precision, in the sense that I'm using the term,
1340400	1346080	denotes a certain phenomenal property, a certain property of your experiences, namely the property
1346080	1350720	that contrasts your full-view color experience from your peripheral color experience.
1352160	1355680	Precision isn't just specific to color experience though. So think about, for example,
1355680	1360400	the phenomenal contrast between, say, hearing a sound that's muffled versus a sound that's clear
1360400	1367040	or touching a surface with your fingertips versus with your back. Those also plausibly
1367040	1374560	involve contrasts in precision. So there's this feature of an alvenology that is just an aspect
1374560	1380640	of our conscious experiences. And the standard framework has kind of an awkward time capturing
1380640	1384800	precision. And that's because the standard framework models mental qualities via points,
1385360	1390000	but imprecise qualities correspond to regions rather than points. At least that's a very
1390080	1396160	natural way of thinking about precision. There's more than I say in the paper to motivate this
1396800	1401920	appeal to regions. For example, some people think, well, couldn't we just add an extra dimension
1401920	1407680	before precision? And that would be one possibility, but I think that for various reasons, that
1407680	1414720	isn't the most appealing possibility for capturing precision. So a very natural move when we start
1414720	1421760	thinking about precision and quality space models is to move from modeling mental qualities using
1421760	1430880	points to using regions. And that's the move that I make in my paper. So it's a pretty basic idea,
1430880	1435360	represent mental qualities via regions and meaning sets of points instead of individual points.
1436000	1443920	But part of what I argue is that this pretty simple move is much more powerful and interesting than
1443920	1449760	you might initially think. And it enables rich new investigation into consciousness that's at the
1449760	1458160	intersection of philosophy and coccy and math. So there's a few constraints that we want on our
1458160	1464880	models if we are doing things in terms of regions rather than points. So first and foremost, we
1464880	1470000	want sizes of regions to correspond to degrees of precision. So the introduction of regions is
1470000	1476320	intended to provide a way of capturing precision. So experiences that are more imprecise will
1476320	1481920	correspond to bigger regions. And then we want one to one correspondence between what we call
1481920	1487040	permissible regions or regions that actually represent genuine possible mental qualities
1487040	1492640	and the qualities themselves. We want distance to inversely correspond to phenomenal similarity
1492640	1498480	and we want phenomenal identity when two qualities are indistinguishable to correspond to distance
1498480	1505120	here to occupy exactly the same location in the space. So in the paper itself, I go through
1505120	1509600	different elements of the regional framework and I explain how to think about them and the
1509600	1515920	substituted philosophical issues that arise. I'm not going to talk about that stuff. Instead of
1515920	1520640	all all I'm going to do here is I'm just going to mention a few interesting questions that arise
1520640	1525040	when we start thinking in terms of the regional framework and also some of the applications
1525040	1530560	that arise when we move to the regional framework. So here's one interesting question. We can ask
1531360	1539200	what kinds of regions actually represent possible qualities? So a region in my definition is just
1539200	1545120	any set of points and for any quality space model there's going to be all sorts of weirdly
1545120	1550480	structured sets of points where it's not obvious whether that's that corresponds to a real
1550480	1555280	phenomenal possibility. So for example you might wonder whether there could be experiences that
1555280	1560640	correspond to disconnected regions. Could you have a color experience that represents something
1560640	1566800	either as aquamarine or scarlet but no shades in between? You might wonder what that kind of
1566800	1575440	experience be like is such an experience possible? And those are philosophical and empirical questions
1575440	1579760	but what the regional framework enables us to do is to translate these into a more precise
1579760	1586800	mathematical language that allows us to ask these questions in a more precise way. And interestingly
1586800	1592160	it also makes it the case that different theories about the space and structure of possible
1592160	1597600	mental qualities will correspond to different formal constraints on the set of permissible regions.
1599040	1604400	So one thing to notice here is how the regional framework enables us to start theorizing about
1604400	1608720	the qualities of consciousness experiences more systematically. You know it would be difficult
1608800	1613680	to even formulate these questions in the first place without the use of this framework.
1613680	1618880	So I think that provides a glimpse of how the regional framework enables us to address
1618880	1624000	theoretical and empirical questions with greater precision and to raise new questions that we
1624000	1630080	previously lacked the conceptual tools to think about. That's one new interesting question that
1630080	1635040	arises when we move to the regional framework. Another interesting question concerns the metric.
1635040	1639840	So there's all sorts of ways of constructing a metric meaning a distance function on regions
1639840	1644640	assuming that we already have a well-defined notion of distance between points. So for example
1645280	1650400	one of the most commonly used metrics on regions is the least distance metric where the distance
1650400	1656080	between two regions is the distance between their closest points. Another common metric is the
1656080	1660720	average distance metric where the distance between two regions is the average distance between all
1660800	1668720	their points. And if we're seeking a metric that models phenomenal similarity then we're going to
1668720	1674560	need that metric to satisfy certain kinds of formal constraints. So for example we want every
1674560	1679840	region to have distance zero to itself since distance zero represents maximal similarity
1679840	1686720	meaning phenomenal identity. So once we identify these formal constraints it's a pretty substantive
1686720	1692240	and interesting question of figuring out which kind of metric on regions actually is the right one
1692240	1697200	for modeling phenomenal similarity. And one thing I argue in my article is that neither the least
1697200	1702240	distance metric nor the average distance metric work they systematically make incorrect predictions.
1703280	1707760	So instead I propose a new metric that I think generates the right kinds of results
1707760	1711920	which I call the qualitative similarity metric or the Paul metric. This is the
1712640	1718240	formal statement of the metric where A and B are two regions. And I'm not going to explain how
1718240	1722320	exactly the metric works but to give you some intuition you can basically think of it as a
1722320	1727680	more sophisticated version of an average distance metric. So the average distance metric works pretty
1727680	1732720	well most of the time but it turns out to lead to systematically incorrect results
1733520	1738320	for phenomenal similarity when we have cases involving overlapping regions. So for example
1738320	1744320	the average distance metric yields the observed result that every mental quality is less than
1744320	1749040	maximally similar to itself and that's because if you take the average distance from a region to
1749040	1755360	itself you'll get a non-zero value. So my Paul metric doesn't generate these sorts of absurd
1755360	1760400	consequences but still yields results that otherwise resemble average distance and more
1760400	1765120	generally it yields the right kinds of predictions across all the kinds of relationships that two
1765120	1770640	regions can bear to each other. So that's one thing that's kind of cool. We get this more
1770640	1777040	interesting sophisticated formalism for capturing phenomenal similarity. Also I think one thing
1777040	1781760	that's cool that comes out of the regional framework is that there are multiple dimensions
1781760	1787040	of phenomenal similarity and we can formally disentangle those dimensions. So alongside
1787040	1792240	qualitative similarity measured by the Paul metric there's also precision similarity.
1792240	1797520	Similarity with respect to how precise two experiences are which is measured by
1797520	1803200	a precision similarity metric. So for example think about a full view experience of red
1803200	1807280	and a full view experience of green versus a peripheral experience of red. The two full
1807280	1812880	view experiences are similar in a certain respect to each other in which they aren't to
1812880	1820480	the peripheral experience. So precision similarity on the way that I'm defining the metric is
1820480	1827120	measured by the ratio between the smaller region to the larger region. And again there's a lot more
1827120	1834160	that's said in the paper to walk through the metric into motivated. But stepping back thinking
1834160	1838320	about the big picture I think what's interesting here is that this is one case where I think
1838320	1843840	formalization can actually help with understanding the phenomenology. So what the regional framework
1843840	1849120	enables us to do is to pull part two distinct dimensions of phenomenal similarity and seeing
1849120	1855040	how they fall out of the formal structure of the regional framework this gives us a much more
1855040	1859760	precise and systematic understanding of phenomenal similarity than we would otherwise have.
1861280	1867360	Last thing I'll mention as an interesting application of the regional framework concerns
1867360	1873600	the phenomenal psorias. So a phenomenal psorias is a case where a subject cannot discriminate
1874400	1879840	an object alpha from an object beta or beta from gamma but can discriminate alpha from gamma. So
1879840	1883600	for example imagine that you're in a psychophysics experiment and you're seeing three
1883600	1889520	color shifts each of which is a different shade of gray. And you can discriminate the first
1889520	1894400	from the third but you can't discriminate the first from the second or the second from the third.
1894400	1899520	So if I I tried to actually construct a phenomenal psorias case here if I did it
1900320	1906880	aptly then you will be able to discriminate the shade of gray for of this first circle alpha
1906880	1912560	from that of gamma but not any of the pairwise circles. So alpha and beta might look to be the
1912560	1917120	same shade of gray and beta and gamma might look to be the same shade of gray. Okay so that's the
1917120	1921840	phenomenon that's a phenomenon that's well known. There's been a lot written about it. It's a phenomenon
1921840	1925680	that calls out for explanation. You might wonder what exactly is going on phenomenologically
1925680	1932800	in phenomenal psorias cases. And the idea that I had is that we can apply the regional framework
1932800	1940400	to the phenomenal psorias where the probability of a phenomenal psorias occurring I hypothesize
1940400	1945280	corresponds to the overlap structure of the relevant regions. So in other words the more
1945280	1951360	a and b overlap or the more b and c overlap the more likely it is that the subject would not be
1951360	1957440	able to discriminate the color of alpha from beta or beta from gamma and the less a and c overlap
1957440	1961840	the more likely it is that they'll be able to discriminate the color of alpha from gamma. So
1961840	1968240	that's the basic idea. So that yields this probabilistic model of the phenomenal psorias
1968240	1974080	that comes out of the regional framework. I'm not going to fully explain all this that would
1974080	1979920	require a bit too much time on technical issues but here's the basic idea. The regional framework
1979920	1987200	gives us this probabilistic model of how likely it is that a phenomenal psorias occurs where the
1987200	1993040	input to the model is the regions that represent the subjects experiences and in particular the
1993040	1998080	overlap structure between those regions. And the thought is that a phenomenal psorias is more
1998080	2004640	likely to occur when a and b overlap or or b and c overlap or or when a and c overlap less.
2004880	2011040	Okay so one exciting thing about this application in particular is that it has the potential to
2011040	2017520	inform future empirical investigation into consciousness but I won't talk about that more
2017520	2025920	for limits of time. So here's just a summary of what I've been talking about in this brief overview.
2025920	2031920	So the goal of this article of mine is to develop a new framework for quality space models where the
2031920	2037200	core idea is to represent qualities using regions and where size of region inversely corresponds to
2037200	2042640	degree of precision and the regional framework enables us to ask a bunch of interesting new
2042640	2047440	questions about phenomenology for example which kinds of regions represents possible mental
2047440	2052160	qualities how we construct the right similarity metrics and it also has a number of applications
2052160	2056640	for example the probabilistic model of the phenomenal psorias as well as a number of other
2056640	2061680	things. And there's an article link at the bottom if you're interested in taking a look at the details.
2062240	2069280	I wanted to end with a more general thought so I'm interested generally in philosophical
2069280	2075040	questions about the structure of consciousness and I have listed here some of the questions that I
2075040	2081200	think are especially interesting or important for making progress. These are mostly fairly
2081200	2086400	foundational questions but I think they're questions that we ought to explore to get a better
2086400	2091360	understanding of this topic and in fact all these questions are under explored there's not
2091360	2097040	yet much work in philosophy or the science of consciousness on these sorts of questions.
2098080	2102640	But I think this is also changing you know in recent years there's been more and more
2102640	2107840	attention being paid to the structure of consciousness and I think this is exciting and
2107840	2112080	I'm interested in seeing how things continue to develop in the future.
2112720	2122160	Yeah very cool I have so many questions and ideas coming out of all of this this is by the way this
2122160	2129680	is also really great this is very inspiring about these open questions and I almost feel like I would
2129680	2134240	like to put a poll below in the video what viewers might be most interested in and get you back on
2134240	2138720	to talk about one of these topics because each of these are really interesting questions.
2139440	2145440	Well these maybe it's worth mentioning that these first four questions I have written on or
2145440	2152560	and currently writing on the last four questions I'm interested in and I have thoughts about but
2152560	2159600	for me they're questions for future work so I've in my in my research program I've been slowly
2159600	2162880	trying to progress through this host of questions.
2163520	2170960	Great great so when it comes to the region's idea that you bring in it seems to me
2170960	2175680	it's one of these things that you go in hindsight everybody should go da because this whole idea
2175680	2182080	that your your qualia would be a point in some kind of space seems questionable in the first place
2182080	2187200	right because a point in a way as a mathematical object is infinitely small and it comes with
2187200	2191360	all kinds of problems but when people show color spaces they never show these points
2192160	2196800	they already show your regions right and so you're kind of duped into into thinking you're not
2196800	2202080	thinking as that as a discretized kind of point space so that's really interesting I also find
2202080	2207040	interesting that you you got the objection that sounded like that some people said well why why
2207680	2213120	not solve that by adding another dimension and so when it when it comes to the color space at least
2213120	2217680	it sounds to me that your idea and that's actually key is that let's say your peripheral
2218240	2224480	sensing your periphery quality of scarlet is less precise but if it's a region in color space then
2224480	2230720	that means that it can't be arbitrarily imprecise the neighboring colors in that space they determined
2230720	2237520	that impreciseness because that is where the imprecision can go to right if you if you just
2237520	2245120	add another dimension and the imprecision can be something other than that this redness that you
2245120	2250320	don't see it as precise as something at the fovea if you think of that as spreading being more
2250320	2256000	wide or more fuzzy in color space well that means that it has something to do with which other colors
2256000	2265920	are nearby yeah or I see so at least if you're thinking that connectedness or maybe complexity
2265920	2271840	is a constraint on the relevant regions if I'm understanding your question if you didn't require
2271920	2276960	connectedness then it doesn't really matter which other colors are nearby because you could have
2276960	2282160	you know some very yeah weirdly shaped regions so that I mean but I think that's just an
2282160	2288640	interesting open question and we don't really know the answer to this yeah so intuitively I just
2288640	2294880	assumed that it must be connected but it almost seems to me like an empirical question that we
2294880	2299920	might be able to answer right because you could show different kinds of shades of red and you
2299920	2304320	could basically explore the color space that's all around that redness you can do that at the fovea
2304320	2310560	and you can do it in the periphery and basically you if you can show more shades of red that are
2310560	2314320	all around this color space it's almost like you could map that region that you're talking about
2314320	2320640	yeah yeah so I think that's one of the ways in which this the regional framework that I developed
2321200	2325200	lends itself to empirical investigation because there's going to be different kinds of
2326000	2333520	predictions depending on for example what the structure of a given region is as far as whether
2334160	2339920	it's an empirical question whether the regions for a quality space are have to be connected or not
2339920	2344400	I think there's one question that's empirical which is how should we be thinking about the
2345760	2350240	regions for human color experiences what how should we be thinking about more generally just
2350240	2355680	the model of human color experiences but then there's also a more general question
2355680	2361200	how do we think about the space of all possible experiences where maybe it's the case that humans
2361200	2367040	just have a certain kind of cognitive architecture that only enables certain kinds of possible
2367040	2371600	color experiences and that wouldn't be surprising if if it were the case like maybe there's not
2371600	2378160	really much advantage to representing something as correspond in the way that like a disconnected
2378880	2384880	would so there's also this more general metaphysical question of what kinds of
2385680	2392800	experiences are possible in general independent of how human color experiences happen to be
2392800	2398320	and that's a that's a difficult question I'm not sure you know I'm not sure what
2398320	2402800	considerations would bear either way on that question but I think one cool thing is that
2402800	2405840	now we can actually formulate this question I wonder about it at least
2405840	2412400	yeah I don't know if you know but there are some human tetrachromats so they have four color
2412400	2417760	receptors and so that that color gamut should be wider and yeah it's very little work on that
2417760	2424080	actually so well so this also goes to I think some very underexplored and very interesting
2424080	2429200	questions about quality spaces about so there's tetrachromats there's also colorblind people
2429200	2434000	and then there's also just other creatures that seem like they might have color experiences but
2434000	2438960	perhaps with a different dimensionality right and there's an interesting question of how to
2438960	2444480	think about the relations between these different quality spaces for example should we think that
2445040	2454480	these all possible color experiences those for neurotypical humans and colorblind humans and
2454480	2461120	dogs and mantis shrimp are they all embedded in this bigger quality space that captures all
2461120	2467440	possible color experiences or should we think about the relations between these different
2467440	2472160	qualities of the same experiential domain but of different spaces in a different way I mean this
2472160	2478560	is something that I'm interested in thinking about more in the future I have some very speculative
2478560	2485440	thoughts at the moment on on this but I think that's an exciting topic to investigate there's
2485440	2491440	also I don't know if you ever heard about this but our lens is actually filtering it's basically a
2491440	2496320	low pass filter and so you can some people they lose their lens and they get just a glass replacement
2496320	2500320	that doesn't have the same properties and they can see parts of the ultraviolet spectrum that we
2500320	2505280	can't see just with a regular eye so we're capable of doing it but it's the lens that prevents us from
2505280	2514000	doing it that's interesting yeah it seems hard enough from what I read to find out whether those
2514000	2521200	people actually do see something other than maybe a very bright violet right so it's very
2521200	2525600	that's where we run into these limits unless maybe we can come up with more clever techniques
2525600	2530080	than what we have in terms of finding out whether they have color perceptions that that we don't have
2530720	2534800	yeah I mean so I was going to say that the hard part there then is figuring out what
2534800	2541200	the phenomenology for those people is but I mean one possible approach would be to just
2541280	2547600	first see whether they're able to make more discriminations than ordinary people are able
2547600	2552560	to make and that's I'm inclined to think provides some defeasible evidence in favor of thinking that
2552560	2559040	they actually do have more color experiences so I had a technical question so I really like the
2559040	2564720	way that you explain one of your equations was not just with a usual notation but you had the
2564720	2571120	discs basically showing the different set configurations and so the thought that popped
2571120	2577760	from my mind there is that I'm also very visual thinker and it's how much of the formalism that
2577760	2583520	you have depends on the and you kind of answered this already but how much of it depends on the
2583520	2591920	size of the shape so if it's like a disc like a ball like shape right then in reality it may
2591920	2598320	not be as you said that and and so would the metrics the work if it's not that yeah so so
2598320	2605360	basically it doesn't maybe I should pull up that and it's just for so really speaking when when I
2605360	2610640	envision that region just without further thought I would in my mind it would be something that's
2610640	2618720	more Gaussian or Gaussian than a solid disc where it seems that even the region itself is not homogeneous
2618720	2624720	but that the region itself might have like a bell curve kind of shape or something or something
2624720	2630800	equivalent in two-dimensional three-dimensional space yeah so let me let me speak to both things
2630800	2637280	that you were raising so for for the first thing how much does the way that this metric works
2638000	2644880	rely upon the assumption that the relevant regions are spherical and the the answer is that it
2644880	2650880	doesn't at all so you can you don't you don't even need to assume that the regions are disconnected
2650880	2658160	or sorry that the regions are connected so this this was designed to work with arbitrary regions
2658160	2662880	of all sorts of weird shapes and sizes and I mean when we're thinking about like very weirdly
2662880	2668960	shaped regions especially disconnected ones then there's not really clear intuitions anyway about
2668960	2677200	what the right results should be but what I aim to do in in developing this metric was to make sure
2677200	2683840	that it covered you know all sorts of weird cases and that included thinking a lot about what the
2683840	2692720	results would be when we're not assuming uniformity for the shapes or convexity or or anything else so
2692720	2700080	the answer to the first question is that this I I think is going to be fully general for the second
2700080	2706000	thing when you were talking about this Gaussian structure there's a part of my paper that discusses
2706000	2713200	this kind of briefly so what I say is that one thing you might think is that not only should we
2713200	2717520	move from the standard framework to the regional framework but we should move even further from
2718160	2723280	the regional framework to a framework where mental qualities are modeled not just by
2724160	2732720	subsets of a space but also by weighted subsets where each point is assigned some value and where
2732720	2738240	maybe there's more concentration in the middle than the periphery and so forth so one reason you
2738240	2744080	might be motivated to move to that kind of structure is that if you think that
2745040	2752240	that perceptual experiences have probabilistic contents and that that probabilistic structure
2752240	2759840	is reflected in the phenomenology then that might be reason to not give equal weight to all of the
2759840	2765520	different parts of the quality space that the relevant region covers so maybe there's more
2765520	2770960	concentration in for example maybe there's a quality that represents something as having
2770960	2776720	a high probability of being red but also some low probability of being orange and some low
2776720	2784000	probability of being purple with when all these like bands of color are of equal size so anyway
2784000	2790240	that would be a way of further developing this framework that will evolve like more sophisticated
2791440	2797520	structures than just regions and I think it's super interesting to think about how to develop
2797520	2802480	that further I mean there would need to be more sophisticated versions of the similarity metrics
2802480	2809680	I discussed for example and I think that would just be a further envisioning of our models of
2810480	2817680	quality spaces one thing that I feel myself agnostic about is just whether we do in fact
2817680	2822080	need that additional structure to capture the phenomenology to me that's just an open question
2822080	2827440	I think it's very obvious that there is such a thing as precision when we just think about the
2827520	2832800	contrast between full view experience and peripheral experience but it's not obvious
2832800	2837760	to me that we need something further not that I'm skeptical but I think it's just
2837760	2844880	more of an open question but I I'm thinking that this is something that might potentially be
2844880	2852080	something I'd like to work on in in the future this this field of qualia structure mathematical
2852080	2858160	phenomenology mathematical consciousness science do you ever feel for where it's headed if you
2858160	2862480	would have to put money on where things might be in five or ten years do you ever feel for that
2862480	2873200	there's a direction there I mean I hope that there will be more and more interest in these topics
2873200	2880240	in the near future and I think that that probably will be the case one thing I hope will happen
2880320	2883520	and I think there's a good chance of happening is for there to be more
2884240	2890560	unity across different disciplines right now it feels like I mean this could be said about
2890560	2898640	consciousness research in general too it feels like there's a lot of different people in different
2898640	2906000	fields that are sometimes developing research that has connections to each other but are working
2906000	2911920	in different literatures maybe using different vocabulary or methodologies so I think there's
2911920	2922320	room for more I guess dialogue across disciplines and more I guess standardization of terms and ideas
2922320	2930400	and literatures and I think that that would constitute a form of progress I guess I also hope
2930400	2937200	that more philosophers become interested in these sorts of topics it's the structure of
2937200	2944720	consciousness is not really a big topic in the philosophy of mind right now but I think it has
2944720	2951520	the potential to be and I think that there's a lot that philosophers can contribute to our inquiry
2951520	2959200	into these subject matters so I'm hoping that in the field of philosophies specifically that more
2959280	2966160	attention is paid to these topics in the future very related to that if somebody's watching this
2966160	2971120	and is a young student and interested maybe in this direction would you have any advice
2972000	2976880	for your younger self do you have anything that you could share with somebody like that
2978080	2984320	yeah well I guess for students interested in this I mean I think consciousness research is a growing
2984400	2993600	field and that I mean I bet that this is in the end going to be an exciting time in history to be
2993600	3000720	a part of that field I think that it's a field that is emerging where a lot of stuff is happening
3000720	3007840	where it's I mean it's only been recently that it's a subject matter that can be seriously
3007840	3012160	studied by scientists I mean consciousness used to be solely in the province of philosophers
3012160	3016160	but now there are people from a variety of disciplines you know philosophy, ecocide,
3016880	3025200	neuro, math even even CS who are focused on consciousness so yeah so I think right now
3025200	3029760	the field is fairly disparate and heterogeneous but I think it's going to probably become more
3029760	3034640	unified over time and partly because of that it's a great time to join the field because there's
3034640	3041680	exciting developments happening I guess maybe it's worth saying that academia is a very tough
3041680	3046320	career to pursue and that you know anyone who considers it should keep those sorts of practical
3046320	3054080	considerations in mind too but I really do think that this is an interesting time in history to
3054960	3062160	be interested and involved in studying consciousness and I suspect that the structure of consciousness
3062160	3070800	will be a bigger and more and more developed topic as as time goes on yeah I couldn't agree more
3070800	3076880	so I have a few things that maybe I'll add it out but I really wanted to hear what you think
3077440	3082080	and this is one thing it's a debate I had with Johannes Kleiner also which and you dropped it
3082080	3087680	at some point whether science has to produce public knowledge whether science has produced one
3087680	3096000	has to produce public knowledge so you said that very early on when we talked about whether we might
3096000	3102000	need new math and so you said that you think that maybe we have to also rethink what science is
3102000	3106400	and what qualifies as science and how science works and you brought that up that like one of these
3106400	3113920	points is whether science has to produce public knowledge and yeah and I find this such an interesting
3113920	3119360	question and so here's that thought experiment that that I thought at some point and I just want
3119360	3122880	to throw it off like that I bounce it off some people I want to bounce off you and see what you
3122880	3128000	think so the thought experiment is that it's like in that movie with Will Smith where the
3128000	3133360	world has ended and he's the only last person alive I imagine I think it's that movie and so
3134240	3139440	let's imagine this happened it's a zombie apocalypse or the rapture and there's one person left on the
3139440	3144640	planet that's the last survivor of mankind and that person just happens to be a brilliant scientist
3145520	3151920	somebody like Albert Einstein or Newton yeah and there's no more need for producing public
3151920	3158800	knowledge right so there's no more need to express science for others because there's
3158800	3163760	not going to be another human being anymore again and yet it seems that whatever the scientists
3163760	3171280	would produce would still be totally accepted as science by all of us yeah that's right although one
3171280	3177760	asymmetry there perhaps with the consciousness case is that in your scenario the knowledge
3177760	3183520	produced by the scientists is still in principle communicable and in principle public if there
3183520	3191440	happened to be like other humans created then he would be able to communicate his minds to
3191440	3196400	and that's what I question right because that's why it gets absurd right because like no you're
3196400	3202320	really the last survivor there's not anybody going to come so there's really no more need to even
3202320	3208080	in principle make it communicable and yet it still seems that then we would be okay with that
3208960	3214240	so it really seems that the need for making science public and communicable almost seems
3214240	3220240	more practical than a priori that's what I'm getting at it would be very weird to say that if
3220240	3226240	this person is doing science just for themselves that that wouldn't be science anymore just because
3226240	3231760	it can't be shared there's nothing that doesn't seem to be something fundamental about the act of
3231760	3236320	scientific knowledge being shared between two individuals that makes it scientific
3237520	3242320	yeah I mean I think that's right I mean I certainly agree that in the scenario you are
3242320	3248400	sketching then what the person is doing should count as scientific inquiry and scientific knowledge
3249120	3254640	it still seems to be that there are some asymmetries between that case and the consciousness case for
3254640	3260800	example even though the particular circumstance that the person is in happens to be one where
3260880	3266880	there will never be any communication of the findings it's still the case that the kind of
3267600	3272800	knowledge that the person is acquiring is the kind that could be communicated to other people
3272800	3278480	I mean maybe that's not a relevant asymmetry so I'm open to thinking that and I certainly think
3278480	3287040	that there can be first person investigation of conscious experiences that is scientific in many
3287040	3293200	relevant respects so I was really thinking of this as a largely verbal question of just like
3293200	3298800	how we define science I mean we could one option would be to think that there's like both first
3298800	3303680	person and third person science and it just has to be the case that almost all scientific
3303680	3308320	investigation is third person and that it also third person investigation produces certain
3308320	3314800	kinds of like benefits like communicability that are less obviously available in the first person
3314800	3324080	case that seems like a fine way of thinking about things to me yeah because some of your work
3324080	3331520	in a way does also rely on introspection right and so yeah so therefore I mean I it is it takes
3331520	3340240	first person science in this case kind of serious and and if you do then some of the issues in
3340240	3343840	consciousness science they actually kind of fall away because a lot of them they to me at least they
3343840	3349040	really come from very very hard insistence on third person science and public knowledge
3350160	3353520	that's right but part of part of what I was thinking about earlier is that
3354400	3360160	if I think there is a sense in which suppose we encountered like this alien species that
3360160	3367440	just had different kinds of experiences than us I'm inclined to think that there's going to be certain
3368400	3373600	things that we know about our own conscious experiences that we're just not going to be able
3373600	3377760	to communicate to them advice versa I think there's a lot that we could communicate to them for
3377760	3383840	example structural knowledge about right our own experiences but there might be certain facts about
3383840	3388880	the qualities of our experiences that are just inaccessible to them because of the way that
3388880	3395840	they're built and we you could imagine a scenario where we do in fact conduct systematic investigation
3396800	3400800	of those qualities maybe we like taxonomize and categorize them and and so forth
3402480	3410000	but I guess one question is just how to think about that kind of inquiry how to think about how
3410880	3415040	that kind of inquiry relates to normal scientific inquiry as it's normally
3415040	3421040	practiced and I guess it just seems to me kind of an open question but I mean maybe this is another
3421040	3426560	way of putting my view though I don't really know how we should think about like the nature of science
3426560	3433360	but I am confident that phenomenology is a thing that we can do that we can like make progress in
3433360	3442320	and that we can investigate systematically in the same way that we investigate other subject
3442320	3448720	matters and whether that's called science or not I don't really care but I'm interested in
3449280	3453920	figuring out how we can advance that mode of inquiry that's that's really beautifully put
3453920	3459120	because the next part of my conducting experiment would be let's say life of life after death right
3459120	3465120	and so if you would die and it would be life after death then in a way to me that's an empirical
3465120	3470800	question or like a scientific question so you die and then now you you know there's some kind of
3470800	3476480	life after death kind of things like nobody would say that this is somehow unscientific that you
3476480	3481040	now have that belief that there's life after death now that that has happened to you do you see what
3481040	3486240	I'm saying but it's a single person issue it's like only only you could have that empirical
3486240	3494560	experience and so so that that seems to me again it's a madness but it seems to me then if we if
3494560	3501040	we open consciousness science that we allow for a single person first person experiences to count
3501040	3506800	to gain knowledge for each of us on their own then some of these obstacles might go away so
3507520	3513120	maybe even you know some experiments like Mary's the famous Mary's room and so on it seemed
3513760	3520480	solvable to me when you when you drop this heart insistence on but it has to be third person has
3520480	3528880	to be communicable uh anyways uh I know there's a little out there but it does it does pertain to
3528880	3533840	the qualia space's question a little bit because it is more introspective than I think the push that
3533840	3540320	psychophysics did which is that was like the first aim to mathematicize phenomenology and it really
3540320	3546480	went out of his way to to not talk about any first person thing ever so there was no introspective
3546480	3550800	component and so it seems to me that some of the breakthrough that has happened or the progress
3550800	3557280	that's going on is by softening that requirement a little bit yeah I know I mean I think that
3557280	3562640	provides a nice way of seeing a bit about a bit more about my own attitude towards these
3562640	3568000	pathological points I guess I'm inclined to think that we ought to use a combination of both
3568000	3574880	first person and third person methods in investigating consciousness and that's what I try to do in my
3574880	3581280	own research and I mean I think this my work on quality space models is a nice example of that
3581280	3587520	because the motivation in my view for thinking that there is precision in the first place comes
3587520	3593600	from introspection just seems very plausible introspectively that foveal color experiences
3593600	3598000	are phenomenologically distinct from peripheral color experiences but then I think we can also get
3598000	3604400	third person support from that by looking at differences in discriminatory abilities of people
3604400	3609840	in say foveal vision versus peripheral vision where one of the natural explanations for why
3609840	3614720	there are those differences is because there are differences in the associated experiences
3614720	3620000	and then we can also apply formal methods and think about how do we capture all of this you
3620000	3629120	know mathematically and then apply those formal methods to you know further stages of inquiry so
3629120	3636560	I tend to be quite holistic in the the methodology that I think we should adopt and I mean one reason
3636560	3640640	is that you know consciousness is just really hard and really difficult to investigate and we
3640640	3646800	should use whatever tools are available to us and that's not to presume that all any of these tools
3646800	3654960	is like infallible or trumps all the others but we can still use a combination to try to like
3655760	3662320	figure out whatever we're trying to attain more knowledge of. Yeah and I think that the success
3662320	3667520	in a way also speaks for itself if you make progress and there's a success then you don't
3667520	3671840	have to question the premises even anymore. I guess one of my main projects right now is
3672560	3678080	on dimensions of consciousness and trying to develop a philosophical analysis of dimensions
3678080	3683680	of consciousness so that's a term that you sometimes see in the science of consciousness
3684400	3690080	and you sometimes see what are called multi-dimensional models of consciousness
3690080	3694640	there have been some proposals for what the dimensions of consciousness might be but what
3694640	3698720	nobody has really done yet is develop a systematic analysis of what the relevant
3698720	3704720	meaning of dimensions of consciousness is here and part of why I became interested in this is that
3704720	3710160	I think there's one natural sense of dimensions of consciousness where it's just obvious that
3710160	3714000	consciousness has an extremely high number of dimensions so in particular if you think of
3714000	3718320	dimensions of consciousness as just ways in which conscious experiences vary from each other
3718320	3722400	then there's going to be innumerably many ways in which conscious experiences can vary from each
3722400	3728240	other but I think there's also a sense of dimensions of consciousness where it might turn out that
3728240	3733120	consciousness in this sense has a low number of dimensions and where searching for the dimensions
3733120	3739360	of consciousness is going to be an important task for future consciousness research so one of my
3739360	3744160	projects right now is trying to identify what this more interesting constrained sense of dimensions
3744160	3750720	of consciousness is and articulating how this has implications for consciousness science
3750720	3757920	so how is this related to modality so you know having smell or vision those seem like natural
3757920	3763600	different dimensions that people think of is that is that part of what you're interested in or is
3763600	3768160	it more about that your the idea is that your consciousness could be graded and you could be
3768160	3773680	very conscious or less conscious so that's one axis yeah well I think both of those are related
3773680	3779760	so one observation is that I think it's fine to call different sensory modalities different
3779760	3784080	dimensions of consciousness but one thing that we should notice there is that these dimensions
3784080	3789840	are not themselves one dimensional so for example visual experiences like there's all sorts of
3789840	3794000	different ways in which visual experiences vary so visual experience itself it's going to be
3794000	3800720	very high dimensional so part of the task here is thinking about what the sense of dimensions
3800720	3806720	of consciousness is that allows us to make sense of these sorts of claims like different sensory
3806720	3811280	modalities are dimensions of consciousness you might wonder what justifies the claim that vision is
3811280	3815680	a dimension of consciousness but not like pink experience why isn't that why doesn't that count
3815680	3820720	as a dimension of consciousness but you also mentioned this idea about great ability and I
3820720	3827280	think that that's also connected to thinking about this issue so for example think about global
3827280	3833680	workspace theory you might have thought that there's an interesting sense in which say size
3833680	3838480	of global workspace might be a dimension of consciousness that is different from the sense
3838480	3844880	in which say color experience might be a dimension of consciousness it seems like the first property
3845440	3852000	gets closer to something more fundamental or more at the heart of what consciousness is
3852000	3856480	then the second thing I'm fascinated because it seems like a really difficult question to me
3857120	3864480	because I've always been struck when it comes to personalities people are at first glance dazzled
3864480	3868720	in the same way as you said that it seems that it's almost infinite dimensional because you said that
3869360	3873360	if you think about different people the same thing as you said if you have different experiences
3873360	3878720	they seem to be so distinguished from each other and so that screams many many dimensions right
3878720	3885040	but if you do careful empirical testing what you find is that all personalities of people can be
3885040	3891600	with I don't know how many 90 something percent of the variance can be done in five dimensions
3891600	3898640	and to me that's always been a very surprising result that it seems that if you would into it
3898640	3904480	you would think that the dimensionality space is much higher for personality and so that's right
3904480	3908000	so if we're trying to capture all differences in personality we're definitely going to need
3908000	3916080	more than just five dimensions but I guess these like the ocean model of personality is intended to
3916080	3921280	abstract away from certain differences while capturing some of the most robust and universal
3921280	3925680	differences in personality that there are and we could do the same thing for consciousness we could
3926240	3930160	develop a multi-dimensional model where we abstract away from certain differences
3930160	3936240	while trying to also identify dimensions that are as universal as possible I mentioned one more
3936240	3941440	thing though that is connected to the your mark about great ability because one of the other things
3941440	3948000	that I'm working on is on degrees of consciousness yeah and you know so if you spend enough time in
3948000	3952720	the conscious world you occasionally hear things like a human is more conscious than a fish or
3952720	3957840	people become more conscious while on psychedelic drugs and a lot of philosophers have been skeptical
3957840	3962560	of the coherence of these sorts of claims and have thought that well maybe people who are making
3962560	3968800	these claims are just kind of conceptually confused but my view is that we don't know whether these
3968800	3973360	claims are true or not but there's nothing semantically defective about these sorts of claims
3974000	3980560	these claims are still makes sense and so one of my recent publications titled degrees of
3980560	3985840	consciousness is arguing that is giving an account of what it means to say that consciousness comes
3985840	3991520	in degrees and arguing that most theories of consciousness actually entail that consciousness
3991520	3996880	comes in degrees and that's something that that's a publication that came out last year but I'm also
3996880	4002400	doing some follow-up work right now with Poppy Mankiewicz a philosopher of language at Bristol
4002400	4007840	on the semantics of gradable conscious expressions so for example sentences like a human is more
4007840	4013680	conscious than a fish and our goal is to examine more closely the semantics of these sorts of claims
4013680	4020320	using resources from philosophy of language and linguistics so that's that's another project that
4020320	4024800	I'm working on that's directly connected to the great ability stuff if I if I may jump in
4024800	4031680	there very quick so I saw some of you presented some of that on Naoto Kias YouTube channel and I
4031680	4037600	thought you did something interesting there which is that you said that consciousness may be graded
4039120	4044480	and at the same time the the issue that the the problem that that people often have with that
4045120	4051920	idea is that whether you're conscious or not seems so much of qualitative rather than just a
4051920	4059520	quantitative change and it's very hard to imagine that how can you go from zero consciousness to
4060560	4067280	some kind of consciousness that the moment that you even give it an infinitesimally small kind
4067280	4073120	of consciousness now you have something else it's conscious and in nature that doesn't seem to happen
4073120	4080400	right so in nature you talked about volume and other physical quantities in the end they are actually
4081360	4086640	not continuous all the way down in the end we know that there's a plank limit to everything
4086640	4090400	and there's a discrete jump from something to a certain amount of time a certain amount of space
4090400	4094080	and so on right and so it sounded to me like you're granting that for consciousness as well
4094080	4097600	that you're saying there might be almost like a plank limit and then once you go above it then
4097600	4102240	it's gradable but that doesn't mean it has to be gradable all the way down there could be some
4102640	4108000	not discontinuity between no conscious and some consciousness yeah so that's that's a nice way
4108000	4113840	of putting it in that's basically the view that i'm most sympathetic to so one question is whether
4115440	4123040	it can be indeterminate or vague whether an entity is conscious or not where it has just an
4123040	4128400	intermediate degree of consciousness meaning it's not yet conscious it's like on the borderline between
4128400	4132640	not conscious and conscious and speaking for myself i'm not sure how to make sense of that it
4132640	4138480	seems to me like that's conceptually incoherent but then another question is whether consciousness
4138480	4143280	comes in degrees meaning some entities are more conscious than others and it could be the kind
4143280	4148720	of picture that you just articulated where you get this instant jump from non-conscious to conscious
4148720	4154480	but once you're in the conscious domain then some creatures can be more conscious than others
4154720	4161520	yeah that's that's really in a way you solved i think a sticking point for a lot of people there
4162400	4165920	it is compatible it seems to me with integrated information theory and maybe some other theories
4165920	4171040	as well so it's really interesting well it's certainly compatible with iot i think it kind of
4171760	4178800	i mean i'm i'm the most people are either very pro or anti iot i'm somebody who's very neutral i
4178880	4185200	guess but i think this is one sometimes iot has been criticized on the grounds that they appeal to
4185840	4191120	degrees of consciousness they say that five values are a measure of how conscious an entity is
4191120	4196800	and some people have thought that well it's not clear that this even makes sense but my attitude
4196800	4201360	is that it does make sense it's fine for them to postulate that it could be that they're the
4201360	4206080	theories false but the mere fact that they're saying that some entities are more conscious than
4206080	4210800	others that's fine because if you really do think that what consciousness is is just having a
4210800	4215920	maximal degree of integrated information then it's natural to think that you know if you have more
4217360	4221680	integrated information going on in your system then i do then you're more conscious than me
4224080	4227520	cool so and what else are you working on you said dimensionality we got the
4228320	4232480	continuity how do you call it grading of consciousness uh degrees of consciousness
4232640	4240480	conscious maybe just one more thing i am working on something on consciousness and continuity
4240480	4244720	and whether we should think of our conscious experiences as having continuous or discrete
4244720	4249680	structures and in particular whether we have any introspective reason for thinking that
4249680	4255440	they're continuous so some some people have thought that you know if you think about your
4255440	4262000	experience of like the blue sky on a cloudless day there's no gaps in that experience so that
4262000	4267760	experience must be continuous because there's no there's in some sense no appearance reality
4267760	4272880	distinction in the case of consciousness and what it is for something to be continuous is
4272880	4279200	just for it to have no gaps but i think that that's a bit too hasty i think that introspection
4279200	4284400	just doesn't reveal to us whether our experiences are fundamentally continuous or discrete that
4284400	4290880	it's more of an empirical question and basically what that paper is doing is clarifying what it
4290880	4298400	means to say that an experience is continuous or discrete and providing what a discrete model of
4299360	4304640	those sorts of experiences like your experience of the blue sky and upon a cloudless day might look
4304640	4309520	like and arguing that we just don't really know at the moment which which view is correct
4311120	4316720	do you the the more natural way to go there would be time right the perception of time and
4316800	4323840	there's a lot of work on that yeah well what does it look like i think it does translate i'm
4323840	4329520	thinking about continuity in a general sense so it could be applied to temporal experience or
4329520	4334800	spatial experience or or any domain and when we're thinking about temporal experience it's a little
4334800	4340960	bit tricky we have to distinguish the timing of experience from the experience of time that's
4340960	4346880	how people would have put it sometimes so there's the objective time that an experience is
4347840	4355040	occurring during and then there's also what it feels like temporally to have the experience
4355040	4359200	and it could be that those two things come apart for example you could in principle have a view where
4359200	4364560	maybe experiences occur at an instant but each experience that occurs at an instant feels like
4365040	4371920	it's occurring over some extended period of time so i'm just concerned with the phenomenology
4371920	4377040	i'm concerned with in this case whether we have any reason to think that temporal phenomenology
4377040	4383600	is continuous as opposed to just to discrete whereas most work that has fallen under the label
4383600	4390480	of consciousness and continuity has been concerned with the timing of experience so the objective
4390480	4397280	time during which experiences occur and i think you could these two issues are related but they're
4397280	4404960	also conceptually distinct the i guess the other difference is that my concern here is mainly with
4404960	4409040	do we have any introspective reason for thinking that our experiences are continuous because some
4409040	4412880	people have thought that we could just know from introspection that our experiences have these
4412880	4418640	structures but i think that when we really think about what continuity means and what it would entail
4418640	4422320	for our experiences to be continuous i mean that would be kind of incredible if we could
4422320	4426560	like just introspect that our experiences have that kind of structure instead i think it's more
4426560	4432320	appropriate to think that we we just don't know from introspection whether our experiences are
4432320	4439040	continuous or discrete it this is again seems to be like a really important question because
4439040	4445120	if we're thinking about formalizing the structure of consciousness that is really important whether
4445120	4450240	you know this could all be done with discrete math or whether we have to deal with infinities
4450240	4455280	right that makes everything ugly and it's also maybe related to the people that come from cs
4455280	4461600	where everything is discrete by definition and we kind of learned that there's so much you can do
4461600	4467280	with just sticking to the discrete that maybe there is no need for for continuous
4468160	4471920	yeah well sometimes infinities make things ugly sometimes they make things easier
4472640	4478960	but i mean for example it's when we're thinking in geometrical or topological context it's much
4478960	4484080	more natural to be working with continuous structures than with discrete structures but
4484080	4488720	i think this also connects to interesting questions about quality spaces too so we might wonder
4488720	4493920	whether we should think of them as graphs or as as manifolds and i think that's a big question too
4493920	4500560	that's just kind of open yeah that's right but i think what i'm getting at is that like if your
4500560	4504560	math has this whole debate about you know there's the final test and so on but in a way it's funny
4504560	4510560	because when it comes to doing the actual calculations we typically just apply discrete math right so
4510560	4516400	we we just round pi to a certain decimal point and so on we'll do just fine we can do a lot of
4516400	4523200	geometry in a computer even though we can't deal with the infinite and so if if so in a way
4524400	4527760	if we think about that we want to do something similar with consciousness and structure of
4527760	4532880	consciousness it might help simplify that we could just break it down and deal with things
4532880	4537440	discreetly yeah no i think that's absolutely right and we should distinguish the question of
4537440	4543280	which kinds of models are most useful and what is the actual structure of the of the thing
4543280	4547680	we're investigating i mean the original idea of psychophysics is that perception is discrete
4547680	4552800	right so the the color space actually that that fechner envisioned was that it's very regional
4552800	4555920	actually right so that you have these just noticeable differences and then the point of
4555920	4561440	subjective equality so so actually in in the mind of a psychophysicist it's all like a step
4561440	4565120	function where you go from i can't tell a difference to now i can't tell a difference
4565120	4570560	and so yeah so it really does help i mean in that case when fechner came along it helped
4570560	4576000	because it gave rise to the idea that perception can't have numerosity and so for that you needed
4576000	4582240	that discreteness that i can't count in units of perception by saying it's thresholds you're just
4582240	4587440	noticeable differences go from one to two and so on and so yeah so it seems a really interesting
4587440	4592960	important question at the same time intuitively as you said that's really hard to have read your
4592960	4596320	to wrap your head around because it seems that yeah of course everything seems continuous
4597600	4604560	yeah so i i guess i think that once we think carefully about it it doesn't i mean i do think
4604560	4610320	we don't notice gaps in our experiences that's definitely right right but then whether we
4610320	4614720	should infer from that that our experiences seem continuous to us in the mathematical sense of
4614720	4621840	continuity that that that's the point that i want to resist and i think that for all we know
4621840	4626320	even though it is the case that our experiences aren't gappy they could still be discreet now
4626880	4631040	so the the empirical examples of gappy experiences like the blind spot and all of this
4631040	4635200	there you have filling in a certain way that would be interpolation and you could still argue it's
4635280	4641120	continuous space right so you have a gap it just gets intimidated yeah but you're going you're
4641120	4645760	going further and you're saying no it could actually it could be fundamentally pixelized
4645760	4652800	basically and you wouldn't know yeah that's interesting i mean one like way to put the
4652800	4658320	general thought is that to notice a gap you have to notice the things that would fill in the gap
4658320	4664080	right but then of course we can't experience we're not experiencing the things that would
4664080	4668480	fill in the gap because the it would mean that our experience is different than it actually is
4670480	4674640	it's it's also as a neuroscientist this is such an interesting thing actually because
4675520	4680000	neurons in a way are discreet right so they they fire action potentials and so if we think that
4680000	4684160	it's action potentials that are causing perception it's very hard to think that that would be a
4684160	4690080	really continuous thing because it is discretized at that level of information or whatever we want
4690080	4694560	to call it right so when it comes to a color perception that's what i'm thinking about explicitly
4694560	4699680	then i think again we get fooled because we're dealing with light as a starting point and that
4699680	4704320	discontinues the waveforms there but our color perception the way that that that i teach about
4704320	4708080	it is that we think of the three photoreceptors and how much they get activated and that's
4708080	4712960	discreet that isn't how many action potentials they fire so that space the color space that i
4712960	4719120	teach is a discrete space it can't be continuous because it has basically three three vectors
4719120	4727040	that have discretized activations yeah so then another angle from which to think about this
4727040	4733280	question is that if we did think that introspection reveals that our experiences are continuous
4733280	4736960	then you might think that that place is substantive constraints on what the physical
4736960	4744000	correlates of our experiences might be and rules out some of the most prominent possibilities for
4744000	4749520	thinking about those physical correlates but then that seems well that i mean that would be a pretty
4749520	4755280	substantive implication but yeah i guess i think that we shouldn't rule out those you're still
4755280	4762480	agnostic possibilities yeah that's interesting okay cool real brief maybe you said there's a fourth
4762480	4769520	one you're working on sure i mean maybe i'll just briefly mention so one thing i'm working on outside
4770240	4776080	the structure of experiences i have various kinds of work on the ethics of consciousness
4776080	4781600	i'm interested in understanding generally how consciousness is ethically significant both
4781600	4788880	with respect to our own welfare and with respect to morality and one of my new papers is called
4788880	4794320	consciousness makes things matter where i argue basically that consciousness is what makes an
4794320	4799440	entity the kind of thing that can be doing well or badly and i think relatedly is the basis for
4799520	4805440	moral status so that's a view that i think many people feel intuitively compelled by but which
4805440	4811840	hasn't actually received any sustained defense in the philosophical literature so that's
4812480	4817840	that's one new thing that i'm working on in the ethics of consciousness and just one example of
4817840	4822880	like i guess a bit of my work outside of the structure of consciousness oh wow you really
4822880	4827360	have a a knack for really interesting things i mean this is one where you really got me because
4828240	4834080	i'm very skeptical of of attributing functions to consciousness and yet as you said that is very
4834080	4840960	intuitive that is that is very compelling argument yeah it's very it's relevant to right as ai is
4840960	4847040	marching along as yeah i mean there's i mean there's been so much discussion like in the last
4847040	4852560	few months about about that sort of stuff in the context of ai and usually the people are just
4852560	4860240	implicitly assuming that consciousness is the basis for welfare and for moral status and i mean i
4861520	4865920	as i said i endorse those intuitions but i think it's also interesting thinking about
4865920	4870880	what the most careful philosophical defense of that view is interesting very interesting
4872000	4876800	wow yeah so that was a lot that was very cool so i hope we can repeat this at some point this is
4876800	4883040	very exciting so thank you so much again andrew that was really cool and did you have any parting
4883040	4890880	thoughts of ideas no i mean i'm looking forward to you know where your channel is going and yeah
4890880	4895680	i mean thanks a lot for bringing me on i really enjoyed the conversation and you've also inspired
4895680	4902960	me to you know maybe try to create my own youtube channel as i was saying at the beginning but yeah
4903040	4908800	i'm looking forward to what you do in the future with the channel and i think there will be as i said
4908800	4916320	it's an exciting time to be part of this this field yeah perfect and everything your website and
4916320	4925600	everything else will be in the description below for people to find so thanks so much thank you
