00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
I'm very excited to talk to you today, Andrew.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
You are a rising star in the field for mathematics of consciousness science and to me, that's

00:20.000 --> 00:21.360
no wonder.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.600
And that's because I'm no philosopher, I know very little about philosophy, but I watched

00:24.600 --> 00:29.360
your talks that are already on YouTube and I was able to understand them and they made

00:29.360 --> 00:30.360
a lot of sense to me.

00:30.360 --> 00:38.640
So I will link below the links to those talks that got me so excited and what really stuck

00:38.640 --> 00:47.420
out to me with your work is the rigor that goes into your thinking and that even translates

00:47.420 --> 00:56.080
into how you present your thoughts and the clarity with which you present and what drives

00:56.080 --> 00:57.080
your thinking.

00:57.080 --> 01:03.880
And this seems like such a welcome thing in the fields of consciousness that for a lot

01:03.880 --> 01:08.800
of people seems to be characterized by the opposite by some kind of fluffiness.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.440
And so this kind of rigor and clarity I think is solely needed.

01:12.440 --> 01:17.440
And I got quite excited that one of your last talks when you believe that real progress

01:17.440 --> 01:22.600
can be made by formalizing things about the structure of consciousness and phenomenal

01:22.600 --> 01:23.600
experience.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.880
So I'm very excited to hear about that today from you.

01:25.880 --> 01:26.880
Thank you, Alex.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.800
I mean, that's really nice for me to hear.

01:28.800 --> 01:36.400
And yeah, I'm glad that the aim that I bring in my work is to have clarity and precision.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.800
So I'm glad that's coming through.

01:38.800 --> 01:42.560
Can you tell me how you got into this mess?

01:42.560 --> 01:48.640
What got you interested in consciousness and also your academic vita that got you to this

01:48.640 --> 01:51.000
point and what you're doing right now?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Yeah.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.200
So I guess it started for me when I was 16 and still in high school.

01:57.200 --> 02:03.160
And at that time, I was a fairly good student, but, you know, I wasn't really inspired by

02:03.160 --> 02:05.080
any academic subjects.

02:05.080 --> 02:10.120
I did find in my classes, but I wasn't really that interested in anything.

02:10.120 --> 02:14.080
But then there were two things that really changed that for me.

02:14.080 --> 02:19.880
So one was reading Goro Escherbach by Douglas Hofstadter.

02:19.880 --> 02:25.320
And the second was reading David Chalmers on philosophical zombies and the heart problem

02:25.320 --> 02:27.480
of consciousness.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.640
Those two texts were really transformative for me.

02:30.640 --> 02:34.960
And I guess after that, I just became fascinated by consciousness.

02:34.960 --> 02:41.800
And I was really gripped by the fact that each of us is intimately acquainted with our

02:41.800 --> 02:47.280
own conscious experiences, but it still was this phenomenon that remained little understood.

02:47.280 --> 02:53.200
It was still one of these remaining great mysteries about the natural world.

02:53.200 --> 02:59.080
So in that respect, I guess consciousness was the first thing that really sparked my

02:59.080 --> 03:04.360
academic interest and that spark has never really fully left me.

03:04.360 --> 03:10.160
Also, I really liked the purity and generality of analytic philosophy.

03:10.160 --> 03:17.120
And I went into college wanting to study philosophy and consciousness in particular.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.080
I was pretty lucky in my undergrad experience.

03:21.080 --> 03:27.960
So I went to Brown University and there happened to be this community of undergrads that were

03:27.960 --> 03:33.040
there at the same time that were also into philosophy and a bunch of us were into philosophy

03:33.040 --> 03:34.040
of mind.

03:34.040 --> 03:39.240
So we had this department undergraduate group where we met every couple of weeks and talked

03:39.240 --> 03:40.680
about different philosophical topics.

03:40.680 --> 03:46.040
And I felt like I was really able to benefit from just having lots of conversations with

03:46.080 --> 03:48.840
peers, even when I was an undergrad.

03:48.840 --> 03:55.480
And I mean, my interest in consciousness kind of stuck with me throughout the whole of college.

03:55.480 --> 04:02.160
And I eventually decided to apply to grad school and to try to become a philosopher of consciousness.

04:02.160 --> 04:08.040
And I was lucky enough to get into NYU for my PhD, where I was able to work with David

04:08.040 --> 04:13.560
Chalmers, as well as Ned Block and Thomas Nagel, all of whom were some of my intellectual

04:13.560 --> 04:14.880
heroes.

04:14.880 --> 04:20.600
And I mean, so it's pretty common for people's interests to change during the course of grad

04:20.600 --> 04:23.600
school, but consciousness never really left me.

04:23.600 --> 04:28.960
And I mean, nowadays I do work on a number of philosophical issues outside of consciousness.

04:28.960 --> 04:36.840
I've like tainted my peer record, but consciousness has always been at the heart of my philosophical

04:36.840 --> 04:40.840
interests and the structure of consciousness in particular, that's at the heart of my interest

04:40.840 --> 04:42.840
in consciousness.

04:42.840 --> 04:49.000
Yeah, and what got you that is such an interesting thing because it seems that different people

04:49.000 --> 04:52.520
from different parts of the planet at the same time started thinking along those lines.

04:52.520 --> 04:58.480
So what was it about structure that got you the most interest about consciousness?

04:58.480 --> 05:01.160
Yeah, no, it's a great question.

05:01.160 --> 05:06.280
So to start, I guess I've just long thought that these sorts of questions, questions about

05:06.280 --> 05:11.400
the structure of consciousness are both really interesting, but also really underexplored.

05:11.640 --> 05:17.960
And I think maybe one reason for the why they're underexplored is that there are many people

05:17.960 --> 05:24.520
in, including myself, who have been kind of seduced by classic philosophical questions

05:24.520 --> 05:28.360
about the fundamental nature of consciousness, you know, like the heart problem, philosophical

05:28.360 --> 05:32.040
zombies, Mary's room, all that stuff.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.480
And I think I think that's great.

05:33.480 --> 05:38.480
I mean, I care a lot about those sorts of questions and I think they're important questions.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.560
I also think that consciousness research, and especially the philosophy of consciousness,

05:42.560 --> 05:45.600
has been overly dominated by those sorts of questions.

05:47.520 --> 05:51.280
I mean, there's so many interesting theoretical questions about consciousness that go beyond

05:51.280 --> 05:54.560
the heart problem, including questions about the structure of consciousness.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.960
And I think some people might have the impression that philosophy of consciousness is just about

05:58.960 --> 06:02.960
those questions about the fundamental nature, but I think there's a whole lot more

06:02.960 --> 06:08.480
there. And that's part of what I'm trying to develop and investigate and uncover in my own

06:08.480 --> 06:14.800
research. I guess one thing is that, I mean, at the same time, investigating the structure of

06:14.800 --> 06:19.680
consciousness is really hard. And maybe that's part of why these questions are underexplored as

06:19.680 --> 06:25.760
well. It's oftentimes not obvious how to make progress. And, you know, if you, so if you

06:25.760 --> 06:30.160
introspect your own conscious experience right now, you'll find that it's obvious that it's

06:30.160 --> 06:35.520
richly structured, but how exactly to think about that structure, what kinds of models or

06:35.520 --> 06:39.040
tools we should use for characterizing that structure, those are really difficult questions.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.840
But I think these are also super important questions and the kinds of questions that we'll

06:43.840 --> 06:48.960
need to tackle in order to really make progress in consciousness research. And in fact, if you

06:48.960 --> 06:54.640
look at other sciences, you know, physics, biology, psychology, whatever, in general,

06:54.640 --> 06:59.440
as a scientific field develops, it starts to move away from essence questions or questions about

06:59.440 --> 07:05.200
the fundamental nature of the entity study and instead to structural questions or questions about

07:05.200 --> 07:10.400
how the entities of the domain are related to each other, how to model those relations.

07:11.040 --> 07:16.880
And right now, consciousness research is still dominated by a focus on essence questions.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.080
You know, the biggest question in the philosophy of consciousness is, what is the fundamental

07:20.080 --> 07:23.520
nature of consciousness? And the biggest question in the science of consciousness is,

07:24.080 --> 07:29.280
what physical properties make a conscious, make a system conscious versus not? But

07:30.560 --> 07:35.840
my, I suspect that if you look at consciousness research a century from now, if we were able

07:35.840 --> 07:40.480
to do that somehow, we would see a much greater focus on structural questions.

07:41.840 --> 07:46.480
It's very interesting, because often with that development in science has also been

07:47.120 --> 07:54.080
the formalization and mathematician. And that is also something that you and other people

07:54.080 --> 08:00.960
interested in the structure have been championing as well. And so there's an analog that often

08:00.960 --> 08:07.440
leads to progress as well, because you're leaving behind the woolly words, you're boiling it down

08:07.440 --> 08:12.800
to something that is much more rigorous. So I'm curious what led you into that direction to

08:13.760 --> 08:18.720
use formal tools and combine that with your interest in the structure of consciousness?

08:20.000 --> 08:25.840
I mean, I guess part of what led me in that direction is basically just agreement with the

08:25.840 --> 08:30.480
thought that you were expressing that one of the best ways of sharpening and systematizing

08:30.480 --> 08:37.120
our inquiry into a phenomenon is to figure out how to use mathematical tools for modeling it

08:37.120 --> 08:42.080
or understanding it. And as I said, I think that's really hard in the case of consciousness,

08:42.080 --> 08:48.560
but I think that quality spaces, which we'll talk about more later, that's one of the ways

08:48.560 --> 08:55.760
in to start doing that in the case of consciousness. I guess also, maybe this is another way of

08:55.760 --> 09:04.800
expressing why I was motivated and gravitated towards this kind of topic. So there's this

09:04.800 --> 09:10.160
famous passage at the end of Thomas Naples, What Does It Like to Be a Bet?, where he says,

09:11.120 --> 09:15.520
Investigating consciousness is really hard, but maybe it would be more tractable if we could

09:15.520 --> 09:21.280
somehow develop an objective phenomenology or a way of understanding conscious experiences that

09:21.280 --> 09:27.200
doesn't require one to have had the experiences under question. And this passage is really well

09:27.200 --> 09:34.000
known, but most people react to it with thought that, well, that sounds cool, but what would this

09:34.000 --> 09:38.480
look like? It's not clear what an objective phenomenology would be or whether that's even

09:38.480 --> 09:45.280
coherent or makes sense. So one of my most recent publications is entitled Objective

09:45.280 --> 09:49.680
Phenomenology and argues that it is indeed possible to develop an objective phenomenology

09:49.680 --> 09:54.880
and that the way of doing so is to investigate the structure of consciousness. So basically,

09:54.880 --> 10:00.320
my view is that purely structural facts about consciousness, for example, the kinds of facts

10:00.320 --> 10:06.400
captured by mathematical models, those are objective phenomenal facts. And that's a way of

10:06.480 --> 10:12.560
doing objective phenomenology. And the paper I mentioned of mine was published just last year,

10:12.560 --> 10:18.560
but the basic ideas behind it have been a guiding thought and guiding motivation behind my work

10:18.560 --> 10:24.560
for a number of years. So I think that's another way of explaining or justifying why

10:25.760 --> 10:29.680
a focus on the structure of consciousness and in particular on figuring out ways to

10:29.680 --> 10:34.560
mathematically model different aspects of consciousness experiences is interesting and

10:34.560 --> 10:39.200
promising and maybe will help pave the way towards progress in consciousness research.

10:39.760 --> 10:44.320
But this might come a little bit out of the left wing maybe, but there's something deeper,

10:44.320 --> 10:50.400
almost mysterious in the fact that if you really boil down science and you really think about all

10:50.400 --> 10:55.200
of this, it's almost like mathematics is all there is. I don't know, you can go as extreme as

10:55.200 --> 10:59.040
Max Teckmark maybe to really say that it's almost ontological in nature, but isn't it,

10:59.840 --> 11:05.200
what you said really brings so true in my thinking as well that when science is at its best,

11:05.200 --> 11:10.080
it just comes up with a bunch of equations. And so it seems exciting that we might have

11:10.080 --> 11:15.840
reached a point in consciousness research that we can use the same language. And so when Galileo

11:15.840 --> 11:19.280
Galilei said the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics, that we now

11:19.280 --> 11:23.760
reached a chapter where it comes to consciousness. And we can start maybe reading it in the same

11:23.760 --> 11:28.560
language. So that seems very exciting at the same time mysterious maybe that just works.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.440
Yeah, well, so a couple thoughts there. One is that I think we're still pretty far off from

11:35.440 --> 11:39.680
actually being able to do that with consciousness, just because I think we're still very much in

11:39.680 --> 11:46.720
the early stages of inquiring about consciousness and and figuring it out. So one analogy I like

11:46.720 --> 11:53.600
to make is that we're sort of in this pre Newtonian stage in investigating consciousness,

11:53.600 --> 11:57.600
a stage analogous to creating Newton and investigating the physical world where

11:58.240 --> 12:02.560
part of what we're trying to do is figure out the basic insights that will enable

12:02.560 --> 12:08.640
systematic mathematical theories in the future. And you know, it's really hard to break past that

12:08.640 --> 12:15.840
basic stage. That's part of why like Newtonian physics was so remarkable. So I guess in my mind

12:15.840 --> 12:23.280
we're very much at the early stages. And maybe we're on the cusp of developing more sophisticated

12:23.280 --> 12:28.080
mathematical models. But I think there's still a lot of work in just figuring out how do we think

12:28.080 --> 12:32.880
about the structure of consciousness in the first place and then what kinds of formalisms will be

12:32.880 --> 12:37.200
useful for for thinking about that. But then to return to the first part of what you were saying.

12:37.840 --> 12:42.400
So one of the lines of thought you might have about the physical world is you might

12:43.280 --> 12:48.320
some people are sympathetic to a kind of Pythagoreanism where everything is just math,

12:48.320 --> 12:52.960
there's no there's nothing more to the world than just mathematical structures. And similarly,

12:52.960 --> 12:57.600
you might take a similar attitude towards consciousness. Maybe consciousness is just

12:57.600 --> 13:03.200
more math. There's not all this like intrinsic Pauli stuff. It's just it's just mathematical

13:03.200 --> 13:08.960
structures. And I'm somebody who's very pro investigating the structure of consciousness.

13:08.960 --> 13:13.680
But I'm also somebody who thinks that there's more to consciousness than just structure. I think that

13:15.040 --> 13:18.800
investigating the structure of consciousness will tell us a whole lot about consciousness. It'll

13:18.800 --> 13:23.360
give us these frameworks for thinking about it more systematically, but it's not going to capture

13:23.360 --> 13:27.920
everything. And I think part of what is in fact remarkable about consciousness and interesting

13:27.920 --> 13:36.400
about it is that it's a phenomenon that consists of more than just structure. And even if we developed

13:36.400 --> 13:42.720
the best mathematical models we possibly could, I think that they would still be leaving something

13:42.720 --> 13:47.920
out, they wouldn't be inadequate, they might capture all the structural aspects of consciousness.

13:47.920 --> 13:56.000
But I'm somebody who thinks that there's qualia in the most robust real sense that you might think.

14:00.000 --> 14:07.360
If I may push on that a little bit, then what do you think of this idea that maybe when it comes

14:07.360 --> 14:12.560
to science, though, that what science can explain might then maybe be limited to the structure,

14:12.560 --> 14:15.920
maybe when it comes to the whole world and consciousness. So in other words, so maybe

14:15.920 --> 14:20.080
it is true that there are things that are hard problems that beyond scientists reach, but at

14:20.080 --> 14:26.720
least now we have something here that we can pull on and become more scientific about it. And it has

14:26.720 --> 14:32.160
this promise that it falls into the fold of mathematical understanding of the world as we

14:32.160 --> 14:38.800
have in physics and other disciplines. Yeah, I mean, I think that's a really interesting idea.

14:38.880 --> 14:48.160
And I'm not sure what my own view on that is yet. So that's partly because I think

14:48.160 --> 14:53.920
it's kind of up for grabs, what we think of as the nature of the science of consciousness

14:53.920 --> 14:59.360
and the scope of scientific investigation in general. I guess I'm somebody who's

14:59.360 --> 15:03.680
fairly sympathetic to the general thought that scientific investigation aims to tell us about

15:03.680 --> 15:07.280
the structure of the world. But you might think that in the case of consciousness,

15:07.280 --> 15:11.440
there's an exception. There's a different kind of epistemic relationship that we bear to our

15:11.440 --> 15:15.680
own conscious experiences than that we bear to the external world. We're in direct contact with

15:15.680 --> 15:19.840
our own conscious experiences in a way that we're not in direct contact with the external world.

15:19.840 --> 15:26.080
And because of that, we're able to apply our knowledge, not just of the structure of the domain

15:26.080 --> 15:33.840
under investigation, but also its intrinsic nature. I guess I do think that everything I just said

15:33.840 --> 15:39.120
is true. But the thing that I feel unsure about is, how should we think about the scope of the

15:39.120 --> 15:45.120
science of consciousness? Is it the case that in acquiring knowledge of and investigating the

15:45.120 --> 15:49.200
qualitative character of our experiences, is that within the purview of the science of consciousness,

15:49.200 --> 15:55.280
or is it not? And I mean, in some ways, I think this is, but you might think, for example,

15:55.280 --> 16:00.800
scientific investigation by nature has to produce public knowledge, and we can't have

16:00.800 --> 16:05.040
public knowledge of the qualities of one's own experiences. That's something that

16:05.040 --> 16:11.840
is essentially private. So anyway, I guess my thought is that there's an interesting question

16:11.840 --> 16:16.720
here that concerns both how we should think about the scope of investigation into consciousness,

16:16.720 --> 16:20.240
but also just how we should think about the nature of science in general.

16:20.880 --> 16:27.040
Oh, that's very interesting. In fact, Ken, push you on the more crazy things. So you brought up

16:27.040 --> 16:32.160
Newton, right? And so there's an interesting piece of history there that maybe we can learn from.

16:32.160 --> 16:36.800
And so my understanding is that it was quite important for him that he basically the way

16:36.800 --> 16:42.640
discovered or invented calculus to then make progress in physics. And so the question that

16:42.640 --> 16:47.440
I have is, do you think that we might also have to work on a mathematics side of things? And maybe

16:47.440 --> 16:52.080
that will help us to learn what breakthroughs in the science of consciousness. Yeah, I think that's

16:52.080 --> 16:56.720
a really interesting question too. I guess I don't see any positive reason for thinking that.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.840
It seems to me that the difficulties with figuring out how to mathematically model our

17:01.840 --> 17:08.080
conscious experiences don't lie on the side of, oh, we need more sophisticated or just novel

17:08.640 --> 17:15.200
mathematical frameworks or formalisms, but instead that it's just really not obvious how to think

17:15.200 --> 17:21.040
about the target of inquiry that we're trying to develop mathematical models of. So I mean, in the

17:21.040 --> 17:27.920
case of quality spaces, it's not like the mathematical structures that we need to appeal to

17:27.920 --> 17:35.760
are particularly new or novel or anything. They're like geometric spaces and things that are fairly

17:35.760 --> 17:40.160
familiar. Maybe it's the case that there will be certain aspects of conscious experiences where

17:40.160 --> 17:45.680
we just don't have anything in our current mathematical repertoire that adequately captures

17:45.680 --> 17:51.920
that structure. But I guess in the absence of a compelling example, I'm inclined to think that

17:51.920 --> 17:58.720
the default is to just assume that, well, the difficulty just lies on getting a better qualitative

17:58.720 --> 18:05.280
understanding of the domain under consideration rather than on the tools that we have for modeling

18:05.280 --> 18:11.360
that domain. Yeah, that's convincing. So maybe this might be a good point to lead into what you

18:11.360 --> 18:17.760
prepared. We might have weathered everybody's appetite on how can this be done to talk more

18:17.760 --> 18:25.600
formally about the structure of consciousness and quality of spaces. Okay, so I prepared a

18:25.600 --> 18:32.080
brief presentation of the ideas in one of my articles, Vaudelay Mental Qualities, that was

18:32.080 --> 18:38.160
published, well, I guess not last year, two years ago now, in the Journal of Philosophical Review.

18:38.720 --> 18:45.680
And I'm going to just provide a pretty brief overview of the core ideas from this article

18:45.680 --> 18:52.400
and mention a few of the interesting questions or applications that arise from the frameworks that

18:52.400 --> 18:59.600
I developed. So I'll keep it pretty short and compact. So the central question that I'm

18:59.600 --> 19:05.680
investigated that I'm interested in here is how do we model the qualities of

19:06.400 --> 19:12.160
conscious experiences, qualities like those involved in seeing red or feeling pain,

19:13.120 --> 19:20.720
smelling cinnamon. And my article is arguing that the standard approach for modeling these mental

19:20.720 --> 19:28.880
qualities is inadequate, that it can't capture a certain core feature of our conscious experiences.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.800
And then I develop a new framework that's more powerful and flexible and showcase some of the

19:32.800 --> 19:39.280
applications of the framework. So maybe just start, let me introduce the concept of a quality

19:39.280 --> 19:44.720
space model. This is probably familiar to many audience members, even if not by that name.

19:44.720 --> 19:51.840
So a quality space model in general is a model of some domain of qualities, for example, colors,

19:51.840 --> 19:58.320
sounds, smells. And the most famous example is the three-dimensional model of color experiences

19:58.320 --> 20:04.720
that has huge saturation and brightness as dimensions. But there are quality space models

20:04.720 --> 20:08.880
where at least potentially could be quality space models for just about any domain of

20:08.880 --> 20:15.440
qualities, auditory, olfactory, and so forth. So these models are pretty remarkable for

20:16.320 --> 20:20.160
people interested in consciousness. And in fact, I think this is a very under-explored

20:20.160 --> 20:27.040
aspect of consciousness research. And one reason is that quality space models are one of the few

20:27.040 --> 20:34.880
cases where we actually have systematic models of some aspect of conscious experiences and where

20:34.880 --> 20:40.960
we know pretty well how to conduct empirical investigation and to develop mathematical formalisms.

20:41.600 --> 20:47.920
Another reason is that quality space models are super general. Any domain of mental qualities

20:47.920 --> 20:53.840
is going to be structured by similarity relations. And as soon as we have similarity, we can model

20:53.840 --> 21:00.960
that domain of qualities using a geometric space. So if part of our goal is to map out the structures

21:00.960 --> 21:05.600
and conscious experiences, then a significant part of that project is probably going to be

21:06.160 --> 21:10.880
consistent developing quality space models for different domains of experiences.

21:12.240 --> 21:16.480
Okay, so one very quick termological note. I'm using the term mental qualities here

21:16.480 --> 21:22.000
and also in the article, but I'm treating that as synonymous with terms like phenomenal qualities

21:22.480 --> 21:30.000
or quality. So the standard approach to quality space models, what I'll call the standard framework,

21:30.000 --> 21:36.240
models mental qualities via points in geometric cold spaces, where the distances between points

21:36.240 --> 21:43.680
correspond to degrees of phenomenal similarity. And you can kind of see this representation of

21:43.680 --> 21:48.080
the three-dimensional model for color experiences in this picture here.

21:48.560 --> 21:55.520
And the standard framework, it works pretty well, but one aspect of conscious experiences that it

21:55.520 --> 22:02.240
doesn't really work so well for is what I call phenomenal precision. So to get a grip on precision,

22:02.240 --> 22:08.320
think about the contrast between your full-view color experience of something as scarlet versus

22:08.320 --> 22:12.960
your peripheral color experience of something as red. So your full-view color experience is more

22:13.040 --> 22:20.400
precise than your peripheral color experience. And precision, in the sense that I'm using the term,

22:20.400 --> 22:26.080
denotes a certain phenomenal property, a certain property of your experiences, namely the property

22:26.080 --> 22:30.720
that contrasts your full-view color experience from your peripheral color experience.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.680
Precision isn't just specific to color experience though. So think about, for example,

22:35.680 --> 22:40.400
the phenomenal contrast between, say, hearing a sound that's muffled versus a sound that's clear

22:40.400 --> 22:47.040
or touching a surface with your fingertips versus with your back. Those also plausibly

22:47.040 --> 22:54.560
involve contrasts in precision. So there's this feature of an alvenology that is just an aspect

22:54.560 --> 23:00.640
of our conscious experiences. And the standard framework has kind of an awkward time capturing

23:00.640 --> 23:04.800
precision. And that's because the standard framework models mental qualities via points,

23:05.360 --> 23:10.000
but imprecise qualities correspond to regions rather than points. At least that's a very

23:10.080 --> 23:16.160
natural way of thinking about precision. There's more than I say in the paper to motivate this

23:16.800 --> 23:21.920
appeal to regions. For example, some people think, well, couldn't we just add an extra dimension

23:21.920 --> 23:27.680
before precision? And that would be one possibility, but I think that for various reasons, that

23:27.680 --> 23:34.720
isn't the most appealing possibility for capturing precision. So a very natural move when we start

23:34.720 --> 23:41.760
thinking about precision and quality space models is to move from modeling mental qualities using

23:41.760 --> 23:50.880
points to using regions. And that's the move that I make in my paper. So it's a pretty basic idea,

23:50.880 --> 23:55.360
represent mental qualities via regions and meaning sets of points instead of individual points.

23:56.000 --> 24:03.920
But part of what I argue is that this pretty simple move is much more powerful and interesting than

24:03.920 --> 24:09.760
you might initially think. And it enables rich new investigation into consciousness that's at the

24:09.760 --> 24:18.160
intersection of philosophy and coccy and math. So there's a few constraints that we want on our

24:18.160 --> 24:24.880
models if we are doing things in terms of regions rather than points. So first and foremost, we

24:24.880 --> 24:30.000
want sizes of regions to correspond to degrees of precision. So the introduction of regions is

24:30.000 --> 24:36.320
intended to provide a way of capturing precision. So experiences that are more imprecise will

24:36.320 --> 24:41.920
correspond to bigger regions. And then we want one to one correspondence between what we call

24:41.920 --> 24:47.040
permissible regions or regions that actually represent genuine possible mental qualities

24:47.040 --> 24:52.640
and the qualities themselves. We want distance to inversely correspond to phenomenal similarity

24:52.640 --> 24:58.480
and we want phenomenal identity when two qualities are indistinguishable to correspond to distance

24:58.480 --> 25:05.120
here to occupy exactly the same location in the space. So in the paper itself, I go through

25:05.120 --> 25:09.600
different elements of the regional framework and I explain how to think about them and the

25:09.600 --> 25:15.920
substituted philosophical issues that arise. I'm not going to talk about that stuff. Instead of

25:15.920 --> 25:20.640
all all I'm going to do here is I'm just going to mention a few interesting questions that arise

25:20.640 --> 25:25.040
when we start thinking in terms of the regional framework and also some of the applications

25:25.040 --> 25:30.560
that arise when we move to the regional framework. So here's one interesting question. We can ask

25:31.360 --> 25:39.200
what kinds of regions actually represent possible qualities? So a region in my definition is just

25:39.200 --> 25:45.120
any set of points and for any quality space model there's going to be all sorts of weirdly

25:45.120 --> 25:50.480
structured sets of points where it's not obvious whether that's that corresponds to a real

25:50.480 --> 25:55.280
phenomenal possibility. So for example you might wonder whether there could be experiences that

25:55.280 --> 26:00.640
correspond to disconnected regions. Could you have a color experience that represents something

26:00.640 --> 26:06.800
either as aquamarine or scarlet but no shades in between? You might wonder what that kind of

26:06.800 --> 26:15.440
experience be like is such an experience possible? And those are philosophical and empirical questions

26:15.440 --> 26:19.760
but what the regional framework enables us to do is to translate these into a more precise

26:19.760 --> 26:26.800
mathematical language that allows us to ask these questions in a more precise way. And interestingly

26:26.800 --> 26:32.160
it also makes it the case that different theories about the space and structure of possible

26:32.160 --> 26:37.600
mental qualities will correspond to different formal constraints on the set of permissible regions.

26:39.040 --> 26:44.400
So one thing to notice here is how the regional framework enables us to start theorizing about

26:44.400 --> 26:48.720
the qualities of consciousness experiences more systematically. You know it would be difficult

26:48.800 --> 26:53.680
to even formulate these questions in the first place without the use of this framework.

26:53.680 --> 26:58.880
So I think that provides a glimpse of how the regional framework enables us to address

26:58.880 --> 27:04.000
theoretical and empirical questions with greater precision and to raise new questions that we

27:04.000 --> 27:10.080
previously lacked the conceptual tools to think about. That's one new interesting question that

27:10.080 --> 27:15.040
arises when we move to the regional framework. Another interesting question concerns the metric.

27:15.040 --> 27:19.840
So there's all sorts of ways of constructing a metric meaning a distance function on regions

27:19.840 --> 27:24.640
assuming that we already have a well-defined notion of distance between points. So for example

27:25.280 --> 27:30.400
one of the most commonly used metrics on regions is the least distance metric where the distance

27:30.400 --> 27:36.080
between two regions is the distance between their closest points. Another common metric is the

27:36.080 --> 27:40.720
average distance metric where the distance between two regions is the average distance between all

27:40.800 --> 27:48.720
their points. And if we're seeking a metric that models phenomenal similarity then we're going to

27:48.720 --> 27:54.560
need that metric to satisfy certain kinds of formal constraints. So for example we want every

27:54.560 --> 27:59.840
region to have distance zero to itself since distance zero represents maximal similarity

27:59.840 --> 28:06.720
meaning phenomenal identity. So once we identify these formal constraints it's a pretty substantive

28:06.720 --> 28:12.240
and interesting question of figuring out which kind of metric on regions actually is the right one

28:12.240 --> 28:17.200
for modeling phenomenal similarity. And one thing I argue in my article is that neither the least

28:17.200 --> 28:22.240
distance metric nor the average distance metric work they systematically make incorrect predictions.

28:23.280 --> 28:27.760
So instead I propose a new metric that I think generates the right kinds of results

28:27.760 --> 28:31.920
which I call the qualitative similarity metric or the Paul metric. This is the

28:32.640 --> 28:38.240
formal statement of the metric where A and B are two regions. And I'm not going to explain how

28:38.240 --> 28:42.320
exactly the metric works but to give you some intuition you can basically think of it as a

28:42.320 --> 28:47.680
more sophisticated version of an average distance metric. So the average distance metric works pretty

28:47.680 --> 28:52.720
well most of the time but it turns out to lead to systematically incorrect results

28:53.520 --> 28:58.320
for phenomenal similarity when we have cases involving overlapping regions. So for example

28:58.320 --> 29:04.320
the average distance metric yields the observed result that every mental quality is less than

29:04.320 --> 29:09.040
maximally similar to itself and that's because if you take the average distance from a region to

29:09.040 --> 29:15.360
itself you'll get a non-zero value. So my Paul metric doesn't generate these sorts of absurd

29:15.360 --> 29:20.400
consequences but still yields results that otherwise resemble average distance and more

29:20.400 --> 29:25.120
generally it yields the right kinds of predictions across all the kinds of relationships that two

29:25.120 --> 29:30.640
regions can bear to each other. So that's one thing that's kind of cool. We get this more

29:30.640 --> 29:37.040
interesting sophisticated formalism for capturing phenomenal similarity. Also I think one thing

29:37.040 --> 29:41.760
that's cool that comes out of the regional framework is that there are multiple dimensions

29:41.760 --> 29:47.040
of phenomenal similarity and we can formally disentangle those dimensions. So alongside

29:47.040 --> 29:52.240
qualitative similarity measured by the Paul metric there's also precision similarity.

29:52.240 --> 29:57.520
Similarity with respect to how precise two experiences are which is measured by

29:57.520 --> 30:03.200
a precision similarity metric. So for example think about a full view experience of red

30:03.200 --> 30:07.280
and a full view experience of green versus a peripheral experience of red. The two full

30:07.280 --> 30:12.880
view experiences are similar in a certain respect to each other in which they aren't to

30:12.880 --> 30:20.480
the peripheral experience. So precision similarity on the way that I'm defining the metric is

30:20.480 --> 30:27.120
measured by the ratio between the smaller region to the larger region. And again there's a lot more

30:27.120 --> 30:34.160
that's said in the paper to walk through the metric into motivated. But stepping back thinking

30:34.160 --> 30:38.320
about the big picture I think what's interesting here is that this is one case where I think

30:38.320 --> 30:43.840
formalization can actually help with understanding the phenomenology. So what the regional framework

30:43.840 --> 30:49.120
enables us to do is to pull part two distinct dimensions of phenomenal similarity and seeing

30:49.120 --> 30:55.040
how they fall out of the formal structure of the regional framework this gives us a much more

30:55.040 --> 30:59.760
precise and systematic understanding of phenomenal similarity than we would otherwise have.

31:01.280 --> 31:07.360
Last thing I'll mention as an interesting application of the regional framework concerns

31:07.360 --> 31:13.600
the phenomenal psorias. So a phenomenal psorias is a case where a subject cannot discriminate

31:14.400 --> 31:19.840
an object alpha from an object beta or beta from gamma but can discriminate alpha from gamma. So

31:19.840 --> 31:23.600
for example imagine that you're in a psychophysics experiment and you're seeing three

31:23.600 --> 31:29.520
color shifts each of which is a different shade of gray. And you can discriminate the first

31:29.520 --> 31:34.400
from the third but you can't discriminate the first from the second or the second from the third.

31:34.400 --> 31:39.520
So if I I tried to actually construct a phenomenal psorias case here if I did it

31:40.320 --> 31:46.880
aptly then you will be able to discriminate the shade of gray for of this first circle alpha

31:46.880 --> 31:52.560
from that of gamma but not any of the pairwise circles. So alpha and beta might look to be the

31:52.560 --> 31:57.120
same shade of gray and beta and gamma might look to be the same shade of gray. Okay so that's the

31:57.120 --> 32:01.840
phenomenon that's a phenomenon that's well known. There's been a lot written about it. It's a phenomenon

32:01.840 --> 32:05.680
that calls out for explanation. You might wonder what exactly is going on phenomenologically

32:05.680 --> 32:12.800
in phenomenal psorias cases. And the idea that I had is that we can apply the regional framework

32:12.800 --> 32:20.400
to the phenomenal psorias where the probability of a phenomenal psorias occurring I hypothesize

32:20.400 --> 32:25.280
corresponds to the overlap structure of the relevant regions. So in other words the more

32:25.280 --> 32:31.360
a and b overlap or the more b and c overlap the more likely it is that the subject would not be

32:31.360 --> 32:37.440
able to discriminate the color of alpha from beta or beta from gamma and the less a and c overlap

32:37.440 --> 32:41.840
the more likely it is that they'll be able to discriminate the color of alpha from gamma. So

32:41.840 --> 32:48.240
that's the basic idea. So that yields this probabilistic model of the phenomenal psorias

32:48.240 --> 32:54.080
that comes out of the regional framework. I'm not going to fully explain all this that would

32:54.080 --> 32:59.920
require a bit too much time on technical issues but here's the basic idea. The regional framework

32:59.920 --> 33:07.200
gives us this probabilistic model of how likely it is that a phenomenal psorias occurs where the

33:07.200 --> 33:13.040
input to the model is the regions that represent the subjects experiences and in particular the

33:13.040 --> 33:18.080
overlap structure between those regions. And the thought is that a phenomenal psorias is more

33:18.080 --> 33:24.640
likely to occur when a and b overlap or or b and c overlap or or when a and c overlap less.

33:24.880 --> 33:31.040
Okay so one exciting thing about this application in particular is that it has the potential to

33:31.040 --> 33:37.520
inform future empirical investigation into consciousness but I won't talk about that more

33:37.520 --> 33:45.920
for limits of time. So here's just a summary of what I've been talking about in this brief overview.

33:45.920 --> 33:51.920
So the goal of this article of mine is to develop a new framework for quality space models where the

33:51.920 --> 33:57.200
core idea is to represent qualities using regions and where size of region inversely corresponds to

33:57.200 --> 34:02.640
degree of precision and the regional framework enables us to ask a bunch of interesting new

34:02.640 --> 34:07.440
questions about phenomenology for example which kinds of regions represents possible mental

34:07.440 --> 34:12.160
qualities how we construct the right similarity metrics and it also has a number of applications

34:12.160 --> 34:16.640
for example the probabilistic model of the phenomenal psorias as well as a number of other

34:16.640 --> 34:21.680
things. And there's an article link at the bottom if you're interested in taking a look at the details.

34:22.240 --> 34:29.280
I wanted to end with a more general thought so I'm interested generally in philosophical

34:29.280 --> 34:35.040
questions about the structure of consciousness and I have listed here some of the questions that I

34:35.040 --> 34:41.200
think are especially interesting or important for making progress. These are mostly fairly

34:41.200 --> 34:46.400
foundational questions but I think they're questions that we ought to explore to get a better

34:46.400 --> 34:51.360
understanding of this topic and in fact all these questions are under explored there's not

34:51.360 --> 34:57.040
yet much work in philosophy or the science of consciousness on these sorts of questions.

34:58.080 --> 35:02.640
But I think this is also changing you know in recent years there's been more and more

35:02.640 --> 35:07.840
attention being paid to the structure of consciousness and I think this is exciting and

35:07.840 --> 35:12.080
I'm interested in seeing how things continue to develop in the future.

35:12.720 --> 35:22.160
Yeah very cool I have so many questions and ideas coming out of all of this this is by the way this

35:22.160 --> 35:29.680
is also really great this is very inspiring about these open questions and I almost feel like I would

35:29.680 --> 35:34.240
like to put a poll below in the video what viewers might be most interested in and get you back on

35:34.240 --> 35:38.720
to talk about one of these topics because each of these are really interesting questions.

35:39.440 --> 35:45.440
Well these maybe it's worth mentioning that these first four questions I have written on or

35:45.440 --> 35:52.560
and currently writing on the last four questions I'm interested in and I have thoughts about but

35:52.560 --> 35:59.600
for me they're questions for future work so I've in my in my research program I've been slowly

35:59.600 --> 36:02.880
trying to progress through this host of questions.

36:03.520 --> 36:10.960
Great great so when it comes to the region's idea that you bring in it seems to me

36:10.960 --> 36:15.680
it's one of these things that you go in hindsight everybody should go da because this whole idea

36:15.680 --> 36:22.080
that your your qualia would be a point in some kind of space seems questionable in the first place

36:22.080 --> 36:27.200
right because a point in a way as a mathematical object is infinitely small and it comes with

36:27.200 --> 36:31.360
all kinds of problems but when people show color spaces they never show these points

36:32.160 --> 36:36.800
they already show your regions right and so you're kind of duped into into thinking you're not

36:36.800 --> 36:42.080
thinking as that as a discretized kind of point space so that's really interesting I also find

36:42.080 --> 36:47.040
interesting that you you got the objection that sounded like that some people said well why why

36:47.680 --> 36:53.120
not solve that by adding another dimension and so when it when it comes to the color space at least

36:53.120 --> 36:57.680
it sounds to me that your idea and that's actually key is that let's say your peripheral

36:58.240 --> 37:04.480
sensing your periphery quality of scarlet is less precise but if it's a region in color space then

37:04.480 --> 37:10.720
that means that it can't be arbitrarily imprecise the neighboring colors in that space they determined

37:10.720 --> 37:17.520
that impreciseness because that is where the imprecision can go to right if you if you just

37:17.520 --> 37:25.120
add another dimension and the imprecision can be something other than that this redness that you

37:25.120 --> 37:30.320
don't see it as precise as something at the fovea if you think of that as spreading being more

37:30.320 --> 37:36.000
wide or more fuzzy in color space well that means that it has something to do with which other colors

37:36.000 --> 37:45.920
are nearby yeah or I see so at least if you're thinking that connectedness or maybe complexity

37:45.920 --> 37:51.840
is a constraint on the relevant regions if I'm understanding your question if you didn't require

37:51.920 --> 37:56.960
connectedness then it doesn't really matter which other colors are nearby because you could have

37:56.960 --> 38:02.160
you know some very yeah weirdly shaped regions so that I mean but I think that's just an

38:02.160 --> 38:08.640
interesting open question and we don't really know the answer to this yeah so intuitively I just

38:08.640 --> 38:14.880
assumed that it must be connected but it almost seems to me like an empirical question that we

38:14.880 --> 38:19.920
might be able to answer right because you could show different kinds of shades of red and you

38:19.920 --> 38:24.320
could basically explore the color space that's all around that redness you can do that at the fovea

38:24.320 --> 38:30.560
and you can do it in the periphery and basically you if you can show more shades of red that are

38:30.560 --> 38:34.320
all around this color space it's almost like you could map that region that you're talking about

38:34.320 --> 38:40.640
yeah yeah so I think that's one of the ways in which this the regional framework that I developed

38:41.200 --> 38:45.200
lends itself to empirical investigation because there's going to be different kinds of

38:46.000 --> 38:53.520
predictions depending on for example what the structure of a given region is as far as whether

38:54.160 --> 38:59.920
it's an empirical question whether the regions for a quality space are have to be connected or not

38:59.920 --> 39:04.400
I think there's one question that's empirical which is how should we be thinking about the

39:05.760 --> 39:10.240
regions for human color experiences what how should we be thinking about more generally just

39:10.240 --> 39:15.680
the model of human color experiences but then there's also a more general question

39:15.680 --> 39:21.200
how do we think about the space of all possible experiences where maybe it's the case that humans

39:21.200 --> 39:27.040
just have a certain kind of cognitive architecture that only enables certain kinds of possible

39:27.040 --> 39:31.600
color experiences and that wouldn't be surprising if if it were the case like maybe there's not

39:31.600 --> 39:38.160
really much advantage to representing something as correspond in the way that like a disconnected

39:38.880 --> 39:44.880
would so there's also this more general metaphysical question of what kinds of

39:45.680 --> 39:52.800
experiences are possible in general independent of how human color experiences happen to be

39:52.800 --> 39:58.320
and that's a that's a difficult question I'm not sure you know I'm not sure what

39:58.320 --> 40:02.800
considerations would bear either way on that question but I think one cool thing is that

40:02.800 --> 40:05.840
now we can actually formulate this question I wonder about it at least

40:05.840 --> 40:12.400
yeah I don't know if you know but there are some human tetrachromats so they have four color

40:12.400 --> 40:17.760
receptors and so that that color gamut should be wider and yeah it's very little work on that

40:17.760 --> 40:24.080
actually so well so this also goes to I think some very underexplored and very interesting

40:24.080 --> 40:29.200
questions about quality spaces about so there's tetrachromats there's also colorblind people

40:29.200 --> 40:34.000
and then there's also just other creatures that seem like they might have color experiences but

40:34.000 --> 40:38.960
perhaps with a different dimensionality right and there's an interesting question of how to

40:38.960 --> 40:44.480
think about the relations between these different quality spaces for example should we think that

40:45.040 --> 40:54.480
these all possible color experiences those for neurotypical humans and colorblind humans and

40:54.480 --> 41:01.120
dogs and mantis shrimp are they all embedded in this bigger quality space that captures all

41:01.120 --> 41:07.440
possible color experiences or should we think about the relations between these different

41:07.440 --> 41:12.160
qualities of the same experiential domain but of different spaces in a different way I mean this

41:12.160 --> 41:18.560
is something that I'm interested in thinking about more in the future I have some very speculative

41:18.560 --> 41:25.440
thoughts at the moment on on this but I think that's an exciting topic to investigate there's

41:25.440 --> 41:31.440
also I don't know if you ever heard about this but our lens is actually filtering it's basically a

41:31.440 --> 41:36.320
low pass filter and so you can some people they lose their lens and they get just a glass replacement

41:36.320 --> 41:40.320
that doesn't have the same properties and they can see parts of the ultraviolet spectrum that we

41:40.320 --> 41:45.280
can't see just with a regular eye so we're capable of doing it but it's the lens that prevents us from

41:45.280 --> 41:54.000
doing it that's interesting yeah it seems hard enough from what I read to find out whether those

41:54.000 --> 42:01.200
people actually do see something other than maybe a very bright violet right so it's very

42:01.200 --> 42:05.600
that's where we run into these limits unless maybe we can come up with more clever techniques

42:05.600 --> 42:10.080
than what we have in terms of finding out whether they have color perceptions that that we don't have

42:10.720 --> 42:14.800
yeah I mean so I was going to say that the hard part there then is figuring out what

42:14.800 --> 42:21.200
the phenomenology for those people is but I mean one possible approach would be to just

42:21.280 --> 42:27.600
first see whether they're able to make more discriminations than ordinary people are able

42:27.600 --> 42:32.560
to make and that's I'm inclined to think provides some defeasible evidence in favor of thinking that

42:32.560 --> 42:39.040
they actually do have more color experiences so I had a technical question so I really like the

42:39.040 --> 42:44.720
way that you explain one of your equations was not just with a usual notation but you had the

42:44.720 --> 42:51.120
discs basically showing the different set configurations and so the thought that popped

42:51.120 --> 42:57.760
from my mind there is that I'm also very visual thinker and it's how much of the formalism that

42:57.760 --> 43:03.520
you have depends on the and you kind of answered this already but how much of it depends on the

43:03.520 --> 43:11.920
size of the shape so if it's like a disc like a ball like shape right then in reality it may

43:11.920 --> 43:18.320
not be as you said that and and so would the metrics the work if it's not that yeah so so

43:18.320 --> 43:25.360
basically it doesn't maybe I should pull up that and it's just for so really speaking when when I

43:25.360 --> 43:30.640
envision that region just without further thought I would in my mind it would be something that's

43:30.640 --> 43:38.720
more Gaussian or Gaussian than a solid disc where it seems that even the region itself is not homogeneous

43:38.720 --> 43:44.720
but that the region itself might have like a bell curve kind of shape or something or something

43:44.720 --> 43:50.800
equivalent in two-dimensional three-dimensional space yeah so let me let me speak to both things

43:50.800 --> 43:57.280
that you were raising so for for the first thing how much does the way that this metric works

43:58.000 --> 44:04.880
rely upon the assumption that the relevant regions are spherical and the the answer is that it

44:04.880 --> 44:10.880
doesn't at all so you can you don't you don't even need to assume that the regions are disconnected

44:10.880 --> 44:18.160
or sorry that the regions are connected so this this was designed to work with arbitrary regions

44:18.160 --> 44:22.880
of all sorts of weird shapes and sizes and I mean when we're thinking about like very weirdly

44:22.880 --> 44:28.960
shaped regions especially disconnected ones then there's not really clear intuitions anyway about

44:28.960 --> 44:37.200
what the right results should be but what I aim to do in in developing this metric was to make sure

44:37.200 --> 44:43.840
that it covered you know all sorts of weird cases and that included thinking a lot about what the

44:43.840 --> 44:52.720
results would be when we're not assuming uniformity for the shapes or convexity or or anything else so

44:52.720 --> 45:00.080
the answer to the first question is that this I I think is going to be fully general for the second

45:00.080 --> 45:06.000
thing when you were talking about this Gaussian structure there's a part of my paper that discusses

45:06.000 --> 45:13.200
this kind of briefly so what I say is that one thing you might think is that not only should we

45:13.200 --> 45:17.520
move from the standard framework to the regional framework but we should move even further from

45:18.160 --> 45:23.280
the regional framework to a framework where mental qualities are modeled not just by

45:24.160 --> 45:32.720
subsets of a space but also by weighted subsets where each point is assigned some value and where

45:32.720 --> 45:38.240
maybe there's more concentration in the middle than the periphery and so forth so one reason you

45:38.240 --> 45:44.080
might be motivated to move to that kind of structure is that if you think that

45:45.040 --> 45:52.240
that perceptual experiences have probabilistic contents and that that probabilistic structure

45:52.240 --> 45:59.840
is reflected in the phenomenology then that might be reason to not give equal weight to all of the

45:59.840 --> 46:05.520
different parts of the quality space that the relevant region covers so maybe there's more

46:05.520 --> 46:10.960
concentration in for example maybe there's a quality that represents something as having

46:10.960 --> 46:16.720
a high probability of being red but also some low probability of being orange and some low

46:16.720 --> 46:24.000
probability of being purple with when all these like bands of color are of equal size so anyway

46:24.000 --> 46:30.240
that would be a way of further developing this framework that will evolve like more sophisticated

46:31.440 --> 46:37.520
structures than just regions and I think it's super interesting to think about how to develop

46:37.520 --> 46:42.480
that further I mean there would need to be more sophisticated versions of the similarity metrics

46:42.480 --> 46:49.680
I discussed for example and I think that would just be a further envisioning of our models of

46:50.480 --> 46:57.680
quality spaces one thing that I feel myself agnostic about is just whether we do in fact

46:57.680 --> 47:02.080
need that additional structure to capture the phenomenology to me that's just an open question

47:02.080 --> 47:07.440
I think it's very obvious that there is such a thing as precision when we just think about the

47:07.520 --> 47:12.800
contrast between full view experience and peripheral experience but it's not obvious

47:12.800 --> 47:17.760
to me that we need something further not that I'm skeptical but I think it's just

47:17.760 --> 47:24.880
more of an open question but I I'm thinking that this is something that might potentially be

47:24.880 --> 47:32.080
something I'd like to work on in in the future this this field of qualia structure mathematical

47:32.080 --> 47:38.160
phenomenology mathematical consciousness science do you ever feel for where it's headed if you

47:38.160 --> 47:42.480
would have to put money on where things might be in five or ten years do you ever feel for that

47:42.480 --> 47:53.200
there's a direction there I mean I hope that there will be more and more interest in these topics

47:53.200 --> 48:00.240
in the near future and I think that that probably will be the case one thing I hope will happen

48:00.320 --> 48:03.520
and I think there's a good chance of happening is for there to be more

48:04.240 --> 48:10.560
unity across different disciplines right now it feels like I mean this could be said about

48:10.560 --> 48:18.640
consciousness research in general too it feels like there's a lot of different people in different

48:18.640 --> 48:26.000
fields that are sometimes developing research that has connections to each other but are working

48:26.000 --> 48:31.920
in different literatures maybe using different vocabulary or methodologies so I think there's

48:31.920 --> 48:42.320
room for more I guess dialogue across disciplines and more I guess standardization of terms and ideas

48:42.320 --> 48:50.400
and literatures and I think that that would constitute a form of progress I guess I also hope

48:50.400 --> 48:57.200
that more philosophers become interested in these sorts of topics it's the structure of

48:57.200 --> 49:04.720
consciousness is not really a big topic in the philosophy of mind right now but I think it has

49:04.720 --> 49:11.520
the potential to be and I think that there's a lot that philosophers can contribute to our inquiry

49:11.520 --> 49:19.200
into these subject matters so I'm hoping that in the field of philosophies specifically that more

49:19.280 --> 49:26.160
attention is paid to these topics in the future very related to that if somebody's watching this

49:26.160 --> 49:31.120
and is a young student and interested maybe in this direction would you have any advice

49:32.000 --> 49:36.880
for your younger self do you have anything that you could share with somebody like that

49:38.080 --> 49:44.320
yeah well I guess for students interested in this I mean I think consciousness research is a growing

49:44.400 --> 49:53.600
field and that I mean I bet that this is in the end going to be an exciting time in history to be

49:53.600 --> 50:00.720
a part of that field I think that it's a field that is emerging where a lot of stuff is happening

50:00.720 --> 50:07.840
where it's I mean it's only been recently that it's a subject matter that can be seriously

50:07.840 --> 50:12.160
studied by scientists I mean consciousness used to be solely in the province of philosophers

50:12.160 --> 50:16.160
but now there are people from a variety of disciplines you know philosophy, ecocide,

50:16.880 --> 50:25.200
neuro, math even even CS who are focused on consciousness so yeah so I think right now

50:25.200 --> 50:29.760
the field is fairly disparate and heterogeneous but I think it's going to probably become more

50:29.760 --> 50:34.640
unified over time and partly because of that it's a great time to join the field because there's

50:34.640 --> 50:41.680
exciting developments happening I guess maybe it's worth saying that academia is a very tough

50:41.680 --> 50:46.320
career to pursue and that you know anyone who considers it should keep those sorts of practical

50:46.320 --> 50:54.080
considerations in mind too but I really do think that this is an interesting time in history to

50:54.960 --> 51:02.160
be interested and involved in studying consciousness and I suspect that the structure of consciousness

51:02.160 --> 51:10.800
will be a bigger and more and more developed topic as as time goes on yeah I couldn't agree more

51:10.800 --> 51:16.880
so I have a few things that maybe I'll add it out but I really wanted to hear what you think

51:17.440 --> 51:22.080
and this is one thing it's a debate I had with Johannes Kleiner also which and you dropped it

51:22.080 --> 51:27.680
at some point whether science has to produce public knowledge whether science has produced one

51:27.680 --> 51:36.000
has to produce public knowledge so you said that very early on when we talked about whether we might

51:36.000 --> 51:42.000
need new math and so you said that you think that maybe we have to also rethink what science is

51:42.000 --> 51:46.400
and what qualifies as science and how science works and you brought that up that like one of these

51:46.400 --> 51:53.920
points is whether science has to produce public knowledge and yeah and I find this such an interesting

51:53.920 --> 51:59.360
question and so here's that thought experiment that that I thought at some point and I just want

51:59.360 --> 52:02.880
to throw it off like that I bounce it off some people I want to bounce off you and see what you

52:02.880 --> 52:08.000
think so the thought experiment is that it's like in that movie with Will Smith where the

52:08.000 --> 52:13.360
world has ended and he's the only last person alive I imagine I think it's that movie and so

52:14.240 --> 52:19.440
let's imagine this happened it's a zombie apocalypse or the rapture and there's one person left on the

52:19.440 --> 52:24.640
planet that's the last survivor of mankind and that person just happens to be a brilliant scientist

52:25.520 --> 52:31.920
somebody like Albert Einstein or Newton yeah and there's no more need for producing public

52:31.920 --> 52:38.800
knowledge right so there's no more need to express science for others because there's

52:38.800 --> 52:43.760
not going to be another human being anymore again and yet it seems that whatever the scientists

52:43.760 --> 52:51.280
would produce would still be totally accepted as science by all of us yeah that's right although one

52:51.280 --> 52:57.760
asymmetry there perhaps with the consciousness case is that in your scenario the knowledge

52:57.760 --> 53:03.520
produced by the scientists is still in principle communicable and in principle public if there

53:03.520 --> 53:11.440
happened to be like other humans created then he would be able to communicate his minds to

53:11.440 --> 53:16.400
and that's what I question right because that's why it gets absurd right because like no you're

53:16.400 --> 53:22.320
really the last survivor there's not anybody going to come so there's really no more need to even

53:22.320 --> 53:28.080
in principle make it communicable and yet it still seems that then we would be okay with that

53:28.960 --> 53:34.240
so it really seems that the need for making science public and communicable almost seems

53:34.240 --> 53:40.240
more practical than a priori that's what I'm getting at it would be very weird to say that if

53:40.240 --> 53:46.240
this person is doing science just for themselves that that wouldn't be science anymore just because

53:46.240 --> 53:51.760
it can't be shared there's nothing that doesn't seem to be something fundamental about the act of

53:51.760 --> 53:56.320
scientific knowledge being shared between two individuals that makes it scientific

53:57.520 --> 54:02.320
yeah I mean I think that's right I mean I certainly agree that in the scenario you are

54:02.320 --> 54:08.400
sketching then what the person is doing should count as scientific inquiry and scientific knowledge

54:09.120 --> 54:14.640
it still seems to be that there are some asymmetries between that case and the consciousness case for

54:14.640 --> 54:20.800
example even though the particular circumstance that the person is in happens to be one where

54:20.880 --> 54:26.880
there will never be any communication of the findings it's still the case that the kind of

54:27.600 --> 54:32.800
knowledge that the person is acquiring is the kind that could be communicated to other people

54:32.800 --> 54:38.480
I mean maybe that's not a relevant asymmetry so I'm open to thinking that and I certainly think

54:38.480 --> 54:47.040
that there can be first person investigation of conscious experiences that is scientific in many

54:47.040 --> 54:53.200
relevant respects so I was really thinking of this as a largely verbal question of just like

54:53.200 --> 54:58.800
how we define science I mean we could one option would be to think that there's like both first

54:58.800 --> 55:03.680
person and third person science and it just has to be the case that almost all scientific

55:03.680 --> 55:08.320
investigation is third person and that it also third person investigation produces certain

55:08.320 --> 55:14.800
kinds of like benefits like communicability that are less obviously available in the first person

55:14.800 --> 55:24.080
case that seems like a fine way of thinking about things to me yeah because some of your work

55:24.080 --> 55:31.520
in a way does also rely on introspection right and so yeah so therefore I mean I it is it takes

55:31.520 --> 55:40.240
first person science in this case kind of serious and and if you do then some of the issues in

55:40.240 --> 55:43.840
consciousness science they actually kind of fall away because a lot of them they to me at least they

55:43.840 --> 55:49.040
really come from very very hard insistence on third person science and public knowledge

55:50.160 --> 55:53.520
that's right but part of part of what I was thinking about earlier is that

55:54.400 --> 56:00.160
if I think there is a sense in which suppose we encountered like this alien species that

56:00.160 --> 56:07.440
just had different kinds of experiences than us I'm inclined to think that there's going to be certain

56:08.400 --> 56:13.600
things that we know about our own conscious experiences that we're just not going to be able

56:13.600 --> 56:17.760
to communicate to them advice versa I think there's a lot that we could communicate to them for

56:17.760 --> 56:23.840
example structural knowledge about right our own experiences but there might be certain facts about

56:23.840 --> 56:28.880
the qualities of our experiences that are just inaccessible to them because of the way that

56:28.880 --> 56:35.840
they're built and we you could imagine a scenario where we do in fact conduct systematic investigation

56:36.800 --> 56:40.800
of those qualities maybe we like taxonomize and categorize them and and so forth

56:42.480 --> 56:50.000
but I guess one question is just how to think about that kind of inquiry how to think about how

56:50.880 --> 56:55.040
that kind of inquiry relates to normal scientific inquiry as it's normally

56:55.040 --> 57:01.040
practiced and I guess it just seems to me kind of an open question but I mean maybe this is another

57:01.040 --> 57:06.560
way of putting my view though I don't really know how we should think about like the nature of science

57:06.560 --> 57:13.360
but I am confident that phenomenology is a thing that we can do that we can like make progress in

57:13.360 --> 57:22.320
and that we can investigate systematically in the same way that we investigate other subject

57:22.320 --> 57:28.720
matters and whether that's called science or not I don't really care but I'm interested in

57:29.280 --> 57:33.920
figuring out how we can advance that mode of inquiry that's that's really beautifully put

57:33.920 --> 57:39.120
because the next part of my conducting experiment would be let's say life of life after death right

57:39.120 --> 57:45.120
and so if you would die and it would be life after death then in a way to me that's an empirical

57:45.120 --> 57:50.800
question or like a scientific question so you die and then now you you know there's some kind of

57:50.800 --> 57:56.480
life after death kind of things like nobody would say that this is somehow unscientific that you

57:56.480 --> 58:01.040
now have that belief that there's life after death now that that has happened to you do you see what

58:01.040 --> 58:06.240
I'm saying but it's a single person issue it's like only only you could have that empirical

58:06.240 --> 58:14.560
experience and so so that that seems to me again it's a madness but it seems to me then if we if

58:14.560 --> 58:21.040
we open consciousness science that we allow for a single person first person experiences to count

58:21.040 --> 58:26.800
to gain knowledge for each of us on their own then some of these obstacles might go away so

58:27.520 --> 58:33.120
maybe even you know some experiments like Mary's the famous Mary's room and so on it seemed

58:33.760 --> 58:40.480
solvable to me when you when you drop this heart insistence on but it has to be third person has

58:40.480 --> 58:48.880
to be communicable uh anyways uh I know there's a little out there but it does it does pertain to

58:48.880 --> 58:53.840
the qualia space's question a little bit because it is more introspective than I think the push that

58:53.840 --> 59:00.320
psychophysics did which is that was like the first aim to mathematicize phenomenology and it really

59:00.320 --> 59:06.480
went out of his way to to not talk about any first person thing ever so there was no introspective

59:06.480 --> 59:10.800
component and so it seems to me that some of the breakthrough that has happened or the progress

59:10.800 --> 59:17.280
that's going on is by softening that requirement a little bit yeah I know I mean I think that

59:17.280 --> 59:22.640
provides a nice way of seeing a bit about a bit more about my own attitude towards these

59:22.640 --> 59:28.000
pathological points I guess I'm inclined to think that we ought to use a combination of both

59:28.000 --> 59:34.880
first person and third person methods in investigating consciousness and that's what I try to do in my

59:34.880 --> 59:41.280
own research and I mean I think this my work on quality space models is a nice example of that

59:41.280 --> 59:47.520
because the motivation in my view for thinking that there is precision in the first place comes

59:47.520 --> 59:53.600
from introspection just seems very plausible introspectively that foveal color experiences

59:53.600 --> 59:58.000
are phenomenologically distinct from peripheral color experiences but then I think we can also get

59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.400
third person support from that by looking at differences in discriminatory abilities of people

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:09.840
in say foveal vision versus peripheral vision where one of the natural explanations for why

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.720
there are those differences is because there are differences in the associated experiences

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:20.000
and then we can also apply formal methods and think about how do we capture all of this you

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:29.120
know mathematically and then apply those formal methods to you know further stages of inquiry so

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:36.560
I tend to be quite holistic in the the methodology that I think we should adopt and I mean one reason

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.640
is that you know consciousness is just really hard and really difficult to investigate and we

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:46.800
should use whatever tools are available to us and that's not to presume that all any of these tools

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:54.960
is like infallible or trumps all the others but we can still use a combination to try to like

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:02.320
figure out whatever we're trying to attain more knowledge of. Yeah and I think that the success

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:07.520
in a way also speaks for itself if you make progress and there's a success then you don't

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.840
have to question the premises even anymore. I guess one of my main projects right now is

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:18.080
on dimensions of consciousness and trying to develop a philosophical analysis of dimensions

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.680
of consciousness so that's a term that you sometimes see in the science of consciousness

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:30.080
and you sometimes see what are called multi-dimensional models of consciousness

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.640
there have been some proposals for what the dimensions of consciousness might be but what

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.720
nobody has really done yet is develop a systematic analysis of what the relevant

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:44.720
meaning of dimensions of consciousness is here and part of why I became interested in this is that

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:50.160
I think there's one natural sense of dimensions of consciousness where it's just obvious that

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.000
consciousness has an extremely high number of dimensions so in particular if you think of

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.320
dimensions of consciousness as just ways in which conscious experiences vary from each other

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:02.400
then there's going to be innumerably many ways in which conscious experiences can vary from each

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:08.240
other but I think there's also a sense of dimensions of consciousness where it might turn out that

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.120
consciousness in this sense has a low number of dimensions and where searching for the dimensions

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:19.360
of consciousness is going to be an important task for future consciousness research so one of my

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:24.160
projects right now is trying to identify what this more interesting constrained sense of dimensions

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:30.720
of consciousness is and articulating how this has implications for consciousness science

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:37.920
so how is this related to modality so you know having smell or vision those seem like natural

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:43.600
different dimensions that people think of is that is that part of what you're interested in or is

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:48.160
it more about that your the idea is that your consciousness could be graded and you could be

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:53.680
very conscious or less conscious so that's one axis yeah well I think both of those are related

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:59.760
so one observation is that I think it's fine to call different sensory modalities different

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.080
dimensions of consciousness but one thing that we should notice there is that these dimensions

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.840
are not themselves one dimensional so for example visual experiences like there's all sorts of

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.000
different ways in which visual experiences vary so visual experience itself it's going to be

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.720
very high dimensional so part of the task here is thinking about what the sense of dimensions

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:26.720
of consciousness is that allows us to make sense of these sorts of claims like different sensory

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:31.280
modalities are dimensions of consciousness you might wonder what justifies the claim that vision is

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:35.680
a dimension of consciousness but not like pink experience why isn't that why doesn't that count

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.720
as a dimension of consciousness but you also mentioned this idea about great ability and I

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:47.280
think that that's also connected to thinking about this issue so for example think about global

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.680
workspace theory you might have thought that there's an interesting sense in which say size

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.480
of global workspace might be a dimension of consciousness that is different from the sense

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:04.880
in which say color experience might be a dimension of consciousness it seems like the first property

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:12.000
gets closer to something more fundamental or more at the heart of what consciousness is

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.480
then the second thing I'm fascinated because it seems like a really difficult question to me

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:24.480
because I've always been struck when it comes to personalities people are at first glance dazzled

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.720
in the same way as you said that it seems that it's almost infinite dimensional because you said that

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.360
if you think about different people the same thing as you said if you have different experiences

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.720
they seem to be so distinguished from each other and so that screams many many dimensions right

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:45.040
but if you do careful empirical testing what you find is that all personalities of people can be

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:51.600
with I don't know how many 90 something percent of the variance can be done in five dimensions

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:58.640
and to me that's always been a very surprising result that it seems that if you would into it

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:04.480
you would think that the dimensionality space is much higher for personality and so that's right

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.000
so if we're trying to capture all differences in personality we're definitely going to need

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.080
more than just five dimensions but I guess these like the ocean model of personality is intended to

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:21.280
abstract away from certain differences while capturing some of the most robust and universal

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.680
differences in personality that there are and we could do the same thing for consciousness we could

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.160
develop a multi-dimensional model where we abstract away from certain differences

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:36.240
while trying to also identify dimensions that are as universal as possible I mentioned one more

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.440
thing though that is connected to the your mark about great ability because one of the other things

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:48.000
that I'm working on is on degrees of consciousness yeah and you know so if you spend enough time in

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.720
the conscious world you occasionally hear things like a human is more conscious than a fish or

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.840
people become more conscious while on psychedelic drugs and a lot of philosophers have been skeptical

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:02.560
of the coherence of these sorts of claims and have thought that well maybe people who are making

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:08.800
these claims are just kind of conceptually confused but my view is that we don't know whether these

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:13.360
claims are true or not but there's nothing semantically defective about these sorts of claims

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.560
these claims are still makes sense and so one of my recent publications titled degrees of

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:25.840
consciousness is arguing that is giving an account of what it means to say that consciousness comes

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:31.520
in degrees and arguing that most theories of consciousness actually entail that consciousness

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:36.880
comes in degrees and that's something that that's a publication that came out last year but I'm also

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:42.400
doing some follow-up work right now with Poppy Mankiewicz a philosopher of language at Bristol

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.840
on the semantics of gradable conscious expressions so for example sentences like a human is more

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:53.680
conscious than a fish and our goal is to examine more closely the semantics of these sorts of claims

01:06:53.680 --> 01:07:00.320
using resources from philosophy of language and linguistics so that's that's another project that

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:04.800
I'm working on that's directly connected to the great ability stuff if I if I may jump in

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:11.680
there very quick so I saw some of you presented some of that on Naoto Kias YouTube channel and I

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:17.600
thought you did something interesting there which is that you said that consciousness may be graded

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:24.480
and at the same time the the issue that the the problem that that people often have with that

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:31.920
idea is that whether you're conscious or not seems so much of qualitative rather than just a

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:39.520
quantitative change and it's very hard to imagine that how can you go from zero consciousness to

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:47.280
some kind of consciousness that the moment that you even give it an infinitesimally small kind

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:53.120
of consciousness now you have something else it's conscious and in nature that doesn't seem to happen

01:07:53.120 --> 01:08:00.400
right so in nature you talked about volume and other physical quantities in the end they are actually

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:06.640
not continuous all the way down in the end we know that there's a plank limit to everything

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.400
and there's a discrete jump from something to a certain amount of time a certain amount of space

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:14.080
and so on right and so it sounded to me like you're granting that for consciousness as well

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.600
that you're saying there might be almost like a plank limit and then once you go above it then

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:22.240
it's gradable but that doesn't mean it has to be gradable all the way down there could be some

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:28.000
not discontinuity between no conscious and some consciousness yeah so that's that's a nice way

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.840
of putting it in that's basically the view that i'm most sympathetic to so one question is whether

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:43.040
it can be indeterminate or vague whether an entity is conscious or not where it has just an

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:48.400
intermediate degree of consciousness meaning it's not yet conscious it's like on the borderline between

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:52.640
not conscious and conscious and speaking for myself i'm not sure how to make sense of that it

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:58.480
seems to me like that's conceptually incoherent but then another question is whether consciousness

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.280
comes in degrees meaning some entities are more conscious than others and it could be the kind

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.720
of picture that you just articulated where you get this instant jump from non-conscious to conscious

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:14.480
but once you're in the conscious domain then some creatures can be more conscious than others

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:21.520
yeah that's that's really in a way you solved i think a sticking point for a lot of people there

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.920
it is compatible it seems to me with integrated information theory and maybe some other theories

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.040
as well so it's really interesting well it's certainly compatible with iot i think it kind of

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:38.800
i mean i'm i'm the most people are either very pro or anti iot i'm somebody who's very neutral i

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:45.200
guess but i think this is one sometimes iot has been criticized on the grounds that they appeal to

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:51.120
degrees of consciousness they say that five values are a measure of how conscious an entity is

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:56.800
and some people have thought that well it's not clear that this even makes sense but my attitude

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:01.360
is that it does make sense it's fine for them to postulate that it could be that they're the

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:06.080
theories false but the mere fact that they're saying that some entities are more conscious than

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:10.800
others that's fine because if you really do think that what consciousness is is just having a

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:15.920
maximal degree of integrated information then it's natural to think that you know if you have more

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.680
integrated information going on in your system then i do then you're more conscious than me

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.520
cool so and what else are you working on you said dimensionality we got the

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.480
continuity how do you call it grading of consciousness uh degrees of consciousness

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:40.480
conscious maybe just one more thing i am working on something on consciousness and continuity

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.720
and whether we should think of our conscious experiences as having continuous or discrete

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.680
structures and in particular whether we have any introspective reason for thinking that

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:55.440
they're continuous so some some people have thought that you know if you think about your

01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:02.000
experience of like the blue sky on a cloudless day there's no gaps in that experience so that

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.760
experience must be continuous because there's no there's in some sense no appearance reality

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.880
distinction in the case of consciousness and what it is for something to be continuous is

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:19.200
just for it to have no gaps but i think that that's a bit too hasty i think that introspection

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.400
just doesn't reveal to us whether our experiences are fundamentally continuous or discrete that

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:30.880
it's more of an empirical question and basically what that paper is doing is clarifying what it

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:38.400
means to say that an experience is continuous or discrete and providing what a discrete model of

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:44.640
those sorts of experiences like your experience of the blue sky and upon a cloudless day might look

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.520
like and arguing that we just don't really know at the moment which which view is correct

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.720
do you the the more natural way to go there would be time right the perception of time and

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:03.840
there's a lot of work on that yeah well what does it look like i think it does translate i'm

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.520
thinking about continuity in a general sense so it could be applied to temporal experience or

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.800
spatial experience or or any domain and when we're thinking about temporal experience it's a little

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:20.960
bit tricky we have to distinguish the timing of experience from the experience of time that's

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:26.880
how people would have put it sometimes so there's the objective time that an experience is

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:35.040
occurring during and then there's also what it feels like temporally to have the experience

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.200
and it could be that those two things come apart for example you could in principle have a view where

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.560
maybe experiences occur at an instant but each experience that occurs at an instant feels like

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:51.920
it's occurring over some extended period of time so i'm just concerned with the phenomenology

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:57.040
i'm concerned with in this case whether we have any reason to think that temporal phenomenology

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:03.600
is continuous as opposed to just to discrete whereas most work that has fallen under the label

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:10.480
of consciousness and continuity has been concerned with the timing of experience so the objective

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:17.280
time during which experiences occur and i think you could these two issues are related but they're

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:24.960
also conceptually distinct the i guess the other difference is that my concern here is mainly with

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.040
do we have any introspective reason for thinking that our experiences are continuous because some

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.880
people have thought that we could just know from introspection that our experiences have these

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:38.640
structures but i think that when we really think about what continuity means and what it would entail

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.320
for our experiences to be continuous i mean that would be kind of incredible if we could

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:46.560
like just introspect that our experiences have that kind of structure instead i think it's more

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:52.320
appropriate to think that we we just don't know from introspection whether our experiences are

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:59.040
continuous or discrete it this is again seems to be like a really important question because

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:05.120
if we're thinking about formalizing the structure of consciousness that is really important whether

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:10.240
you know this could all be done with discrete math or whether we have to deal with infinities

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:15.280
right that makes everything ugly and it's also maybe related to the people that come from cs

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:21.600
where everything is discrete by definition and we kind of learned that there's so much you can do

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:27.280
with just sticking to the discrete that maybe there is no need for for continuous

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.920
yeah well sometimes infinities make things ugly sometimes they make things easier

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:38.960
but i mean for example it's when we're thinking in geometrical or topological context it's much

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:44.080
more natural to be working with continuous structures than with discrete structures but

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.720
i think this also connects to interesting questions about quality spaces too so we might wonder

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.920
whether we should think of them as graphs or as as manifolds and i think that's a big question too

01:14:53.920 --> 01:15:00.560
that's just kind of open yeah that's right but i think what i'm getting at is that like if your

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.560
math has this whole debate about you know there's the final test and so on but in a way it's funny

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:10.560
because when it comes to doing the actual calculations we typically just apply discrete math right so

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:16.400
we we just round pi to a certain decimal point and so on we'll do just fine we can do a lot of

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:23.200
geometry in a computer even though we can't deal with the infinite and so if if so in a way

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.760
if we think about that we want to do something similar with consciousness and structure of

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:32.880
consciousness it might help simplify that we could just break it down and deal with things

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:37.440
discreetly yeah no i think that's absolutely right and we should distinguish the question of

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:43.280
which kinds of models are most useful and what is the actual structure of the of the thing

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:47.680
we're investigating i mean the original idea of psychophysics is that perception is discrete

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.800
right so the the color space actually that that fechner envisioned was that it's very regional

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.920
actually right so that you have these just noticeable differences and then the point of

01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:01.440
subjective equality so so actually in in the mind of a psychophysicist it's all like a step

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:05.120
function where you go from i can't tell a difference to now i can't tell a difference

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:10.560
and so yeah so it really does help i mean in that case when fechner came along it helped

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:16.000
because it gave rise to the idea that perception can't have numerosity and so for that you needed

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:22.240
that discreteness that i can't count in units of perception by saying it's thresholds you're just

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:27.440
noticeable differences go from one to two and so on and so yeah so it seems a really interesting

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:32.960
important question at the same time intuitively as you said that's really hard to have read your

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:36.320
to wrap your head around because it seems that yeah of course everything seems continuous

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:44.560
yeah so i i guess i think that once we think carefully about it it doesn't i mean i do think

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:50.320
we don't notice gaps in our experiences that's definitely right right but then whether we

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:54.720
should infer from that that our experiences seem continuous to us in the mathematical sense of

01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:01.840
continuity that that that's the point that i want to resist and i think that for all we know

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.320
even though it is the case that our experiences aren't gappy they could still be discreet now

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.040
so the the empirical examples of gappy experiences like the blind spot and all of this

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.200
there you have filling in a certain way that would be interpolation and you could still argue it's

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:21.120
continuous space right so you have a gap it just gets intimidated yeah but you're going you're

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.760
going further and you're saying no it could actually it could be fundamentally pixelized

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:32.800
basically and you wouldn't know yeah that's interesting i mean one like way to put the

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:38.320
general thought is that to notice a gap you have to notice the things that would fill in the gap

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:44.080
right but then of course we can't experience we're not experiencing the things that would

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.480
fill in the gap because the it would mean that our experience is different than it actually is

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.640
it's it's also as a neuroscientist this is such an interesting thing actually because

01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:00.000
neurons in a way are discreet right so they they fire action potentials and so if we think that

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.160
it's action potentials that are causing perception it's very hard to think that that would be a

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:10.080
really continuous thing because it is discretized at that level of information or whatever we want

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.560
to call it right so when it comes to a color perception that's what i'm thinking about explicitly

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:19.680
then i think again we get fooled because we're dealing with light as a starting point and that

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.320
discontinues the waveforms there but our color perception the way that that that i teach about

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.080
it is that we think of the three photoreceptors and how much they get activated and that's

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.960
discreet that isn't how many action potentials they fire so that space the color space that i

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:39.120
teach is a discrete space it can't be continuous because it has basically three three vectors

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:47.040
that have discretized activations yeah so then another angle from which to think about this

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:53.280
question is that if we did think that introspection reveals that our experiences are continuous

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.960
then you might think that that place is substantive constraints on what the physical

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:04.000
correlates of our experiences might be and rules out some of the most prominent possibilities for

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.520
thinking about those physical correlates but then that seems well that i mean that would be a pretty

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:15.280
substantive implication but yeah i guess i think that we shouldn't rule out those you're still

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:22.480
agnostic possibilities yeah that's interesting okay cool real brief maybe you said there's a fourth

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:29.520
one you're working on sure i mean maybe i'll just briefly mention so one thing i'm working on outside

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:36.080
the structure of experiences i have various kinds of work on the ethics of consciousness

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:41.600
i'm interested in understanding generally how consciousness is ethically significant both

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:48.880
with respect to our own welfare and with respect to morality and one of my new papers is called

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:54.320
consciousness makes things matter where i argue basically that consciousness is what makes an

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:59.440
entity the kind of thing that can be doing well or badly and i think relatedly is the basis for

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:05.440
moral status so that's a view that i think many people feel intuitively compelled by but which

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:11.840
hasn't actually received any sustained defense in the philosophical literature so that's

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:17.840
that's one new thing that i'm working on in the ethics of consciousness and just one example of

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:22.880
like i guess a bit of my work outside of the structure of consciousness oh wow you really

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.360
have a a knack for really interesting things i mean this is one where you really got me because

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:34.080
i'm very skeptical of of attributing functions to consciousness and yet as you said that is very

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:40.960
intuitive that is that is very compelling argument yeah it's very it's relevant to right as ai is

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:47.040
marching along as yeah i mean there's i mean there's been so much discussion like in the last

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.560
few months about about that sort of stuff in the context of ai and usually the people are just

01:20:52.560 --> 01:21:00.240
implicitly assuming that consciousness is the basis for welfare and for moral status and i mean i

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:05.920
as i said i endorse those intuitions but i think it's also interesting thinking about

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:10.880
what the most careful philosophical defense of that view is interesting very interesting

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.800
wow yeah so that was a lot that was very cool so i hope we can repeat this at some point this is

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:23.040
very exciting so thank you so much again andrew that was really cool and did you have any parting

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:30.880
thoughts of ideas no i mean i'm looking forward to you know where your channel is going and yeah

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:35.680
i mean thanks a lot for bringing me on i really enjoyed the conversation and you've also inspired

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:42.960
me to you know maybe try to create my own youtube channel as i was saying at the beginning but yeah

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.800
i'm looking forward to what you do in the future with the channel and i think there will be as i said

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:56.320
it's an exciting time to be part of this this field yeah perfect and everything your website and

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:05.600
