1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
My name is Adam, and for the last 12 years I was a cook.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,000
When Daria and I moved to Thailand and started this channel, it was just supposed to be about

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
food.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,680
That's it, that's all I know.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,600
But it turns out that when you follow the stories of food, if you just go where the

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,840
road takes you, it might change your entire life.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,280
This is a story that I still can't believe or lucky enough to get to tell.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,920
One I'm honestly terrified I won't be able to do justice.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,400
A story of the forgotten people living in Thailand's northwest jungle, of migrants

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,920
and refugees and so-called stateless children, of perseverance and survival, triumph and

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,880
tragedy and of course, food.

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:04,920
This is our road trip to a town called Sangkla Buri, an ancient village along the Myanmar

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,680
border where we came to find the local food, but left with so much more.

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:35,480
If you've heard of the Three Pagodas Pass, the famous border crossing between Thailand

15
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,120
and Myanmar, that's where we're headed.

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,200
There's a lot of stuff on this trip that is going to take a good deal of research and

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,760
understanding and we're kind of going into a situation that none of us really know what

18
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
to expect.

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,160
But right now we only have one priority, which is lunch.

20
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:05,120
This is Highway 323, soon to be replaced by a new expressway but for now the road to

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,040
Kanchana Buri, Thailand's jungle curry capital.

22
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,120
We left Bangkok around 9am in a van on loan from an embassy, invited guests of some mutual

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,080
friends and with almost three full days ahead of us, to track down the most interesting

24
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:30,640
food we can find in one of the most unexplored corners of Thailand.

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,080
Now the thing about this country is it's a true melting pot.

26
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,400
There are said to be around 46 different ethnic groups making up the modern kingdom and that

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,200
doesn't even include the foreigners like me.

28
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,040
Thai cuisine represents nothing less than history, each dish telling a story, the mixing

29
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,320
and blending of cultures and techniques between Siam and the Chinese, Indian, Lao, Malay,

30
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,080
even Portuguese.

31
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,760
But the farther you get from the urban centers, the more the melting pot hasn't melted.

32
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,720
Trying stuff cooked here is like turning back time, a window into a world that used to be

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,320
a lot less complicated.

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:23,720
Alright, so the guests and guides and hosts for our trip to Northwest Thailand are starting

35
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,920
to learn quickly what it's like to travel with OTR, the good and the bad.

36
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,280
The good is we eat really, really well.

37
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,720
The bad is we have to sit here and stare at it for a really long time until we're actually

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,200
ready to start eating because we've got to get all of our coverage and then you guys

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,240
are going to really hate me in a moment because you're going to have to sit here while I try

40
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,880
everything one by one and say, wow, this is delicious.

41
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:53,640
Vasana, JP and what are a driver who is really upset at me already because he's just slowly

42
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,680
starting to go, you've got to wait, you've got to wait.

43
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:11,200
Alright, let me introduce you to the people sitting across from me since they're the

44
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,720
reason we're here two hours into a seven hour road trip far away from anywhere we've

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,440
ever been.

46
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,440
This is Jean-Pierre or JP and he's been in Thailand since before I was born.

47
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,360
He's the only one out of six of us who's been anywhere near our destination before.

48
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,960
In fact, he's come to the remote borderlands several times in his former capacity as Thai

49
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,720
director of the Asia Development Bank.

50
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,880
And Vasana originally from Bangkok, once Thailand's trade representative to the United States,

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,640
for the last two decades focused on public service ever since finding herself in the hospital

52
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,480
for two months, injured on 9-11 when the towers fell.

53
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,120
This is no normal group, and honestly, it's not a normal road trip.

54
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,080
See where we're going is a place called Sangkla Buri, almost 400 kilometers northwest of Bangkok

55
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,760
and right next to the Burmese border, right in the middle of the most sparsely populated

56
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,560
part of the entire country.

57
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,920
For a guy into food history, it's the Holy Grail, a place where some of the first ethnic

58
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,520
groups to settle Southeast Asia still live, practicing cultures and cooking dishes long

59
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,420
lost to the outside world.

60
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,200
But it's also a place with such hardship that JP and Vasana are heading there because

61
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,000
they're bringing a donation from Bangkok's Rotary Club, school supplies, toys, and money

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,840
on its way to a school for stateless children.

63
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,900
And into the undocumented tribes in the mountains are here fleeing violence across the border.

64
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,160
Sangkla Buri is famous for its preserved and ancient way of life, but also for human

65
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,160
trafficking, ethnic violence, and most of all, its wild mystery.

66
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,360
There's only one road in and out.

67
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,320
Many of the local people are unregistered and Thai's not the primary language or even

68
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Burmese.

69
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,600
It's the domain of the Keren.

70
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,760
Native to the nearby mountains or brought here as slaves by the Japanese to build the

71
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,680
so-called Death Railway.

72
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,320
And most of all, it's the home of the Mon, the ancient people who introduced the region

73
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,920
to rice farming, Buddhism, and so much of modern cuisine.

74
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Long absorbed into Thailand, outlawed in Myanmar, the majority in Sangkla Buri.

75
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:49,120
Somewhere in the middle of the Khao Lam National Park, the signal started fading on our phones.

76
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,360
By the time we reached 100 kilometers north of where we had our lunch, the jungle got

77
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
denser.

78
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,320
And for a hundred more, we kept on going, driving through forests and mountains, through

79
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,200
police checkpoints, and finally crossing the River Kwee, looking out over a region that

80
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,480
all of a sudden was very real.

81
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,720
The town was dark when we arrived, nine hours after leaving our home in Bangkok.

82
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,480
The next day we'd separate.

83
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,200
Jasper, Daria, and I on our food trip and JP and Visana off to do their good work on

84
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,680
behalf of Rotary Club.

85
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,800
So at a hotel restaurant near the water, we had our dinner and raised a glass to the journey

86
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,960
before tomorrow, starting the real one.

87
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,920
There's an old story that about a thousand years ago, a monk named Tong Su made a pilgrimage

88
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,640
to what's now Myanmar to study under mon Buddhist teachers.

89
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,760
He'd eventually settle here, building a temple in the remote mountains near the River Kwee.

90
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,040
Now Tong Su was known as a healer, and his reputation drew followers, forming a settlement

91
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,600
of mon, Karen, and the ethnic dye.

92
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,040
Today it's a place known as Sangkla Buri.

93
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,600
This part of town, this side of the water, is the home of the ethnic mon.

94
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,120
And before we get into anything else, let me talk about the food.

95
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,040
As I mentioned earlier, the mon were the first to bring rice farming to Southeast Asia, coming

96
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,320
from what's now China in the Yangtze River basin about 5,000 years ago, following the

97
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,280
rivers to the south, first settling the Irrawadi, then the Chao Praia, then everywhere.

98
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,840
Now there's not much known about ancient mon cuisine, that's why we're here, but

99
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,240
there are a few dishes among today's mainstream Thai food that we know trace back to the mon.

100
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,240
There's Khao Kluk Gapi, shrimp-paste fried rice, served with an assortment of meats and

101
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,200
vegetables and based on a traditional mon dish.

102
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,840
There's Khao Cheh, rice soaked in chilled jasmine water and associated with Songkran,

103
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,600
or the Thai New Year.

104
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,080
And most of all, Khanom Jeen, Thailand's favorite noodles, served from the far south along

105
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,680
the Malay border all the way to the old Lan Na Kingdom in the north.

106
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,800
Khanom Jeen was the signature of the mon people.

107
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,080
In fact, the name, while today meaning Chinese snack, actually derives from a mon word,

108
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,760
Hanom Tien.

109
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,000
And it's not unique to Thailand.

110
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,760
The noodles themselves are a part of the cuisine all across the region and wherever

111
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,000
they show up, it's an indication that sometime, hundreds or thousands of years ago, there

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,480
was mon influence and culture, an ancient trade route or a mon settlement or civilization

113
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,640
long since destroyed or assimilated.

114
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,120
In Vietnam, the noodles are called Boon, Num Ban Chok in Cambodia, Idiyapam in South

115
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,320
India in Sri Lanka and in Myanmar, Mohinga.

116
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:21,840
So we actually, we have not arrived at the market yet, that's down the hill and it ends

117
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,600
soon so we need to rush.

118
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,680
But the very first thing we saw was a Burmese lady selling Mohinga by the side of the road

119
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,800
and with fresh Khanom Jeen noodles.

120
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,760
So that is extremely exciting and we are detouring on the way to the market and hopefully

121
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,360
we still have time to make it there.

122
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,240
But right now, I don't really care.

123
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,640
Mohinga is the national dish of Myanmar, a soup made from fish stock served with fried

124
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,520
garlic, chickpea fritters and here, condiments including what I think is tamarind but I don't

125
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,640
know because I don't speak mon and communication might become an issue.

126
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
That's alright, we can talk through food.

127
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,840
I might just sit right here because the other customer just left and we're going to chase

128
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,000
this with some water.

129
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,600
This is the first time I understand why all of our Burmese friends say we have to start

130
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,080
every day with a bowl of Mohinga, not to insult the restaurant version of this dish but it's

131
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,800
clearly not made to be a restaurant dish.

132
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,320
This is so comforting, subtle, I would say a lot less fishy than I expected.

133
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Look at him, look at him, look at the namgom.

134
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:56,800
Plus, what dish is not made better with crispy fried garlic, this is just, it's very, very

135
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
good.

136
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,360
With breakfast done, our destination was the morning market.

137
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,680
Open every day from 5 a.m. until about an hour after sunrise.

138
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,520
The early morning in Sanclaburi has a feeling all its own.

139
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,240
The quiet stillness of the remote mountains punctuated with the sounds of two-stroke engines

140
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,240
and people on their way from place to place, with an energy of somewhere both welcoming

141
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,760
and incomprehensible.

142
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,520
Everyone going out of their way to smile or watch us walk by, a warm start to the day,

143
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,240
and also a reminder in case we ever forget that we are very much outsiders.

144
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,160
In the thousand years or so since the first settlers followed Tongsu and built a home

145
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,640
here in the valley, while the entire world has grown up, the Mon language and culture

146
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,400
has more or less remained the same, although for the people themselves it's been a long

147
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,800
and often tragic journey and one that needs to be understood to gain any kind of context

148
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
about where we are.

149
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,840
At the time Sanclaburi was established, the Mon were the rulers of what's now Thailand,

150
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,760
having built a kingdom called the Dvaravati, based in what today is the neighboring province

151
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,840
of Supanburi.

152
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,560
For this part of the world this was the first real empire and it was Mon, establishing trade

153
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,720
with China and India in bringing religion from Theravada missionaries.

154
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,880
The Dvaravati would fall to another Mon kingdom, the Lavo, which would gain even more influence

155
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,120
and territory and the Mon seemed destined to rule Southeast Asia forever.

156
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,520
But that's not what would happen.

157
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,600
In the 11th century the Lavo would be defeated in a series of battles by the Khmer and would

158
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,280
become a sort of vassal empire.

159
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,920
The Khmer would absorb Mon language and traditions and people too, enslaving a huge number of

160
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,440
the Lavo.

161
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,280
Then 400 years later the Khmer would fall to Ayutthaya in the ethnic die and the last

162
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,400
vestiges of the Mon would disappear.

163
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,240
To the west this story would be completely different.

164
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,400
Far removed from Angkor or Ayutthaya, in what's now Myanmar the Mon had been locked in an

165
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,160
ancient and endless war with their rivals, the Bha-Mar, the rulers of the powerful Pagan

166
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,560
Kingdom.

167
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,880
In the 1200s just as Thailand's Mon were being crushed by the Khmer, Myanmar's Mon

168
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,320
gained the upper hand, establishing their own kingdom.

169
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,320
As it relates to our story where things really developed here in Sanclaburi as a Mon town

170
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,760
was win in the 16th century, that kingdom would fall again to the Bha-Mar and thousands

171
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,720
fled the massacres that followed and came to the remote jungle lands here, around Tongsu's

172
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,720
temple.

173
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,480
Anyway, long story short, over the border the clashes continued for another two centuries

174
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:00,080
between the Mon and the Bha-Mar, with the Mon finally routed in 1757, the Burmese army

175
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,200
chasing them as far as Ayutthaya and then raising that city to the ground.

176
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Now it's worth mentioning that since the ethnic Mon had long been absorbed and welcomed

177
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,760
into Siamese society, many of the nobles in Ayutthaya's court were of Mon descent.

178
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,760
And as both Toxin, who revived the Siamese empire in Tonburi, and Rama I who'd built

179
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,280
the palace in Bangkok both had Mon roots, there was plenty of room for the new refugees

180
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,800
to integrate into the new Thai kingdom.

181
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,240
Again though it was different across the border.

182
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,320
The Mon and Bha-Mar had now been at war for almost a thousand years, with the violence

183
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,640
persisting until the British arrived and enforced an uneasy peace.

184
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:49,280
They carved out a Mon state, bordering Thailand and ending just across the hills from Sanclaburi.

185
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:57,080
Then the British colony fell, the war began again, and it is very much still ongoing today.

186
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,920
And we'll pick up that story later but first, we've arrived at Sanclaburi's Mon village

187
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:14,120
morning market.

188
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:20,640
This is such a cool atmosphere, it's really hard to explain how unlike, this reminds me

189
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,640
of Yunnan province, it's the only place I've ever been where you know you can go deep into

190
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,800
the countryside, at least the last time I was there and you end up finding these village

191
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,360
markets where everything is different, the languages are different, the people are just

192
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:46,520
differently.

193
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,000
One thing by the way, if you're listening around me, I don't recognize the languages

194
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,080
that are being spoken.

195
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,920
So, from what we understand, Thai, Burmese are both minority languages here, the majority

196
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,760
language is Mon, Korean is a secondary language, so good morning.

197
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,000
So there's a lot of languages being spoken that I have never heard before.

198
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,640
Yeah, let's go into the market, we have one hour before this since, the dog is literally

199
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:38,400
playing with him and asking for cabbage as treats, that is so funny.

200
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:55,520
This just smells so good.

201
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,540
And I just hope somebody comes here to let me eat some of this, Honglei is usually made

202
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:07,280
with pork belly, this looks like beef, but I'm not sure what that is or what the difference

203
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,440
is, we've got four different types of bowls of stuff here, there's something cooking back

204
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,960
there so somebody's going to come back to this house and let me eat.

205
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,800
Here comes our man, he just went and picked up something.

206
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm not sure what happened when we followed the smell of food cooking to a platform just

207
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,120
behind the morning market, but the long story short is that this is not a restaurant, it's

208
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,880
the house of a very confused Mon family who probably didn't expect their own day to start

209
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:47,000
with Jasper and I barging in trying to order breakfast, Toto we're not in Kansas anymore.

210
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,880
There's a section of Sangkla Burri intended for visitors, a place with at least something

211
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,160
of a tourist infrastructure and we figured this would be a good time for us to maybe

212
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,440
go down there, to shake off our embarrassment and see the other side of town and maybe find

213
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:13,520
a place to actually sell us something to eat.

214
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,120
The walk from the morning market to the quote tourist center of Sangkla Burri is only about

215
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,880
400 meters, maybe five minutes up one hill and down another, but here, for at least a

216
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,520
few square blocks, the vibe is completely different.

217
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,840
A pretty straightforward cluster of optimistic trinket shops, signs in Thai and even English

218
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,560
and restaurants serving dishes more well known by the general public.

219
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:48,640
We stopped here for a famous place that sells Joe in Chinese kanji or Joke in Thai, this

220
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,360
one with what looks like ground pork, crispy garlic, a bunch of ginger, a soft and semi

221
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:03,920
runny egg, and of course, patonggo, which is what in Chinese you would call yotiao, Chinese

222
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:12,800
donuts if you will, so you should have this with your Joe, but actually that's very good.

223
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,000
I never ordered Joe, I don't know why, because I lived in China for so long I kind of never

224
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,120
saw the point, you know, this is what you eat when you don't have enough rice so you

225
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,800
boil it to make it stretch longer, but maybe that's a little unfair, this is delicious.

226
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,200
I have work to do, I've got two coffees.

227
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,920
The bridge that connects this mon settlement with the other side of Sangkla Burri is the

228
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:50,320
symbol of the region, the biggest man-made wooden bridge in Thailand and at 850 meters,

229
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,680
one of the longest on earth, an attraction that brings at least some curious onlookers to the

230
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:02,400
town, usually after visiting the waterfalls in the Khao Lam National Forest. It's a bit ironic,

231
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,880
kind of a metaphor for the region I guess that this bridge only gained attention and the village

232
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:13,200
first saw visitors in 2013, not because of its grandeur, but because it made the national news

233
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,480
after being destroyed in a flood, then rebuilt by hand the next year. It's an engineering marvel,

234
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,000
each piece of wood cut from the nearby forest and all of it done by hand, no heavy equipment

235
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,720
needed. It's called the Utama Nusorn Bridge, named in honor of a mon Buddhist monk named Luang

236
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:40,800
Po Utama, and that brings us back to where we left off, when the British left Myanmar in 1948.

237
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,160
We pick up with the Bahmar now in control of the newly independent country,

238
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,080
for the record in case you're wondering, yes the name Burma comes from a word for

239
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,640
Bahmar, and actually so does Myanmar, both variations of the same term. Anyway, with the

240
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,600
mon state now no longer under any kind of protection, an independence movement took hold

241
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,680
and the Burmese sent in the military to shut it down, and by that I mean they pretty much laid waste

242
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,800
to the whole region. One of the mon villages destroyed within a few months of the end of

243
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,320
colonization was a place called Yebu, once home to a population of a few thousand,

244
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,760
about 40 kilometers northwest of the Thai border at the Three Pagodas Pass. In June 1949, Yebu was

245
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:33,200
burned to the ground and a local monk, Luang Po Utama, gathered around 60 families and led them

246
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,160
through the mountains, avoiding the Burmese patrols and crossing into Thailand where they'd

247
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,320
settle their own corner of Sangkla Buri. Now to that point this region was fraught with its own

248
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,800
ethnic tensions, with occasional flare-ups between the various different groups, but Utama was a bridge

249
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,720
builder pun very much intended, and the land his followers settled was actually in a village that

250
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:04,480
had previously been majority Karen, a place called Nong Lu, a Karen word meaning roofs made of palm leaves.

251
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,240
The mon areas in Sangkla Buri were scattered throughout the valley, and the main town became

252
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,600
something of a diverse community, with the new cultural center a temple Utama would build in

253
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,240
1953. Now that's all on the other side of the water, where our hotel is and where today there's

254
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,840
something of a small but reasonably developed city. The bridge itself would come decades later,

255
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,480
with construction led by Utama himself starting in 1986, connecting Nong Lu to a village on a

256
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:41,680
peninsula that until almost that time was neither a village nor a peninsula. Everything we've told

257
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,200
you so far about the history of Sangkla Buri, from Tongsu's pilgrimage to the death railway and even

258
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,360
Utama's new settlement, was based around the river Kwe. It gave life to the region and all

259
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,400
through the centuries as new migrants arrived, they'd settle pieces of land along the river.

260
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,520
But in 1979 construction would begin on a hydroelectric power plant, which would dam the river,

261
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,440
about 80 kilometers to the south. In 1984 the work would be completed and the ancient valley

262
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,120
would begin to fill with water, and within months, a thousand years of history and the homes of countless

263
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:24,080
people would be below the surface. Now many of the families that lived in the valley were refugees,

264
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,080
undocumented migrants and ethnic minorities, and as they'd lived off the grid, they had no citizenship

265
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,320
and thus received no compensation. But thanks to Utama, along with a grant of land from the Thai

266
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,800
government, Sangkla Buri came together to help build a new village, a home for displaced families

267
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:48,400
who'd once come because they'd already been displaced by any of a dozen wars and conflicts,

268
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,680
both recent and very, very long ago. And that is the story of where we've spent this morning,

269
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,120
and the people we've encountered in this unique place, keeping alive a culture long lost with

270
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:18,800
their own history just below the water. Wow. I've never, I've never seen anything like that before.

271
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,400
That's insane.

272
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,400
It's almost surreal in real life. You know what I mean? You can see pictures of it,

273
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,080
but when you're actually right next to something where, you know, it's incredible.

274
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:15,120
It's

275
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:27,120
welcome.

276
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:59,680
We had about an hour left before we'd need to meet up again with JP and Visana to travel

277
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,120
further into the countryside. So we asked our boatman where he'd go for lunch if he wasn't on the

278
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:12,320
water and he sent us here to a local mon restaurant just past the mohinga stall where we'd started

279
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:19,360
our day. First of all, tell me what we're eating. What is this? This looks amazing.

280
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:53,520
The specialty here is a dish called hang le, actually quite well known in Thailand and

281
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,400
something I listed among my top 10 favorite Thai foods in a video we did last year.

282
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,560
It's known in Bangkok as a dish influenced by the Burmese, something that probably came from

283
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,840
Myanmar. But this is the first time I've ever known the real roots of hang le,

284
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,840
a unique specialty not of Myanmar itself but of the Mon people.

285
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:49,840
Oh my gosh. That smells amazing.

286
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:09,440
Crispy pork, excuse me, crispy pork skin. Everything is better with pork rub.

287
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,720
Crispy pork skin, everything is better with crispy pork skin. I did not expect that in a stewed vegetable dish.

288
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,640
This is just the best version I've ever had of this.

289
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:49,520
Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you.

290
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,920
Now, can he tell us what he just said so that we can actually translate that on screen later?

291
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,360
Okay, we just had one of the best meals we have ever had in Thailand,

292
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,800
the best hang le curry I've ever had. We have 25 minutes before we need to be back on the other

293
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,680
side of the lake. After we cross the bridge, that's where our drive is meeting us because we have

294
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,720
plans all afternoon. But I just saw somebody down the road here that's serving on no khao soi.

295
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,720
And so we're going to try and fit that in. This is going to be the fastest food segment we've

296
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,800
ever filmed, but we can't come all the way to the Myanmar border and not have a bowl

297
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:35,600
of homemade on no khao soi.

298
00:30:49,440 --> 00:31:01,600
We got to run.

299
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,840
In 1949, after Utama's successful journey with the 60 mon families to Sankla Buri,

300
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,760
it wasn't long before more refugees would follow. At first, it was family members and

301
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,400
neighbors of that first group of modern arrivals, but in 1962, the trickle became a constant flow.

302
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,880
That was when Neh Nguyen seized power in Myanmar in a military coup, and in one of his first

303
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,720
moves, his government outlawed the mon language, mon culture, basically erasing the mon people.

304
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,320
When the refugees would come, many would arrive illegally, but through work they'd at least

305
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,920
earn Thai registration and according to the law, their children born here would become Thai citizens.

306
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:00,080
But that law would be repealed in 1972, in large part because of just how many people

307
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,000
were pouring across the long border from Myanmar. This change didn't just affect the new arrivals,

308
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,440
by the way, but also many of the hill tribes in the border regions who spoke their own languages

309
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,960
and lived separated enough from society that they couldn't actually prove that they'd always been

310
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,600
here. In 2008, the Thai government reversed the law again, but since then, very few applications

311
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,280
for birthright citizenship have actually been accepted. There's a simple truth which is that

312
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:38,480
the Thai-Burmese border is long. In fact, 2,416 kilometers, about the same as from Paris to Moscow.

313
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,440
It's impossible to police and with so much turmoil on the Myanmar side,

314
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:51,120
there are a lot of undocumented immigrants. When a child is born to refugee parents on this side

315
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,440
of the line, the newborn is neither Burmese nor Thai. They're stateless, which means they don't

316
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,800
have a passport, but also that they don't receive government medical insurance. They can't buy a

317
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:09,760
smartphone, can't open a bank account, or get a legal driver's license. As of 2023, according to

318
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,720
Thailand's Health Security Office, there are 520,000 stateless persons residing in the country,

319
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,800
and many of them are here, living a life of survival in places like Sanclaburi.

320
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,720
Let's see what we have at the convenience store.

321
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,640
Can I have just a Coke?

322
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,240
This doesn't even need to be part of the video, I just wanted to,

323
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
I don't like to come here and not support and buy something.

324
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:09,680
It's about 2 in the afternoon and we've been taken by JP and Visana to ride along with the

325
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:15,600
medical worker from Children of the Forest, the organization supported by the Bangkok Rotary Club,

326
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,560
on her rounds as she checks in on some of the makeshift communities built on the outskirts of

327
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:28,960
Sanclaburi. This place, the home of about 125 people, is mixed between Maan, Khorin, and Burmese,

328
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,640
all living on a remote property owned by a monastery, which allows migrants to stay and

329
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:43,280
build their own places to live for a rent of about $5 per year. Delito, the medic, is herself a refugee,

330
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,760
first coming into Thailand from a city in Maan State about three hours away. That was almost

331
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:58,320
24 years ago. Obviously, a lot of people who come here, it's not easy. I'm sure when you came,

332
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,800
you didn't speak Thai, or did you, when you first arrived? I can't speak Thai, okay? I'm really

333
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:13,840
scared. I don't have any paper, but it's lucky one of the Thai men is take me with his motorbike,

334
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:21,760
we passing to the checkpoint, but before it's my job is I'm working also the boyapun on the

335
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:29,600
on the what is the hospital, like a clinic near the border. So when we take the patient

336
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:36,560
to the Thailand, we have a border pass, like a letter you can take. So the also the people

337
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:43,440
is around there, they know as I just come and go, so they're not checked. So I live here. Since

338
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,160
of I came in here at the Sangla Buri about six months later, I have a paper, not Thai

339
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:57,520
idea. I have a paper after that. Now I have a serial card. There are hundreds of settlements

340
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,320
like this throughout the border region and Delito tries to visit each one once a month.

341
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,880
More often, if there's an urgent need for medical service, like here where there's a newborn

342
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:19,360
from a one single mother, this scare and then she's a single mother. And then her job is making

343
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,520
broom. But now is the this house is not their house. The owner didn't come because of no broom

344
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:35,520
flower here at the moment. So she no job. But since of she have a baby about 10 days. So her

345
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,680
mother is people around here contact me, she have a problem, no food, no husband. And then please

346
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:49,760
come and help. So we come and helping her now is her baby dead. Since this land is owned by the

347
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,160
Buddhist temple, nobody gets turned away, which means not only is this place known as Frogstream

348
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,520
Village, a mixture of languages and cultures, but also of the needs of the people here.

349
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,200
For some, it's a temporary stop, a place to stay until the next job comes along in the orchards

350
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,680
or rubber plantations. But for many, it's the only option. Among the people staying here are also

351
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,760
those who are disabled or look after disabled family. There are single parents, the elderly,

352
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,880
people without any other options. In fact, some of the residents living in makeshift

353
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,760
housing close enough to Myanmar to hear the gunfire have been here for as long as 25 years.

354
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:40,560
Her daughter is have a polio polio. Yes. Since I was born, he said about one month and then

355
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:51,520
get sick and then like that. But his wife is a die. When she's a three years old, but now she's a 22.

356
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:07,920
This house and then we helping. Helping is when the kids sick. One of the boys is get sick and big,

357
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:16,080
upset and then take to the, take down to the Ratchaburi hospital. And then this house

358
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:23,360
is we have we also also the pregnant woman around here. So she have my telephone number

359
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:29,920
who have a problem and then they worry they can't speak Thai or they don't have ID card and then

360
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,760
come and contact her. She have my telephone number. She contact me just before she said one of the

361
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,760
patient who have a problem with the leg is a car. No money to go.

362
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:53,040
It's not all despair at Frogstream Village. Many of the children are now students at Delito's school,

363
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,000
Children of the Forest, where not only do they learn Thai, but also gain something priceless.

364
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:05,040
A name, a registration, not citizenship, but legal documentation and access to the Thai school

365
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,920
system. Hope. For the people living here, there is work. They've formed something of a village

366
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,440
business, collecting a special kind of plant, which grows in the nearby mountains. This is

367
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,440
the making room. And this is the business here. This is the people in here that that is the main

368
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:31,520
the main business is making room. Okay. And they sell this room. There is a room factory here.

369
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,480
And then they're making room here. And then this room they take to the whole Thailand Bangkok or

370
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,400
everywhere. Really? Yes. Yes. That is all is from here.

371
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,400
This is hard work. You see how intense that I mean this is thick. This is packed in really thickly.

372
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,320
I would stab myself right through the hand if I even tried.

373
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:15,360
I have a feeling in the mon language, he's hilarious. I just don't understand anything about that.

374
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:22,640
Oh, he said, uh, if, if you come and buy with the dollar, it might be, he said it's a very good,

375
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:30,320
good for them. If you have like, it's been more than 10 years since I've been back to America.

376
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,920
I don't have any dollars. I would love to.

377
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,120
So we found we've somehow this still is a food video because even here, even

378
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:51,840
along the Thai Burmese border, in a refugee village, for people who don't have Thai ID,

379
00:40:51,840 --> 00:41:00,480
who don't speak Thai for the most part, Mon Karen and Burmese living here on the land

380
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,600
owned by a Buddhist monastery, we have still found somewhere serving food. And we have our

381
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:13,600
favorite sticky rice flour and what looks like black sesame doughnut and some squash,

382
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,840
which she's giving us with a dipping sauce. As we were about to leave Frogstream Village,

383
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,840
I noticed something that caught my eye, a restaurant or more accurately, a snack counter,

384
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,600
serving things like fried chicken, sticky rice, pastries and the kind of fritters you'd see in

385
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:38,640
any proper Burmese market here open for business servicing a refugee camp of 125 people.

386
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:47,440
Okay, no Ken, no problem. Yeah, yeah. Please, please, please.

387
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,280
I'm sure. Is that what she said? Not done every day? Is not every day people come to film

388
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:16,480
food video here? They're going to be famous for their food, you can tell it is, is they're

389
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,200
going to be famous for their food when they're on on our OTR.

390
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:33,840
It was like the best, best franchise we've ever had. That's a good comparison. It was really good.

391
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:38,960
Thank you very much.

392
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:59,040
As we left the village to head somewhere else, Delito received a phone call. It was her mother

393
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,560
in Myanmar, letting her know that she was safe as their home village had been bombed by the Burmese

394
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:11,520
military earlier that same morning. It's a fact of life for her living here in safety while every

395
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,840
day she worries about her family three hours away. Can you go home right now? There's the border.

396
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,400
Can you go back to visit your family and come back in Myanmar to Thailand or not right now?

397
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:30,160
Right now, now is the way it is. In Thailand you can go, but in Myanmar they're closing the road,

398
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:39,520
so have a wall in there. They're closing so you can't go. Even now my mom's hometown is fighting.

399
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,320
And here it's safe and then if you if you have like a one-day working, you can buy food right

400
00:43:50,320 --> 00:44:01,120
in Myanmar. It's no job fighting, no food, no job, so people is just, just even with all the trouble

401
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:08,160
of coming here with no ID, it's still better than maybe some people's safety in Burma.

402
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,360
Safe, safe, safer than Burma because again here is no fighting, right? Even if you don't have money,

403
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:21,680
but only you have to scale when they come and take, you scale again. So if you like,

404
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,000
living in the jungle, you're walking in the rubber garden, that is your safe life.

405
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,680
That is what the people here around here.

406
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,920
So this is, if this looks improp too, it is improp too, and I was just telling your father

407
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,760
actually is behind us that my favorite thing about filming is when I don't know what's going on

408
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,360
and somebody just says, hey, at this time you need to be here. I'm like, great, that's awesome.

409
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,640
It's less work for me. Okay. I've been told now that we needed to be at Children of the Forest at

410
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,240
3.30, which I don't even have time to process where we are. We'll do that tomorrow morning. Okay.

411
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,640
But we just got here, we changed vehicles, we're in another pickup truck and going right back to the

412
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,200
back. Where are we going? Okay, so we're moving from, you've just been to some of the villages on

413
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,440
the road. Now we're going off road into the jungle, see some rubber plantations quite deep in the

414
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,320
jungle, about 15 kilometers into the jungle. And we're going to visit some of our students that

415
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,120
come to the school, give you an idea of just how far our students are prepared to travel,

416
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:24,320
just to get an education. And you'll meet some mothers and you'll meet some patients as well

417
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,760
that were helping. So it should be an interesting trip. Amazing. And then I see there's a cooler

418
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,600
being loaded into the back of the, into the back of the truck as well. That's right. Yeah, we've

419
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:39,280
got a, we thought might as well treat the villages there. We know them quite well and make it exciting

420
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,640
for them. So we're going to, they're doing a little bit of food and that now, enjoying doing that.

421
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,640
And we're going to take some ice, take some coke and some snacks for the kids over there as well.

422
00:45:49,360 --> 00:46:00,480
Anthony Bourdain once said that the greatest meals you could ever have are the ones you don't go

423
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,720
looking for. Instead, life is about putting yourself in a position where they might just

424
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:13,760
happen. Like jumping into the back of a pickup truck heading as deep as the path goes off road

425
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,480
into the jungle.

426
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,320
There was a time, I remember when I was a little kid, when I could be in the back of a truck

427
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:30,160
and just get tossed around and it was no problem. And now every single bump I'm like in 10 years,

428
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,520
that has been a murder in my back.

429
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:48,640
Guys, Jasper, this is going to make a really bad headline if I lose my balance and just crush

430
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,480
and crush the kids. That's going to be really bad for everybody.

431
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,280
I love how the car is driving so much more gently now that all the kids are in the back.

432
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:08,480
When it was just us, it was like, no, I hope nobody knows that word.

433
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,880
I can't swear around the kids. This is why I could never be a teacher.

434
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:24,320
Yeah, I don't know if this is translating to video, but we are, this is just a straight drop

435
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:32,240
off everywhere along the side of the bus. It's just a dead drop the whole way. I'm going to

436
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,920
give this back to Jasper because I clearly have no idea how to operate a camera. But yeah,

437
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,120
we have been driving alongside a straight drop and there keep being times when

438
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:43,360
they'll yell out to us, hang on tight. This is a slippery part.

439
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:56,720
Well, the car has stopped and we are surrounded by people and I almost forgot that we were,

440
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,640
we had a direction. I was just going to keep going and then we're just going to end up as deep

441
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,840
as you can get in the jungle and then we're going to turn around and come back and I can't

442
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:13,920
believe that there's a settlement here, but oh my God. Everyone's even kids are laughing at me.

443
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,320
My back, what back? My back is done.

444
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,240
There are things that you see and experience once in a lifetime,

445
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,840
places that open your eyes to a world so far removed from anything you've ever encountered

446
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:42,560
that you can't help but leave a different person. This is one of those places. It's a makeshift

447
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,720
settlement so far into the jungle that for six months a year during the rainy season,

448
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:53,760
it's completely inaccessible. The only way in or out a four hour hike each way to reach the nearest

449
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:01,040
paved road, a hike that unbelievably many of the 30 children who call this enclave home make every

450
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:06,800
single day just to get to school, to receive an education and get that life-changing piece of

451
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:15,520
paper documenting their own existence. Our host is Daniel Hobson, born in the UK, but in Sanclebury

452
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,360
for two decades. The founder of Children of the Forest, the place the kids here find their hope.

453
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,200
Why would somebody build a house here? This isn't just, I want to be deep in the jungle.

454
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,560
Are the parents working for the rubber? Are they independent? Are they working for rubber

455
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:39,920
companies? Why does this exist? Yeah, you're right. It's the following work, which is typical of all

456
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,200
the stateless families really around this area. Wherever the work is, that's where they'll go.

457
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,720
They don't have their own land, their own home, so they'll follow where the work is. And at the

458
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,000
moment the work is here in this huge rubber plantation, which they'll be tapping tonight

459
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,640
from about 12 o'clock. They'll start tapping and they'll finish maybe seven or eight in the morning,

460
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:05,200
so they'll sleep during the day. And that's every day, or that's seasonal? In the heavy rain,

461
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,840
you can't tap the rubber, but at the moment it's kind of the best time of year. That's when the

462
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:15,120
rubber is flowing, the best is right now. So they'll be tapping it for three nights and then they'll

463
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,480
take a break one night. Do you find the kids that you teach, or that your teachers teach, coming

464
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,280
from a place like this, where they have to... I would guess that somebody who would go to the

465
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:32,160
initiative of walking 12 kilometers, each direction to get to school every day, is going to not be

466
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,720
lax with their work. Is that fair? That's a fair statement. It's great to see the motivation

467
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,960
just to get to school. It takes them probably about two hours to get to school. And then once

468
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,880
they're there, yeah, they're going to take that opportunity to study hard. And we've been working

469
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:52,800
with this village now for almost 20 years. So we've actually seen children that have studied hard,

470
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,960
gone through the elementary school, gone on to high school, and are actually now studying in the

471
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:04,240
city to be teachers, community development workers, hotel management, vocational colleges.

472
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,920
And what are we looking at real quick, just so we understand, these are all houses around us,

473
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,480
or is this like a platform, which I guess is just for communal meals? I don't know,

474
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,040
if you can kind of explain to me just what we see, is every building going down this way,

475
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:27,040
a family's home? Yeah, that's right. Every building here is a home. There's a community spirit here,

476
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,440
even though, strictly speaking, it's not a village, it's not a community. It's just workers that are

477
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:38,560
on the land, the landowner of the rubber plantation happens to own. But there's a community spirit,

478
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,920
and they're all Karen in this area. So these are all, these are all Karen families? Yeah,

479
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,320
that's right. So it would have started with just what, one or two families when they, and then

480
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:52,480
they ask their cousins and distant cousins to come, and then they kind of build up a

481
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,600
village because, like you said, following the work, coming here for the work.

482
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:02,080
The Karen tribe of Thailand's far west are also like the Mon, an ancient people,

483
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:07,760
with their own history in Southeast Asia dating back at least as far as the third century AD.

484
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,720
But unlike the Mon, there is no unifying Karen culture or identity. The Karen are a Highland

485
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,360
people, scattered throughout the mountains of Myanmar and Thailand, and as far as the Andaman

486
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:24,400
Islands off the coast of India. And their settlements were built so far apart that in different places

487
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:29,760
they practice vastly different cultures and traditions. But like the Mon, they're also

488
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,120
marginalized, and also at war with the Burmese government in a fight for ethnic autonomy.

489
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,680
That's the story for the families that live here. Refugees who fled persecution and now get by

490
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,040
working the rubber trees in a harsh and unforgiving landscape, starting again at the very bottom of

491
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:53,040
society, completely cut off from the conveniences of 21st century urban life simply because of who

492
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:59,600
they are and where they were born. Like everything else here in the settlement,

493
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:04,400
food is usually based around what can be farmed or foraged in the nearby mountains,

494
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,880
along with staples like rice purchased with hard-earned income. But today we're in for a treat.

495
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,640
This morning, while we were in the town, Daniel went to his own local market and bought a whole

496
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:23,360
pig, delivering it here a few hours earlier. And since then, a few of the villagers have been

497
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:30,160
hard at work, preparing a true feast, a celebration of life and survival, and to welcome us to their

498
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,960
small corner of the jungle with their very best Karen hospitality.

499
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,360
So earlier today, some of the guys who we came here with went to the local market and bought

500
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,800
some fresh pork, which apparently was just as fresh and amazing as it gets. So then they've been

501
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:55,760
cooking all day to prepare this feast for the village tonight. We have pork curry. This is

502
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,480
this is rice because obviously it's all going to be based around rice. So pork curry, rice,

503
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,200
this is a soup made from the innards of the pork. So we have intestines, we have kidney,

504
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:12,880
we have liver, and then we have the meat from, I see hoof and I see spine along with gourd and

505
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:21,680
vegetables. And that is going to be hearty and flavorful and very healthy. We have eggplants

506
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,760
and we have these nuts, and it's going to be served along with the classic Burmese

507
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,840
and got the fish paste. And that's what we have. And I think everybody here is about to,

508
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,480
they're about to lose it. If I don't say, okay, let's open the floodgates and eat

509
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,760
because this just smells and looks amazing. This is really a feast prepared for everybody here tonight.

510
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:57,120
The pork curry is just dynamite. Yeah.

511
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,000
Who is the cook? Who do I, who do I compliment? Who is the cook?

512
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:19,040
I just really want to compliment the chef because the soup is mind blowing how good that is.

513
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,960
I just, I just, is this the chef? Thank you. Please, please help me to explain that this is,

514
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,160
everything is really special. This is incredibly good that I would be proud to serve this at,

515
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:39,120
I would be proud to serve this at my restaurant. She's embarrassed and walking away.

516
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:49,520
As if we needed one more component for a very, very long and very fascinating day.

517
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,160
We were on the way home to the hotel and there's a night market and we,

518
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,840
the pickup truck stopped and Daniel said, you know what? This is actually

519
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,480
pretty cool night market. You guys should check it out. So our day is not quite done yet. We have

520
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,240
one more stop and it's the last, the last part of one of the most really, really,

521
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:13,360
unbelievably interesting days we've ever had on the channel. And I need caffeine to keep going.

522
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,000
So let's start with a, with an instant coffee.

523
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:24,960
Just a few blocks from our comfortable beds after a day that saw us start at sunrise on the

524
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,400
peninsula, explore the Mont Village, take a boat trip around the reservoir, eat a bunch of awesome

525
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,920
stuff and then spend the afternoon and evening deep in the mountains. Well, there's still one more

526
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:42,640
stop. And by now, who cares? We can't get any more tired. So we might as well just keep going

527
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:49,360
and do what the locals here in this amazing town do when their hard days are over. Hang out and

528
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:56,080
enjoy the night market. I am so tired. Oh, I forgot that I'm wearing a hat. That I'm like...

529
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:03,920
Cowboy, Daria, you, you could not, you could not look like more of a tourist. Camera around your,

530
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,120
camera around your waist and a stupid hat on. It doesn't, at least it doesn't say Ronaldinho.

531
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:31,840
Look at this. The crispy fried garlic makes everything better. I did not intend for you to

532
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:37,200
take that spoon from me. I was showing that to you, not giving that to you. Pretty good, yeah?

533
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,040
Daria, you and I have traveled off camera to most corners of Thailand and there's always a market

534
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:57,760
like that. You're a mess with your camera and your, your hat.

535
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,240
I've turned into an ATM. My pocket is literally like an ATM now. We're,

536
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:16,400
just, we walk past the, walk past the food stand and all of a sudden there's just

537
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:23,360
money coming out of my, coming out of my pocket. Okay, thank you.

538
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:41,680
All right, before we get to the last part of this video, I need to go into one final bit of history.

539
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:49,600
In this case, our own, or at least why we got in that van 48 hours ago. It starts of all things

540
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:55,200
with ice hockey. Actually, a video we filmed back in March about a donut shop at Bangkok's

541
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:00,160
hockey stadium where we interviewed a man named Greg Beattie, who happens to be the president

542
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:06,320
of the local Rotary Club. Rotary, if you don't know, is a service organization. It was founded in

543
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:12,000
1905 and since then has grown to almost one and a half million members worldwide with a focus on

544
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
promoting peace and public works. Anyway, Greg must have been really low on options since he

545
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,200
invited me to give a keynote at a Rotary meeting. And after rambling through my speech, I was introduced

546
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:29,440
to a man named Matthew Kelly, a longtime Rotarian and for decades, a famous rock musician,

547
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:34,800
most associated with the grateful dead. Anyway, fast forward a few months and we're

548
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:40,640
filming in Pateya and who walks by but Matthew Kelly. He invites us to brunch and tells us

549
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,360
on the channel about an organization that along with his wife has become their personal mission,

550
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:52,480
Children of the Forest. The first time he visited was in 2004, right after they welcomed their first

551
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,560
students and that would change his entire life. The Kellys packed their guitars and harmonicas

552
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:04,080
and moved to Thailand and since then have devoted their own resources to the project,

553
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:09,680
including through Matthew's local Rotary Club. When the Kellys first visited Sankla Buri,

554
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:15,200
Children of the Forest was just two small bamboo classrooms set up by an Englishman then

555
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,320
in his early twenties named Daniel Hobson. He traveled through the region and saw how many

556
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:26,720
kids living on the margins had no hope, no future, no documentation or Thai language skills.

557
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,000
So he cleared some land, built a couple of shacks and gathered a few local mon,

558
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,440
Karen and Burmese and sent them into the jungle to spread word of his new school,

559
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,160
where the kids could come and have a chance to learn. The first day they opened his goal,

560
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:48,320
his secret hope was for 20 students to show up. They received six times that number.

561
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:54,720
In the two decades that would follow, Children of the Forest has grown into a force for true good.

562
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,120
It's a school, a women's shelter, a medical clinic, a self-sustaining farm and it even has

563
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:06,880
a football team that keeps winning regional championships. Last month, Greg called me again,

564
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,360
the hockey guy and said that two of his Rotary members would be taking the trip to visit the

565
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,280
organization. Would we like to jump in, spend a couple of days in Sanclebury doing whatever we

566
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:23,600
do here on OTR and maybe if we want to check out that place that Matthew and Mary Kelly had told

567
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:30,240
us so much about. And on our last morning before heading back, well that's exactly what we're gonna do.

568
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:46,240
Everything that happened today is out of my hands. Yesterday was something that me and Daria

569
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:53,840
will remember forever. Seriously, and this goes back to every part of sort of unraveling where

570
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:59,920
we are and the people and the challenges and then obviously that's something that connected with you

571
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,600
20 years ago because you've been here for that long. Before we get into that story, where are we?

572
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:12,640
Tell me about what we're looking at, what is this place? Just give me the basic rundown of where

573
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:20,400
we are. Okay, well we're in a town called Sanclebury on the time me and my border and this is a

574
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,200
special school, a school that was established almost 20 years ago now and a school which

575
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:32,320
particularly caters to the needs of the stateless children from as young as four years old. The

576
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:39,520
children join our school here and from the kindergarten they'll go into our grade one,

577
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:44,480
grade two of elementary school. The elementary school here is a satellite of the government

578
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,840
school so the children will get full certificates when they graduate here and this is their entry

579
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:58,160
point into the school education, Thai education system. We're kind of the bridge between the

580
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:04,720
villages, the plantations and the big Thai government schools. Children of the forest

581
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:11,280
sits on about 17 acres of land just outside the main town of Sanclebury and here on the property

582
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:17,680
more than 7,000 stateless children have learned to speak Thai, received an education,

583
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:24,080
two meals a day and in many cases legal residents and access to continue their studies in Thailand's

584
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:31,360
public schools. For a stateless child to be in a position of vulnerability where they're

585
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:38,800
being exploited or being trafficked, the assistance or the response that they get from

586
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:46,560
society is just not the same and of course there are people of influence and power that

587
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:54,640
know how vulnerable and how weak these children are and they're able to exploit that so that's why

588
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:00,480
the first thing we want to make sure is that all the stateless children in this border region are

589
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,360
in education so once they're here at this school that's when the monitoring begins you know that's

590
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:10,160
when we're able to know the child, we're able to know their plantation, their village, we're able to

591
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:18,640
know their families and they immediately get this safety net and then they also join the Thai

592
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,440
education system which means that they get a student number, there you go they're visible now,

593
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,920
they're not invisible anymore, they've got some proof that they exist, this is their student number

594
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:37,440
and their student number is the first step on the way to gaining certain levels of identification

595
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:42,240
which one day can be realized into Thai citizenship.

596
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:51,280
Today there are more than 200 students enrolled at Children of the Forest but that's just a

597
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:57,200
fraction of those receiving their services. There are houses built on the property for women fleeing

598
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:02,480
abusive relationships or single mothers in need of help raising their children. There's a health

599
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:08,480
clinic operated by Delito who as we saw yesterday also travels into the villages and looks after

600
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:14,560
hundreds of others in need. There's support provided to children in other jungle schools if

601
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,760
this location is inaccessible and there's even a sports program for local teenagers

602
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,600
with the Children of the Forest football team competing throughout the region.

603
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,920
Are you a celebrity to them having come from Manchester?

604
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,520
Yeah some of them think that I used to play for Manchester United which

605
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,520
my football skills are not quite up to that but yeah yeah just leave them thinking that.

606
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,360
A few years ago when Daniel's parents retired his mom and dad came over from the UK and built

607
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:51,680
their own house in Sanclaburi and ever since they've dedicated their golden years to Children

608
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:57,440
of the Forest as well. Hands on and contributing whatever they can to a place that every year

609
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:06,560
sees its needs grow but also its successes. Good morning, my name is Faisu so I grew up here so

610
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:14,800
when I maybe eight years old I went here to the Children of the Forest so I started

611
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:22,080
house and went to university and when I graduate I come to help in here.

612
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:29,920
So we had a little get together with the kids last year and we said what would you like to

613
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,080
add this term and some of the older kids said we'd like to have music and play

614
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:40,800
guitar so we managed to get a donation and bought some acoustic guitars not expensive ones but just

615
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:45,440
and the music teacher comes in for an hour. He's here yesterday and he's here again this morning.

616
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,280
Did you make it? Did you make it?

617
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,520
Yes. Anya. What's it?

618
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:07,520
Pea, bean and what is it called? Tomato.

619
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:14,880
Okay. This is Christmas for me. This is the most exciting thing that could have possibly happened

620
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,480
to me this morning. Even if by now we'd completely lost track of the fact that we were here to make a

621
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:26,560
food video at least someone never forgot and in between a morning of checking on patience and

622
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:31,760
overseeing the Children of the Forest women's shelter our friend Delito found time to make

623
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:38,640
sure we'd fulfill our own mission preparing us a completely unexpected meal of her own family's

624
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,520
traditional mon food.

625
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,400
I guess I don't drink but

626
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,520
Jay is a local painter. This is. This is a cisney.

627
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:00,400
This is something to say. I want you to try a little you know. I'm so excited about this.

628
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:12,480
Three star Michelin restaurant. You know you have the classical guitar playing in the background.

629
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,280
We have the music over there. Yes. We have the home cooked meal. It's very elegant, right? Yes.

630
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:30,080
What did you make for us?

631
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:37,760
Mon food for me is food you guys. Mon, very old style, very old style, true.

632
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,440
This is a little bit special for all of you come because in our culture,

633
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:47,280
more and more culture when the people come there so they will come with the food.

634
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:54,560
So cook food and then eat if you lie and you can try if you if you like the taste you try a lot.

635
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,320
Okay. If you don't like just try a little. Tell me the name of the dish as you would say it in

636
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,320
mon language and then also just kind of a little description. Mon language.

637
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:31,600
Thank you so much for this. This is just an amazing, amazing meal.

638
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,200
I'm happy.

639
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,360
How do I say how do I know I asked you this yesterday but I'm not very good with languages.

640
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,040
How do I say thank you in one language?

641
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,880
If you want to say like a very soft one is a tango.

642
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:59,680
After that you just said easy is a tango.

643
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,400
I want to say this in a very not soft way. I want to say this in a very tango.

644
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,520
Until the age of 10 or 11 then I would have come to the school here. What would you like to do?

645
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:31,280
The life would have been that of a typical stateless child really just no home, no land.

646
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,760
So you're moving constantly just following wherever the work is so you might have a few

647
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:42,160
months here and the work seems good but then your employer decides not to pay you so you

648
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:47,280
haven't got enough for food but you hear about work in another town or another village and then

649
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,480
you'll follow the work there and just keep moving around from factory to rubber plantation to

650
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,840
construction site just no no stability.

651
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,640
It's hard in a place like this to put into words what it's actually like to visit

652
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:14,800
but the main takeaway at least for the three of us and I'm sure as well for JP and Visana

653
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:20,240
and I suppose for Matthew and Mary Kelly and for Daniel and his family is that coming here

654
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:25,760
shows how inadequate our knowledge and the usual reporting about refugees and migrants actually

655
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:31,840
is. I mean the scale of the problem is so big that there's no way to cover this topic without

656
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:39,360
distilling people down to statistics to reducing everything to numbers like the 520,000 stateless

657
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:45,680
people living in Thailand's no man's land surviving in limbo with dreams and ambitions the

658
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:51,760
kinds of things that make us human long given way to the simple struggle of how to survive another day.

659
01:11:52,800 --> 01:12:00,880
520,000, 4.5 million in total who fled from Myanmar, 5 million people stateless and 35 million

660
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:07,280
refugees if you consider the entire world. It's a massive number but it becomes completely

661
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:14,720
overwhelming when you consider each one is actually a person. These people, the families who cooked us

662
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:19,680
dinner at the rubber plantation or who stay on the grounds of the temple that allows them at least

663
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:26,960
to exist. It's not fair how is it fair that I have the life I have just because I was born in New York

664
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:32,640
into a family with a house and a car hell we had two cars and someone else has to hike four hours

665
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:38,880
twice a day just to get recognized as a person just for the chance to earn what I take for granted

666
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:46,560
every single day food shelter clean water I don't have much I feel like I don't have much and things

667
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:52,320
haven't always been easy but even with my problems I can still go out to dinner or do a weekend at the

668
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:58,080
beach or even have a hobby like playing tennis or running what a luxury it is to have a hobby.

669
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:11,120
When you think in terms of the top line number statistics like 520,000 or 35 million seeing the

670
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:17,040
work that goes on here can feel like taking a cup of water from the ocean it's too much it's just

671
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:23,120
way too much but when you stop turning people into statistics and see each one as an individual

672
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,720
then all this starts to make sense and what an honor to have been invited here.

673
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:45,120
When Daniel found out that a food channel was coming to visit children of the forest he had an

674
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:50,160
idea since even though the students come from different backgrounds at its core this is a

675
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:56,800
community we shouldn't leave without at least one last meal of the regional specialty and for the

676
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:03,760
kids one chance to show us who they are and where they come from so the whole time we've been here

677
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:09,760
while we've been touring the school and having our own incredible experience groups of students

678
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,720
along with some of the staff who themselves are graduates of the school have been hard at work

679
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:21,520
preparing us a going away feast something for us to remember what it was like to visit Sanclaburi

680
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:27,600
and to spend these last three days experiencing something that we will never forget of course

681
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:34,560
it's conom gene made with banana leaves cut down from their own plantation vegetables from their

682
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:40,960
own gardens and a technique to make the noodles themselves used here in this jungle since the

683
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:57,200
mon ran the kingdom and everything that would come after well it hadn't happened yet

684
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,840
do you feel fulfilled is this a life that you ever would have envisioned for yourself and how

685
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,160
how is what's it like being you having having this life and having seen the success that you've

686
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:18,480
been a part of creating um i don't think i ever really consciously planned to you know be living

687
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:24,880
here permanently um it's just something happened i just kind of followed what was inspiring me and

688
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:32,480
what i felt needed to be done and had an incredible team around me to to make it happen and yeah i'm

689
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:38,960
happy a lot of the visitors that come here and they think that it involves a huge kind of sacrifice

690
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:44,240
to be here but not really it's uh it's easy to get up in the morning when you're seeing all this

691
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:49,680
inspiration around you um probably more sacrifice will be being in an office in the city for me

692
01:15:49,680 --> 01:16:02,880
that would be a real level of sacrifice
