0	6260	I probably don't need to tell you what this is.
6260	11620	Half of the people on this planet eat at least a bowl of it every single day.
11620	16580	Rice is the staple for civilizations from Southeast Asia to the Caribbean, China to
16580	22700	West Africa, and wherever it's grown it doesn't just provide nutrition, it forms the backbone
22700	25900	of entire culinary cultures.
25900	31180	This simple grain has built empires, led to the establishment of cities and been the cause
31180	35540	of everything from diplomatic feuds to full-on warps.
35540	40140	Its cultivation was the single most important moment in the history of agriculture and yet
40140	46920	somehow it manages to be everywhere and still overlooked, taken for granted, never given
46920	49800	the credit it's actually due.
49800	55160	So today on OTR we're out to change that, to trace its incredible path and wade into
55160	61320	its long and often controversial history, and of course, to try some of the best versions
61320	66080	of the world's most ancient and enduring rice dishes.
66080	79640	This is the story of rice.
79640	83640	There's a legend told in the villages of Vietnam that a very long time ago there were
83640	86800	no such things as grains of rice.
86800	91200	Instead every night rice would grow to the size of basketballs and each morning, piles
91200	95400	of them would proudly roll themselves towards every house and wade outside the front door
95400	99240	for the family to wake up, ready to eat.
99240	103840	Humans thanks to rice had everything they needed, and all rice asked in exchange was
103840	109000	a little bit of gratitude, a simple thank you in the form of some decorations left outside
109000	111160	to show appreciation.
111160	115040	So the people would decorate their houses with tributes to the friendly rice, but one
115040	121780	night a farmer ate too much and fell asleep, forgetting to display his sacred shrine.
121780	126040	To the rice gods this was a sign that humans had begun to take their bounty for granted,
126040	132400	so in anger they shrunk down to a tiny size and decided to stay put out in the fields.
132400	137360	From then on wherever rice would grow it would be up to the farmers to do the work themselves
137360	139040	or go hungry.
139040	144120	This is just one of the countless origin stories and legends about the creation of rice, found
144120	148560	in the oral histories of cultures from one side of the planet to the other, because for
148560	156320	so much of the world, wherever you find life, well if you go back far enough, you find rice.
156320	161280	Since the beginning of time in this part of the world rice has been everything, the very
161280	166120	foundation of society and the staple crop that allowed cities to form and caused empires
166120	168520	to rise and fall.
168520	174400	Day across the planet, 14% of every crop pulled from the ground is a rice stalk, and if you
174400	180360	put all the rice fields together, it would make the 13th largest country on earth.
180360	185160	A billion people on this planet make a living from planting, harvesting, packing, shipping
185160	190880	or selling rice, from Asia to the Americas and almost everywhere in between, with the
190880	196520	plant itself cultivated from the lowest points below sea level to the mountains of the Himalayas.
196520	201640	It can be grown on water, in the fields or even high up in the mountains.
201640	205200	Where there is rice, there are people.
205200	209040	Throughout history, the rice plant has been used to make clothes and insulation, paper
209040	211120	and even particle board.
211120	215840	In ancient Korea, it was used as currency for paying taxes and today it might even rescue
215840	217840	your cell phone.
217840	222400	Rice is used for preservation, for adding strength to concrete and for fermenting into
222400	223900	alcohol.
223900	230140	But of course, most of all, it's used as food, with as much as half of the world's population
230140	234800	consuming at least a bowl of rice every single day.
234800	239160	Now alright, this is a story about history and as hard as it might be to fathom, there
239160	241040	is always a first.
241040	246200	In this case someone, somewhere, who became the first person to ever plant and cook some
246200	250600	rice, the tiny act that would change everything.
250700	255480	That's usually how these videos begin, but let me issue a caveat.
255480	259300	Finding origins is always going to be complicated, not necessarily because the evidence is hard
259300	260500	to follow.
260500	264100	If you cut through the nonsense, there's usually a decent trail you can follow that
264100	266540	leads somewhere before anywhere else.
266540	271860	But the problem when it comes to rice is how much nonsense there actually is, mainly because
271860	275940	this has become an existential battle for national pride.
275940	280480	I mean, the concept of food wars isn't new, like there's stuff like french fries, kimchi
280480	283720	and hummus where multiple countries make a claim.
283720	286840	But this is rice, it's different.
286840	290600	So with that said, before we get to our first meal, let's start by going back to the very
290600	294960	beginning and wading into a fight that's divided the world.
301240	304760	Alright, before we get into speculation, let's start with facts.
305020	308260	First, the consumption of rice is very, very old.
308260	313980	And second, rice is a grass, and before it was first domesticated, variations of wild
313980	316100	rice grew across much of the world.
316100	320740	But with that said, let's begin with a generally accepted point of origin for the use of rice
320740	326900	as a food source, which is China's Yangtze River Valley, specifically here, in the area
326900	333380	between today's Ningbo and Hangzhou, at dig sites dating to as far back as 12,000 B.C.
333380	338760	or 8,000 years before the invention of the wheel, and 2,000 years prior to the fictional
338760	341080	lives of the Flintstones.
341080	346080	Anyway, this evidence is generally based on rice having famously been found in storage
346080	347080	basins.
347080	351280	However, what's not as widely known is that rice was just a small component of giant
351280	357240	pots filled mostly with nuts and acorns, which probably, not definitely, but most likely,
357240	360760	means that rice wasn't actually that widely accessible.
360760	365220	Or in other words, it wasn't being farmed yet, just foraged.
365220	369540	Let me digress for a second to explain something about how rice works.
369540	373900	Basically the rice we eat is the seed of the plant, and grasses have this thing they do
373900	376260	in nature called shattering.
376260	379300	What it means is that when the seed becomes ripe, it falls off.
379300	381500	That's how the species survives.
381500	386260	But when something that's just ripe and falls off, it kind of ruins the idea of farming.
386260	390400	So at some point, I mean, thousands and thousands of years after people filled those basins
390400	394120	in China, we see a genetic shift.
394120	399720	All of a sudden, the fossilized samples archaeologists found starting around 5,000 BC had a mutated
399720	405880	gene, one that would stop the plant from shattering and therefore allow farming.
405880	407720	This would have been incredibly difficult.
407720	411520	I mean, it took as long as 8,000 years to be achieved.
411520	416980	It would be perhaps the most significant breakthrough in global farming history, and that's not
416980	418660	an exaggeration.
418660	423900	But as for where it happened, well, that's when we start getting into the controversy.
423900	429300	The oldest fossilized remains of non-shattering rice were actually not found in China, but
429300	434660	in India, where rice consumption also dates back to the beginning of the written record.
434660	439700	Now, Indian legends claim that rice has been consumed in the country since at least 13,000
439720	444040	BC, although with no evidence to support it, it feels like that number might have been
444040	447960	chosen only because it's older than what they found in China.
447960	452880	But it is without question that rice also has an ancient history in India.
452880	456840	It's closely linked to many of the country's great religions, and those claims are also
456840	459240	backed up by archaeology.
459240	463560	The Indian and Chinese strains of rice are two distinct variations, known as japonica
463560	464840	and indica.
465180	472220	However, they both belong to the same species, oriza sativa, and both possess the exact same
472220	475300	non-shattering gene, evolved identically.
475300	479260	So scientists have come to generally agree that it would be impossible for them not to
479260	481820	come from the same source.
481820	483660	It had to start somewhere.
483660	487620	Now, since scientists first started studying this topic, both countries have put a lot
487620	492740	of money into commissioning research backing their own origin claims, which makes finding
492740	496520	truth in the history books a complete mess.
496520	501520	There are tons of studies from China which show irrefutable evidence of the Chinese origin,
501520	507160	and just as many from India proving with certainty that they were the ones who made the breakthrough.
507160	512920	Maybe the best actual clue comes from an American research team that in 2011 did a full genome
512920	518360	mapping of more than 100 types of Indian and Chinese rice, and determined that the actual
518380	523220	point of origin based on genetic comparisons with wild rice wasn't from the banks of the
523220	525500	Yangtze or the Ganges.
525500	530420	Instead, it was the flood plains of the Pearl River Delta in China's south close to Hong
530420	531420	Kong.
531420	536300	According to that theory, the rice from there would make its way across China and by land
536300	541380	to India, along the way being cross-bred with local endemic ferritals.
541380	547300	Anyway, one last point on the topic which may or may not be relevant, but in 2003, a team
547320	551680	of archaeologists in Korea announced that they'd found evidence that rice actually
551680	558680	originated there as far back as 15,000 B.C., jumping the line even ahead of China and India.
559520	564600	The studies flew in fast and furious from both of those countries, with literally thousands
564600	567560	of papers discrediting the Korean claim.
567560	571480	Successfully, by the way, as by now it's almost completely forgotten.
571480	574800	At least China and India can work together sometimes.
574980	579100	Anyway, regardless of where rice started, as soon as farmers figured out how to grow
579100	583100	it, well, towns started forming, then cities.
583100	587460	Here was something so abundant, so resilient that it literally took Asian society from
587460	594460	hunter-gatherers to urban dwellers, which finally brings us to our first meal.
594500	598460	The earliest versions of rice eaten, whether in China, India, or Korea, wouldn't look
598460	601580	that different to how you might typically see it today.
601580	605520	Some steamed rice, along with a protein, or maybe some simple vegetables.
605520	610720	But around 1000 B.C., we start to see the first culinary breakthroughs, the use of rice as
610720	614000	a component in a complete dish.
614000	618920	What we find at the very beginning is something incredibly simple, made with just rice and
618920	624000	water, created after a flood to stretch a limited supply further.
624000	629800	But as far as we know, it's the world's first rice recipe, a dish from China, known
629820	630820	as Joe.
641320	648820	So, all right, Michelin-rated Joe restaurant, although realistically Joe is Joe.
648820	655420	It's rice cooked until it's a soup texture, if you've ever had it before, it's kind of
655420	657580	like oatmeal.
657580	662560	You can make it as thick or as thin as you see fit, although this is pretty standard,
662560	664840	it's kind of right in the middle.
664840	670360	The whole idea is just to stretch rice further, and in this case, put a couple of classic
670360	672320	components in it.
672320	676360	The more elegant, famous Joe restaurants will serve it with seafood, especially in
676360	677360	South China.
677360	683080	Here, I just have sun-dried pork and century egg, which are both preserved ingredients
683080	687900	that would have been in a classic Joe, at least as far as we know, a really long time
687900	688900	ago.
688900	693900	And we got it on the side with yotiao, thank you very much, otherwise known as patonggou
693900	700900	here in Thailand, which secretly is kind of what this is really all about.
704740	709740	The genius, of course, of Joe is that it stretches a limited supply of rice further, a way to
709760	715320	save a population dependent on rice from starvation when there's not enough to go around.
715320	720680	Joe, also known as kanji, or here in Thailand, joke, is said to have been created in China
720680	726640	during the Zhou Dynasty, the name is probably just a coincidence, around 1000 BC.
726640	731520	Now the Zhou ruled from what's now Xi'an, and they pretty much based much of their rule
731520	733280	on rice.
733280	737720	They claim to be descended from a man named Hou Ji, a figure from Chinese mythology who
737740	743580	was, and this is hilarious if you've ever dealt with Chinese bureaucracy, an administrator,
743580	749820	a prehistoric minister of agriculture who was revered for giving the Middle Kingdom rice.
749820	754580	And through the spread of Joe, the Zhou dynasty could claim to oversee an empire that was
754580	758700	almost immune to famine.
758700	763100	It wouldn't take long for Joe to spread wherever there was rice, and to become revered as almost
763100	764300	a miracle.
764320	769840	You can find it in ancient recipes in Southeast Asia, Japan, and Korea, and also of course
769840	775000	in the Indian subcontinent where it was used not just as food but as traditional medicine,
775000	779920	and where we get the name kanji, a temel word meaning boiling.
779920	785920	And to this day in the same region where it first emerged, it's an everyday breakfast staple.
794300	798320	I've never really thought about this, but since we're on camera, and I have to look
798320	805320	okay, eating Joe with a mustache is really causing me some trouble.
818320	824040	Alright, between the advent of non-shattering rice, the fast expansion of rice across Asia
824060	828780	and the introduction of dishes like Joe to make rice drought-proof, the thousand years
828780	833740	before the year zero would see an explosion in both rice consumption, and also more and
833740	838820	more new recipes, new uses of rice adapted to local palates.
838820	844220	In those years we see the first example of sushi made in Japan, something called narazushi.
844220	850460	Fish and rice pickled together in salt, said to have originated around the year 300 BC.
850460	855160	It's the time frame in India when we see the birth of something called kheer, basically
855160	859880	Joe but cooked in milk and sugar instead of water, seasoned with cardamom and topped with
859880	865120	nuts and almost definitely the world's first sweet rice dish.
865120	870560	And it's around the same time as the Qin Dynasty, the first to unify China, saw northerners
870560	876080	from non-rice growing regions move south where they began to make their own staple, noodles
876080	878920	from rice instead of wheat.
878920	883060	But those noodles, while they would spread around much of the world, well they weren't
883060	886100	technically the first rice noodles.
886100	890100	Because long before those show up, another group of people from China had settled the
890100	895660	basin of the Irawati River in what today is Myanmar, bringing rice farming to Southeast
895660	900980	Asia and putting their stamp on cuisine through their own signature dish.
900980	906500	These were people known as the Maun and what they made brings us to the next part of this
906500	907500	story.
907500	917960	Now, we've talked at length about the Maun on this channel as they were massively influential
917960	922760	in the origins of Southeast Asia, but basically they were rice farmers who swept down from
922760	926580	the Yangtze River Valley around 3500 BC.
926580	930660	It's true that pretty much every civilization from this region would develop their own techniques
930660	936640	and varietals of rice, but the first to sow the land, to plant the seeds literally and
936640	939520	figuratively, were the ethnic Maun.
939520	944760	It's the Maun who introduced the region to irrigation and rice cultivation, and while
944760	949800	they didn't leave a lot of records behind, we can follow their spread through two paths,
949800	955080	their language, and their most famous dish, something that would become a staple of ancient
955080	958520	civilizations from the Lanna to the Khmer.
958520	963280	It was made by milling rice into flour and then making it into a dough, fermented in
963280	968040	the tropical heat for preservation, and then forced through small holes directly into boiling
968040	969040	water.
969040	974080	It's a technique still followed today, an essential part of the cuisine in Thailand,
974080	979680	Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and even as far away as Sri Lanka and southern India.
979680	984920	The Maun called it Hanon Chin, the root of the Thai name, Kanom Chin.
984920	989200	Like Joe, it was most likely developed to stretch a rice harvest even farther, something
989200	994760	critical here in the floodlands and with the added benefit of tasting really, really good.
994760	1000080	Its history predates almost anything else still found in Southeast Asia, food or otherwise,
1000080	1005200	and where it started, today's Myanmar, it's still the national dish.
1005200	1011440	Served in a soup made of fish stock and aromatics, something found in every corner of the country.
1011440	1014120	There it's known as a dish called Mohinga.
1019200	1028640	This is like the ultimate Burmese breakfast food.
1028640	1031440	It's salty, you know, it's a fish stock.
1031440	1034400	You have the chickpea fritters because it's from Myanmar, which means there's going to
1034400	1036560	be some kind of textural contrast.
1036560	1045520	Egg, fish cake, and long beans, some cilantro or coriander if you prefer, and the soup with
1045520	1048680	some chili on top.
1048680	1052680	And yeah, this is just one of my all time favorite things.
1052680	1055160	It's a lot of people's favorite thing.
1055160	1069720	This is a very popular dish.
1069720	1073880	We did a whole video about these noodles, these rice noodles that like, you can see them
1073880	1077520	all across Southeast Asia.
1077520	1082640	Thailand is Khanom Jin, Cambodia it's Numbang Chok, Vietnam it's Bun, and the whole point
1082640	1087000	is that like wherever you see this, that's where the ethnic mon once settled.
1087000	1090760	These are probably, we don't know for sure and there's some disagreement in South China,
1090760	1095360	but probably the first rice noodles that were ever made.
1095360	1100600	And it has, you know, a history that's a lot older than any kind of modern Southeast Asian
1100600	1106600	society.
1106600	1111520	And it helps, it is absolutely delicious.
1111520	1120060	It's also pretty light, which I'm thankful for with the amount of eating that we have
1120060	1121060	ahead of us.
1121060	1126520	I'm already getting full.
1126520	1131600	Why the year 500 BC rice was found pretty much everywhere in the eastern half of Asia,
1131600	1136800	and I mean everywhere from the southernmost islands all the way into the Himalayas.
1136800	1140480	And maybe the most fun part about tracing its spread isn't really the fundamentals of
1140480	1145040	how it was traded, so much as the myths that spring up around its arrival.
1145040	1150480	I mean, in the eyes of the earliest people, something this important had to be a gift
1150480	1151480	from the gods.
1151480	1156200	In fact, almost every culture and ethnic group in this part of the world has an origin story
1156200	1158360	about this plant.
1158360	1162160	And if you'll indulge me just a minute before we get back to the history, well these are
1162160	1165040	very much worth acknowledging.
1165040	1169360	In China, the most common story involves the goddess Guan Yin, who you might also remember
1169360	1171680	from our history of oysters.
1171680	1176400	It's said that she gave her milk and her blood to create the first rice plant, with
1176400	1181120	the milk explaining the white color of the grains, and the blood, the reddish husk, around
1181120	1182640	the outside.
1182640	1188080	To early Japan, it was another goddess, Amaterasu Omikami, who was given grains of rice by a
1188080	1194400	swan flying through heaven and presented them as a gift to the Japanese islands.
1194400	1198240	Female deities also play roles in a few ancient stories here in Thailand, where according
1198240	1203840	to one legend, a goddess was cursed by the wives of farmers because she was too beautiful,
1203840	1206360	and their husbands desired her affection.
1206360	1211160	So she hid herself in shame and lived with her best friend, a freshwater fish, where
1211160	1217280	she would remain until the farmers apologized and as a show of goodwill, she gave them rice.
1217280	1221380	Maybe my favorite story about the origin of rice comes from Tibet, where people once
1221380	1226160	battled starvation as they relied on hunting in a land with few animals.
1226160	1230440	One day a dog came running across an empty field and hanging from its tail were clusters
1230440	1235240	of rice seeds, which they planted and hunger disappeared.
1235240	1239480	Versions of this story are found throughout the Himalayas and western China, one from
1239480	1245000	the Miao people, where a dog with nine tails went into heaven to steal a rice plant, fighting
1245000	1249960	the heavenly gods and in the process, seeing eight of its tails cut off before achieving
1249960	1256400	its mission and returning to earth with rice, which is also the origin story of dogs.
1256400	1260200	Regardless of which version is told in a community in the region from Sichuan to the
1260200	1265480	Himalayas, it's still tradition to give the first cooked handful of that year's rice
1265480	1268520	harvest to the family dog.
1268520	1270640	A couple more than back to our story.
1270640	1274720	In the Philippines, there's one legend that says a girl born into slavery named Agme was
1274720	1280300	sitting at a river, crying tears of sadness when she saw a bundle of golden stalks floating
1280300	1281720	with the current.
1281720	1286120	She buried the plant in the mud next to the river and when it grew, her family collected
1286120	1289160	the rice and used it to buy their freedom.
1289160	1293840	And a Laotian tale involves a farmer who had no food to eat, so he trapped a fish but
1293840	1296440	the fish turned out to be sacred.
1296440	1301920	To prevent the fish from being eaten, the king of the fishes gave the farmer rice instead.
1301920	1305640	Rice would become so important and Laot that eventually a king would take all the rice
1305640	1308160	and hoard it in a locked dungeon.
1308160	1313480	So a peasant, when in search of the rice goddess, hacked her into pieces and planted them, which
1313480	1318480	gave Laot countless varieties of the plant, white, black, long grain, short grain and
1318480	1319960	sticky rice.
1319960	1324560	With so many types of rice now growing, the king could no longer control the supply and
1324560	1327780	from then on the people lived in abundance.
1327780	1332000	And even though there are countless more, well that's as good a segue as any into another
1332000	1336560	important topic, which is the diversity of rice itself.
1336560	1340560	With so many cultures and so many climates relying on the plant, it's not a surprise
1340560	1345680	that this simple grain has evolved in thousands of different ways.
1345680	1350160	Actually 120,000 different ways, that's how many varieties of rice are said to exist today
1350160	1356720	across the planet, 20,000 right here in Thailand alone, which all evolved from that very first
1356720	1358220	Big Bang.
1358220	1361800	It's a number that might sound crazy, I mean it is crazy.
1361800	1365960	But to see for ourselves, well we had to take a trip to the local market.
1365960	1376760	I wonder if the ducks and chickens still remember me.
1376760	1387560	Maybe not, I don't think they're the same ones.
1387560	1391880	This is Klangtoi, Thailand's largest wet market in a place we just filmed a couple
1391880	1395760	weeks ago, spending 24 hours here without leaving.
1395760	1399640	And while then our focus was on the meats and vegetables, this is also where Bangkok
1399640	1401760	shops for rice.
1401760	1407080	There's rice in all forms, toasted for use in Esan cuisine, made into kanam jeen or
1407080	1415200	mohinga noodles, and of course, sold straight from the farm in massive quantities.
1415200	1424280	Alright, we already found our destination, we don't need to go beyond this, 31 types
1424280	1425800	of rice at least.
1425800	1434280	And obviously we have all kinds of different sizes and variations of Chinese white rice.
1434280	1440160	We have all the Thai jasmine rice, the long grain Thai jasmine rice I think is going to
1440160	1442480	be this.
1442480	1449600	We have what looks like sticky rice, so this is going to be the Esan sticky rice, 1, 2,
1449600	1452680	3, at a minimum of that.
1452680	1473600	We have the unhusked varieties, black rice, brown rice, slightly less brown rice.
1473600	1478400	The diversity of rice on display at a place like Klangtoi is both impressive and honestly
1478400	1481960	unless you grew up in this culture, confusing.
1482240	1485920	We need to get back to the history, but before this channel I was a chef and the food side
1485920	1488600	of this needs to be addressed.
1488600	1494240	What's the difference between all these variations and how does the choice of rice impact the
1494240	1496360	dishes it's meant to be served with?
1496360	1500720	Well, I can't answer that question, but I do know someone who can.
1500720	1505560	So for our next meal, I set up an appointment with the owner of one of Thailand's best
1505760	1507760	restaurants.
1521280	1526320	This is Bandang by Methevalai Sorndang, an offshoot of the Michelin-starred place that's
1526320	1530320	often called one of the best Thai restaurants on the planet.
1530320	1535000	The third generation owner, my friend Nam, agreed to join us to pass along some of his
1535440	1539440	secrets when it comes to selecting a proper rice to pair with his cuisine.
1541440	1547440	Tell me, as a Thai person, how important rice is in the culture, in the language of saying
1547440	1550440	like, how are you doing essentially, right?
1550440	1555440	Just explain to me about the importance of rice to somebody in Thailand.
1555440	1556440	Wow.
1556440	1559440	Wow.
1559440	1564440	That metaphor, it's basically the same as just waking up and breathing.
1564440	1567440	I'd say we eat it every single day.
1567440	1572440	I'd say for the typical Thai, every day, just every day, it's an everyday thing for us.
1572440	1576440	So it's very important.
1576440	1581440	According to Nam, of all the varietals you'll find at a market, there are subtle differences
1581440	1585440	in tastes and textures, and certain sizes work better with some dishes.
1585440	1589440	But for an educated shopper, what you're really paying attention to is not just the type of
1589440	1593440	rice, but how it's treated after it's been harvested.
1594440	1595440	Wow.
1595440	1599440	You were telling me off off the air something that's really interesting about a side of
1599440	1602440	choosing what rice you're going to use that I hadn't really considered.
1602440	1603440	Right.
1603440	1608440	So I guess the most common is jasmine rice, which we use here as well.
1608440	1615440	But what I've learned throughout my career is that the amount of time for rice storage
1615440	1622440	before it is used also has also affected its uses as well.
1622440	1628440	Typically when a rice is stored, give or take, less than three months, it still has its starch
1628440	1630440	content, which makes it more sticky.
1630440	1635440	And most people use it for, let's say, jok, porridge.
1635440	1641440	It creates a more sticky feeling, and then the aroma is going to be nicer.
1641440	1647440	However, after it's stored later than three months, six months, or a year with proper
1647440	1651440	storing, it can be more used in a versatile manner.
1651440	1653440	For example, fried rice.
1653440	1657440	It becomes less starchy, less sticky, and less clumpy.
1657440	1660440	That's why it's a bit of a hidden technique.
1660440	1662440	You don't have to use a day old rice.
1662440	1667440	You can use rice that is probably stored for a long time.
1667440	1668440	And so it's...
1668440	1669440	You just cook it and fry it.
1669440	1671440	Yeah, just cook it and fry it, basically.
1671440	1673440	What do you choose to use here?
1673440	1676440	So here we use a typically three to six month old rice.
1676440	1680440	So it's more versatile use in a restaurant manner.
1680440	1686440	And for newer rice, it's much harder to cook properly because sometimes it's so easy to
1686440	1692440	overcook it, and it becomes this sort of like pasty kind of feel.
1698440	1699440	So you get your rice.
1699440	1700440	Yeah.
1700440	1701440	Get your rice.
1701440	1702440	Thank you.
1702440	1703440	And then...
1703440	1707440	Let's do it here so we can endorse if you want to film this from above while we're doing this.
1707440	1708440	All right.
1708440	1714440	So basically what you typically do, you get the sauce, the curry, and then you pour it
1714440	1717440	over the rice.
1717440	1722440	And then basically you just do that.
1722440	1724440	So the rice absorbs all the flavor.
1724440	1727440	And that's how basically we eat.
1732440	1733440	All right.
1733440	1734440	Let me eat.
1734440	1735440	Thank you.
1735440	1736440	Go ahead.
1736440	1737440	I'm just looking at this.
1737440	1738440	I got my plate off to the side.
1738440	1739440	Enjoy.
1739440	1740440	Yeah.
1740440	1741440	Thank you so much.
1741440	1742440	Nice to see you again.
1742440	1743440	You're welcome.
1743440	1744440	Thank you.
1757440	1758440	All right.
1758440	1762440	To get back to the history we left off around the time the Japanese developed sushi and the
1762440	1767440	mon created rice noodles, all using crops and techniques brought from China.
1767440	1772440	But not long after that, the global rice trade would change, with China putting a hard stop
1772440	1774440	on rice export.
1774440	1779440	See, China might have become a nation completely dependent on rice, but by the time of the
1779440	1784440	Tin Dynasty, it was already clear that there just wasn't enough to go around.
1784440	1789440	They had a growing population to feed and only a small percentage of land suitable for farming.
1789440	1794440	So for a long time, there would be no more trade in Chinese rice.
1794440	1800440	And so this story shifts to India, which was at its peak as the linchpin of global culinary
1800440	1801440	commerce.
1801440	1807440	Let's start around 500 BC, when India was a trading partner of the ancient Persian
1807440	1808440	Empire.
1808440	1813440	At some point around that time, the Persians began to import quantities of Indian rice,
1813440	1817440	the first time that it reached that far to Asia's West.
1817440	1822440	Rice would become common in Persia, with their own agriculture centered around Basra in
1822440	1823440	today's Iraq.
1823440	1826440	The Persian Empire wouldn't last much longer.
1826440	1832440	It would fall to the Greeks under Alexander the Great in the year 330 BC, and it was that
1832440	1837440	conquest that first introduced rice to Europe and the Western world.
1837440	1843440	As a matter of fact, it's also how we get the word rice, from the Greek orisa, which
1843440	1848440	was taken from the language of Persia, which itself came a very long time ago from India's
1848440	1850440	southern language of Tamil.
1850440	1854440	Anyway, just because the Persians were growing rice doesn't mean they were using it as a
1854440	1856440	staple food source.
1856440	1860440	After all, theirs was a baking culture and rice should be steamed, something not yet
1860440	1862440	found in West Asia.
1862440	1867440	Instead, as far as we can tell, in Persia and later in ancient Greece, rice was used
1867440	1872440	for making into flour for desserts, and most of all, for making beer.
1872440	1877440	After rice first shows up in Persia, it would be another few centuries before it would become
1877440	1882440	part of their diet, and for that, well, let's go back to China again.
1882440	1887440	Well, maybe not China itself, I mean, it was close to the rice trade, but to the borderlands
1887440	1891440	where Chinese rice had first spread so long ago.
1891440	1896440	One of those neighboring countries to China's west was Uzbekistan, where as far back as
1896440	1902440	the 4th century AD, the people were known to favor a local dish of rice cooked in stock
1902440	1908440	with spices, called hualao in Chinese, locally pronounced as pilaf.
1908440	1913440	After the Muslim conquest of Central Asia in the 700s, new trade routes would spring up
1913440	1916440	linking the region to the Middle East.
1916440	1921440	It was along those paths that pilaf was first introduced from Uzbekistan to Persia, and
1921440	1927440	then during the Mughal Empire from Persia to India, where it would become biryani.
1927440	1931440	That dish would change the way rice was consumed in the Middle East.
1931440	1934440	And for our next meal, well, that's where we're headed.
1938440	1956440	In the alleys between Bangkok's Sukhumvit Soi 3 and Soi 5, there's a neighborhood
1956440	1961440	known as the Arab Quarter, the home to a densely packed maze of restaurants run by
1961440	1964440	and servicing people from the Muslim world.
1964440	1970440	And one thing those cultures have in common from Morocco to Iraq is the use of rice.
1970440	1973440	But nothing draws a crowd like this one.
1973440	1980440	One of my favorite dishes served in this city, a legendary Bedouin dish known as Mansaf Rice.
1985440	1989440	Alright, so I understand that at this stage in the shoot, and we, this is not a camera
1989440	1992440	trick, we've done this all in succession.
1992440	1998440	Having this enormous 10 kilo plate of food is a strong choice.
1998440	2004440	However, I mean, I don't care what the circumstances are, I will always have room for this.
2004440	2009440	This is Mansaf Rice, and it is the national dish of Jordan.
2009440	2013440	It's found sort of throughout the Levant region.
2013440	2018440	Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, it's very popular.
2018440	2022440	What it is is basically rice that's cooked in a sauce made of yogurt.
2022440	2024440	We have more of the yogurt sauce here.
2024440	2027440	Mutton is the meat of choice.
2027440	2033440	And it's cooked on top of and with bread, you know, which is the flatbread of the Middle East.
2033440	2038440	So I'm going to start scooping this, and it is just like, this is a treat.
2038440	2039440	This is the kind of thing.
2039440	2042440	I mean, you know, we've never filmed at this restaurant before.
2042440	2045440	This is called Hafid, and the restaurant itself is actually Egyptian.
2045440	2051440	But they do have foods from throughout the region, and this is the highlight.
2051440	2055440	Me and Daria actually came here for this off-camera like a week ago.
2055440	2060440	And that's something that we do quite frequently whenever we're in the mood.
2060440	2069440	I would say that this is one of our two or three most frequent stops in the whole city for a place that we eat regularly off-camera.
2069440	2074440	So yeah, Mansaf Rice, it's a dish that has a ton of history.
2074440	2080440	And like thousands of years of history as a Bedouin dish, the incorporation of rice is more modern.
2080440	2085440	It was traditionally mutton yogurt sauce and bread.
2085440	2093440	However, rice as a staple grain in the Middle East is also something that has ancient history because, of course, it does its rice.
2105440	2110440	That's unbelievable.
2110440	2115440	I'm going to just eat because the hair salon across the street is celebrating song crime.
2115440	2117440	It was just a high new year.
2117440	2123440	And so they were very nice and agreed to turn their blasting music off for us while we were filming.
2123440	2127440	But I told them just a few minutes and then we promised we'll let you get back to your party.
2127440	2131440	So I'm going to let them do that because I have work to do.
2131440	2138440	There's a lot to eat and talking is just distracting me from the actual mission.
2138440	2142440	Unreal.
2142440	2150440	Alright, as long and convoluted as the path of rice is, the one thing that's certain, the one universal truth is that in ancient history,
2150440	2158440	rice grew wild across much of the world before somewhere, probably China, maybe India, after thousands of years of trying,
2158440	2163440	breeders were able to crack the genetic code and successfully domesticate rice.
2163440	2168440	I mean, we covered that right at the beginning and it's the most important thing that might have ever happened in food.
2168440	2170440	But it's not the whole story.
2170440	2178440	What isn't usually included in the history books is that there was a second domestication, half a world away from Asia,
2178440	2184440	a second miracle of agriculture completely independent from the one that we all know about.
2184440	2191440	It happened around 3,500 years ago in Africa, and you probably don't know about it because nobody talks about Africa,
2191440	2198440	but it happened in what's now the country of Nigeria, and for the people there, it would be history changing.
2198440	2206440	Now, according to theory, and keep in mind this isn't well documented, as the Sahara dried out around 2,500 BC,
2206440	2214440	but the local versions of wild rice which were once abundant across the whole of Africa became in the northern hemisphere harder to find,
2214440	2217440	so the people set out to make their own.
2217440	2224440	For the record, this would happen more than a thousand years before any record of trade between Africa and either China or India,
2224440	2230440	in fact a full 1,500 years before the first rice was shipped to the port at Alexandria.
2230440	2236440	This was something completely different and totally independent, unique in global history,
2236440	2242440	and the only rice found anywhere on earth that belongs to a different species than Oryza sativa.
2242440	2250440	Basically, we start here in Nigeria, and the area we're talking about is here, the delta of the Niger River.
2250440	2257440	Now, again, this story has to rely on a bit of speculation, but the farmers who first managed this incredible accomplishment
2257440	2266440	were most likely from a group of 16 small clans known as the Volta Niger, who were pastoral farmers and yet were still, according to archaeology,
2266440	2271440	advanced enough that they were smelting metal as early as almost anyone else on earth,
2271440	2277440	and it would take an advanced civilization to have developed this rice because it was no joke of an achievement.
2277440	2283440	It was bred in a way that still baffles scientists, with a dense canopy that prevents the growth of weeds,
2283440	2291440	a faster maturation than that of Asian rice, and most significantly, the ability to thrive in even the harshest of conditions,
2291440	2299440	tolerating bad soil, arid soil, and even no soil at all, growing literally on top of the water in the delta region.
2299440	2305440	When this rice, by the way, was first encountered by European slave traders, they wrote of its impressive nature
2305440	2310440	and described its cultivation as the most complex they'd ever seen.
2310440	2318440	Anyway, just like in Asia, after rice was domesticated, it led to the construction of cities, with the first recorded a place called Ile Ife.
2318440	2326440	It was here that the Volta Niger would consolidate into a tribe known as the Yoruba, who today number almost 45 million.
2326440	2333440	In the Yoruba language, by the way, the name Ile Ife translates to the home of expansion.
2333440	2338440	From that new city, the domesticated rice would quickly spread across a large swath of West Africa,
2338440	2343440	blanketing the coastline and moving inland as far as Lake Chad.
2343440	2349440	It would be this rice that would serve as the staple food for the greatest empires that region has ever seen,
2349440	2357440	beginning with the Mali Kingdom, which would spread from the Niger basin to become, for a time, the richest civilization on Earth.
2357440	2365440	The consumption of rice would also be the lynchpin of the Songhai, the great rivals and eventual successors of the Mali.
2365440	2375440	For a time, there were a number of large kingdoms centered in West Africa all consuming local rice, which again means this story is about to get controversial.
2375440	2385440	See, somewhere in one of those civilizations, sometime in the 1500s, a dish emerged that would quickly become the single most iconic food of West Africa.
2385440	2390440	It was made by cooking rice with onions and tomatoes, which had just arrived from the Portuguese.
2390440	2398440	Now, this dish, which would be called Jolof Rice, would lead to centuries of intense feuds between West African countries,
2398440	2405440	particularly Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, and Senegal, as to where it first actually originated.
2405440	2413440	And when I say intense, I mean this manifested not just in generations of arguments, but in more recent years, cook-offs, articles,
2413440	2418440	and even musical battles with rival songs staking their claims to the dish.
2418440	2423440	In the end, UNESCO got involved and decided the actual credit should go to Senegal,
2423440	2430440	which in all honesty should have been obvious from the beginning because the name of the dish itself comes from the Senegalese Jolof people.
2430440	2437440	But I guess it didn't really matter because in West Africa, there are so many other preparations using rice,
2437440	2442440	including even inversions of the continent's most beloved staple.
2448440	2456440	When you allow your water to boil, when the water is already boiled, then you mix it.
2456440	2465440	When you mix it, you will use something like this to turn it, turn it until it is done.
2465440	2469440	It's very easy to do. Perfect.
2471440	2476440	In a back alley across from the Arab quarter, above a hair salon, behind an unmarked entrance,
2476440	2480440	there's Bangkok's best West African restaurant.
2480440	2486440	It's run by a man named Andy, who invited us to visit to show us his famous Jolof rice,
2486440	2496440	and also how he makes Fufu, the Nigerian staple, not with the more common cassava, but instead using rice.
2496440	2501440	For that one bag of flour, how much water is in it? Or you just know. You don't measure, you just know.
2501440	2508440	I don't measure. I don't measure. But I know exactly how much water is in it.
2508440	2513440	Even if the water is too much, you still add the rice flour.
2513440	2521440	When you are turning it, when you are turning it because you have to put it on fire so that it will be done.
2521440	2532440	When you see that it's already thick, because you have to make sure that it's a little bit thick,
2532440	2536440	then you will keep the reserved water standby.
2536440	2557440	So this is the oil. You add it small, fully small, so that when the customer is eating,
2557440	2569440	because we normally eat with hand. So when you are eating, it will be just smooth and easy because of the oil.
2569440	2588440	Like before, if I have a big customer, I can make more. That is when I need somebody to hold the pot for me.
2588440	2595440	While I work in kitchens for long enough, my hands don't get hot. I don't have any feeling in my hands anymore.
2595440	2598440	As you can see, it's already smooth.
2601440	2603440	So it's already done.
2603440	2626440	Hi, Goosey. The second time we've shown it on the channel, this version is just something else.
2626440	2638440	This is why we are here. Every culture and country that has a history of farming rice in Nigeria goes back 3,000 or 4,000 years.
2638440	2644440	It's such a versatile thing, not necessarily in the climate where it grows, but in the uses of it.
2644440	2653440	To be able to substitute the classic cassava for rice flour, and to keep that textural integrity, it's awesome.
2659440	2662440	You make yours a little bit spicy. I like that.
2663440	2671440	If we thought we were starting to get full, that hit of chili pepper is going to wake us right back up again.
2672440	2677440	Fantastic. Let's try the rice.
2685440	2695440	Here, the texture of the rice is going to be a little bit different from what we saw, for example, at Bondang.
2695440	2703440	When we were looking at the Thai way of making rice, and you go to how rice is served in China, where it's going to be a little bit lighter and fluffier.
2703440	2709440	In this case, because of the tomato that it's stewed in, this has almost a sticky texture.
2709440	2714440	It's something that almost feels like it's like... how would you describe this?
2714440	2720440	It's more like a risotto than a bowl of Chinese rice.
2720440	2728440	This is fantastic, and the cool thing is, again, such a completely different flavor profile than anywhere else we've been today.
2728440	2739440	It just shows the versatility of rice, and the reasons why it's appreciated by people everywhere.
2751440	2777440	The ancient Nigerian rice is today almost extinct, increasingly replaced since the 1970s by the Chinese varietal, for the primary reason that it's more cost-effective, since through genetic engineering it now yields a bigger harvest.
2778440	2790440	But there's a massive legacy of the African culture of rice, not least of which can be found throughout the Caribbean, where the first strains planted in the 1560s were brought from Nigeria.
2790440	2805440	As a matter of fact, more than half of all African slaves were taken from the rice growing region, mainly because European slavers found that it was easy to stock up on food supplies for the transatlantic journey thanks to the abundance of local rice.
2805440	2819440	There are even stories in places like Jamaica that said that slaves held in bondage used to hide grains of rice in their clothes and even in their hair, so that if they ever became free, they could plant their own crop and build a new life.
2819440	2831440	And to this day, rice is found in pretty much every meal from Jamaica to Trinidad and the Dominican Republic, and of course on the continent as well, in both North and South America.
2832440	2842440	The story of rice in the New World isn't simple or straightforward. There are many different points of origin, from European trade to the arrival of Indian plantation workers.
2842440	2857440	There's even a theory, thus far not proven, but also worth observing, that it's possible there could have even been a third domestication event in Brazil around 5,000 years ago, using their own strains of wild rice that grew in the Amazon basin.
2857440	2866440	What we know for sure is that today, rice is a key component in the cuisine of Mexico, where it arrived with the Spanish, which is why it's sometimes called Spanish rice.
2866440	2878440	In Peru, where it also came with the Spanish and where a common dish, arroz chaufa, was introduced by the Chinese in the 1800s and takes its name from chaufan, fried rice in Mandarin.
2879440	2896440	And it's consumed in Brazil, maybe not their own native strains, but there you can find white rice brought by the Portuguese, and also something called red rice, which is the species from West Africa, maybe almost gone from its original home but thriving in Brazilian cuisine.
2896440	2902440	And of course, there's also the United States, and one more time, this gets complicated.
2903440	2911440	The most common version of the stories that rice was first cultivated in 1685 in South Carolina, using rice seed brought from Madagascar.
2911440	2928440	Now that rice was the same that we first find way back at the beginning of this story in China, which worked its way to Taiwan, was brought to the Philippines by Austronesians around 5,000 years ago, and then they would introduce it to the islands across the Pacific, Madagascar included.
2928440	2938440	And it is true that the so-called Carolina rice would become a key crop in the colonial economy, helping drive the domestic commerce that would finance the American Revolution.
2938440	2945440	But there's more to it than that, and somehow, our last story might be the craziest one of this entire video.
2946440	2962440	This time, for the first time ever on OTR, we start in my hometown, Charlottesville, Virginia, in the year 1787 at a place called Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, who 11 years earlier had written the American Declaration of Independence.
2962440	2973440	Having played a role in uniting the colonies into one brand new country, Mr. Jefferson had a conundrum, which is why America's main trading partner, France, refused to buy Carolina rice.
2973440	2992440	Maybe he thought it was because the American rice wouldn't grow in a more mountainous climate, so Jefferson traveled to Italy, into the Alps to a region that was growing its own rice, and despite an Italian law promising the death penalty to rice smugglers, he made his way back to the coast with rice seed in his pockets.
2992440	3001440	Planting this rice at Monticello, he was disappointed to find out it was exactly the same plant as the varietal from South Carolina, so that wasn't it.
3001440	3017440	As fate would have it, he'd receive a copy of a travelogue written by a missionary to Vietnam, who described finding rice of the most perfect color and quality, so Jefferson decided that would be his next mission, to obtain a sample of Vietnamese rice.
3017440	3025440	Again, this led him back to Europe in hopes of enlisting the help of his friend, the head of the French Navy, who often sailed to Vietnam.
3025440	3028440	But what Jefferson found was even more exciting.
3028440	3042440	See, in Paris at the time was the son of the exiled Vietnamese King Nguyen An, along with his guardian, Bishop Pierre Pignot, forced into hiding because of the Tây Son Rebellion, literally the subject of our video two weeks ago.
3042440	3050440	Anyway, Jefferson received an audience with the prince who promised to send him a French ship full of rice on his return to his homeland.
3050440	3065440	But that would never happen, as shortly after Jefferson returned to Virginia, the French pulled back their support of the Nguyen family, and anyway, by the time Nguyen An would win his war on his own, his son had died of smallpox at the age of 21.
3065440	3081440	But Jefferson was now obsessed, and he would eventually receive his Asian rice, not from Vietnam but from Sumatra, delivered by none other than Lieutenant William Bly, deposed in the mutiny of the HMS Bounty and left stranded on the island of Timor.
3081440	3094440	Since Bly could no longer hope to show any success from his mission, which had been to deliver breadfruit trees to England, he instead wanted to salvage something so he scavenged a small amount of local Indonesian rice.
3094440	3109440	After his return to England, he'd present that rice to the botanist Joseph Banks, who would eventually deliver it all to Jefferson with a note informing him that he'd just received the entirety of the ill-fated mission of the HMS Bounty.
3109440	3122440	However, sadly, this rice proved unsuccessful growing at Monticello and also at the home of Jefferson's friend James Madison, the writer of the U.S. Constitution, but still, all was not lost.
3122440	3142440	In the end, the success of Jefferson's chaotic quest for rice started with a chance meeting in 1789 with a young Bostonian captain who'd heard about these struggles and offered to help, this time by sailing for the west coast of Africa, where he said he'd heard of a rice that surpassed all others in both quality and adaptability.
3142440	3165440	The sailor returned a few months later with a 10-gallon drum of rice purchased from a local farmer in what's now Guinea, the western edge of Africa's ancient rice growing region, where he divided it into portions and sent them to growers he'd involved in his quest, including, of course, none other than George Washington, who had just begun his first term as the president of the United States.
3165440	3177440	Now, long story slightly shorter, the African rice didn't succeed in Virginia, but it did in the hills of Georgia, so successfully that it would soon spread across the entire southern region of the country.
3177440	3194440	And in 1803, after Jefferson himself negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, that land, including the Delta of the Mississippi River, would be populated with the very same African slaves who, once they saw this unique red rice, well, they knew exactly what to do with it.
3194440	3207440	And thus a new cuisine would develop, a fusion of influences from the French and Spanish who had previously colonized Louisiana, the new American settlers, and most of all, the cooks from West Africa.
3225440	3237440	All right, so this is not going to be a struggle for the last meal of the day, as full as we are, because this is the taste of home, and I'm so excited for this.
3237440	3251440	And it smells great, like we got the jambalaya with andouille sausage and pulp chicken, and we have the gumbo, which is with seafood, shrimp, and crab meat, both rice-based dishes from New Orleans.
3251440	3262440	And yeah, so usually on the channel when we film at a restaurant that has music playing like this, we have to ask them to please turn it off for us while we film, just because of copyright laws.
3262440	3270440	It really hurt to make that request here, because this is, again, like Dr. John playing at a New Orleans-themed restaurant.
3271440	3286440	Steve Miller-Benn was the last song that was just on, and I have to ask them to please turn it off. But let's give the food a try, and then stop talking, and also stop eating, because there's a lot of rice today.
3290440	3292440	New Orleans food is amazing.
3300440	3321440	Quite surprised to find a decent version of jambalaya so far away from home. It's a little bit sweeter than I would want it, but, you know, that's, I guess, what the local palate wants. It's delicious, honestly, and the sausage is great.
3331440	3352440	As my initial excitement wears off, and I start to realize how much we've actually eaten so far today, and how much rice we've eaten so far today, I think there's about time to wrap this up, both literally and figuratively.
3352440	3355440	I'm going to take this away and bring it home for Daria.
3361440	3373440	Alright, for our last bit of rice history, we return to where we started with that very first origin story, in Vietnam, except this time not in ancient history, but in the 20th century.
3373440	3384440	It's the last years of the colony of French Indochina, and in spite of what we all know now was about to happen, there was no sign yet that the country was primed for a communist revolution.
3384440	3389440	Hell, even Ho Chi Minh was living overseas, where he'd been for almost 30 years.
3389440	3395440	Back home, the biggest concern wasn't one of politics, it was the much more urgent matter of starvation.
3395440	3405440	See, the French had realized there was a big market for exported rice, so they were sending the local stock overseas, and at their factories, they even burned the Vietnamese rice for fuel.
3405440	3408440	When World War II broke out, things became dire.
3409440	3419440	The Japanese sent an army to take control of Vietnam, and to keep them at bay, the French signed a treaty, promising Japan a million tons of Vietnamese rice per year.
3419440	3432440	And then after the two countries entered a sort of shared occupation, it got even worse, with the Japanese seizing even more food while at the same time forcing subsistence farmers to switch to military production.
3432440	3447440	Between 1944 and 1945, a catastrophic famine gripped Vietnam, particularly in the north, and with Ho Chi Minh now back in trying to rally an army, he found a winning cause in promising not political change, but rice.
3447440	3456440	Back by legions of rice farmers, his revolution would pick up support, gain steam, and eventually that would lead to everything that came after.
3456440	3471440	In other words, if the French had simply understood the life or death importance of rice, the entire course of modern history might have unfolded differently, and it's possible, maybe even likely, that the Vietnam War would never have happened.
3471440	3475440	The truth is there are more stories like this from all throughout history.
3475440	3478440	It was a rice shortage that led to the fall of the Khmer.
3478440	3490440	Rice riots brought down a Japanese government in 1918, and India and Pakistan are embroiled in a bitter feud over Basmati, and that's just the tip of the rice bird.
3490440	3495440	If I have one takeaway from making this video, it's that there's no way to properly do it justice.
3495440	3504440	That's the thing about a subject like rice, which is so closely linked to everything from history, commerce, and mythology in countries across the planet.
3504440	3511440	The closer you look, the more layers you find, from ancient China to India to, well, pretty much everywhere.
3511440	3515440	Today, rice is the most widely eaten food on earth.
3515440	3523440	It's grown in 117 of the world's 195 countries, and its consumption continues to increase every single year.
3523440	3533440	It's thrown at newly married couples at weddings, celebrated with festivals across Asia and Africa, and used in religious rituals in the Indian subcontinent.
3533440	3544440	It provides billions of people with sustenance and a source of income, and is both affordable enough to feed a family, and diverse enough to please the best chefs from across the planet.
3544440	3560440	Rice tells the story of cultures, empires, and trade, and it's a story that we're still uncovering, with new research continuing to broaden our understanding of just how important this simple grain has been since the very beginning of time.
3560440	3565440	This might not be a complete narrative, there's so much more we could still cover.
3565440	3570440	More rebellions, and origin legends, and so many more dishes out there for us to try.
3570440	3579440	But for now, at the very least, we can say that this has been our very best attempt at covering the most important story in the history of food.
3579440	3581440	The story of rice.
3590440	3619440	I mean, the concept of food wars is not new, like their stuff like kimchi, hummus, french fries, or...
3620440	3622440	french fries.
3622440	3630440	I mean, the concept of food wars is not new, like their stuff like kimchi, hummus, french fries.
3632440	3634440	Alright.
3634440	3641440	I mean, the concept of food wars is not new.
3641440	3644440	Let me just take french fries out.
3644440	3646440	Ron Burgundy.
3646440	3652440	I mean, the concept of food wars is not new, like their stuff like kimchi, hummus, french fries.
