0	9560	My name is Adam, and for the last 12 years I was a cook.
9560	14000	When Daria and I moved to Thailand and started this channel, it was just supposed to be about
14000	15000	food.
15000	17680	That's it, that's all I know.
17680	22600	But it turns out that when you follow the stories of food, if you just go where the
22600	27840	road takes you, it might change your entire life.
27840	32280	This is a story that I still can't believe or lucky enough to get to tell.
32280	35920	One I'm honestly terrified I won't be able to do justice.
35920	41400	A story of the forgotten people living in Thailand's northwest jungle, of migrants
41400	47920	and refugees and so-called stateless children, of perseverance and survival, triumph and
47920	54880	tragedy and of course, food.
55640	64920	This is our road trip to a town called Sangkla Buri, an ancient village along the Myanmar
64920	70680	border where we came to find the local food, but left with so much more.
84880	95480	If you've heard of the Three Pagodas Pass, the famous border crossing between Thailand
95480	101120	and Myanmar, that's where we're headed.
101120	107200	There's a lot of stuff on this trip that is going to take a good deal of research and
107200	111760	understanding and we're kind of going into a situation that none of us really know what
111760	112760	to expect.
113200	119160	But right now we only have one priority, which is lunch.
119160	125120	This is Highway 323, soon to be replaced by a new expressway but for now the road to
125120	132040	Kanchana Buri, Thailand's jungle curry capital.
132040	138120	We left Bangkok around 9am in a van on loan from an embassy, invited guests of some mutual
138160	143080	friends and with almost three full days ahead of us, to track down the most interesting
143080	150640	food we can find in one of the most unexplored corners of Thailand.
150640	154080	Now the thing about this country is it's a true melting pot.
154080	159400	There are said to be around 46 different ethnic groups making up the modern kingdom and that
159400	163200	doesn't even include the foreigners like me.
163280	169040	Thai cuisine represents nothing less than history, each dish telling a story, the mixing
169040	175320	and blending of cultures and techniques between Siam and the Chinese, Indian, Lao, Malay,
175320	177080	even Portuguese.
177080	182760	But the farther you get from the urban centers, the more the melting pot hasn't melted.
182760	187720	Trying stuff cooked here is like turning back time, a window into a world that used to be
187720	189320	a lot less complicated.
193200	203720	Alright, so the guests and guides and hosts for our trip to Northwest Thailand are starting
203720	208920	to learn quickly what it's like to travel with OTR, the good and the bad.
208920	212280	The good is we eat really, really well.
212280	216720	The bad is we have to sit here and stare at it for a really long time until we're actually
216720	220200	ready to start eating because we've got to get all of our coverage and then you guys
220200	223240	are going to really hate me in a moment because you're going to have to sit here while I try
223240	225880	everything one by one and say, wow, this is delicious.
225880	233640	Vasana, JP and what are a driver who is really upset at me already because he's just slowly
233640	236680	starting to go, you've got to wait, you've got to wait.
236680	251200	Alright, let me introduce you to the people sitting across from me since they're the
251200	256720	reason we're here two hours into a seven hour road trip far away from anywhere we've
256720	258440	ever been.
258440	264440	This is Jean-Pierre or JP and he's been in Thailand since before I was born.
264440	269360	He's the only one out of six of us who's been anywhere near our destination before.
269360	274960	In fact, he's come to the remote borderlands several times in his former capacity as Thai
274960	278720	director of the Asia Development Bank.
278720	284880	And Vasana originally from Bangkok, once Thailand's trade representative to the United States,
284880	289640	for the last two decades focused on public service ever since finding herself in the hospital
289640	295480	for two months, injured on 9-11 when the towers fell.
295480	302120	This is no normal group, and honestly, it's not a normal road trip.
302120	308080	See where we're going is a place called Sangkla Buri, almost 400 kilometers northwest of Bangkok
308080	313760	and right next to the Burmese border, right in the middle of the most sparsely populated
313760	316560	part of the entire country.
316560	321920	For a guy into food history, it's the Holy Grail, a place where some of the first ethnic
321920	327520	groups to settle Southeast Asia still live, practicing cultures and cooking dishes long
327520	330420	lost to the outside world.
330420	335200	But it's also a place with such hardship that JP and Vasana are heading there because
335200	341000	they're bringing a donation from Bangkok's Rotary Club, school supplies, toys, and money
341000	344840	on its way to a school for stateless children.
344880	350900	And into the undocumented tribes in the mountains are here fleeing violence across the border.
350900	356160	Sangkla Buri is famous for its preserved and ancient way of life, but also for human
356160	362160	trafficking, ethnic violence, and most of all, its wild mystery.
362160	365360	There's only one road in and out.
365360	370320	Many of the local people are unregistered and Thai's not the primary language or even
370320	371320	Burmese.
371320	374600	It's the domain of the Keren.
374800	378760	Native to the nearby mountains or brought here as slaves by the Japanese to build the
378760	381680	so-called Death Railway.
381680	387320	And most of all, it's the home of the Mon, the ancient people who introduced the region
387320	392920	to rice farming, Buddhism, and so much of modern cuisine.
392920	399920	Long absorbed into Thailand, outlawed in Myanmar, the majority in Sangkla Buri.
400920	409120	Somewhere in the middle of the Khao Lam National Park, the signal started fading on our phones.
409120	413360	By the time we reached 100 kilometers north of where we had our lunch, the jungle got
413360	414800	denser.
414800	420320	And for a hundred more, we kept on going, driving through forests and mountains, through
420320	426200	police checkpoints, and finally crossing the River Kwee, looking out over a region that
426200	430480	all of a sudden was very real.
430480	435720	The town was dark when we arrived, nine hours after leaving our home in Bangkok.
435720	437480	The next day we'd separate.
437480	443200	Jasper, Daria, and I on our food trip and JP and Visana off to do their good work on
443200	445680	behalf of Rotary Club.
445680	450800	So at a hotel restaurant near the water, we had our dinner and raised a glass to the journey
450800	454960	before tomorrow, starting the real one.
465560	470920	There's an old story that about a thousand years ago, a monk named Tong Su made a pilgrimage
470920	475640	to what's now Myanmar to study under mon Buddhist teachers.
475640	480760	He'd eventually settle here, building a temple in the remote mountains near the River Kwee.
481520	487040	Now Tong Su was known as a healer, and his reputation drew followers, forming a settlement
487040	490600	of mon, Karen, and the ethnic dye.
490600	497040	Today it's a place known as Sangkla Buri.
497040	501600	This part of town, this side of the water, is the home of the ethnic mon.
501600	506120	And before we get into anything else, let me talk about the food.
506120	511040	As I mentioned earlier, the mon were the first to bring rice farming to Southeast Asia, coming
511040	516320	from what's now China in the Yangtze River basin about 5,000 years ago, following the
516320	523280	rivers to the south, first settling the Irrawadi, then the Chao Praia, then everywhere.
523280	527840	Now there's not much known about ancient mon cuisine, that's why we're here, but
527840	534240	there are a few dishes among today's mainstream Thai food that we know trace back to the mon.
534280	539240	There's Khao Kluk Gapi, shrimp-paste fried rice, served with an assortment of meats and
539240	543200	vegetables and based on a traditional mon dish.
543200	548840	There's Khao Cheh, rice soaked in chilled jasmine water and associated with Songkran,
548840	550600	or the Thai New Year.
550600	557080	And most of all, Khanom Jeen, Thailand's favorite noodles, served from the far south along
557080	561680	the Malay border all the way to the old Lan Na Kingdom in the north.
561720	564800	Khanom Jeen was the signature of the mon people.
564800	571080	In fact, the name, while today meaning Chinese snack, actually derives from a mon word,
571080	572760	Hanom Tien.
572760	575000	And it's not unique to Thailand.
575000	578760	The noodles themselves are a part of the cuisine all across the region and wherever
578760	585000	they show up, it's an indication that sometime, hundreds or thousands of years ago, there
585000	590480	was mon influence and culture, an ancient trade route or a mon settlement or civilization
590480	593640	long since destroyed or assimilated.
593640	600120	In Vietnam, the noodles are called Boon, Num Ban Chok in Cambodia, Idiyapam in South
600120	604320	India in Sri Lanka and in Myanmar, Mohinga.
604320	621840	So we actually, we have not arrived at the market yet, that's down the hill and it ends
621840	624600	soon so we need to rush.
624600	630680	But the very first thing we saw was a Burmese lady selling Mohinga by the side of the road
630680	632800	and with fresh Khanom Jeen noodles.
632800	637760	So that is extremely exciting and we are detouring on the way to the market and hopefully
637760	640360	we still have time to make it there.
640360	642240	But right now, I don't really care.
650240	655640	Mohinga is the national dish of Myanmar, a soup made from fish stock served with fried
655760	661520	garlic, chickpea fritters and here, condiments including what I think is tamarind but I don't
661520	666640	know because I don't speak mon and communication might become an issue.
666640	669640	That's alright, we can talk through food.
669640	674840	I might just sit right here because the other customer just left and we're going to chase
674840	678000	this with some water.
686000	689600	This is the first time I understand why all of our Burmese friends say we have to start
689600	695080	every day with a bowl of Mohinga, not to insult the restaurant version of this dish but it's
695080	696800	clearly not made to be a restaurant dish.
696800	702320	This is so comforting, subtle, I would say a lot less fishy than I expected.
702320	706320	Look at him, look at him, look at the namgom.
707000	716800	Plus, what dish is not made better with crispy fried garlic, this is just, it's very, very
716800	717800	good.
725400	729360	With breakfast done, our destination was the morning market.
729360	733680	Open every day from 5 a.m. until about an hour after sunrise.
733680	737520	The early morning in Sanclaburi has a feeling all its own.
737520	742240	The quiet stillness of the remote mountains punctuated with the sounds of two-stroke engines
742240	747240	and people on their way from place to place, with an energy of somewhere both welcoming
747240	749760	and incomprehensible.
749760	755520	Everyone going out of their way to smile or watch us walk by, a warm start to the day,
755520	761240	and also a reminder in case we ever forget that we are very much outsiders.
761240	765160	In the thousand years or so since the first settlers followed Tongsu and built a home
765160	770640	here in the valley, while the entire world has grown up, the Mon language and culture
770640	775400	has more or less remained the same, although for the people themselves it's been a long
775400	780800	and often tragic journey and one that needs to be understood to gain any kind of context
780800	783200	about where we are.
783200	788840	At the time Sanclaburi was established, the Mon were the rulers of what's now Thailand,
788880	793760	having built a kingdom called the Dvaravati, based in what today is the neighboring province
793760	795840	of Supanburi.
795840	801560	For this part of the world this was the first real empire and it was Mon, establishing trade
801560	806720	with China and India in bringing religion from Theravada missionaries.
806720	812880	The Dvaravati would fall to another Mon kingdom, the Lavo, which would gain even more influence
812880	818120	and territory and the Mon seemed destined to rule Southeast Asia forever.
818400	820520	But that's not what would happen.
820520	825600	In the 11th century the Lavo would be defeated in a series of battles by the Khmer and would
825600	828280	become a sort of vassal empire.
828280	834920	The Khmer would absorb Mon language and traditions and people too, enslaving a huge number of
834920	836440	the Lavo.
836440	841280	Then 400 years later the Khmer would fall to Ayutthaya in the ethnic die and the last
841280	844400	vestiges of the Mon would disappear.
844480	848240	To the west this story would be completely different.
848240	853400	Far removed from Angkor or Ayutthaya, in what's now Myanmar the Mon had been locked in an
853400	859160	ancient and endless war with their rivals, the Bha-Mar, the rulers of the powerful Pagan
859160	860560	Kingdom.
860560	865880	In the 1200s just as Thailand's Mon were being crushed by the Khmer, Myanmar's Mon
865880	870320	gained the upper hand, establishing their own kingdom.
870320	875320	As it relates to our story where things really developed here in Sanclaburi as a Mon town
875320	881760	was win in the 16th century, that kingdom would fall again to the Bha-Mar and thousands
881760	887720	fled the massacres that followed and came to the remote jungle lands here, around Tongsu's
887720	888720	temple.
888720	893480	Anyway, long story short, over the border the clashes continued for another two centuries
893480	900080	between the Mon and the Bha-Mar, with the Mon finally routed in 1757, the Burmese army
900080	905200	chasing them as far as Ayutthaya and then raising that city to the ground.
905200	909200	Now it's worth mentioning that since the ethnic Mon had long been absorbed and welcomed
909200	915760	into Siamese society, many of the nobles in Ayutthaya's court were of Mon descent.
915760	921760	And as both Toxin, who revived the Siamese empire in Tonburi, and Rama I who'd built
921760	927280	the palace in Bangkok both had Mon roots, there was plenty of room for the new refugees
927280	930800	to integrate into the new Thai kingdom.
930800	933240	Again though it was different across the border.
933240	938320	The Mon and Bha-Mar had now been at war for almost a thousand years, with the violence
938320	942640	persisting until the British arrived and enforced an uneasy peace.
942640	949280	They carved out a Mon state, bordering Thailand and ending just across the hills from Sanclaburi.
949280	957080	Then the British colony fell, the war began again, and it is very much still ongoing today.
957080	962920	And we'll pick up that story later but first, we've arrived at Sanclaburi's Mon village
962920	974120	morning market.
974120	980640	This is such a cool atmosphere, it's really hard to explain how unlike, this reminds me
980640	985640	of Yunnan province, it's the only place I've ever been where you know you can go deep into
985640	989800	the countryside, at least the last time I was there and you end up finding these village
989800	994360	markets where everything is different, the languages are different, the people are just
994360	1006520	differently.
1006520	1010000	One thing by the way, if you're listening around me, I don't recognize the languages
1010000	1011080	that are being spoken.
1011080	1016920	So, from what we understand, Thai, Burmese are both minority languages here, the majority
1016920	1022760	language is Mon, Korean is a secondary language, so good morning.
1022760	1027000	So there's a lot of languages being spoken that I have never heard before.
1027000	1033640	Yeah, let's go into the market, we have one hour before this since, the dog is literally
1033640	1058400	playing with him and asking for cabbage as treats, that is so funny.
1058400	1075520	This just smells so good.
1075520	1080540	And I just hope somebody comes here to let me eat some of this, Honglei is usually made
1080540	1087280	with pork belly, this looks like beef, but I'm not sure what that is or what the difference
1087280	1091440	is, we've got four different types of bowls of stuff here, there's something cooking back
1091440	1095960	there so somebody's going to come back to this house and let me eat.
1095960	1100800	Here comes our man, he just went and picked up something.
1100800	1105200	I'm not sure what happened when we followed the smell of food cooking to a platform just
1105200	1111120	behind the morning market, but the long story short is that this is not a restaurant, it's
1111120	1116880	the house of a very confused Mon family who probably didn't expect their own day to start
1116880	1127000	with Jasper and I barging in trying to order breakfast, Toto we're not in Kansas anymore.
1127000	1131880	There's a section of Sangkla Burri intended for visitors, a place with at least something
1131880	1136160	of a tourist infrastructure and we figured this would be a good time for us to maybe
1136160	1142440	go down there, to shake off our embarrassment and see the other side of town and maybe find
1142440	1153520	a place to actually sell us something to eat.
1153520	1158120	The walk from the morning market to the quote tourist center of Sangkla Burri is only about
1158120	1163880	400 meters, maybe five minutes up one hill and down another, but here, for at least a
1163880	1167520	few square blocks, the vibe is completely different.
1167520	1173840	A pretty straightforward cluster of optimistic trinket shops, signs in Thai and even English
1173840	1180560	and restaurants serving dishes more well known by the general public.
1180560	1188640	We stopped here for a famous place that sells Joe in Chinese kanji or Joke in Thai, this
1188640	1195360	one with what looks like ground pork, crispy garlic, a bunch of ginger, a soft and semi
1195520	1203920	runny egg, and of course, patonggo, which is what in Chinese you would call yotiao, Chinese
1203920	1212800	donuts if you will, so you should have this with your Joe, but actually that's very good.
1217440	1222000	I never ordered Joe, I don't know why, because I lived in China for so long I kind of never
1222000	1227120	saw the point, you know, this is what you eat when you don't have enough rice so you
1227120	1230800	boil it to make it stretch longer, but maybe that's a little unfair, this is delicious.
1234080	1239200	I have work to do, I've got two coffees.
1239200	1243920	The bridge that connects this mon settlement with the other side of Sangkla Burri is the
1243920	1250320	symbol of the region, the biggest man-made wooden bridge in Thailand and at 850 meters,
1250400	1255680	one of the longest on earth, an attraction that brings at least some curious onlookers to the
1255680	1262400	town, usually after visiting the waterfalls in the Khao Lam National Forest. It's a bit ironic,
1262400	1266880	kind of a metaphor for the region I guess that this bridge only gained attention and the village
1266880	1273200	first saw visitors in 2013, not because of its grandeur, but because it made the national news
1273200	1280480	after being destroyed in a flood, then rebuilt by hand the next year. It's an engineering marvel,
1280480	1286000	each piece of wood cut from the nearby forest and all of it done by hand, no heavy equipment
1286000	1292720	needed. It's called the Utama Nusorn Bridge, named in honor of a mon Buddhist monk named Luang
1292720	1300800	Po Utama, and that brings us back to where we left off, when the British left Myanmar in 1948.
1301760	1306160	We pick up with the Bahmar now in control of the newly independent country,
1306160	1310080	for the record in case you're wondering, yes the name Burma comes from a word for
1310080	1316640	Bahmar, and actually so does Myanmar, both variations of the same term. Anyway, with the
1316640	1321600	mon state now no longer under any kind of protection, an independence movement took hold
1321600	1327680	and the Burmese sent in the military to shut it down, and by that I mean they pretty much laid waste
1327680	1332800	to the whole region. One of the mon villages destroyed within a few months of the end of
1332800	1338320	colonization was a place called Yebu, once home to a population of a few thousand,
1338320	1345760	about 40 kilometers northwest of the Thai border at the Three Pagodas Pass. In June 1949, Yebu was
1345760	1353200	burned to the ground and a local monk, Luang Po Utama, gathered around 60 families and led them
1353200	1358160	through the mountains, avoiding the Burmese patrols and crossing into Thailand where they'd
1358160	1364320	settle their own corner of Sangkla Buri. Now to that point this region was fraught with its own
1364320	1370800	ethnic tensions, with occasional flare-ups between the various different groups, but Utama was a bridge
1370800	1376720	builder pun very much intended, and the land his followers settled was actually in a village that
1376800	1384480	had previously been majority Karen, a place called Nong Lu, a Karen word meaning roofs made of palm leaves.
1385200	1390240	The mon areas in Sangkla Buri were scattered throughout the valley, and the main town became
1390240	1395600	something of a diverse community, with the new cultural center a temple Utama would build in
1395600	1402240	1953. Now that's all on the other side of the water, where our hotel is and where today there's
1402240	1407840	something of a small but reasonably developed city. The bridge itself would come decades later,
1407840	1414480	with construction led by Utama himself starting in 1986, connecting Nong Lu to a village on a
1414480	1421680	peninsula that until almost that time was neither a village nor a peninsula. Everything we've told
1421680	1427200	you so far about the history of Sangkla Buri, from Tongsu's pilgrimage to the death railway and even
1427200	1433360	Utama's new settlement, was based around the river Kwe. It gave life to the region and all
1433360	1438400	through the centuries as new migrants arrived, they'd settle pieces of land along the river.
1439120	1445520	But in 1979 construction would begin on a hydroelectric power plant, which would dam the river,
1445520	1451440	about 80 kilometers to the south. In 1984 the work would be completed and the ancient valley
1451440	1457120	would begin to fill with water, and within months, a thousand years of history and the homes of countless
1457120	1464080	people would be below the surface. Now many of the families that lived in the valley were refugees,
1464080	1470080	undocumented migrants and ethnic minorities, and as they'd lived off the grid, they had no citizenship
1470080	1476320	and thus received no compensation. But thanks to Utama, along with a grant of land from the Thai
1476320	1482800	government, Sangkla Buri came together to help build a new village, a home for displaced families
1482800	1488400	who'd once come because they'd already been displaced by any of a dozen wars and conflicts,
1488400	1495680	both recent and very, very long ago. And that is the story of where we've spent this morning,
1495680	1501120	and the people we've encountered in this unique place, keeping alive a culture long lost with
1501120	1518800	their own history just below the water. Wow. I've never, I've never seen anything like that before.
1523680	1524400	That's insane.
1527600	1530400	It's almost surreal in real life. You know what I mean? You can see pictures of it,
1530400	1536080	but when you're actually right next to something where, you know, it's incredible.
1560400	1575120	It's
1580080	1587120	welcome.
1590400	1619680	We had about an hour left before we'd need to meet up again with JP and Visana to travel
1619680	1625120	further into the countryside. So we asked our boatman where he'd go for lunch if he wasn't on the
1625120	1632320	water and he sent us here to a local mon restaurant just past the mohinga stall where we'd started
1632320	1639360	our day. First of all, tell me what we're eating. What is this? This looks amazing.
1649680	1673520	The specialty here is a dish called hang le, actually quite well known in Thailand and
1673520	1678400	something I listed among my top 10 favorite Thai foods in a video we did last year.
1679120	1684560	It's known in Bangkok as a dish influenced by the Burmese, something that probably came from
1684560	1689840	Myanmar. But this is the first time I've ever known the real roots of hang le,
1689840	1693840	a unique specialty not of Myanmar itself but of the Mon people.
1708400	1729840	Oh my gosh. That smells amazing.
1738400	1749440	Crispy pork, excuse me, crispy pork skin. Everything is better with pork rub.
1751360	1756720	Crispy pork skin, everything is better with crispy pork skin. I did not expect that in a stewed vegetable dish.
1760000	1762640	This is just the best version I've ever had of this.
1762640	1789520	Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you.
1790480	1793920	Now, can he tell us what he just said so that we can actually translate that on screen later?
1796000	1799360	Okay, we just had one of the best meals we have ever had in Thailand,
1799360	1804800	the best hang le curry I've ever had. We have 25 minutes before we need to be back on the other
1804800	1809680	side of the lake. After we cross the bridge, that's where our drive is meeting us because we have
1809680	1814720	plans all afternoon. But I just saw somebody down the road here that's serving on no khao soi.
1814720	1818720	And so we're going to try and fit that in. This is going to be the fastest food segment we've
1818720	1822800	ever filmed, but we can't come all the way to the Myanmar border and not have a bowl
1822800	1835600	of homemade on no khao soi.
1849440	1861600	We got to run.
1872080	1877840	In 1949, after Utama's successful journey with the 60 mon families to Sankla Buri,
1878400	1883760	it wasn't long before more refugees would follow. At first, it was family members and
1883760	1890400	neighbors of that first group of modern arrivals, but in 1962, the trickle became a constant flow.
1891280	1896880	That was when Neh Nguyen seized power in Myanmar in a military coup, and in one of his first
1896880	1902720	moves, his government outlawed the mon language, mon culture, basically erasing the mon people.
1903520	1908320	When the refugees would come, many would arrive illegally, but through work they'd at least
1908320	1913920	earn Thai registration and according to the law, their children born here would become Thai citizens.
1914560	1920080	But that law would be repealed in 1972, in large part because of just how many people
1920080	1926000	were pouring across the long border from Myanmar. This change didn't just affect the new arrivals,
1926000	1931440	by the way, but also many of the hill tribes in the border regions who spoke their own languages
1931440	1936960	and lived separated enough from society that they couldn't actually prove that they'd always been
1936960	1943600	here. In 2008, the Thai government reversed the law again, but since then, very few applications
1943600	1949280	for birthright citizenship have actually been accepted. There's a simple truth which is that
1949280	1958480	the Thai-Burmese border is long. In fact, 2,416 kilometers, about the same as from Paris to Moscow.
1959200	1963440	It's impossible to police and with so much turmoil on the Myanmar side,
1964080	1971120	there are a lot of undocumented immigrants. When a child is born to refugee parents on this side
1971120	1977440	of the line, the newborn is neither Burmese nor Thai. They're stateless, which means they don't
1977440	1982800	have a passport, but also that they don't receive government medical insurance. They can't buy a
1982800	1989760	smartphone, can't open a bank account, or get a legal driver's license. As of 2023, according to
1989760	1996720	Thailand's Health Security Office, there are 520,000 stateless persons residing in the country,
1997360	2002800	and many of them are here, living a life of survival in places like Sanclaburi.
2007120	2008720	Let's see what we have at the convenience store.
2012960	2018640	Can I have just a Coke?
2032080	2034240	This doesn't even need to be part of the video, I just wanted to,
2034240	2036640	I don't like to come here and not support and buy something.
2043520	2049680	It's about 2 in the afternoon and we've been taken by JP and Visana to ride along with the
2049680	2055600	medical worker from Children of the Forest, the organization supported by the Bangkok Rotary Club,
2055600	2060560	on her rounds as she checks in on some of the makeshift communities built on the outskirts of
2060560	2068960	Sanclaburi. This place, the home of about 125 people, is mixed between Maan, Khorin, and Burmese,
2069520	2074640	all living on a remote property owned by a monastery, which allows migrants to stay and
2074640	2083280	build their own places to live for a rent of about $5 per year. Delito, the medic, is herself a refugee,
2084080	2089760	first coming into Thailand from a city in Maan State about three hours away. That was almost
2089760	2098320	24 years ago. Obviously, a lot of people who come here, it's not easy. I'm sure when you came,
2098320	2104800	you didn't speak Thai, or did you, when you first arrived? I can't speak Thai, okay? I'm really
2104800	2113840	scared. I don't have any paper, but it's lucky one of the Thai men is take me with his motorbike,
2113840	2121760	we passing to the checkpoint, but before it's my job is I'm working also the boyapun on the
2122400	2129600	on the what is the hospital, like a clinic near the border. So when we take the patient
2129600	2136560	to the Thailand, we have a border pass, like a letter you can take. So the also the people
2136560	2143440	is around there, they know as I just come and go, so they're not checked. So I live here. Since
2143440	2150160	of I came in here at the Sangla Buri about six months later, I have a paper, not Thai
2150160	2157520	idea. I have a paper after that. Now I have a serial card. There are hundreds of settlements
2157520	2162320	like this throughout the border region and Delito tries to visit each one once a month.
2162880	2168880	More often, if there's an urgent need for medical service, like here where there's a newborn
2168880	2179360	from a one single mother, this scare and then she's a single mother. And then her job is making
2179360	2185520	broom. But now is the this house is not their house. The owner didn't come because of no broom
2185520	2195520	flower here at the moment. So she no job. But since of she have a baby about 10 days. So her
2195520	2201680	mother is people around here contact me, she have a problem, no food, no husband. And then please
2201680	2209760	come and help. So we come and helping her now is her baby dead. Since this land is owned by the
2209760	2216160	Buddhist temple, nobody gets turned away, which means not only is this place known as Frogstream
2216160	2221520	Village, a mixture of languages and cultures, but also of the needs of the people here.
2222240	2227200	For some, it's a temporary stop, a place to stay until the next job comes along in the orchards
2227200	2233680	or rubber plantations. But for many, it's the only option. Among the people staying here are also
2233680	2239760	those who are disabled or look after disabled family. There are single parents, the elderly,
2239760	2244880	people without any other options. In fact, some of the residents living in makeshift
2244880	2251760	housing close enough to Myanmar to hear the gunfire have been here for as long as 25 years.
2253120	2260560	Her daughter is have a polio polio. Yes. Since I was born, he said about one month and then
2260560	2271520	get sick and then like that. But his wife is a die. When she's a three years old, but now she's a 22.
2279200	2287920	This house and then we helping. Helping is when the kids sick. One of the boys is get sick and big,
2288320	2296080	upset and then take to the, take down to the Ratchaburi hospital. And then this house
2296080	2303360	is we have we also also the pregnant woman around here. So she have my telephone number
2303360	2309920	who have a problem and then they worry they can't speak Thai or they don't have ID card and then
2309920	2315760	come and contact her. She have my telephone number. She contact me just before she said one of the
2316480	2321760	patient who have a problem with the leg is a car. No money to go.
2326880	2333040	It's not all despair at Frogstream Village. Many of the children are now students at Delito's school,
2333040	2338000	Children of the Forest, where not only do they learn Thai, but also gain something priceless.
2338720	2345040	A name, a registration, not citizenship, but legal documentation and access to the Thai school
2345040	2351920	system. Hope. For the people living here, there is work. They've formed something of a village
2351920	2357440	business, collecting a special kind of plant, which grows in the nearby mountains. This is
2357440	2363440	the making room. And this is the business here. This is the people in here that that is the main
2363440	2371520	the main business is making room. Okay. And they sell this room. There is a room factory here.
2371520	2376480	And then they're making room here. And then this room they take to the whole Thailand Bangkok or
2376480	2380400	everywhere. Really? Yes. Yes. That is all is from here.
2388160	2392400	This is hard work. You see how intense that I mean this is thick. This is packed in really thickly.
2393680	2396320	I would stab myself right through the hand if I even tried.
2397280	2415360	I have a feeling in the mon language, he's hilarious. I just don't understand anything about that.
2415360	2422640	Oh, he said, uh, if, if you come and buy with the dollar, it might be, he said it's a very good,
2422720	2430320	good for them. If you have like, it's been more than 10 years since I've been back to America.
2430320	2431920	I don't have any dollars. I would love to.
2436480	2443120	So we found we've somehow this still is a food video because even here, even
2443840	2451840	along the Thai Burmese border, in a refugee village, for people who don't have Thai ID,
2451840	2460480	who don't speak Thai for the most part, Mon Karen and Burmese living here on the land
2460480	2465600	owned by a Buddhist monastery, we have still found somewhere serving food. And we have our
2465600	2473600	favorite sticky rice flour and what looks like black sesame doughnut and some squash,
2473600	2479840	which she's giving us with a dipping sauce. As we were about to leave Frogstream Village,
2479840	2485840	I noticed something that caught my eye, a restaurant or more accurately, a snack counter,
2486400	2491600	serving things like fried chicken, sticky rice, pastries and the kind of fritters you'd see in
2491600	2498640	any proper Burmese market here open for business servicing a refugee camp of 125 people.
2498640	2507440	Okay, no Ken, no problem. Yeah, yeah. Please, please, please.
2518160	2523280	I'm sure. Is that what she said? Not done every day? Is not every day people come to film
2523280	2536480	food video here? They're going to be famous for their food, you can tell it is, is they're
2536480	2539200	going to be famous for their food when they're on on our OTR.
2539440	2553840	It was like the best, best franchise we've ever had. That's a good comparison. It was really good.
2558400	2558960	Thank you very much.
2570160	2579040	As we left the village to head somewhere else, Delito received a phone call. It was her mother
2579040	2584560	in Myanmar, letting her know that she was safe as their home village had been bombed by the Burmese
2584560	2591520	military earlier that same morning. It's a fact of life for her living here in safety while every
2591520	2597840	day she worries about her family three hours away. Can you go home right now? There's the border.
2598160	2602400	Can you go back to visit your family and come back in Myanmar to Thailand or not right now?
2603120	2610160	Right now, now is the way it is. In Thailand you can go, but in Myanmar they're closing the road,
2610720	2619520	so have a wall in there. They're closing so you can't go. Even now my mom's hometown is fighting.
2620000	2630320	And here it's safe and then if you if you have like a one-day working, you can buy food right
2630320	2641120	in Myanmar. It's no job fighting, no food, no job, so people is just, just even with all the trouble
2641120	2648160	of coming here with no ID, it's still better than maybe some people's safety in Burma.
2649600	2655360	Safe, safe, safer than Burma because again here is no fighting, right? Even if you don't have money,
2655360	2661680	but only you have to scale when they come and take, you scale again. So if you like,
2661680	2666000	living in the jungle, you're walking in the rubber garden, that is your safe life.
2666800	2669680	That is what the people here around here.
2672720	2677920	So this is, if this looks improp too, it is improp too, and I was just telling your father
2677920	2681760	actually is behind us that my favorite thing about filming is when I don't know what's going on
2681760	2685360	and somebody just says, hey, at this time you need to be here. I'm like, great, that's awesome.
2685360	2690640	It's less work for me. Okay. I've been told now that we needed to be at Children of the Forest at
2690640	2694240	3.30, which I don't even have time to process where we are. We'll do that tomorrow morning. Okay.
2694240	2698640	But we just got here, we changed vehicles, we're in another pickup truck and going right back to the
2698640	2703200	back. Where are we going? Okay, so we're moving from, you've just been to some of the villages on
2703200	2709440	the road. Now we're going off road into the jungle, see some rubber plantations quite deep in the
2709440	2714320	jungle, about 15 kilometers into the jungle. And we're going to visit some of our students that
2714320	2719120	come to the school, give you an idea of just how far our students are prepared to travel,
2719120	2724320	just to get an education. And you'll meet some mothers and you'll meet some patients as well
2724320	2729760	that were helping. So it should be an interesting trip. Amazing. And then I see there's a cooler
2729760	2733600	being loaded into the back of the, into the back of the truck as well. That's right. Yeah, we've
2733600	2739280	got a, we thought might as well treat the villages there. We know them quite well and make it exciting
2739280	2744640	for them. So we're going to, they're doing a little bit of food and that now, enjoying doing that.
2744640	2748640	And we're going to take some ice, take some coke and some snacks for the kids over there as well.
2749360	2760480	Anthony Bourdain once said that the greatest meals you could ever have are the ones you don't go
2760480	2766720	looking for. Instead, life is about putting yourself in a position where they might just
2766720	2773760	happen. Like jumping into the back of a pickup truck heading as deep as the path goes off road
2773760	2774480	into the jungle.
2781200	2784320	There was a time, I remember when I was a little kid, when I could be in the back of a truck
2784320	2790160	and just get tossed around and it was no problem. And now every single bump I'm like in 10 years,
2790160	2791520	that has been a murder in my back.
2791520	2808640	Guys, Jasper, this is going to make a really bad headline if I lose my balance and just crush
2808640	2812480	and crush the kids. That's going to be really bad for everybody.
2815920	2821280	I love how the car is driving so much more gently now that all the kids are in the back.
2821280	2828480	When it was just us, it was like, no, I hope nobody knows that word.
2829920	2834880	I can't swear around the kids. This is why I could never be a teacher.
2839360	2844320	Yeah, I don't know if this is translating to video, but we are, this is just a straight drop
2844320	2852240	off everywhere along the side of the bus. It's just a dead drop the whole way. I'm going to
2852240	2855920	give this back to Jasper because I clearly have no idea how to operate a camera. But yeah,
2855920	2859120	we have been driving alongside a straight drop and there keep being times when
2859840	2863360	they'll yell out to us, hang on tight. This is a slippery part.
2863360	2876720	Well, the car has stopped and we are surrounded by people and I almost forgot that we were,
2876720	2880640	we had a direction. I was just going to keep going and then we're just going to end up as deep
2880640	2883840	as you can get in the jungle and then we're going to turn around and come back and I can't
2883840	2893920	believe that there's a settlement here, but oh my God. Everyone's even kids are laughing at me.
2898400	2900320	My back, what back? My back is done.
2906560	2910240	There are things that you see and experience once in a lifetime,
2910960	2915840	places that open your eyes to a world so far removed from anything you've ever encountered
2915840	2922560	that you can't help but leave a different person. This is one of those places. It's a makeshift
2922560	2926720	settlement so far into the jungle that for six months a year during the rainy season,
2927360	2933760	it's completely inaccessible. The only way in or out a four hour hike each way to reach the nearest
2933760	2941040	paved road, a hike that unbelievably many of the 30 children who call this enclave home make every
2941040	2946800	single day just to get to school, to receive an education and get that life-changing piece of
2946800	2955520	paper documenting their own existence. Our host is Daniel Hobson, born in the UK, but in Sanclebury
2955520	2961360	for two decades. The founder of Children of the Forest, the place the kids here find their hope.
2962320	2967200	Why would somebody build a house here? This isn't just, I want to be deep in the jungle.
2967200	2972560	Are the parents working for the rubber? Are they independent? Are they working for rubber
2972560	2979920	companies? Why does this exist? Yeah, you're right. It's the following work, which is typical of all
2979920	2983200	the stateless families really around this area. Wherever the work is, that's where they'll go.
2983200	2988720	They don't have their own land, their own home, so they'll follow where the work is. And at the
2988720	2994000	moment the work is here in this huge rubber plantation, which they'll be tapping tonight
2994000	2998640	from about 12 o'clock. They'll start tapping and they'll finish maybe seven or eight in the morning,
2998640	3005200	so they'll sleep during the day. And that's every day, or that's seasonal? In the heavy rain,
3005200	3009840	you can't tap the rubber, but at the moment it's kind of the best time of year. That's when the
3009840	3015120	rubber is flowing, the best is right now. So they'll be tapping it for three nights and then they'll
3015120	3020480	take a break one night. Do you find the kids that you teach, or that your teachers teach, coming
3020480	3025280	from a place like this, where they have to... I would guess that somebody who would go to the
3025280	3032160	initiative of walking 12 kilometers, each direction to get to school every day, is going to not be
3032160	3038720	lax with their work. Is that fair? That's a fair statement. It's great to see the motivation
3038720	3042960	just to get to school. It takes them probably about two hours to get to school. And then once
3042960	3046880	they're there, yeah, they're going to take that opportunity to study hard. And we've been working
3046880	3052800	with this village now for almost 20 years. So we've actually seen children that have studied hard,
3052800	3056960	gone through the elementary school, gone on to high school, and are actually now studying in the
3056960	3064240	city to be teachers, community development workers, hotel management, vocational colleges.
3066160	3069920	And what are we looking at real quick, just so we understand, these are all houses around us,
3069920	3074480	or is this like a platform, which I guess is just for communal meals? I don't know,
3074480	3079040	if you can kind of explain to me just what we see, is every building going down this way,
3079040	3087040	a family's home? Yeah, that's right. Every building here is a home. There's a community spirit here,
3087040	3091440	even though, strictly speaking, it's not a village, it's not a community. It's just workers that are
3091440	3098560	on the land, the landowner of the rubber plantation happens to own. But there's a community spirit,
3098560	3103920	and they're all Karen in this area. So these are all, these are all Karen families? Yeah,
3103920	3108320	that's right. So it would have started with just what, one or two families when they, and then
3108320	3112480	they ask their cousins and distant cousins to come, and then they kind of build up a
3112480	3115600	village because, like you said, following the work, coming here for the work.
3117120	3122080	The Karen tribe of Thailand's far west are also like the Mon, an ancient people,
3122080	3127760	with their own history in Southeast Asia dating back at least as far as the third century AD.
3128640	3134720	But unlike the Mon, there is no unifying Karen culture or identity. The Karen are a Highland
3134720	3139360	people, scattered throughout the mountains of Myanmar and Thailand, and as far as the Andaman
3139360	3144400	Islands off the coast of India. And their settlements were built so far apart that in different places
3144400	3149760	they practice vastly different cultures and traditions. But like the Mon, they're also
3149760	3155120	marginalized, and also at war with the Burmese government in a fight for ethnic autonomy.
3156000	3161680	That's the story for the families that live here. Refugees who fled persecution and now get by
3161680	3167040	working the rubber trees in a harsh and unforgiving landscape, starting again at the very bottom of
3167040	3173040	society, completely cut off from the conveniences of 21st century urban life simply because of who
3173040	3179600	they are and where they were born. Like everything else here in the settlement,
3179600	3184400	food is usually based around what can be farmed or foraged in the nearby mountains,
3184400	3190880	along with staples like rice purchased with hard-earned income. But today we're in for a treat.
3191760	3196640	This morning, while we were in the town, Daniel went to his own local market and bought a whole
3196640	3203360	pig, delivering it here a few hours earlier. And since then, a few of the villagers have been
3203360	3210160	hard at work, preparing a true feast, a celebration of life and survival, and to welcome us to their
3210160	3214960	small corner of the jungle with their very best Karen hospitality.
3218480	3223360	So earlier today, some of the guys who we came here with went to the local market and bought
3224160	3228800	some fresh pork, which apparently was just as fresh and amazing as it gets. So then they've been
3228800	3235760	cooking all day to prepare this feast for the village tonight. We have pork curry. This is
3236320	3240480	this is rice because obviously it's all going to be based around rice. So pork curry, rice,
3240480	3245200	this is a soup made from the innards of the pork. So we have intestines, we have kidney,
3245200	3252880	we have liver, and then we have the meat from, I see hoof and I see spine along with gourd and
3252880	3261680	vegetables. And that is going to be hearty and flavorful and very healthy. We have eggplants
3261680	3267760	and we have these nuts, and it's going to be served along with the classic Burmese
3267760	3271840	and got the fish paste. And that's what we have. And I think everybody here is about to,
3272800	3276480	they're about to lose it. If I don't say, okay, let's open the floodgates and eat
3277280	3281760	because this just smells and looks amazing. This is really a feast prepared for everybody here tonight.
3291760	3297120	The pork curry is just dynamite. Yeah.
3305680	3308000	Who is the cook? Who do I, who do I compliment? Who is the cook?
3314240	3319040	I just really want to compliment the chef because the soup is mind blowing how good that is.
3322000	3328960	I just, I just, is this the chef? Thank you. Please, please help me to explain that this is,
3329520	3334160	everything is really special. This is incredibly good that I would be proud to serve this at,
3334160	3339120	I would be proud to serve this at my restaurant. She's embarrassed and walking away.
3343920	3349520	As if we needed one more component for a very, very long and very fascinating day.
3350400	3354160	We were on the way home to the hotel and there's a night market and we,
3354160	3357840	the pickup truck stopped and Daniel said, you know what? This is actually
3357840	3362480	pretty cool night market. You guys should check it out. So our day is not quite done yet. We have
3362480	3368240	one more stop and it's the last, the last part of one of the most really, really,
3368240	3373360	unbelievably interesting days we've ever had on the channel. And I need caffeine to keep going.
3373360	3376000	So let's start with a, with an instant coffee.
3380080	3384960	Just a few blocks from our comfortable beds after a day that saw us start at sunrise on the
3384960	3390400	peninsula, explore the Mont Village, take a boat trip around the reservoir, eat a bunch of awesome
3390400	3395920	stuff and then spend the afternoon and evening deep in the mountains. Well, there's still one more
3395920	3402640	stop. And by now, who cares? We can't get any more tired. So we might as well just keep going
3402640	3409360	and do what the locals here in this amazing town do when their hard days are over. Hang out and
3409360	3416080	enjoy the night market. I am so tired. Oh, I forgot that I'm wearing a hat. That I'm like...
3416080	3423920	Cowboy, Daria, you, you could not, you could not look like more of a tourist. Camera around your,
3423920	3429120	camera around your waist and a stupid hat on. It doesn't, at least it doesn't say Ronaldinho.
3433440	3451840	Look at this. The crispy fried garlic makes everything better. I did not intend for you to
3451840	3457200	take that spoon from me. I was showing that to you, not giving that to you. Pretty good, yeah?
3462880	3469040	Daria, you and I have traveled off camera to most corners of Thailand and there's always a market
3469040	3477760	like that. You're a mess with your camera and your, your hat.
3486400	3490240	I've turned into an ATM. My pocket is literally like an ATM now. We're,
3490800	3496400	just, we walk past the, walk past the food stand and all of a sudden there's just
3497200	3503360	money coming out of my, coming out of my pocket. Okay, thank you.
3503760	3521680	All right, before we get to the last part of this video, I need to go into one final bit of history.
3522320	3529600	In this case, our own, or at least why we got in that van 48 hours ago. It starts of all things
3529680	3535200	with ice hockey. Actually, a video we filmed back in March about a donut shop at Bangkok's
3535200	3540160	hockey stadium where we interviewed a man named Greg Beattie, who happens to be the president
3540160	3546320	of the local Rotary Club. Rotary, if you don't know, is a service organization. It was founded in
3546320	3552000	1905 and since then has grown to almost one and a half million members worldwide with a focus on
3552000	3558000	promoting peace and public works. Anyway, Greg must have been really low on options since he
3558000	3563200	invited me to give a keynote at a Rotary meeting. And after rambling through my speech, I was introduced
3563200	3569440	to a man named Matthew Kelly, a longtime Rotarian and for decades, a famous rock musician,
3570080	3574800	most associated with the grateful dead. Anyway, fast forward a few months and we're
3574800	3580640	filming in Pateya and who walks by but Matthew Kelly. He invites us to brunch and tells us
3580640	3585360	on the channel about an organization that along with his wife has become their personal mission,
3586080	3592480	Children of the Forest. The first time he visited was in 2004, right after they welcomed their first
3592480	3598560	students and that would change his entire life. The Kellys packed their guitars and harmonicas
3598560	3604080	and moved to Thailand and since then have devoted their own resources to the project,
3604080	3609680	including through Matthew's local Rotary Club. When the Kellys first visited Sankla Buri,
3609680	3615200	Children of the Forest was just two small bamboo classrooms set up by an Englishman then
3615200	3620320	in his early twenties named Daniel Hobson. He traveled through the region and saw how many
3620320	3626720	kids living on the margins had no hope, no future, no documentation or Thai language skills.
3627280	3632000	So he cleared some land, built a couple of shacks and gathered a few local mon,
3632000	3637440	Karen and Burmese and sent them into the jungle to spread word of his new school,
3637440	3642160	where the kids could come and have a chance to learn. The first day they opened his goal,
3642160	3648320	his secret hope was for 20 students to show up. They received six times that number.
3649200	3654720	In the two decades that would follow, Children of the Forest has grown into a force for true good.
3655280	3661120	It's a school, a women's shelter, a medical clinic, a self-sustaining farm and it even has
3661120	3666880	a football team that keeps winning regional championships. Last month, Greg called me again,
3666880	3671360	the hockey guy and said that two of his Rotary members would be taking the trip to visit the
3671440	3677280	organization. Would we like to jump in, spend a couple of days in Sanclebury doing whatever we
3677280	3683600	do here on OTR and maybe if we want to check out that place that Matthew and Mary Kelly had told
3683600	3690240	us so much about. And on our last morning before heading back, well that's exactly what we're gonna do.
3690240	3706240	Everything that happened today is out of my hands. Yesterday was something that me and Daria
3706240	3713840	will remember forever. Seriously, and this goes back to every part of sort of unraveling where
3713840	3719920	we are and the people and the challenges and then obviously that's something that connected with you
3719920	3725600	20 years ago because you've been here for that long. Before we get into that story, where are we?
3725600	3732640	Tell me about what we're looking at, what is this place? Just give me the basic rundown of where
3732640	3740400	we are. Okay, well we're in a town called Sanclebury on the time me and my border and this is a
3740400	3745200	special school, a school that was established almost 20 years ago now and a school which
3745200	3752320	particularly caters to the needs of the stateless children from as young as four years old. The
3752320	3759520	children join our school here and from the kindergarten they'll go into our grade one,
3759520	3764480	grade two of elementary school. The elementary school here is a satellite of the government
3764480	3769840	school so the children will get full certificates when they graduate here and this is their entry
3769840	3778160	point into the school education, Thai education system. We're kind of the bridge between the
3778160	3784720	villages, the plantations and the big Thai government schools. Children of the forest
3784720	3791280	sits on about 17 acres of land just outside the main town of Sanclebury and here on the property
3791840	3797680	more than 7,000 stateless children have learned to speak Thai, received an education,
3797680	3804080	two meals a day and in many cases legal residents and access to continue their studies in Thailand's
3804080	3811360	public schools. For a stateless child to be in a position of vulnerability where they're
3812320	3818800	being exploited or being trafficked, the assistance or the response that they get from
3818800	3826560	society is just not the same and of course there are people of influence and power that
3827360	3834640	know how vulnerable and how weak these children are and they're able to exploit that so that's why
3835280	3840480	the first thing we want to make sure is that all the stateless children in this border region are
3840480	3845360	in education so once they're here at this school that's when the monitoring begins you know that's
3845360	3850160	when we're able to know the child, we're able to know their plantation, their village, we're able to
3850160	3858640	know their families and they immediately get this safety net and then they also join the Thai
3858640	3863440	education system which means that they get a student number, there you go they're visible now,
3863440	3869920	they're not invisible anymore, they've got some proof that they exist, this is their student number
3869920	3877440	and their student number is the first step on the way to gaining certain levels of identification
3877440	3882240	which one day can be realized into Thai citizenship.
3885840	3891280	Today there are more than 200 students enrolled at Children of the Forest but that's just a
3891280	3897200	fraction of those receiving their services. There are houses built on the property for women fleeing
3897200	3902480	abusive relationships or single mothers in need of help raising their children. There's a health
3902480	3908480	clinic operated by Delito who as we saw yesterday also travels into the villages and looks after
3908480	3914560	hundreds of others in need. There's support provided to children in other jungle schools if
3914560	3919760	this location is inaccessible and there's even a sports program for local teenagers
3919760	3923600	with the Children of the Forest football team competing throughout the region.
3924720	3927920	Are you a celebrity to them having come from Manchester?
3928480	3931520	Yeah some of them think that I used to play for Manchester United which
3931520	3935520	my football skills are not quite up to that but yeah yeah just leave them thinking that.
3939760	3945360	A few years ago when Daniel's parents retired his mom and dad came over from the UK and built
3945360	3951680	their own house in Sanclaburi and ever since they've dedicated their golden years to Children
3951680	3957440	of the Forest as well. Hands on and contributing whatever they can to a place that every year
3957440	3966560	sees its needs grow but also its successes. Good morning, my name is Faisu so I grew up here so
3967760	3974800	when I maybe eight years old I went here to the Children of the Forest so I started
3974800	3982080	house and went to university and when I graduate I come to help in here.
3982720	3989920	So we had a little get together with the kids last year and we said what would you like to
3989920	3994080	add this term and some of the older kids said we'd like to have music and play
3994080	4000800	guitar so we managed to get a donation and bought some acoustic guitars not expensive ones but just
4000800	4005440	and the music teacher comes in for an hour. He's here yesterday and he's here again this morning.
4013680	4015280	Did you make it? Did you make it?
4016240	4019520	Yes. Anya. What's it?
4020960	4027520	Pea, bean and what is it called? Tomato.
4027840	4034880	Okay. This is Christmas for me. This is the most exciting thing that could have possibly happened
4034880	4040480	to me this morning. Even if by now we'd completely lost track of the fact that we were here to make a
4040480	4046560	food video at least someone never forgot and in between a morning of checking on patience and
4046560	4051760	overseeing the Children of the Forest women's shelter our friend Delito found time to make
4051760	4058640	sure we'd fulfill our own mission preparing us a completely unexpected meal of her own family's
4058640	4061520	traditional mon food.
4062480	4064400	I guess I don't drink but
4066400	4071520	Jay is a local painter. This is. This is a cisney.
4075840	4080400	This is something to say. I want you to try a little you know. I'm so excited about this.
4080400	4092480	Three star Michelin restaurant. You know you have the classical guitar playing in the background.
4092480	4097280	We have the music over there. Yes. We have the home cooked meal. It's very elegant, right? Yes.
4097280	4110080	What did you make for us?
4110080	4117760	Mon food for me is food you guys. Mon, very old style, very old style, true.
4118960	4123440	This is a little bit special for all of you come because in our culture,
4123440	4127280	more and more culture when the people come there so they will come with the food.
4127920	4134560	So cook food and then eat if you lie and you can try if you if you like the taste you try a lot.
4134560	4140320	Okay. If you don't like just try a little. Tell me the name of the dish as you would say it in
4140320	4144320	mon language and then also just kind of a little description. Mon language.
4144720	4171600	Thank you so much for this. This is just an amazing, amazing meal.
4172560	4173200	I'm happy.
4177520	4183360	How do I say how do I know I asked you this yesterday but I'm not very good with languages.
4183360	4185040	How do I say thank you in one language?
4191440	4194880	If you want to say like a very soft one is a tango.
4195120	4199680	After that you just said easy is a tango.
4200560	4204400	I want to say this in a very not soft way. I want to say this in a very tango.
4219760	4223520	Until the age of 10 or 11 then I would have come to the school here. What would you like to do?
4224240	4231280	The life would have been that of a typical stateless child really just no home, no land.
4231280	4235760	So you're moving constantly just following wherever the work is so you might have a few
4235760	4242160	months here and the work seems good but then your employer decides not to pay you so you
4242160	4247280	haven't got enough for food but you hear about work in another town or another village and then
4247280	4252480	you'll follow the work there and just keep moving around from factory to rubber plantation to
4252560	4255840	construction site just no no stability.
4263840	4268640	It's hard in a place like this to put into words what it's actually like to visit
4269360	4274800	but the main takeaway at least for the three of us and I'm sure as well for JP and Visana
4274800	4280240	and I suppose for Matthew and Mary Kelly and for Daniel and his family is that coming here
4280240	4285760	shows how inadequate our knowledge and the usual reporting about refugees and migrants actually
4285760	4291840	is. I mean the scale of the problem is so big that there's no way to cover this topic without
4291840	4299360	distilling people down to statistics to reducing everything to numbers like the 520,000 stateless
4299360	4305680	people living in Thailand's no man's land surviving in limbo with dreams and ambitions the
4305680	4311760	kinds of things that make us human long given way to the simple struggle of how to survive another day.
4312800	4320880	520,000, 4.5 million in total who fled from Myanmar, 5 million people stateless and 35 million
4320880	4327280	refugees if you consider the entire world. It's a massive number but it becomes completely
4327280	4334720	overwhelming when you consider each one is actually a person. These people, the families who cooked us
4334720	4339680	dinner at the rubber plantation or who stay on the grounds of the temple that allows them at least
4339680	4346960	to exist. It's not fair how is it fair that I have the life I have just because I was born in New York
4346960	4352640	into a family with a house and a car hell we had two cars and someone else has to hike four hours
4352640	4358880	twice a day just to get recognized as a person just for the chance to earn what I take for granted
4358880	4366560	every single day food shelter clean water I don't have much I feel like I don't have much and things
4366560	4372320	haven't always been easy but even with my problems I can still go out to dinner or do a weekend at the
4372320	4378080	beach or even have a hobby like playing tennis or running what a luxury it is to have a hobby.
4378800	4391120	When you think in terms of the top line number statistics like 520,000 or 35 million seeing the
4391120	4397040	work that goes on here can feel like taking a cup of water from the ocean it's too much it's just
4397040	4403120	way too much but when you stop turning people into statistics and see each one as an individual
4403840	4408720	then all this starts to make sense and what an honor to have been invited here.
4420320	4425120	When Daniel found out that a food channel was coming to visit children of the forest he had an
4425120	4430160	idea since even though the students come from different backgrounds at its core this is a
4430640	4436800	community we shouldn't leave without at least one last meal of the regional specialty and for the
4436800	4443760	kids one chance to show us who they are and where they come from so the whole time we've been here
4444400	4449760	while we've been touring the school and having our own incredible experience groups of students
4449760	4454720	along with some of the staff who themselves are graduates of the school have been hard at work
4454720	4461520	preparing us a going away feast something for us to remember what it was like to visit Sanclaburi
4461520	4467600	and to spend these last three days experiencing something that we will never forget of course
4467600	4474560	it's conom gene made with banana leaves cut down from their own plantation vegetables from their
4474560	4480960	own gardens and a technique to make the noodles themselves used here in this jungle since the
4480960	4497200	mon ran the kingdom and everything that would come after well it hadn't happened yet
4504400	4507840	do you feel fulfilled is this a life that you ever would have envisioned for yourself and how
4507840	4512160	how is what's it like being you having having this life and having seen the success that you've
4512160	4518480	been a part of creating um i don't think i ever really consciously planned to you know be living
4518480	4524880	here permanently um it's just something happened i just kind of followed what was inspiring me and
4524880	4532480	what i felt needed to be done and had an incredible team around me to to make it happen and yeah i'm
4532480	4538960	happy a lot of the visitors that come here and they think that it involves a huge kind of sacrifice
4538960	4544240	to be here but not really it's uh it's easy to get up in the morning when you're seeing all this
4544240	4549680	inspiration around you um probably more sacrifice will be being in an office in the city for me
4549680	4562880	that would be a real level of sacrifice
