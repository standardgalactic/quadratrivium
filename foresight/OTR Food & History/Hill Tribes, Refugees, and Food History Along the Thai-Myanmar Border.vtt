WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.560
My name is Adam, and for the last 12 years I was a cook.

00:09.560 --> 00:14.000
When Daria and I moved to Thailand and started this channel, it was just supposed to be about

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
food.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.680
That's it, that's all I know.

00:17.680 --> 00:22.600
But it turns out that when you follow the stories of food, if you just go where the

00:22.600 --> 00:27.840
road takes you, it might change your entire life.

00:27.840 --> 00:32.280
This is a story that I still can't believe or lucky enough to get to tell.

00:32.280 --> 00:35.920
One I'm honestly terrified I won't be able to do justice.

00:35.920 --> 00:41.400
A story of the forgotten people living in Thailand's northwest jungle, of migrants

00:41.400 --> 00:47.920
and refugees and so-called stateless children, of perseverance and survival, triumph and

00:47.920 --> 00:54.880
tragedy and of course, food.

00:55.640 --> 01:04.920
This is our road trip to a town called Sangkla Buri, an ancient village along the Myanmar

01:04.920 --> 01:10.680
border where we came to find the local food, but left with so much more.

01:24.880 --> 01:35.480
If you've heard of the Three Pagodas Pass, the famous border crossing between Thailand

01:35.480 --> 01:41.120
and Myanmar, that's where we're headed.

01:41.120 --> 01:47.200
There's a lot of stuff on this trip that is going to take a good deal of research and

01:47.200 --> 01:51.760
understanding and we're kind of going into a situation that none of us really know what

01:51.760 --> 01:52.760
to expect.

01:53.200 --> 01:59.160
But right now we only have one priority, which is lunch.

01:59.160 --> 02:05.120
This is Highway 323, soon to be replaced by a new expressway but for now the road to

02:05.120 --> 02:12.040
Kanchana Buri, Thailand's jungle curry capital.

02:12.040 --> 02:18.120
We left Bangkok around 9am in a van on loan from an embassy, invited guests of some mutual

02:18.160 --> 02:23.080
friends and with almost three full days ahead of us, to track down the most interesting

02:23.080 --> 02:30.640
food we can find in one of the most unexplored corners of Thailand.

02:30.640 --> 02:34.080
Now the thing about this country is it's a true melting pot.

02:34.080 --> 02:39.400
There are said to be around 46 different ethnic groups making up the modern kingdom and that

02:39.400 --> 02:43.200
doesn't even include the foreigners like me.

02:43.280 --> 02:49.040
Thai cuisine represents nothing less than history, each dish telling a story, the mixing

02:49.040 --> 02:55.320
and blending of cultures and techniques between Siam and the Chinese, Indian, Lao, Malay,

02:55.320 --> 02:57.080
even Portuguese.

02:57.080 --> 03:02.760
But the farther you get from the urban centers, the more the melting pot hasn't melted.

03:02.760 --> 03:07.720
Trying stuff cooked here is like turning back time, a window into a world that used to be

03:07.720 --> 03:09.320
a lot less complicated.

03:13.200 --> 03:23.720
Alright, so the guests and guides and hosts for our trip to Northwest Thailand are starting

03:23.720 --> 03:28.920
to learn quickly what it's like to travel with OTR, the good and the bad.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.280
The good is we eat really, really well.

03:32.280 --> 03:36.720
The bad is we have to sit here and stare at it for a really long time until we're actually

03:36.720 --> 03:40.200
ready to start eating because we've got to get all of our coverage and then you guys

03:40.200 --> 03:43.240
are going to really hate me in a moment because you're going to have to sit here while I try

03:43.240 --> 03:45.880
everything one by one and say, wow, this is delicious.

03:45.880 --> 03:53.640
Vasana, JP and what are a driver who is really upset at me already because he's just slowly

03:53.640 --> 03:56.680
starting to go, you've got to wait, you've got to wait.

03:56.680 --> 04:11.200
Alright, let me introduce you to the people sitting across from me since they're the

04:11.200 --> 04:16.720
reason we're here two hours into a seven hour road trip far away from anywhere we've

04:16.720 --> 04:18.440
ever been.

04:18.440 --> 04:24.440
This is Jean-Pierre or JP and he's been in Thailand since before I was born.

04:24.440 --> 04:29.360
He's the only one out of six of us who's been anywhere near our destination before.

04:29.360 --> 04:34.960
In fact, he's come to the remote borderlands several times in his former capacity as Thai

04:34.960 --> 04:38.720
director of the Asia Development Bank.

04:38.720 --> 04:44.880
And Vasana originally from Bangkok, once Thailand's trade representative to the United States,

04:44.880 --> 04:49.640
for the last two decades focused on public service ever since finding herself in the hospital

04:49.640 --> 04:55.480
for two months, injured on 9-11 when the towers fell.

04:55.480 --> 05:02.120
This is no normal group, and honestly, it's not a normal road trip.

05:02.120 --> 05:08.080
See where we're going is a place called Sangkla Buri, almost 400 kilometers northwest of Bangkok

05:08.080 --> 05:13.760
and right next to the Burmese border, right in the middle of the most sparsely populated

05:13.760 --> 05:16.560
part of the entire country.

05:16.560 --> 05:21.920
For a guy into food history, it's the Holy Grail, a place where some of the first ethnic

05:21.920 --> 05:27.520
groups to settle Southeast Asia still live, practicing cultures and cooking dishes long

05:27.520 --> 05:30.420
lost to the outside world.

05:30.420 --> 05:35.200
But it's also a place with such hardship that JP and Vasana are heading there because

05:35.200 --> 05:41.000
they're bringing a donation from Bangkok's Rotary Club, school supplies, toys, and money

05:41.000 --> 05:44.840
on its way to a school for stateless children.

05:44.880 --> 05:50.900
And into the undocumented tribes in the mountains are here fleeing violence across the border.

05:50.900 --> 05:56.160
Sangkla Buri is famous for its preserved and ancient way of life, but also for human

05:56.160 --> 06:02.160
trafficking, ethnic violence, and most of all, its wild mystery.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.360
There's only one road in and out.

06:05.360 --> 06:10.320
Many of the local people are unregistered and Thai's not the primary language or even

06:10.320 --> 06:11.320
Burmese.

06:11.320 --> 06:14.600
It's the domain of the Keren.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.760
Native to the nearby mountains or brought here as slaves by the Japanese to build the

06:18.760 --> 06:21.680
so-called Death Railway.

06:21.680 --> 06:27.320
And most of all, it's the home of the Mon, the ancient people who introduced the region

06:27.320 --> 06:32.920
to rice farming, Buddhism, and so much of modern cuisine.

06:32.920 --> 06:39.920
Long absorbed into Thailand, outlawed in Myanmar, the majority in Sangkla Buri.

06:40.920 --> 06:49.120
Somewhere in the middle of the Khao Lam National Park, the signal started fading on our phones.

06:49.120 --> 06:53.360
By the time we reached 100 kilometers north of where we had our lunch, the jungle got

06:53.360 --> 06:54.800
denser.

06:54.800 --> 07:00.320
And for a hundred more, we kept on going, driving through forests and mountains, through

07:00.320 --> 07:06.200
police checkpoints, and finally crossing the River Kwee, looking out over a region that

07:06.200 --> 07:10.480
all of a sudden was very real.

07:10.480 --> 07:15.720
The town was dark when we arrived, nine hours after leaving our home in Bangkok.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.480
The next day we'd separate.

07:17.480 --> 07:23.200
Jasper, Daria, and I on our food trip and JP and Visana off to do their good work on

07:23.200 --> 07:25.680
behalf of Rotary Club.

07:25.680 --> 07:30.800
So at a hotel restaurant near the water, we had our dinner and raised a glass to the journey

07:30.800 --> 07:34.960
before tomorrow, starting the real one.

07:45.560 --> 07:50.920
There's an old story that about a thousand years ago, a monk named Tong Su made a pilgrimage

07:50.920 --> 07:55.640
to what's now Myanmar to study under mon Buddhist teachers.

07:55.640 --> 08:00.760
He'd eventually settle here, building a temple in the remote mountains near the River Kwee.

08:01.520 --> 08:07.040
Now Tong Su was known as a healer, and his reputation drew followers, forming a settlement

08:07.040 --> 08:10.600
of mon, Karen, and the ethnic dye.

08:10.600 --> 08:17.040
Today it's a place known as Sangkla Buri.

08:17.040 --> 08:21.600
This part of town, this side of the water, is the home of the ethnic mon.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.120
And before we get into anything else, let me talk about the food.

08:26.120 --> 08:31.040
As I mentioned earlier, the mon were the first to bring rice farming to Southeast Asia, coming

08:31.040 --> 08:36.320
from what's now China in the Yangtze River basin about 5,000 years ago, following the

08:36.320 --> 08:43.280
rivers to the south, first settling the Irrawadi, then the Chao Praia, then everywhere.

08:43.280 --> 08:47.840
Now there's not much known about ancient mon cuisine, that's why we're here, but

08:47.840 --> 08:54.240
there are a few dishes among today's mainstream Thai food that we know trace back to the mon.

08:54.280 --> 08:59.240
There's Khao Kluk Gapi, shrimp-paste fried rice, served with an assortment of meats and

08:59.240 --> 09:03.200
vegetables and based on a traditional mon dish.

09:03.200 --> 09:08.840
There's Khao Cheh, rice soaked in chilled jasmine water and associated with Songkran,

09:08.840 --> 09:10.600
or the Thai New Year.

09:10.600 --> 09:17.080
And most of all, Khanom Jeen, Thailand's favorite noodles, served from the far south along

09:17.080 --> 09:21.680
the Malay border all the way to the old Lan Na Kingdom in the north.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.800
Khanom Jeen was the signature of the mon people.

09:24.800 --> 09:31.080
In fact, the name, while today meaning Chinese snack, actually derives from a mon word,

09:31.080 --> 09:32.760
Hanom Tien.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.000
And it's not unique to Thailand.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.760
The noodles themselves are a part of the cuisine all across the region and wherever

09:38.760 --> 09:45.000
they show up, it's an indication that sometime, hundreds or thousands of years ago, there

09:45.000 --> 09:50.480
was mon influence and culture, an ancient trade route or a mon settlement or civilization

09:50.480 --> 09:53.640
long since destroyed or assimilated.

09:53.640 --> 10:00.120
In Vietnam, the noodles are called Boon, Num Ban Chok in Cambodia, Idiyapam in South

10:00.120 --> 10:04.320
India in Sri Lanka and in Myanmar, Mohinga.

10:04.320 --> 10:21.840
So we actually, we have not arrived at the market yet, that's down the hill and it ends

10:21.840 --> 10:24.600
soon so we need to rush.

10:24.600 --> 10:30.680
But the very first thing we saw was a Burmese lady selling Mohinga by the side of the road

10:30.680 --> 10:32.800
and with fresh Khanom Jeen noodles.

10:32.800 --> 10:37.760
So that is extremely exciting and we are detouring on the way to the market and hopefully

10:37.760 --> 10:40.360
we still have time to make it there.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.240
But right now, I don't really care.

10:50.240 --> 10:55.640
Mohinga is the national dish of Myanmar, a soup made from fish stock served with fried

10:55.760 --> 11:01.520
garlic, chickpea fritters and here, condiments including what I think is tamarind but I don't

11:01.520 --> 11:06.640
know because I don't speak mon and communication might become an issue.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.640
That's alright, we can talk through food.

11:09.640 --> 11:14.840
I might just sit right here because the other customer just left and we're going to chase

11:14.840 --> 11:18.000
this with some water.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.600
This is the first time I understand why all of our Burmese friends say we have to start

11:29.600 --> 11:35.080
every day with a bowl of Mohinga, not to insult the restaurant version of this dish but it's

11:35.080 --> 11:36.800
clearly not made to be a restaurant dish.

11:36.800 --> 11:42.320
This is so comforting, subtle, I would say a lot less fishy than I expected.

11:42.320 --> 11:46.320
Look at him, look at him, look at the namgom.

11:47.000 --> 11:56.800
Plus, what dish is not made better with crispy fried garlic, this is just, it's very, very

11:56.800 --> 11:57.800
good.

12:05.400 --> 12:09.360
With breakfast done, our destination was the morning market.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.680
Open every day from 5 a.m. until about an hour after sunrise.

12:13.680 --> 12:17.520
The early morning in Sanclaburi has a feeling all its own.

12:17.520 --> 12:22.240
The quiet stillness of the remote mountains punctuated with the sounds of two-stroke engines

12:22.240 --> 12:27.240
and people on their way from place to place, with an energy of somewhere both welcoming

12:27.240 --> 12:29.760
and incomprehensible.

12:29.760 --> 12:35.520
Everyone going out of their way to smile or watch us walk by, a warm start to the day,

12:35.520 --> 12:41.240
and also a reminder in case we ever forget that we are very much outsiders.

12:41.240 --> 12:45.160
In the thousand years or so since the first settlers followed Tongsu and built a home

12:45.160 --> 12:50.640
here in the valley, while the entire world has grown up, the Mon language and culture

12:50.640 --> 12:55.400
has more or less remained the same, although for the people themselves it's been a long

12:55.400 --> 13:00.800
and often tragic journey and one that needs to be understood to gain any kind of context

13:00.800 --> 13:03.200
about where we are.

13:03.200 --> 13:08.840
At the time Sanclaburi was established, the Mon were the rulers of what's now Thailand,

13:08.880 --> 13:13.760
having built a kingdom called the Dvaravati, based in what today is the neighboring province

13:13.760 --> 13:15.840
of Supanburi.

13:15.840 --> 13:21.560
For this part of the world this was the first real empire and it was Mon, establishing trade

13:21.560 --> 13:26.720
with China and India in bringing religion from Theravada missionaries.

13:26.720 --> 13:32.880
The Dvaravati would fall to another Mon kingdom, the Lavo, which would gain even more influence

13:32.880 --> 13:38.120
and territory and the Mon seemed destined to rule Southeast Asia forever.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.520
But that's not what would happen.

13:40.520 --> 13:45.600
In the 11th century the Lavo would be defeated in a series of battles by the Khmer and would

13:45.600 --> 13:48.280
become a sort of vassal empire.

13:48.280 --> 13:54.920
The Khmer would absorb Mon language and traditions and people too, enslaving a huge number of

13:54.920 --> 13:56.440
the Lavo.

13:56.440 --> 14:01.280
Then 400 years later the Khmer would fall to Ayutthaya in the ethnic die and the last

14:01.280 --> 14:04.400
vestiges of the Mon would disappear.

14:04.480 --> 14:08.240
To the west this story would be completely different.

14:08.240 --> 14:13.400
Far removed from Angkor or Ayutthaya, in what's now Myanmar the Mon had been locked in an

14:13.400 --> 14:19.160
ancient and endless war with their rivals, the Bha-Mar, the rulers of the powerful Pagan

14:19.160 --> 14:20.560
Kingdom.

14:20.560 --> 14:25.880
In the 1200s just as Thailand's Mon were being crushed by the Khmer, Myanmar's Mon

14:25.880 --> 14:30.320
gained the upper hand, establishing their own kingdom.

14:30.320 --> 14:35.320
As it relates to our story where things really developed here in Sanclaburi as a Mon town

14:35.320 --> 14:41.760
was win in the 16th century, that kingdom would fall again to the Bha-Mar and thousands

14:41.760 --> 14:47.720
fled the massacres that followed and came to the remote jungle lands here, around Tongsu's

14:47.720 --> 14:48.720
temple.

14:48.720 --> 14:53.480
Anyway, long story short, over the border the clashes continued for another two centuries

14:53.480 --> 15:00.080
between the Mon and the Bha-Mar, with the Mon finally routed in 1757, the Burmese army

15:00.080 --> 15:05.200
chasing them as far as Ayutthaya and then raising that city to the ground.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.200
Now it's worth mentioning that since the ethnic Mon had long been absorbed and welcomed

15:09.200 --> 15:15.760
into Siamese society, many of the nobles in Ayutthaya's court were of Mon descent.

15:15.760 --> 15:21.760
And as both Toxin, who revived the Siamese empire in Tonburi, and Rama I who'd built

15:21.760 --> 15:27.280
the palace in Bangkok both had Mon roots, there was plenty of room for the new refugees

15:27.280 --> 15:30.800
to integrate into the new Thai kingdom.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.240
Again though it was different across the border.

15:33.240 --> 15:38.320
The Mon and Bha-Mar had now been at war for almost a thousand years, with the violence

15:38.320 --> 15:42.640
persisting until the British arrived and enforced an uneasy peace.

15:42.640 --> 15:49.280
They carved out a Mon state, bordering Thailand and ending just across the hills from Sanclaburi.

15:49.280 --> 15:57.080
Then the British colony fell, the war began again, and it is very much still ongoing today.

15:57.080 --> 16:02.920
And we'll pick up that story later but first, we've arrived at Sanclaburi's Mon village

16:02.920 --> 16:14.120
morning market.

16:14.120 --> 16:20.640
This is such a cool atmosphere, it's really hard to explain how unlike, this reminds me

16:20.640 --> 16:25.640
of Yunnan province, it's the only place I've ever been where you know you can go deep into

16:25.640 --> 16:29.800
the countryside, at least the last time I was there and you end up finding these village

16:29.800 --> 16:34.360
markets where everything is different, the languages are different, the people are just

16:34.360 --> 16:46.520
differently.

16:46.520 --> 16:50.000
One thing by the way, if you're listening around me, I don't recognize the languages

16:50.000 --> 16:51.080
that are being spoken.

16:51.080 --> 16:56.920
So, from what we understand, Thai, Burmese are both minority languages here, the majority

16:56.920 --> 17:02.760
language is Mon, Korean is a secondary language, so good morning.

17:02.760 --> 17:07.000
So there's a lot of languages being spoken that I have never heard before.

17:07.000 --> 17:13.640
Yeah, let's go into the market, we have one hour before this since, the dog is literally

17:13.640 --> 17:38.400
playing with him and asking for cabbage as treats, that is so funny.

17:38.400 --> 17:55.520
This just smells so good.

17:55.520 --> 18:00.540
And I just hope somebody comes here to let me eat some of this, Honglei is usually made

18:00.540 --> 18:07.280
with pork belly, this looks like beef, but I'm not sure what that is or what the difference

18:07.280 --> 18:11.440
is, we've got four different types of bowls of stuff here, there's something cooking back

18:11.440 --> 18:15.960
there so somebody's going to come back to this house and let me eat.

18:15.960 --> 18:20.800
Here comes our man, he just went and picked up something.

18:20.800 --> 18:25.200
I'm not sure what happened when we followed the smell of food cooking to a platform just

18:25.200 --> 18:31.120
behind the morning market, but the long story short is that this is not a restaurant, it's

18:31.120 --> 18:36.880
the house of a very confused Mon family who probably didn't expect their own day to start

18:36.880 --> 18:47.000
with Jasper and I barging in trying to order breakfast, Toto we're not in Kansas anymore.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.880
There's a section of Sangkla Burri intended for visitors, a place with at least something

18:51.880 --> 18:56.160
of a tourist infrastructure and we figured this would be a good time for us to maybe

18:56.160 --> 19:02.440
go down there, to shake off our embarrassment and see the other side of town and maybe find

19:02.440 --> 19:13.520
a place to actually sell us something to eat.

19:13.520 --> 19:18.120
The walk from the morning market to the quote tourist center of Sangkla Burri is only about

19:18.120 --> 19:23.880
400 meters, maybe five minutes up one hill and down another, but here, for at least a

19:23.880 --> 19:27.520
few square blocks, the vibe is completely different.

19:27.520 --> 19:33.840
A pretty straightforward cluster of optimistic trinket shops, signs in Thai and even English

19:33.840 --> 19:40.560
and restaurants serving dishes more well known by the general public.

19:40.560 --> 19:48.640
We stopped here for a famous place that sells Joe in Chinese kanji or Joke in Thai, this

19:48.640 --> 19:55.360
one with what looks like ground pork, crispy garlic, a bunch of ginger, a soft and semi

19:55.520 --> 20:03.920
runny egg, and of course, patonggo, which is what in Chinese you would call yotiao, Chinese

20:03.920 --> 20:12.800
donuts if you will, so you should have this with your Joe, but actually that's very good.

20:17.440 --> 20:22.000
I never ordered Joe, I don't know why, because I lived in China for so long I kind of never

20:22.000 --> 20:27.120
saw the point, you know, this is what you eat when you don't have enough rice so you

20:27.120 --> 20:30.800
boil it to make it stretch longer, but maybe that's a little unfair, this is delicious.

20:34.080 --> 20:39.200
I have work to do, I've got two coffees.

20:39.200 --> 20:43.920
The bridge that connects this mon settlement with the other side of Sangkla Burri is the

20:43.920 --> 20:50.320
symbol of the region, the biggest man-made wooden bridge in Thailand and at 850 meters,

20:50.400 --> 20:55.680
one of the longest on earth, an attraction that brings at least some curious onlookers to the

20:55.680 --> 21:02.400
town, usually after visiting the waterfalls in the Khao Lam National Forest. It's a bit ironic,

21:02.400 --> 21:06.880
kind of a metaphor for the region I guess that this bridge only gained attention and the village

21:06.880 --> 21:13.200
first saw visitors in 2013, not because of its grandeur, but because it made the national news

21:13.200 --> 21:20.480
after being destroyed in a flood, then rebuilt by hand the next year. It's an engineering marvel,

21:20.480 --> 21:26.000
each piece of wood cut from the nearby forest and all of it done by hand, no heavy equipment

21:26.000 --> 21:32.720
needed. It's called the Utama Nusorn Bridge, named in honor of a mon Buddhist monk named Luang

21:32.720 --> 21:40.800
Po Utama, and that brings us back to where we left off, when the British left Myanmar in 1948.

21:41.760 --> 21:46.160
We pick up with the Bahmar now in control of the newly independent country,

21:46.160 --> 21:50.080
for the record in case you're wondering, yes the name Burma comes from a word for

21:50.080 --> 21:56.640
Bahmar, and actually so does Myanmar, both variations of the same term. Anyway, with the

21:56.640 --> 22:01.600
mon state now no longer under any kind of protection, an independence movement took hold

22:01.600 --> 22:07.680
and the Burmese sent in the military to shut it down, and by that I mean they pretty much laid waste

22:07.680 --> 22:12.800
to the whole region. One of the mon villages destroyed within a few months of the end of

22:12.800 --> 22:18.320
colonization was a place called Yebu, once home to a population of a few thousand,

22:18.320 --> 22:25.760
about 40 kilometers northwest of the Thai border at the Three Pagodas Pass. In June 1949, Yebu was

22:25.760 --> 22:33.200
burned to the ground and a local monk, Luang Po Utama, gathered around 60 families and led them

22:33.200 --> 22:38.160
through the mountains, avoiding the Burmese patrols and crossing into Thailand where they'd

22:38.160 --> 22:44.320
settle their own corner of Sangkla Buri. Now to that point this region was fraught with its own

22:44.320 --> 22:50.800
ethnic tensions, with occasional flare-ups between the various different groups, but Utama was a bridge

22:50.800 --> 22:56.720
builder pun very much intended, and the land his followers settled was actually in a village that

22:56.800 --> 23:04.480
had previously been majority Karen, a place called Nong Lu, a Karen word meaning roofs made of palm leaves.

23:05.200 --> 23:10.240
The mon areas in Sangkla Buri were scattered throughout the valley, and the main town became

23:10.240 --> 23:15.600
something of a diverse community, with the new cultural center a temple Utama would build in

23:15.600 --> 23:22.240
1953. Now that's all on the other side of the water, where our hotel is and where today there's

23:22.240 --> 23:27.840
something of a small but reasonably developed city. The bridge itself would come decades later,

23:27.840 --> 23:34.480
with construction led by Utama himself starting in 1986, connecting Nong Lu to a village on a

23:34.480 --> 23:41.680
peninsula that until almost that time was neither a village nor a peninsula. Everything we've told

23:41.680 --> 23:47.200
you so far about the history of Sangkla Buri, from Tongsu's pilgrimage to the death railway and even

23:47.200 --> 23:53.360
Utama's new settlement, was based around the river Kwe. It gave life to the region and all

23:53.360 --> 23:58.400
through the centuries as new migrants arrived, they'd settle pieces of land along the river.

23:59.120 --> 24:05.520
But in 1979 construction would begin on a hydroelectric power plant, which would dam the river,

24:05.520 --> 24:11.440
about 80 kilometers to the south. In 1984 the work would be completed and the ancient valley

24:11.440 --> 24:17.120
would begin to fill with water, and within months, a thousand years of history and the homes of countless

24:17.120 --> 24:24.080
people would be below the surface. Now many of the families that lived in the valley were refugees,

24:24.080 --> 24:30.080
undocumented migrants and ethnic minorities, and as they'd lived off the grid, they had no citizenship

24:30.080 --> 24:36.320
and thus received no compensation. But thanks to Utama, along with a grant of land from the Thai

24:36.320 --> 24:42.800
government, Sangkla Buri came together to help build a new village, a home for displaced families

24:42.800 --> 24:48.400
who'd once come because they'd already been displaced by any of a dozen wars and conflicts,

24:48.400 --> 24:55.680
both recent and very, very long ago. And that is the story of where we've spent this morning,

24:55.680 --> 25:01.120
and the people we've encountered in this unique place, keeping alive a culture long lost with

25:01.120 --> 25:18.800
their own history just below the water. Wow. I've never, I've never seen anything like that before.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.400
That's insane.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.400
It's almost surreal in real life. You know what I mean? You can see pictures of it,

25:30.400 --> 25:36.080
but when you're actually right next to something where, you know, it's incredible.

26:00.400 --> 26:15.120
It's

26:20.080 --> 26:27.120
welcome.

26:30.400 --> 26:59.680
We had about an hour left before we'd need to meet up again with JP and Visana to travel

26:59.680 --> 27:05.120
further into the countryside. So we asked our boatman where he'd go for lunch if he wasn't on the

27:05.120 --> 27:12.320
water and he sent us here to a local mon restaurant just past the mohinga stall where we'd started

27:12.320 --> 27:19.360
our day. First of all, tell me what we're eating. What is this? This looks amazing.

27:29.680 --> 27:53.520
The specialty here is a dish called hang le, actually quite well known in Thailand and

27:53.520 --> 27:58.400
something I listed among my top 10 favorite Thai foods in a video we did last year.

27:59.120 --> 28:04.560
It's known in Bangkok as a dish influenced by the Burmese, something that probably came from

28:04.560 --> 28:09.840
Myanmar. But this is the first time I've ever known the real roots of hang le,

28:09.840 --> 28:13.840
a unique specialty not of Myanmar itself but of the Mon people.

28:28.400 --> 28:49.840
Oh my gosh. That smells amazing.

28:58.400 --> 29:09.440
Crispy pork, excuse me, crispy pork skin. Everything is better with pork rub.

29:11.360 --> 29:16.720
Crispy pork skin, everything is better with crispy pork skin. I did not expect that in a stewed vegetable dish.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.640
This is just the best version I've ever had of this.

29:22.640 --> 29:49.520
Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.920
Now, can he tell us what he just said so that we can actually translate that on screen later?

29:56.000 --> 29:59.360
Okay, we just had one of the best meals we have ever had in Thailand,

29:59.360 --> 30:04.800
the best hang le curry I've ever had. We have 25 minutes before we need to be back on the other

30:04.800 --> 30:09.680
side of the lake. After we cross the bridge, that's where our drive is meeting us because we have

30:09.680 --> 30:14.720
plans all afternoon. But I just saw somebody down the road here that's serving on no khao soi.

30:14.720 --> 30:18.720
And so we're going to try and fit that in. This is going to be the fastest food segment we've

30:18.720 --> 30:22.800
ever filmed, but we can't come all the way to the Myanmar border and not have a bowl

30:22.800 --> 30:35.600
of homemade on no khao soi.

30:49.440 --> 31:01.600
We got to run.

31:12.080 --> 31:17.840
In 1949, after Utama's successful journey with the 60 mon families to Sankla Buri,

31:18.400 --> 31:23.760
it wasn't long before more refugees would follow. At first, it was family members and

31:23.760 --> 31:30.400
neighbors of that first group of modern arrivals, but in 1962, the trickle became a constant flow.

31:31.280 --> 31:36.880
That was when Neh Nguyen seized power in Myanmar in a military coup, and in one of his first

31:36.880 --> 31:42.720
moves, his government outlawed the mon language, mon culture, basically erasing the mon people.

31:43.520 --> 31:48.320
When the refugees would come, many would arrive illegally, but through work they'd at least

31:48.320 --> 31:53.920
earn Thai registration and according to the law, their children born here would become Thai citizens.

31:54.560 --> 32:00.080
But that law would be repealed in 1972, in large part because of just how many people

32:00.080 --> 32:06.000
were pouring across the long border from Myanmar. This change didn't just affect the new arrivals,

32:06.000 --> 32:11.440
by the way, but also many of the hill tribes in the border regions who spoke their own languages

32:11.440 --> 32:16.960
and lived separated enough from society that they couldn't actually prove that they'd always been

32:16.960 --> 32:23.600
here. In 2008, the Thai government reversed the law again, but since then, very few applications

32:23.600 --> 32:29.280
for birthright citizenship have actually been accepted. There's a simple truth which is that

32:29.280 --> 32:38.480
the Thai-Burmese border is long. In fact, 2,416 kilometers, about the same as from Paris to Moscow.

32:39.200 --> 32:43.440
It's impossible to police and with so much turmoil on the Myanmar side,

32:44.080 --> 32:51.120
there are a lot of undocumented immigrants. When a child is born to refugee parents on this side

32:51.120 --> 32:57.440
of the line, the newborn is neither Burmese nor Thai. They're stateless, which means they don't

32:57.440 --> 33:02.800
have a passport, but also that they don't receive government medical insurance. They can't buy a

33:02.800 --> 33:09.760
smartphone, can't open a bank account, or get a legal driver's license. As of 2023, according to

33:09.760 --> 33:16.720
Thailand's Health Security Office, there are 520,000 stateless persons residing in the country,

33:17.360 --> 33:22.800
and many of them are here, living a life of survival in places like Sanclaburi.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.720
Let's see what we have at the convenience store.

33:32.960 --> 33:38.640
Can I have just a Coke?

33:52.080 --> 33:54.240
This doesn't even need to be part of the video, I just wanted to,

33:54.240 --> 33:56.640
I don't like to come here and not support and buy something.

34:03.520 --> 34:09.680
It's about 2 in the afternoon and we've been taken by JP and Visana to ride along with the

34:09.680 --> 34:15.600
medical worker from Children of the Forest, the organization supported by the Bangkok Rotary Club,

34:15.600 --> 34:20.560
on her rounds as she checks in on some of the makeshift communities built on the outskirts of

34:20.560 --> 34:28.960
Sanclaburi. This place, the home of about 125 people, is mixed between Maan, Khorin, and Burmese,

34:29.520 --> 34:34.640
all living on a remote property owned by a monastery, which allows migrants to stay and

34:34.640 --> 34:43.280
build their own places to live for a rent of about $5 per year. Delito, the medic, is herself a refugee,

34:44.080 --> 34:49.760
first coming into Thailand from a city in Maan State about three hours away. That was almost

34:49.760 --> 34:58.320
24 years ago. Obviously, a lot of people who come here, it's not easy. I'm sure when you came,

34:58.320 --> 35:04.800
you didn't speak Thai, or did you, when you first arrived? I can't speak Thai, okay? I'm really

35:04.800 --> 35:13.840
scared. I don't have any paper, but it's lucky one of the Thai men is take me with his motorbike,

35:13.840 --> 35:21.760
we passing to the checkpoint, but before it's my job is I'm working also the boyapun on the

35:22.400 --> 35:29.600
on the what is the hospital, like a clinic near the border. So when we take the patient

35:29.600 --> 35:36.560
to the Thailand, we have a border pass, like a letter you can take. So the also the people

35:36.560 --> 35:43.440
is around there, they know as I just come and go, so they're not checked. So I live here. Since

35:43.440 --> 35:50.160
of I came in here at the Sangla Buri about six months later, I have a paper, not Thai

35:50.160 --> 35:57.520
idea. I have a paper after that. Now I have a serial card. There are hundreds of settlements

35:57.520 --> 36:02.320
like this throughout the border region and Delito tries to visit each one once a month.

36:02.880 --> 36:08.880
More often, if there's an urgent need for medical service, like here where there's a newborn

36:08.880 --> 36:19.360
from a one single mother, this scare and then she's a single mother. And then her job is making

36:19.360 --> 36:25.520
broom. But now is the this house is not their house. The owner didn't come because of no broom

36:25.520 --> 36:35.520
flower here at the moment. So she no job. But since of she have a baby about 10 days. So her

36:35.520 --> 36:41.680
mother is people around here contact me, she have a problem, no food, no husband. And then please

36:41.680 --> 36:49.760
come and help. So we come and helping her now is her baby dead. Since this land is owned by the

36:49.760 --> 36:56.160
Buddhist temple, nobody gets turned away, which means not only is this place known as Frogstream

36:56.160 --> 37:01.520
Village, a mixture of languages and cultures, but also of the needs of the people here.

37:02.240 --> 37:07.200
For some, it's a temporary stop, a place to stay until the next job comes along in the orchards

37:07.200 --> 37:13.680
or rubber plantations. But for many, it's the only option. Among the people staying here are also

37:13.680 --> 37:19.760
those who are disabled or look after disabled family. There are single parents, the elderly,

37:19.760 --> 37:24.880
people without any other options. In fact, some of the residents living in makeshift

37:24.880 --> 37:31.760
housing close enough to Myanmar to hear the gunfire have been here for as long as 25 years.

37:33.120 --> 37:40.560
Her daughter is have a polio polio. Yes. Since I was born, he said about one month and then

37:40.560 --> 37:51.520
get sick and then like that. But his wife is a die. When she's a three years old, but now she's a 22.

37:59.200 --> 38:07.920
This house and then we helping. Helping is when the kids sick. One of the boys is get sick and big,

38:08.320 --> 38:16.080
upset and then take to the, take down to the Ratchaburi hospital. And then this house

38:16.080 --> 38:23.360
is we have we also also the pregnant woman around here. So she have my telephone number

38:23.360 --> 38:29.920
who have a problem and then they worry they can't speak Thai or they don't have ID card and then

38:29.920 --> 38:35.760
come and contact her. She have my telephone number. She contact me just before she said one of the

38:36.480 --> 38:41.760
patient who have a problem with the leg is a car. No money to go.

38:46.880 --> 38:53.040
It's not all despair at Frogstream Village. Many of the children are now students at Delito's school,

38:53.040 --> 38:58.000
Children of the Forest, where not only do they learn Thai, but also gain something priceless.

38:58.720 --> 39:05.040
A name, a registration, not citizenship, but legal documentation and access to the Thai school

39:05.040 --> 39:11.920
system. Hope. For the people living here, there is work. They've formed something of a village

39:11.920 --> 39:17.440
business, collecting a special kind of plant, which grows in the nearby mountains. This is

39:17.440 --> 39:23.440
the making room. And this is the business here. This is the people in here that that is the main

39:23.440 --> 39:31.520
the main business is making room. Okay. And they sell this room. There is a room factory here.

39:31.520 --> 39:36.480
And then they're making room here. And then this room they take to the whole Thailand Bangkok or

39:36.480 --> 39:40.400
everywhere. Really? Yes. Yes. That is all is from here.

39:48.160 --> 39:52.400
This is hard work. You see how intense that I mean this is thick. This is packed in really thickly.

39:53.680 --> 39:56.320
I would stab myself right through the hand if I even tried.

39:57.280 --> 40:15.360
I have a feeling in the mon language, he's hilarious. I just don't understand anything about that.

40:15.360 --> 40:22.640
Oh, he said, uh, if, if you come and buy with the dollar, it might be, he said it's a very good,

40:22.720 --> 40:30.320
good for them. If you have like, it's been more than 10 years since I've been back to America.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.920
I don't have any dollars. I would love to.

40:36.480 --> 40:43.120
So we found we've somehow this still is a food video because even here, even

40:43.840 --> 40:51.840
along the Thai Burmese border, in a refugee village, for people who don't have Thai ID,

40:51.840 --> 41:00.480
who don't speak Thai for the most part, Mon Karen and Burmese living here on the land

41:00.480 --> 41:05.600
owned by a Buddhist monastery, we have still found somewhere serving food. And we have our

41:05.600 --> 41:13.600
favorite sticky rice flour and what looks like black sesame doughnut and some squash,

41:13.600 --> 41:19.840
which she's giving us with a dipping sauce. As we were about to leave Frogstream Village,

41:19.840 --> 41:25.840
I noticed something that caught my eye, a restaurant or more accurately, a snack counter,

41:26.400 --> 41:31.600
serving things like fried chicken, sticky rice, pastries and the kind of fritters you'd see in

41:31.600 --> 41:38.640
any proper Burmese market here open for business servicing a refugee camp of 125 people.

41:38.640 --> 41:47.440
Okay, no Ken, no problem. Yeah, yeah. Please, please, please.

41:58.160 --> 42:03.280
I'm sure. Is that what she said? Not done every day? Is not every day people come to film

42:03.280 --> 42:16.480
food video here? They're going to be famous for their food, you can tell it is, is they're

42:16.480 --> 42:19.200
going to be famous for their food when they're on on our OTR.

42:19.440 --> 42:33.840
It was like the best, best franchise we've ever had. That's a good comparison. It was really good.

42:38.400 --> 42:38.960
Thank you very much.

42:50.160 --> 42:59.040
As we left the village to head somewhere else, Delito received a phone call. It was her mother

42:59.040 --> 43:04.560
in Myanmar, letting her know that she was safe as their home village had been bombed by the Burmese

43:04.560 --> 43:11.520
military earlier that same morning. It's a fact of life for her living here in safety while every

43:11.520 --> 43:17.840
day she worries about her family three hours away. Can you go home right now? There's the border.

43:18.160 --> 43:22.400
Can you go back to visit your family and come back in Myanmar to Thailand or not right now?

43:23.120 --> 43:30.160
Right now, now is the way it is. In Thailand you can go, but in Myanmar they're closing the road,

43:30.720 --> 43:39.520
so have a wall in there. They're closing so you can't go. Even now my mom's hometown is fighting.

43:40.000 --> 43:50.320
And here it's safe and then if you if you have like a one-day working, you can buy food right

43:50.320 --> 44:01.120
in Myanmar. It's no job fighting, no food, no job, so people is just, just even with all the trouble

44:01.120 --> 44:08.160
of coming here with no ID, it's still better than maybe some people's safety in Burma.

44:09.600 --> 44:15.360
Safe, safe, safer than Burma because again here is no fighting, right? Even if you don't have money,

44:15.360 --> 44:21.680
but only you have to scale when they come and take, you scale again. So if you like,

44:21.680 --> 44:26.000
living in the jungle, you're walking in the rubber garden, that is your safe life.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.680
That is what the people here around here.

44:32.720 --> 44:37.920
So this is, if this looks improp too, it is improp too, and I was just telling your father

44:37.920 --> 44:41.760
actually is behind us that my favorite thing about filming is when I don't know what's going on

44:41.760 --> 44:45.360
and somebody just says, hey, at this time you need to be here. I'm like, great, that's awesome.

44:45.360 --> 44:50.640
It's less work for me. Okay. I've been told now that we needed to be at Children of the Forest at

44:50.640 --> 44:54.240
3.30, which I don't even have time to process where we are. We'll do that tomorrow morning. Okay.

44:54.240 --> 44:58.640
But we just got here, we changed vehicles, we're in another pickup truck and going right back to the

44:58.640 --> 45:03.200
back. Where are we going? Okay, so we're moving from, you've just been to some of the villages on

45:03.200 --> 45:09.440
the road. Now we're going off road into the jungle, see some rubber plantations quite deep in the

45:09.440 --> 45:14.320
jungle, about 15 kilometers into the jungle. And we're going to visit some of our students that

45:14.320 --> 45:19.120
come to the school, give you an idea of just how far our students are prepared to travel,

45:19.120 --> 45:24.320
just to get an education. And you'll meet some mothers and you'll meet some patients as well

45:24.320 --> 45:29.760
that were helping. So it should be an interesting trip. Amazing. And then I see there's a cooler

45:29.760 --> 45:33.600
being loaded into the back of the, into the back of the truck as well. That's right. Yeah, we've

45:33.600 --> 45:39.280
got a, we thought might as well treat the villages there. We know them quite well and make it exciting

45:39.280 --> 45:44.640
for them. So we're going to, they're doing a little bit of food and that now, enjoying doing that.

45:44.640 --> 45:48.640
And we're going to take some ice, take some coke and some snacks for the kids over there as well.

45:49.360 --> 46:00.480
Anthony Bourdain once said that the greatest meals you could ever have are the ones you don't go

46:00.480 --> 46:06.720
looking for. Instead, life is about putting yourself in a position where they might just

46:06.720 --> 46:13.760
happen. Like jumping into the back of a pickup truck heading as deep as the path goes off road

46:13.760 --> 46:14.480
into the jungle.

46:21.200 --> 46:24.320
There was a time, I remember when I was a little kid, when I could be in the back of a truck

46:24.320 --> 46:30.160
and just get tossed around and it was no problem. And now every single bump I'm like in 10 years,

46:30.160 --> 46:31.520
that has been a murder in my back.

46:31.520 --> 46:48.640
Guys, Jasper, this is going to make a really bad headline if I lose my balance and just crush

46:48.640 --> 46:52.480
and crush the kids. That's going to be really bad for everybody.

46:55.920 --> 47:01.280
I love how the car is driving so much more gently now that all the kids are in the back.

47:01.280 --> 47:08.480
When it was just us, it was like, no, I hope nobody knows that word.

47:09.920 --> 47:14.880
I can't swear around the kids. This is why I could never be a teacher.

47:19.360 --> 47:24.320
Yeah, I don't know if this is translating to video, but we are, this is just a straight drop

47:24.320 --> 47:32.240
off everywhere along the side of the bus. It's just a dead drop the whole way. I'm going to

47:32.240 --> 47:35.920
give this back to Jasper because I clearly have no idea how to operate a camera. But yeah,

47:35.920 --> 47:39.120
we have been driving alongside a straight drop and there keep being times when

47:39.840 --> 47:43.360
they'll yell out to us, hang on tight. This is a slippery part.

47:43.360 --> 47:56.720
Well, the car has stopped and we are surrounded by people and I almost forgot that we were,

47:56.720 --> 48:00.640
we had a direction. I was just going to keep going and then we're just going to end up as deep

48:00.640 --> 48:03.840
as you can get in the jungle and then we're going to turn around and come back and I can't

48:03.840 --> 48:13.920
believe that there's a settlement here, but oh my God. Everyone's even kids are laughing at me.

48:18.400 --> 48:20.320
My back, what back? My back is done.

48:26.560 --> 48:30.240
There are things that you see and experience once in a lifetime,

48:30.960 --> 48:35.840
places that open your eyes to a world so far removed from anything you've ever encountered

48:35.840 --> 48:42.560
that you can't help but leave a different person. This is one of those places. It's a makeshift

48:42.560 --> 48:46.720
settlement so far into the jungle that for six months a year during the rainy season,

48:47.360 --> 48:53.760
it's completely inaccessible. The only way in or out a four hour hike each way to reach the nearest

48:53.760 --> 49:01.040
paved road, a hike that unbelievably many of the 30 children who call this enclave home make every

49:01.040 --> 49:06.800
single day just to get to school, to receive an education and get that life-changing piece of

49:06.800 --> 49:15.520
paper documenting their own existence. Our host is Daniel Hobson, born in the UK, but in Sanclebury

49:15.520 --> 49:21.360
for two decades. The founder of Children of the Forest, the place the kids here find their hope.

49:22.320 --> 49:27.200
Why would somebody build a house here? This isn't just, I want to be deep in the jungle.

49:27.200 --> 49:32.560
Are the parents working for the rubber? Are they independent? Are they working for rubber

49:32.560 --> 49:39.920
companies? Why does this exist? Yeah, you're right. It's the following work, which is typical of all

49:39.920 --> 49:43.200
the stateless families really around this area. Wherever the work is, that's where they'll go.

49:43.200 --> 49:48.720
They don't have their own land, their own home, so they'll follow where the work is. And at the

49:48.720 --> 49:54.000
moment the work is here in this huge rubber plantation, which they'll be tapping tonight

49:54.000 --> 49:58.640
from about 12 o'clock. They'll start tapping and they'll finish maybe seven or eight in the morning,

49:58.640 --> 50:05.200
so they'll sleep during the day. And that's every day, or that's seasonal? In the heavy rain,

50:05.200 --> 50:09.840
you can't tap the rubber, but at the moment it's kind of the best time of year. That's when the

50:09.840 --> 50:15.120
rubber is flowing, the best is right now. So they'll be tapping it for three nights and then they'll

50:15.120 --> 50:20.480
take a break one night. Do you find the kids that you teach, or that your teachers teach, coming

50:20.480 --> 50:25.280
from a place like this, where they have to... I would guess that somebody who would go to the

50:25.280 --> 50:32.160
initiative of walking 12 kilometers, each direction to get to school every day, is going to not be

50:32.160 --> 50:38.720
lax with their work. Is that fair? That's a fair statement. It's great to see the motivation

50:38.720 --> 50:42.960
just to get to school. It takes them probably about two hours to get to school. And then once

50:42.960 --> 50:46.880
they're there, yeah, they're going to take that opportunity to study hard. And we've been working

50:46.880 --> 50:52.800
with this village now for almost 20 years. So we've actually seen children that have studied hard,

50:52.800 --> 50:56.960
gone through the elementary school, gone on to high school, and are actually now studying in the

50:56.960 --> 51:04.240
city to be teachers, community development workers, hotel management, vocational colleges.

51:06.160 --> 51:09.920
And what are we looking at real quick, just so we understand, these are all houses around us,

51:09.920 --> 51:14.480
or is this like a platform, which I guess is just for communal meals? I don't know,

51:14.480 --> 51:19.040
if you can kind of explain to me just what we see, is every building going down this way,

51:19.040 --> 51:27.040
a family's home? Yeah, that's right. Every building here is a home. There's a community spirit here,

51:27.040 --> 51:31.440
even though, strictly speaking, it's not a village, it's not a community. It's just workers that are

51:31.440 --> 51:38.560
on the land, the landowner of the rubber plantation happens to own. But there's a community spirit,

51:38.560 --> 51:43.920
and they're all Karen in this area. So these are all, these are all Karen families? Yeah,

51:43.920 --> 51:48.320
that's right. So it would have started with just what, one or two families when they, and then

51:48.320 --> 51:52.480
they ask their cousins and distant cousins to come, and then they kind of build up a

51:52.480 --> 51:55.600
village because, like you said, following the work, coming here for the work.

51:57.120 --> 52:02.080
The Karen tribe of Thailand's far west are also like the Mon, an ancient people,

52:02.080 --> 52:07.760
with their own history in Southeast Asia dating back at least as far as the third century AD.

52:08.640 --> 52:14.720
But unlike the Mon, there is no unifying Karen culture or identity. The Karen are a Highland

52:14.720 --> 52:19.360
people, scattered throughout the mountains of Myanmar and Thailand, and as far as the Andaman

52:19.360 --> 52:24.400
Islands off the coast of India. And their settlements were built so far apart that in different places

52:24.400 --> 52:29.760
they practice vastly different cultures and traditions. But like the Mon, they're also

52:29.760 --> 52:35.120
marginalized, and also at war with the Burmese government in a fight for ethnic autonomy.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.680
That's the story for the families that live here. Refugees who fled persecution and now get by

52:41.680 --> 52:47.040
working the rubber trees in a harsh and unforgiving landscape, starting again at the very bottom of

52:47.040 --> 52:53.040
society, completely cut off from the conveniences of 21st century urban life simply because of who

52:53.040 --> 52:59.600
they are and where they were born. Like everything else here in the settlement,

52:59.600 --> 53:04.400
food is usually based around what can be farmed or foraged in the nearby mountains,

53:04.400 --> 53:10.880
along with staples like rice purchased with hard-earned income. But today we're in for a treat.

53:11.760 --> 53:16.640
This morning, while we were in the town, Daniel went to his own local market and bought a whole

53:16.640 --> 53:23.360
pig, delivering it here a few hours earlier. And since then, a few of the villagers have been

53:23.360 --> 53:30.160
hard at work, preparing a true feast, a celebration of life and survival, and to welcome us to their

53:30.160 --> 53:34.960
small corner of the jungle with their very best Karen hospitality.

53:38.480 --> 53:43.360
So earlier today, some of the guys who we came here with went to the local market and bought

53:44.160 --> 53:48.800
some fresh pork, which apparently was just as fresh and amazing as it gets. So then they've been

53:48.800 --> 53:55.760
cooking all day to prepare this feast for the village tonight. We have pork curry. This is

53:56.320 --> 54:00.480
this is rice because obviously it's all going to be based around rice. So pork curry, rice,

54:00.480 --> 54:05.200
this is a soup made from the innards of the pork. So we have intestines, we have kidney,

54:05.200 --> 54:12.880
we have liver, and then we have the meat from, I see hoof and I see spine along with gourd and

54:12.880 --> 54:21.680
vegetables. And that is going to be hearty and flavorful and very healthy. We have eggplants

54:21.680 --> 54:27.760
and we have these nuts, and it's going to be served along with the classic Burmese

54:27.760 --> 54:31.840
and got the fish paste. And that's what we have. And I think everybody here is about to,

54:32.800 --> 54:36.480
they're about to lose it. If I don't say, okay, let's open the floodgates and eat

54:37.280 --> 54:41.760
because this just smells and looks amazing. This is really a feast prepared for everybody here tonight.

54:51.760 --> 54:57.120
The pork curry is just dynamite. Yeah.

55:05.680 --> 55:08.000
Who is the cook? Who do I, who do I compliment? Who is the cook?

55:14.240 --> 55:19.040
I just really want to compliment the chef because the soup is mind blowing how good that is.

55:22.000 --> 55:28.960
I just, I just, is this the chef? Thank you. Please, please help me to explain that this is,

55:29.520 --> 55:34.160
everything is really special. This is incredibly good that I would be proud to serve this at,

55:34.160 --> 55:39.120
I would be proud to serve this at my restaurant. She's embarrassed and walking away.

55:43.920 --> 55:49.520
As if we needed one more component for a very, very long and very fascinating day.

55:50.400 --> 55:54.160
We were on the way home to the hotel and there's a night market and we,

55:54.160 --> 55:57.840
the pickup truck stopped and Daniel said, you know what? This is actually

55:57.840 --> 56:02.480
pretty cool night market. You guys should check it out. So our day is not quite done yet. We have

56:02.480 --> 56:08.240
one more stop and it's the last, the last part of one of the most really, really,

56:08.240 --> 56:13.360
unbelievably interesting days we've ever had on the channel. And I need caffeine to keep going.

56:13.360 --> 56:16.000
So let's start with a, with an instant coffee.

56:20.080 --> 56:24.960
Just a few blocks from our comfortable beds after a day that saw us start at sunrise on the

56:24.960 --> 56:30.400
peninsula, explore the Mont Village, take a boat trip around the reservoir, eat a bunch of awesome

56:30.400 --> 56:35.920
stuff and then spend the afternoon and evening deep in the mountains. Well, there's still one more

56:35.920 --> 56:42.640
stop. And by now, who cares? We can't get any more tired. So we might as well just keep going

56:42.640 --> 56:49.360
and do what the locals here in this amazing town do when their hard days are over. Hang out and

56:49.360 --> 56:56.080
enjoy the night market. I am so tired. Oh, I forgot that I'm wearing a hat. That I'm like...

56:56.080 --> 57:03.920
Cowboy, Daria, you, you could not, you could not look like more of a tourist. Camera around your,

57:03.920 --> 57:09.120
camera around your waist and a stupid hat on. It doesn't, at least it doesn't say Ronaldinho.

57:13.440 --> 57:31.840
Look at this. The crispy fried garlic makes everything better. I did not intend for you to

57:31.840 --> 57:37.200
take that spoon from me. I was showing that to you, not giving that to you. Pretty good, yeah?

57:42.880 --> 57:49.040
Daria, you and I have traveled off camera to most corners of Thailand and there's always a market

57:49.040 --> 57:57.760
like that. You're a mess with your camera and your, your hat.

58:06.400 --> 58:10.240
I've turned into an ATM. My pocket is literally like an ATM now. We're,

58:10.800 --> 58:16.400
just, we walk past the, walk past the food stand and all of a sudden there's just

58:17.200 --> 58:23.360
money coming out of my, coming out of my pocket. Okay, thank you.

58:23.760 --> 58:41.680
All right, before we get to the last part of this video, I need to go into one final bit of history.

58:42.320 --> 58:49.600
In this case, our own, or at least why we got in that van 48 hours ago. It starts of all things

58:49.680 --> 58:55.200
with ice hockey. Actually, a video we filmed back in March about a donut shop at Bangkok's

58:55.200 --> 59:00.160
hockey stadium where we interviewed a man named Greg Beattie, who happens to be the president

59:00.160 --> 59:06.320
of the local Rotary Club. Rotary, if you don't know, is a service organization. It was founded in

59:06.320 --> 59:12.000
1905 and since then has grown to almost one and a half million members worldwide with a focus on

59:12.000 --> 59:18.000
promoting peace and public works. Anyway, Greg must have been really low on options since he

59:18.000 --> 59:23.200
invited me to give a keynote at a Rotary meeting. And after rambling through my speech, I was introduced

59:23.200 --> 59:29.440
to a man named Matthew Kelly, a longtime Rotarian and for decades, a famous rock musician,

59:30.080 --> 59:34.800
most associated with the grateful dead. Anyway, fast forward a few months and we're

59:34.800 --> 59:40.640
filming in Pateya and who walks by but Matthew Kelly. He invites us to brunch and tells us

59:40.640 --> 59:45.360
on the channel about an organization that along with his wife has become their personal mission,

59:46.080 --> 59:52.480
Children of the Forest. The first time he visited was in 2004, right after they welcomed their first

59:52.480 --> 59:58.560
students and that would change his entire life. The Kellys packed their guitars and harmonicas

59:58.560 --> 01:00:04.080
and moved to Thailand and since then have devoted their own resources to the project,

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:09.680
including through Matthew's local Rotary Club. When the Kellys first visited Sankla Buri,

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:15.200
Children of the Forest was just two small bamboo classrooms set up by an Englishman then

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:20.320
in his early twenties named Daniel Hobson. He traveled through the region and saw how many

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:26.720
kids living on the margins had no hope, no future, no documentation or Thai language skills.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.000
So he cleared some land, built a couple of shacks and gathered a few local mon,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.440
Karen and Burmese and sent them into the jungle to spread word of his new school,

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:42.160
where the kids could come and have a chance to learn. The first day they opened his goal,

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:48.320
his secret hope was for 20 students to show up. They received six times that number.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:54.720
In the two decades that would follow, Children of the Forest has grown into a force for true good.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:01.120
It's a school, a women's shelter, a medical clinic, a self-sustaining farm and it even has

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.880
a football team that keeps winning regional championships. Last month, Greg called me again,

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.360
the hockey guy and said that two of his Rotary members would be taking the trip to visit the

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.280
organization. Would we like to jump in, spend a couple of days in Sanclebury doing whatever we

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:23.600
do here on OTR and maybe if we want to check out that place that Matthew and Mary Kelly had told

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:30.240
us so much about. And on our last morning before heading back, well that's exactly what we're gonna do.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:46.240
Everything that happened today is out of my hands. Yesterday was something that me and Daria

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:53.840
will remember forever. Seriously, and this goes back to every part of sort of unraveling where

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.920
we are and the people and the challenges and then obviously that's something that connected with you

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:05.600
20 years ago because you've been here for that long. Before we get into that story, where are we?

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:12.640
Tell me about what we're looking at, what is this place? Just give me the basic rundown of where

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:20.400
we are. Okay, well we're in a town called Sanclebury on the time me and my border and this is a

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.200
special school, a school that was established almost 20 years ago now and a school which

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:32.320
particularly caters to the needs of the stateless children from as young as four years old. The

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:39.520
children join our school here and from the kindergarten they'll go into our grade one,

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.480
grade two of elementary school. The elementary school here is a satellite of the government

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:49.840
school so the children will get full certificates when they graduate here and this is their entry

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:58.160
point into the school education, Thai education system. We're kind of the bridge between the

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:04.720
villages, the plantations and the big Thai government schools. Children of the forest

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:11.280
sits on about 17 acres of land just outside the main town of Sanclebury and here on the property

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:17.680
more than 7,000 stateless children have learned to speak Thai, received an education,

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:24.080
two meals a day and in many cases legal residents and access to continue their studies in Thailand's

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:31.360
public schools. For a stateless child to be in a position of vulnerability where they're

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:38.800
being exploited or being trafficked, the assistance or the response that they get from

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:46.560
society is just not the same and of course there are people of influence and power that

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:54.640
know how vulnerable and how weak these children are and they're able to exploit that so that's why

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.480
the first thing we want to make sure is that all the stateless children in this border region are

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.360
in education so once they're here at this school that's when the monitoring begins you know that's

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.160
when we're able to know the child, we're able to know their plantation, their village, we're able to

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:18.640
know their families and they immediately get this safety net and then they also join the Thai

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:23.440
education system which means that they get a student number, there you go they're visible now,

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:29.920
they're not invisible anymore, they've got some proof that they exist, this is their student number

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:37.440
and their student number is the first step on the way to gaining certain levels of identification

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:42.240
which one day can be realized into Thai citizenship.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:51.280
Today there are more than 200 students enrolled at Children of the Forest but that's just a

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:57.200
fraction of those receiving their services. There are houses built on the property for women fleeing

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:02.480
abusive relationships or single mothers in need of help raising their children. There's a health

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:08.480
clinic operated by Delito who as we saw yesterday also travels into the villages and looks after

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:14.560
hundreds of others in need. There's support provided to children in other jungle schools if

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:19.760
this location is inaccessible and there's even a sports program for local teenagers

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:23.600
with the Children of the Forest football team competing throughout the region.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.920
Are you a celebrity to them having come from Manchester?

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.520
Yeah some of them think that I used to play for Manchester United which

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:35.520
my football skills are not quite up to that but yeah yeah just leave them thinking that.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:45.360
A few years ago when Daniel's parents retired his mom and dad came over from the UK and built

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:51.680
their own house in Sanclaburi and ever since they've dedicated their golden years to Children

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:57.440
of the Forest as well. Hands on and contributing whatever they can to a place that every year

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:06.560
sees its needs grow but also its successes. Good morning, my name is Faisu so I grew up here so

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:14.800
when I maybe eight years old I went here to the Children of the Forest so I started

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:22.080
house and went to university and when I graduate I come to help in here.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:29.920
So we had a little get together with the kids last year and we said what would you like to

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.080
add this term and some of the older kids said we'd like to have music and play

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:40.800
guitar so we managed to get a donation and bought some acoustic guitars not expensive ones but just

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:45.440
and the music teacher comes in for an hour. He's here yesterday and he's here again this morning.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.280
Did you make it? Did you make it?

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.520
Yes. Anya. What's it?

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:07.520
Pea, bean and what is it called? Tomato.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:14.880
Okay. This is Christmas for me. This is the most exciting thing that could have possibly happened

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:20.480
to me this morning. Even if by now we'd completely lost track of the fact that we were here to make a

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:26.560
food video at least someone never forgot and in between a morning of checking on patience and

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:31.760
overseeing the Children of the Forest women's shelter our friend Delito found time to make

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:38.640
sure we'd fulfill our own mission preparing us a completely unexpected meal of her own family's

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.520
traditional mon food.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.400
I guess I don't drink but

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:51.520
Jay is a local painter. This is. This is a cisney.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:00.400
This is something to say. I want you to try a little you know. I'm so excited about this.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:12.480
Three star Michelin restaurant. You know you have the classical guitar playing in the background.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.280
We have the music over there. Yes. We have the home cooked meal. It's very elegant, right? Yes.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:30.080
What did you make for us?

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:37.760
Mon food for me is food you guys. Mon, very old style, very old style, true.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:43.440
This is a little bit special for all of you come because in our culture,

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:47.280
more and more culture when the people come there so they will come with the food.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:54.560
So cook food and then eat if you lie and you can try if you if you like the taste you try a lot.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.320
Okay. If you don't like just try a little. Tell me the name of the dish as you would say it in

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:04.320
mon language and then also just kind of a little description. Mon language.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:31.600
Thank you so much for this. This is just an amazing, amazing meal.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.200
I'm happy.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:43.360
How do I say how do I know I asked you this yesterday but I'm not very good with languages.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.040
How do I say thank you in one language?

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.880
If you want to say like a very soft one is a tango.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:59.680
After that you just said easy is a tango.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.400
I want to say this in a very not soft way. I want to say this in a very tango.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:23.520
Until the age of 10 or 11 then I would have come to the school here. What would you like to do?

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:31.280
The life would have been that of a typical stateless child really just no home, no land.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.760
So you're moving constantly just following wherever the work is so you might have a few

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:42.160
months here and the work seems good but then your employer decides not to pay you so you

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:47.280
haven't got enough for food but you hear about work in another town or another village and then

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:52.480
you'll follow the work there and just keep moving around from factory to rubber plantation to

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.840
construction site just no no stability.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.640
It's hard in a place like this to put into words what it's actually like to visit

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:14.800
but the main takeaway at least for the three of us and I'm sure as well for JP and Visana

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:20.240
and I suppose for Matthew and Mary Kelly and for Daniel and his family is that coming here

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:25.760
shows how inadequate our knowledge and the usual reporting about refugees and migrants actually

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:31.840
is. I mean the scale of the problem is so big that there's no way to cover this topic without

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:39.360
distilling people down to statistics to reducing everything to numbers like the 520,000 stateless

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:45.680
people living in Thailand's no man's land surviving in limbo with dreams and ambitions the

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:51.760
kinds of things that make us human long given way to the simple struggle of how to survive another day.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:12:00.880
520,000, 4.5 million in total who fled from Myanmar, 5 million people stateless and 35 million

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:07.280
refugees if you consider the entire world. It's a massive number but it becomes completely

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:14.720
overwhelming when you consider each one is actually a person. These people, the families who cooked us

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:19.680
dinner at the rubber plantation or who stay on the grounds of the temple that allows them at least

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:26.960
to exist. It's not fair how is it fair that I have the life I have just because I was born in New York

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.640
into a family with a house and a car hell we had two cars and someone else has to hike four hours

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.880
twice a day just to get recognized as a person just for the chance to earn what I take for granted

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:46.560
every single day food shelter clean water I don't have much I feel like I don't have much and things

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:52.320
haven't always been easy but even with my problems I can still go out to dinner or do a weekend at the

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:58.080
beach or even have a hobby like playing tennis or running what a luxury it is to have a hobby.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:11.120
When you think in terms of the top line number statistics like 520,000 or 35 million seeing the

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:17.040
work that goes on here can feel like taking a cup of water from the ocean it's too much it's just

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:23.120
way too much but when you stop turning people into statistics and see each one as an individual

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:28.720
then all this starts to make sense and what an honor to have been invited here.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.120
When Daniel found out that a food channel was coming to visit children of the forest he had an

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:50.160
idea since even though the students come from different backgrounds at its core this is a

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:56.800
community we shouldn't leave without at least one last meal of the regional specialty and for the

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:03.760
kids one chance to show us who they are and where they come from so the whole time we've been here

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.760
while we've been touring the school and having our own incredible experience groups of students

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.720
along with some of the staff who themselves are graduates of the school have been hard at work

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:21.520
preparing us a going away feast something for us to remember what it was like to visit Sanclaburi

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:27.600
and to spend these last three days experiencing something that we will never forget of course

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:34.560
it's conom gene made with banana leaves cut down from their own plantation vegetables from their

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:40.960
own gardens and a technique to make the noodles themselves used here in this jungle since the

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:57.200
mon ran the kingdom and everything that would come after well it hadn't happened yet

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.840
do you feel fulfilled is this a life that you ever would have envisioned for yourself and how

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.160
how is what's it like being you having having this life and having seen the success that you've

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:18.480
been a part of creating um i don't think i ever really consciously planned to you know be living

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:24.880
here permanently um it's just something happened i just kind of followed what was inspiring me and

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:32.480
what i felt needed to be done and had an incredible team around me to to make it happen and yeah i'm

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:38.960
happy a lot of the visitors that come here and they think that it involves a huge kind of sacrifice

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:44.240
to be here but not really it's uh it's easy to get up in the morning when you're seeing all this

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:49.680
inspiration around you um probably more sacrifice will be being in an office in the city for me

01:15:49.680 --> 01:16:02.880
that would be a real level of sacrifice

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:12.960
