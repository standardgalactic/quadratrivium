1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,260
I probably don't need to tell you what this is.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:11,620
Half of the people on this planet eat at least a bowl of it every single day.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,580
Rice is the staple for civilizations from Southeast Asia to the Caribbean, China to

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,700
West Africa, and wherever it's grown it doesn't just provide nutrition, it forms the backbone

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,900
of entire culinary cultures.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,180
This simple grain has built empires, led to the establishment of cities and been the cause

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:35,540
of everything from diplomatic feuds to full-on warps.

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,140
Its cultivation was the single most important moment in the history of agriculture and yet

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,920
somehow it manages to be everywhere and still overlooked, taken for granted, never given

10
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,800
the credit it's actually due.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,160
So today on OTR we're out to change that, to trace its incredible path and wade into

12
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,320
its long and often controversial history, and of course, to try some of the best versions

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,080
of the world's most ancient and enduring rice dishes.

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:19,640
This is the story of rice.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,640
There's a legend told in the villages of Vietnam that a very long time ago there were

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,800
no such things as grains of rice.

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,200
Instead every night rice would grow to the size of basketballs and each morning, piles

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,400
of them would proudly roll themselves towards every house and wade outside the front door

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,240
for the family to wake up, ready to eat.

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,840
Humans thanks to rice had everything they needed, and all rice asked in exchange was

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,000
a little bit of gratitude, a simple thank you in the form of some decorations left outside

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,160
to show appreciation.

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,040
So the people would decorate their houses with tributes to the friendly rice, but one

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,780
night a farmer ate too much and fell asleep, forgetting to display his sacred shrine.

25
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,040
To the rice gods this was a sign that humans had begun to take their bounty for granted,

26
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,400
so in anger they shrunk down to a tiny size and decided to stay put out in the fields.

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,360
From then on wherever rice would grow it would be up to the farmers to do the work themselves

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,040
or go hungry.

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,120
This is just one of the countless origin stories and legends about the creation of rice, found

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,560
in the oral histories of cultures from one side of the planet to the other, because for

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,320
so much of the world, wherever you find life, well if you go back far enough, you find rice.

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,280
Since the beginning of time in this part of the world rice has been everything, the very

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,120
foundation of society and the staple crop that allowed cities to form and caused empires

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,520
to rise and fall.

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,400
Day across the planet, 14% of every crop pulled from the ground is a rice stalk, and if you

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,360
put all the rice fields together, it would make the 13th largest country on earth.

37
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,160
A billion people on this planet make a living from planting, harvesting, packing, shipping

38
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,880
or selling rice, from Asia to the Americas and almost everywhere in between, with the

39
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,520
plant itself cultivated from the lowest points below sea level to the mountains of the Himalayas.

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,640
It can be grown on water, in the fields or even high up in the mountains.

41
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,200
Where there is rice, there are people.

42
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040
Throughout history, the rice plant has been used to make clothes and insulation, paper

43
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,120
and even particle board.

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,840
In ancient Korea, it was used as currency for paying taxes and today it might even rescue

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
your cell phone.

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,400
Rice is used for preservation, for adding strength to concrete and for fermenting into

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,900
alcohol.

48
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:50,140
But of course, most of all, it's used as food, with as much as half of the world's population

49
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,800
consuming at least a bowl of rice every single day.

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,160
Now alright, this is a story about history and as hard as it might be to fathom, there

51
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,040
is always a first.

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,200
In this case someone, somewhere, who became the first person to ever plant and cook some

53
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,600
rice, the tiny act that would change everything.

54
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,480
That's usually how these videos begin, but let me issue a caveat.

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,300
Finding origins is always going to be complicated, not necessarily because the evidence is hard

56
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,500
to follow.

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,100
If you cut through the nonsense, there's usually a decent trail you can follow that

58
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,540
leads somewhere before anywhere else.

59
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,860
But the problem when it comes to rice is how much nonsense there actually is, mainly because

60
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,940
this has become an existential battle for national pride.

61
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,480
I mean, the concept of food wars isn't new, like there's stuff like french fries, kimchi

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,720
and hummus where multiple countries make a claim.

63
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,840
But this is rice, it's different.

64
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,600
So with that said, before we get to our first meal, let's start by going back to the very

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,960
beginning and wading into a fight that's divided the world.

66
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,760
Alright, before we get into speculation, let's start with facts.

67
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,260
First, the consumption of rice is very, very old.

68
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,980
And second, rice is a grass, and before it was first domesticated, variations of wild

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,100
rice grew across much of the world.

70
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,740
But with that said, let's begin with a generally accepted point of origin for the use of rice

71
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,900
as a food source, which is China's Yangtze River Valley, specifically here, in the area

72
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:33,380
between today's Ningbo and Hangzhou, at dig sites dating to as far back as 12,000 B.C.

73
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,760
or 8,000 years before the invention of the wheel, and 2,000 years prior to the fictional

74
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,080
lives of the Flintstones.

75
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Anyway, this evidence is generally based on rice having famously been found in storage

76
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
basins.

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,280
However, what's not as widely known is that rice was just a small component of giant

78
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,240
pots filled mostly with nuts and acorns, which probably, not definitely, but most likely,

79
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,760
means that rice wasn't actually that widely accessible.

80
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,220
Or in other words, it wasn't being farmed yet, just foraged.

81
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,540
Let me digress for a second to explain something about how rice works.

82
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,900
Basically the rice we eat is the seed of the plant, and grasses have this thing they do

83
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,260
in nature called shattering.

84
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,300
What it means is that when the seed becomes ripe, it falls off.

85
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,500
That's how the species survives.

86
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,260
But when something that's just ripe and falls off, it kind of ruins the idea of farming.

87
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,400
So at some point, I mean, thousands and thousands of years after people filled those basins

88
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,120
in China, we see a genetic shift.

89
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,720
All of a sudden, the fossilized samples archaeologists found starting around 5,000 BC had a mutated

90
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,880
gene, one that would stop the plant from shattering and therefore allow farming.

91
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,720
This would have been incredibly difficult.

92
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,520
I mean, it took as long as 8,000 years to be achieved.

93
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,980
It would be perhaps the most significant breakthrough in global farming history, and that's not

94
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,660
an exaggeration.

95
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,900
But as for where it happened, well, that's when we start getting into the controversy.

96
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,300
The oldest fossilized remains of non-shattering rice were actually not found in China, but

97
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,660
in India, where rice consumption also dates back to the beginning of the written record.

98
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,700
Now, Indian legends claim that rice has been consumed in the country since at least 13,000

99
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,040
BC, although with no evidence to support it, it feels like that number might have been

100
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,960
chosen only because it's older than what they found in China.

101
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,880
But it is without question that rice also has an ancient history in India.

102
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,840
It's closely linked to many of the country's great religions, and those claims are also

103
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,240
backed up by archaeology.

104
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,560
The Indian and Chinese strains of rice are two distinct variations, known as japonica

105
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,840
and indica.

106
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:52,220
However, they both belong to the same species, oriza sativa, and both possess the exact same

107
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,300
non-shattering gene, evolved identically.

108
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,260
So scientists have come to generally agree that it would be impossible for them not to

109
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,820
come from the same source.

110
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,660
It had to start somewhere.

111
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,620
Now, since scientists first started studying this topic, both countries have put a lot

112
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,740
of money into commissioning research backing their own origin claims, which makes finding

113
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:16,520
truth in the history books a complete mess.

114
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,520
There are tons of studies from China which show irrefutable evidence of the Chinese origin,

115
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,160
and just as many from India proving with certainty that they were the ones who made the breakthrough.

116
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,920
Maybe the best actual clue comes from an American research team that in 2011 did a full genome

117
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,360
mapping of more than 100 types of Indian and Chinese rice, and determined that the actual

118
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,220
point of origin based on genetic comparisons with wild rice wasn't from the banks of the

119
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,500
Yangtze or the Ganges.

120
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,420
Instead, it was the flood plains of the Pearl River Delta in China's south close to Hong

121
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,420
Kong.

122
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,300
According to that theory, the rice from there would make its way across China and by land

123
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,380
to India, along the way being cross-bred with local endemic ferritals.

124
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,300
Anyway, one last point on the topic which may or may not be relevant, but in 2003, a team

125
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,680
of archaeologists in Korea announced that they'd found evidence that rice actually

126
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,680
originated there as far back as 15,000 B.C., jumping the line even ahead of China and India.

127
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,600
The studies flew in fast and furious from both of those countries, with literally thousands

128
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,560
of papers discrediting the Korean claim.

129
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,480
Successfully, by the way, as by now it's almost completely forgotten.

130
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,800
At least China and India can work together sometimes.

131
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,100
Anyway, regardless of where rice started, as soon as farmers figured out how to grow

132
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,100
it, well, towns started forming, then cities.

133
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,460
Here was something so abundant, so resilient that it literally took Asian society from

134
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:54,460
hunter-gatherers to urban dwellers, which finally brings us to our first meal.

135
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,460
The earliest versions of rice eaten, whether in China, India, or Korea, wouldn't look

136
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,580
that different to how you might typically see it today.

137
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,520
Some steamed rice, along with a protein, or maybe some simple vegetables.

138
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,720
But around 1000 B.C., we start to see the first culinary breakthroughs, the use of rice as

139
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
a component in a complete dish.

140
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,920
What we find at the very beginning is something incredibly simple, made with just rice and

141
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,000
water, created after a flood to stretch a limited supply further.

142
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,800
But as far as we know, it's the world's first rice recipe, a dish from China, known

143
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,820
as Joe.

144
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:48,820
So, all right, Michelin-rated Joe restaurant, although realistically Joe is Joe.

145
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:55,420
It's rice cooked until it's a soup texture, if you've ever had it before, it's kind of

146
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,580
like oatmeal.

147
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,560
You can make it as thick or as thin as you see fit, although this is pretty standard,

148
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,840
it's kind of right in the middle.

149
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,360
The whole idea is just to stretch rice further, and in this case, put a couple of classic

150
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,320
components in it.

151
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,360
The more elegant, famous Joe restaurants will serve it with seafood, especially in

152
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
South China.

153
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,080
Here, I just have sun-dried pork and century egg, which are both preserved ingredients

154
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,900
that would have been in a classic Joe, at least as far as we know, a really long time

155
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
ago.

156
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,900
And we got it on the side with yotiao, thank you very much, otherwise known as patonggou

157
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:40,900
here in Thailand, which secretly is kind of what this is really all about.

158
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,740
The genius, of course, of Joe is that it stretches a limited supply of rice further, a way to

159
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,320
save a population dependent on rice from starvation when there's not enough to go around.

160
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,680
Joe, also known as kanji, or here in Thailand, joke, is said to have been created in China

161
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,640
during the Zhou Dynasty, the name is probably just a coincidence, around 1000 BC.

162
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,520
Now the Zhou ruled from what's now Xi'an, and they pretty much based much of their rule

163
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,280
on rice.

164
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,720
They claim to be descended from a man named Hou Ji, a figure from Chinese mythology who

165
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:23,580
was, and this is hilarious if you've ever dealt with Chinese bureaucracy, an administrator,

166
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,820
a prehistoric minister of agriculture who was revered for giving the Middle Kingdom rice.

167
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,580
And through the spread of Joe, the Zhou dynasty could claim to oversee an empire that was

168
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,700
almost immune to famine.

169
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,100
It wouldn't take long for Joe to spread wherever there was rice, and to become revered as almost

170
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,300
a miracle.

171
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,840
You can find it in ancient recipes in Southeast Asia, Japan, and Korea, and also of course

172
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,000
in the Indian subcontinent where it was used not just as food but as traditional medicine,

173
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,920
and where we get the name kanji, a temel word meaning boiling.

174
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,920
And to this day in the same region where it first emerged, it's an everyday breakfast staple.

175
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,320
I've never really thought about this, but since we're on camera, and I have to look

176
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,320
okay, eating Joe with a mustache is really causing me some trouble.

177
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,040
Alright, between the advent of non-shattering rice, the fast expansion of rice across Asia

178
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,780
and the introduction of dishes like Joe to make rice drought-proof, the thousand years

179
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,740
before the year zero would see an explosion in both rice consumption, and also more and

180
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,820
more new recipes, new uses of rice adapted to local palates.

181
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,220
In those years we see the first example of sushi made in Japan, something called narazushi.

182
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:10,460
Fish and rice pickled together in salt, said to have originated around the year 300 BC.

183
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,160
It's the time frame in India when we see the birth of something called kheer, basically

184
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,880
Joe but cooked in milk and sugar instead of water, seasoned with cardamom and topped with

185
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,120
nuts and almost definitely the world's first sweet rice dish.

186
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,560
And it's around the same time as the Qin Dynasty, the first to unify China, saw northerners

187
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,080
from non-rice growing regions move south where they began to make their own staple, noodles

188
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,920
from rice instead of wheat.

189
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,060
But those noodles, while they would spread around much of the world, well they weren't

190
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,100
technically the first rice noodles.

191
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Because long before those show up, another group of people from China had settled the

192
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,660
basin of the Irawati River in what today is Myanmar, bringing rice farming to Southeast

193
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,980
Asia and putting their stamp on cuisine through their own signature dish.

194
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:06,500
These were people known as the Maun and what they made brings us to the next part of this

195
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
story.

196
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:17,960
Now, we've talked at length about the Maun on this channel as they were massively influential

197
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,760
in the origins of Southeast Asia, but basically they were rice farmers who swept down from

198
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,580
the Yangtze River Valley around 3500 BC.

199
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,660
It's true that pretty much every civilization from this region would develop their own techniques

200
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,640
and varietals of rice, but the first to sow the land, to plant the seeds literally and

201
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,520
figuratively, were the ethnic Maun.

202
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,760
It's the Maun who introduced the region to irrigation and rice cultivation, and while

203
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,800
they didn't leave a lot of records behind, we can follow their spread through two paths,

204
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,080
their language, and their most famous dish, something that would become a staple of ancient

205
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,520
civilizations from the Lanna to the Khmer.

206
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,280
It was made by milling rice into flour and then making it into a dough, fermented in

207
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,040
the tropical heat for preservation, and then forced through small holes directly into boiling

208
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
water.

209
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,080
It's a technique still followed today, an essential part of the cuisine in Thailand,

210
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,680
Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and even as far away as Sri Lanka and southern India.

211
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,920
The Maun called it Hanon Chin, the root of the Thai name, Kanom Chin.

212
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,200
Like Joe, it was most likely developed to stretch a rice harvest even farther, something

213
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,760
critical here in the floodlands and with the added benefit of tasting really, really good.

214
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,080
Its history predates almost anything else still found in Southeast Asia, food or otherwise,

215
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,200
and where it started, today's Myanmar, it's still the national dish.

216
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,440
Served in a soup made of fish stock and aromatics, something found in every corner of the country.

217
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,120
There it's known as a dish called Mohinga.

218
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:08,640
This is like the ultimate Burmese breakfast food.

219
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,440
It's salty, you know, it's a fish stock.

220
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,400
You have the chickpea fritters because it's from Myanmar, which means there's going to

221
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,560
be some kind of textural contrast.

222
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:25,520
Egg, fish cake, and long beans, some cilantro or coriander if you prefer, and the soup with

223
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,680
some chili on top.

224
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,680
And yeah, this is just one of my all time favorite things.

225
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,160
It's a lot of people's favorite thing.

226
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:49,720
This is a very popular dish.

227
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,880
We did a whole video about these noodles, these rice noodles that like, you can see them

228
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,520
all across Southeast Asia.

229
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,640
Thailand is Khanom Jin, Cambodia it's Numbang Chok, Vietnam it's Bun, and the whole point

230
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,000
is that like wherever you see this, that's where the ethnic mon once settled.

231
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,760
These are probably, we don't know for sure and there's some disagreement in South China,

232
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,360
but probably the first rice noodles that were ever made.

233
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,600
And it has, you know, a history that's a lot older than any kind of modern Southeast Asian

234
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,600
society.

235
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,520
And it helps, it is absolutely delicious.

236
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:40,060
It's also pretty light, which I'm thankful for with the amount of eating that we have

237
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,060
ahead of us.

238
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:46,520
I'm already getting full.

239
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,600
Why the year 500 BC rice was found pretty much everywhere in the eastern half of Asia,

240
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,800
and I mean everywhere from the southernmost islands all the way into the Himalayas.

241
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,480
And maybe the most fun part about tracing its spread isn't really the fundamentals of

242
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,040
how it was traded, so much as the myths that spring up around its arrival.

243
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,480
I mean, in the eyes of the earliest people, something this important had to be a gift

244
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
from the gods.

245
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,200
In fact, almost every culture and ethnic group in this part of the world has an origin story

246
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,360
about this plant.

247
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,160
And if you'll indulge me just a minute before we get back to the history, well these are

248
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,040
very much worth acknowledging.

249
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,360
In China, the most common story involves the goddess Guan Yin, who you might also remember

250
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,680
from our history of oysters.

251
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,400
It's said that she gave her milk and her blood to create the first rice plant, with

252
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,120
the milk explaining the white color of the grains, and the blood, the reddish husk, around

253
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,640
the outside.

254
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,080
To early Japan, it was another goddess, Amaterasu Omikami, who was given grains of rice by a

255
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,400
swan flying through heaven and presented them as a gift to the Japanese islands.

256
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,240
Female deities also play roles in a few ancient stories here in Thailand, where according

257
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,840
to one legend, a goddess was cursed by the wives of farmers because she was too beautiful,

258
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,360
and their husbands desired her affection.

259
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,160
So she hid herself in shame and lived with her best friend, a freshwater fish, where

260
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,280
she would remain until the farmers apologized and as a show of goodwill, she gave them rice.

261
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,380
Maybe my favorite story about the origin of rice comes from Tibet, where people once

262
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,160
battled starvation as they relied on hunting in a land with few animals.

263
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,440
One day a dog came running across an empty field and hanging from its tail were clusters

264
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,240
of rice seeds, which they planted and hunger disappeared.

265
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,480
Versions of this story are found throughout the Himalayas and western China, one from

266
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,000
the Miao people, where a dog with nine tails went into heaven to steal a rice plant, fighting

267
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,960
the heavenly gods and in the process, seeing eight of its tails cut off before achieving

268
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:56,400
its mission and returning to earth with rice, which is also the origin story of dogs.

269
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,200
Regardless of which version is told in a community in the region from Sichuan to the

270
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,480
Himalayas, it's still tradition to give the first cooked handful of that year's rice

271
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,520
harvest to the family dog.

272
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,640
A couple more than back to our story.

273
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,720
In the Philippines, there's one legend that says a girl born into slavery named Agme was

274
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,300
sitting at a river, crying tears of sadness when she saw a bundle of golden stalks floating

275
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,720
with the current.

276
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,120
She buried the plant in the mud next to the river and when it grew, her family collected

277
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,160
the rice and used it to buy their freedom.

278
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,840
And a Laotian tale involves a farmer who had no food to eat, so he trapped a fish but

279
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,440
the fish turned out to be sacred.

280
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,920
To prevent the fish from being eaten, the king of the fishes gave the farmer rice instead.

281
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,640
Rice would become so important and Laot that eventually a king would take all the rice

282
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,160
and hoard it in a locked dungeon.

283
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,480
So a peasant, when in search of the rice goddess, hacked her into pieces and planted them, which

284
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,480
gave Laot countless varieties of the plant, white, black, long grain, short grain and

285
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,960
sticky rice.

286
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,560
With so many types of rice now growing, the king could no longer control the supply and

287
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,780
from then on the people lived in abundance.

288
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,000
And even though there are countless more, well that's as good a segue as any into another

289
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,560
important topic, which is the diversity of rice itself.

290
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,560
With so many cultures and so many climates relying on the plant, it's not a surprise

291
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,680
that this simple grain has evolved in thousands of different ways.

292
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,160
Actually 120,000 different ways, that's how many varieties of rice are said to exist today

293
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,720
across the planet, 20,000 right here in Thailand alone, which all evolved from that very first

294
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,220
Big Bang.

295
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,800
It's a number that might sound crazy, I mean it is crazy.

296
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,960
But to see for ourselves, well we had to take a trip to the local market.

297
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:56,760
I wonder if the ducks and chickens still remember me.

298
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:07,560
Maybe not, I don't think they're the same ones.

299
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,880
This is Klangtoi, Thailand's largest wet market in a place we just filmed a couple

300
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,760
weeks ago, spending 24 hours here without leaving.

301
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,640
And while then our focus was on the meats and vegetables, this is also where Bangkok

302
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,760
shops for rice.

303
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,080
There's rice in all forms, toasted for use in Esan cuisine, made into kanam jeen or

304
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:35,200
mohinga noodles, and of course, sold straight from the farm in massive quantities.

305
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:44,280
Alright, we already found our destination, we don't need to go beyond this, 31 types

306
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,800
of rice at least.

307
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:54,280
And obviously we have all kinds of different sizes and variations of Chinese white rice.

308
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,160
We have all the Thai jasmine rice, the long grain Thai jasmine rice I think is going to

309
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,480
be this.

310
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,600
We have what looks like sticky rice, so this is going to be the Esan sticky rice, 1, 2,

311
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,680
3, at a minimum of that.

312
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:33,600
We have the unhusked varieties, black rice, brown rice, slightly less brown rice.

313
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,400
The diversity of rice on display at a place like Klangtoi is both impressive and honestly

314
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,960
unless you grew up in this culture, confusing.

315
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,920
We need to get back to the history, but before this channel I was a chef and the food side

316
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,600
of this needs to be addressed.

317
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,240
What's the difference between all these variations and how does the choice of rice impact the

318
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,360
dishes it's meant to be served with?

319
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,720
Well, I can't answer that question, but I do know someone who can.

320
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,560
So for our next meal, I set up an appointment with the owner of one of Thailand's best

321
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
restaurants.

322
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:26,320
This is Bandang by Methevalai Sorndang, an offshoot of the Michelin-starred place that's

323
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,320
often called one of the best Thai restaurants on the planet.

324
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,000
The third generation owner, my friend Nam, agreed to join us to pass along some of his

325
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,440
secrets when it comes to selecting a proper rice to pair with his cuisine.

326
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Tell me, as a Thai person, how important rice is in the culture, in the language of saying

327
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,440
like, how are you doing essentially, right?

328
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Just explain to me about the importance of rice to somebody in Thailand.

329
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Wow.

330
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,440
Wow.

331
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,440
That metaphor, it's basically the same as just waking up and breathing.

332
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,440
I'd say we eat it every single day.

333
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,440
I'd say for the typical Thai, every day, just every day, it's an everyday thing for us.

334
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,440
So it's very important.

335
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,440
According to Nam, of all the varietals you'll find at a market, there are subtle differences

336
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,440
in tastes and textures, and certain sizes work better with some dishes.

337
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,440
But for an educated shopper, what you're really paying attention to is not just the type of

338
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,440
rice, but how it's treated after it's been harvested.

339
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Wow.

340
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,440
You were telling me off off the air something that's really interesting about a side of

341
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,440
choosing what rice you're going to use that I hadn't really considered.

342
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Right.

343
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,440
So I guess the most common is jasmine rice, which we use here as well.

344
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:55,440
But what I've learned throughout my career is that the amount of time for rice storage

345
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,440
before it is used also has also affected its uses as well.

346
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,440
Typically when a rice is stored, give or take, less than three months, it still has its starch

347
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,440
content, which makes it more sticky.

348
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,440
And most people use it for, let's say, jok, porridge.

349
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,440
It creates a more sticky feeling, and then the aroma is going to be nicer.

350
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,440
However, after it's stored later than three months, six months, or a year with proper

351
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,440
storing, it can be more used in a versatile manner.

352
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
For example, fried rice.

353
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,440
It becomes less starchy, less sticky, and less clumpy.

354
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,440
That's why it's a bit of a hidden technique.

355
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440
You don't have to use a day old rice.

356
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,440
You can use rice that is probably stored for a long time.

357
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
And so it's...

358
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
You just cook it and fry it.

359
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
Yeah, just cook it and fry it, basically.

360
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
What do you choose to use here?

361
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,440
So here we use a typically three to six month old rice.

362
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,440
So it's more versatile use in a restaurant manner.

363
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,440
And for newer rice, it's much harder to cook properly because sometimes it's so easy to

364
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,440
overcook it, and it becomes this sort of like pasty kind of feel.

365
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
So you get your rice.

366
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Yeah.

367
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Get your rice.

368
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Thank you.

369
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
And then...

370
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Let's do it here so we can endorse if you want to film this from above while we're doing this.

371
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
All right.

372
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,440
So basically what you typically do, you get the sauce, the curry, and then you pour it

373
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,440
over the rice.

374
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,440
And then basically you just do that.

375
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,440
So the rice absorbs all the flavor.

376
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,440
And that's how basically we eat.

377
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
All right.

378
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
Let me eat.

379
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
Thank you.

380
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Go ahead.

381
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
I'm just looking at this.

382
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
I got my plate off to the side.

383
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
Enjoy.

384
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Yeah.

385
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Thank you so much.

386
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
Nice to see you again.

387
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
You're welcome.

388
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Thank you.

389
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
All right.

390
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,440
To get back to the history we left off around the time the Japanese developed sushi and the

391
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,440
mon created rice noodles, all using crops and techniques brought from China.

392
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,440
But not long after that, the global rice trade would change, with China putting a hard stop

393
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
on rice export.

394
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,440
See, China might have become a nation completely dependent on rice, but by the time of the

395
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,440
Tin Dynasty, it was already clear that there just wasn't enough to go around.

396
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,440
They had a growing population to feed and only a small percentage of land suitable for farming.

397
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,440
So for a long time, there would be no more trade in Chinese rice.

398
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,440
And so this story shifts to India, which was at its peak as the linchpin of global culinary

399
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
commerce.

400
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,440
Let's start around 500 BC, when India was a trading partner of the ancient Persian

401
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
Empire.

402
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,440
At some point around that time, the Persians began to import quantities of Indian rice,

403
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,440
the first time that it reached that far to Asia's West.

404
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Rice would become common in Persia, with their own agriculture centered around Basra in

405
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,440
today's Iraq.

406
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,440
The Persian Empire wouldn't last much longer.

407
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,440
It would fall to the Greeks under Alexander the Great in the year 330 BC, and it was that

408
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,440
conquest that first introduced rice to Europe and the Western world.

409
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,440
As a matter of fact, it's also how we get the word rice, from the Greek orisa, which

410
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,440
was taken from the language of Persia, which itself came a very long time ago from India's

411
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,440
southern language of Tamil.

412
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,440
Anyway, just because the Persians were growing rice doesn't mean they were using it as a

413
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,440
staple food source.

414
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,440
After all, theirs was a baking culture and rice should be steamed, something not yet

415
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,440
found in West Asia.

416
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:07,440
Instead, as far as we can tell, in Persia and later in ancient Greece, rice was used

417
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,440
for making into flour for desserts, and most of all, for making beer.

418
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,440
After rice first shows up in Persia, it would be another few centuries before it would become

419
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,440
part of their diet, and for that, well, let's go back to China again.

420
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Well, maybe not China itself, I mean, it was close to the rice trade, but to the borderlands

421
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,440
where Chinese rice had first spread so long ago.

422
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,440
One of those neighboring countries to China's west was Uzbekistan, where as far back as

423
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:42,440
the 4th century AD, the people were known to favor a local dish of rice cooked in stock

424
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,440
with spices, called hualao in Chinese, locally pronounced as pilaf.

425
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:53,440
After the Muslim conquest of Central Asia in the 700s, new trade routes would spring up

426
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,440
linking the region to the Middle East.

427
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,440
It was along those paths that pilaf was first introduced from Uzbekistan to Persia, and

428
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,440
then during the Mughal Empire from Persia to India, where it would become biryani.

429
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,440
That dish would change the way rice was consumed in the Middle East.

430
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,440
And for our next meal, well, that's where we're headed.

431
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:36,440
In the alleys between Bangkok's Sukhumvit Soi 3 and Soi 5, there's a neighborhood

432
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,440
known as the Arab Quarter, the home to a densely packed maze of restaurants run by

433
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,440
and servicing people from the Muslim world.

434
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,440
And one thing those cultures have in common from Morocco to Iraq is the use of rice.

435
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,440
But nothing draws a crowd like this one.

436
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,440
One of my favorite dishes served in this city, a legendary Bedouin dish known as Mansaf Rice.

437
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,440
Alright, so I understand that at this stage in the shoot, and we, this is not a camera

438
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,440
trick, we've done this all in succession.

439
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:18,440
Having this enormous 10 kilo plate of food is a strong choice.

440
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:24,440
However, I mean, I don't care what the circumstances are, I will always have room for this.

441
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,440
This is Mansaf Rice, and it is the national dish of Jordan.

442
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,440
It's found sort of throughout the Levant region.

443
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,440
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, it's very popular.

444
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,440
What it is is basically rice that's cooked in a sauce made of yogurt.

445
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,440
We have more of the yogurt sauce here.

446
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,440
Mutton is the meat of choice.

447
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,440
And it's cooked on top of and with bread, you know, which is the flatbread of the Middle East.

448
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,440
So I'm going to start scooping this, and it is just like, this is a treat.

449
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
This is the kind of thing.

450
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,440
I mean, you know, we've never filmed at this restaurant before.

451
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,440
This is called Hafid, and the restaurant itself is actually Egyptian.

452
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,440
But they do have foods from throughout the region, and this is the highlight.

453
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Me and Daria actually came here for this off-camera like a week ago.

454
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,440
And that's something that we do quite frequently whenever we're in the mood.

455
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:29,440
I would say that this is one of our two or three most frequent stops in the whole city for a place that we eat regularly off-camera.

456
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,440
So yeah, Mansaf Rice, it's a dish that has a ton of history.

457
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,440
And like thousands of years of history as a Bedouin dish, the incorporation of rice is more modern.

458
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,440
It was traditionally mutton yogurt sauce and bread.

459
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:53,440
However, rice as a staple grain in the Middle East is also something that has ancient history because, of course, it does its rice.

460
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,440
That's unbelievable.

461
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,440
I'm going to just eat because the hair salon across the street is celebrating song crime.

462
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
It was just a high new year.

463
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,440
And so they were very nice and agreed to turn their blasting music off for us while we were filming.

464
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,440
But I told them just a few minutes and then we promised we'll let you get back to your party.

465
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,440
So I'm going to let them do that because I have work to do.

466
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,440
There's a lot to eat and talking is just distracting me from the actual mission.

467
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Unreal.

468
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:50,440
Alright, as long and convoluted as the path of rice is, the one thing that's certain, the one universal truth is that in ancient history,

469
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:58,440
rice grew wild across much of the world before somewhere, probably China, maybe India, after thousands of years of trying,

470
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,440
breeders were able to crack the genetic code and successfully domesticate rice.

471
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,440
I mean, we covered that right at the beginning and it's the most important thing that might have ever happened in food.

472
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
But it's not the whole story.

473
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:18,440
What isn't usually included in the history books is that there was a second domestication, half a world away from Asia,

474
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,440
a second miracle of agriculture completely independent from the one that we all know about.

475
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:31,440
It happened around 3,500 years ago in Africa, and you probably don't know about it because nobody talks about Africa,

476
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,440
but it happened in what's now the country of Nigeria, and for the people there, it would be history changing.

477
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Now, according to theory, and keep in mind this isn't well documented, as the Sahara dried out around 2,500 BC,

478
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:54,440
but the local versions of wild rice which were once abundant across the whole of Africa became in the northern hemisphere harder to find,

479
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,440
so the people set out to make their own.

480
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,440
For the record, this would happen more than a thousand years before any record of trade between Africa and either China or India,

481
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,440
in fact a full 1,500 years before the first rice was shipped to the port at Alexandria.

482
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,440
This was something completely different and totally independent, unique in global history,

483
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:22,440
and the only rice found anywhere on earth that belongs to a different species than Oryza sativa.

484
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Basically, we start here in Nigeria, and the area we're talking about is here, the delta of the Niger River.

485
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Now, again, this story has to rely on a bit of speculation, but the farmers who first managed this incredible accomplishment

486
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:46,440
were most likely from a group of 16 small clans known as the Volta Niger, who were pastoral farmers and yet were still, according to archaeology,

487
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,440
advanced enough that they were smelting metal as early as almost anyone else on earth,

488
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,440
and it would take an advanced civilization to have developed this rice because it was no joke of an achievement.

489
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,440
It was bred in a way that still baffles scientists, with a dense canopy that prevents the growth of weeds,

490
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:11,440
a faster maturation than that of Asian rice, and most significantly, the ability to thrive in even the harshest of conditions,

491
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:19,440
tolerating bad soil, arid soil, and even no soil at all, growing literally on top of the water in the delta region.

492
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,440
When this rice, by the way, was first encountered by European slave traders, they wrote of its impressive nature

493
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,440
and described its cultivation as the most complex they'd ever seen.

494
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Anyway, just like in Asia, after rice was domesticated, it led to the construction of cities, with the first recorded a place called Ile Ife.

495
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:46,440
It was here that the Volta Niger would consolidate into a tribe known as the Yoruba, who today number almost 45 million.

496
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:53,440
In the Yoruba language, by the way, the name Ile Ife translates to the home of expansion.

497
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,440
From that new city, the domesticated rice would quickly spread across a large swath of West Africa,

498
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:03,440
blanketing the coastline and moving inland as far as Lake Chad.

499
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,440
It would be this rice that would serve as the staple food for the greatest empires that region has ever seen,

500
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:17,440
beginning with the Mali Kingdom, which would spread from the Niger basin to become, for a time, the richest civilization on Earth.

501
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:25,440
The consumption of rice would also be the lynchpin of the Songhai, the great rivals and eventual successors of the Mali.

502
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:35,440
For a time, there were a number of large kingdoms centered in West Africa all consuming local rice, which again means this story is about to get controversial.

503
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:45,440
See, somewhere in one of those civilizations, sometime in the 1500s, a dish emerged that would quickly become the single most iconic food of West Africa.

504
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,440
It was made by cooking rice with onions and tomatoes, which had just arrived from the Portuguese.

505
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Now, this dish, which would be called Jolof Rice, would lead to centuries of intense feuds between West African countries,

506
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,440
particularly Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, and Senegal, as to where it first actually originated.

507
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:13,440
And when I say intense, I mean this manifested not just in generations of arguments, but in more recent years, cook-offs, articles,

508
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,440
and even musical battles with rival songs staking their claims to the dish.

509
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,440
In the end, UNESCO got involved and decided the actual credit should go to Senegal,

510
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,440
which in all honesty should have been obvious from the beginning because the name of the dish itself comes from the Senegalese Jolof people.

511
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,440
But I guess it didn't really matter because in West Africa, there are so many other preparations using rice,

512
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,440
including even inversions of the continent's most beloved staple.

513
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:56,440
When you allow your water to boil, when the water is already boiled, then you mix it.

514
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:05,440
When you mix it, you will use something like this to turn it, turn it until it is done.

515
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,440
It's very easy to do. Perfect.

516
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,440
In a back alley across from the Arab quarter, above a hair salon, behind an unmarked entrance,

517
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,440
there's Bangkok's best West African restaurant.

518
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,440
It's run by a man named Andy, who invited us to visit to show us his famous Jolof rice,

519
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:36,440
and also how he makes Fufu, the Nigerian staple, not with the more common cassava, but instead using rice.

520
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,440
For that one bag of flour, how much water is in it? Or you just know. You don't measure, you just know.

521
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,440
I don't measure. I don't measure. But I know exactly how much water is in it.

522
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Even if the water is too much, you still add the rice flour.

523
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:01,440
When you are turning it, when you are turning it because you have to put it on fire so that it will be done.

524
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:12,440
When you see that it's already thick, because you have to make sure that it's a little bit thick,

525
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,440
then you will keep the reserved water standby.

526
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:37,440
So this is the oil. You add it small, fully small, so that when the customer is eating,

527
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:49,440
because we normally eat with hand. So when you are eating, it will be just smooth and easy because of the oil.

528
00:42:49,440 --> 00:43:08,440
Like before, if I have a big customer, I can make more. That is when I need somebody to hold the pot for me.

529
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:15,440
While I work in kitchens for long enough, my hands don't get hot. I don't have any feeling in my hands anymore.

530
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,440
As you can see, it's already smooth.

531
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,440
So it's already done.

532
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:46,440
Hi, Goosey. The second time we've shown it on the channel, this version is just something else.

533
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:58,440
This is why we are here. Every culture and country that has a history of farming rice in Nigeria goes back 3,000 or 4,000 years.

534
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:04,440
It's such a versatile thing, not necessarily in the climate where it grows, but in the uses of it.

535
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:13,440
To be able to substitute the classic cassava for rice flour, and to keep that textural integrity, it's awesome.

536
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,440
You make yours a little bit spicy. I like that.

537
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:31,440
If we thought we were starting to get full, that hit of chili pepper is going to wake us right back up again.

538
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,440
Fantastic. Let's try the rice.

539
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:55,440
Here, the texture of the rice is going to be a little bit different from what we saw, for example, at Bondang.

540
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:03,440
When we were looking at the Thai way of making rice, and you go to how rice is served in China, where it's going to be a little bit lighter and fluffier.

541
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,440
In this case, because of the tomato that it's stewed in, this has almost a sticky texture.

542
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,440
It's something that almost feels like it's like... how would you describe this?

543
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,440
It's more like a risotto than a bowl of Chinese rice.

544
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:28,440
This is fantastic, and the cool thing is, again, such a completely different flavor profile than anywhere else we've been today.

545
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:39,440
It just shows the versatility of rice, and the reasons why it's appreciated by people everywhere.

546
00:45:51,440 --> 00:46:17,440
The ancient Nigerian rice is today almost extinct, increasingly replaced since the 1970s by the Chinese varietal, for the primary reason that it's more cost-effective, since through genetic engineering it now yields a bigger harvest.

547
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:30,440
But there's a massive legacy of the African culture of rice, not least of which can be found throughout the Caribbean, where the first strains planted in the 1560s were brought from Nigeria.

548
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:45,440
As a matter of fact, more than half of all African slaves were taken from the rice growing region, mainly because European slavers found that it was easy to stock up on food supplies for the transatlantic journey thanks to the abundance of local rice.

549
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:59,440
There are even stories in places like Jamaica that said that slaves held in bondage used to hide grains of rice in their clothes and even in their hair, so that if they ever became free, they could plant their own crop and build a new life.

550
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:11,440
And to this day, rice is found in pretty much every meal from Jamaica to Trinidad and the Dominican Republic, and of course on the continent as well, in both North and South America.

551
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:22,440
The story of rice in the New World isn't simple or straightforward. There are many different points of origin, from European trade to the arrival of Indian plantation workers.

552
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:37,440
There's even a theory, thus far not proven, but also worth observing, that it's possible there could have even been a third domestication event in Brazil around 5,000 years ago, using their own strains of wild rice that grew in the Amazon basin.

553
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:46,440
What we know for sure is that today, rice is a key component in the cuisine of Mexico, where it arrived with the Spanish, which is why it's sometimes called Spanish rice.

554
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:58,440
In Peru, where it also came with the Spanish and where a common dish, arroz chaufa, was introduced by the Chinese in the 1800s and takes its name from chaufan, fried rice in Mandarin.

555
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:16,440
And it's consumed in Brazil, maybe not their own native strains, but there you can find white rice brought by the Portuguese, and also something called red rice, which is the species from West Africa, maybe almost gone from its original home but thriving in Brazilian cuisine.

556
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:22,440
And of course, there's also the United States, and one more time, this gets complicated.

557
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:31,440
The most common version of the stories that rice was first cultivated in 1685 in South Carolina, using rice seed brought from Madagascar.

558
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:48,440
Now that rice was the same that we first find way back at the beginning of this story in China, which worked its way to Taiwan, was brought to the Philippines by Austronesians around 5,000 years ago, and then they would introduce it to the islands across the Pacific, Madagascar included.

559
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:58,440
And it is true that the so-called Carolina rice would become a key crop in the colonial economy, helping drive the domestic commerce that would finance the American Revolution.

560
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:05,440
But there's more to it than that, and somehow, our last story might be the craziest one of this entire video.

561
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:22,440
This time, for the first time ever on OTR, we start in my hometown, Charlottesville, Virginia, in the year 1787 at a place called Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, who 11 years earlier had written the American Declaration of Independence.

562
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:33,440
Having played a role in uniting the colonies into one brand new country, Mr. Jefferson had a conundrum, which is why America's main trading partner, France, refused to buy Carolina rice.

563
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:52,440
Maybe he thought it was because the American rice wouldn't grow in a more mountainous climate, so Jefferson traveled to Italy, into the Alps to a region that was growing its own rice, and despite an Italian law promising the death penalty to rice smugglers, he made his way back to the coast with rice seed in his pockets.

564
00:49:52,440 --> 00:50:01,440
Planting this rice at Monticello, he was disappointed to find out it was exactly the same plant as the varietal from South Carolina, so that wasn't it.

565
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:17,440
As fate would have it, he'd receive a copy of a travelogue written by a missionary to Vietnam, who described finding rice of the most perfect color and quality, so Jefferson decided that would be his next mission, to obtain a sample of Vietnamese rice.

566
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:25,440
Again, this led him back to Europe in hopes of enlisting the help of his friend, the head of the French Navy, who often sailed to Vietnam.

567
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,440
But what Jefferson found was even more exciting.

568
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:42,440
See, in Paris at the time was the son of the exiled Vietnamese King Nguyen An, along with his guardian, Bishop Pierre Pignot, forced into hiding because of the Tây Son Rebellion, literally the subject of our video two weeks ago.

569
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:50,440
Anyway, Jefferson received an audience with the prince who promised to send him a French ship full of rice on his return to his homeland.

570
00:50:50,440 --> 00:51:05,440
But that would never happen, as shortly after Jefferson returned to Virginia, the French pulled back their support of the Nguyen family, and anyway, by the time Nguyen An would win his war on his own, his son had died of smallpox at the age of 21.

571
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:21,440
But Jefferson was now obsessed, and he would eventually receive his Asian rice, not from Vietnam but from Sumatra, delivered by none other than Lieutenant William Bly, deposed in the mutiny of the HMS Bounty and left stranded on the island of Timor.

572
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:34,440
Since Bly could no longer hope to show any success from his mission, which had been to deliver breadfruit trees to England, he instead wanted to salvage something so he scavenged a small amount of local Indonesian rice.

573
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:49,440
After his return to England, he'd present that rice to the botanist Joseph Banks, who would eventually deliver it all to Jefferson with a note informing him that he'd just received the entirety of the ill-fated mission of the HMS Bounty.

574
00:51:49,440 --> 00:52:02,440
However, sadly, this rice proved unsuccessful growing at Monticello and also at the home of Jefferson's friend James Madison, the writer of the U.S. Constitution, but still, all was not lost.

575
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:22,440
In the end, the success of Jefferson's chaotic quest for rice started with a chance meeting in 1789 with a young Bostonian captain who'd heard about these struggles and offered to help, this time by sailing for the west coast of Africa, where he said he'd heard of a rice that surpassed all others in both quality and adaptability.

576
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:45,440
The sailor returned a few months later with a 10-gallon drum of rice purchased from a local farmer in what's now Guinea, the western edge of Africa's ancient rice growing region, where he divided it into portions and sent them to growers he'd involved in his quest, including, of course, none other than George Washington, who had just begun his first term as the president of the United States.

577
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:57,440
Now, long story slightly shorter, the African rice didn't succeed in Virginia, but it did in the hills of Georgia, so successfully that it would soon spread across the entire southern region of the country.

578
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:14,440
And in 1803, after Jefferson himself negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, that land, including the Delta of the Mississippi River, would be populated with the very same African slaves who, once they saw this unique red rice, well, they knew exactly what to do with it.

579
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:27,440
And thus a new cuisine would develop, a fusion of influences from the French and Spanish who had previously colonized Louisiana, the new American settlers, and most of all, the cooks from West Africa.

580
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:57,440
All right, so this is not going to be a struggle for the last meal of the day, as full as we are, because this is the taste of home, and I'm so excited for this.

581
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:11,440
And it smells great, like we got the jambalaya with andouille sausage and pulp chicken, and we have the gumbo, which is with seafood, shrimp, and crab meat, both rice-based dishes from New Orleans.

582
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:22,440
And yeah, so usually on the channel when we film at a restaurant that has music playing like this, we have to ask them to please turn it off for us while we film, just because of copyright laws.

583
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:30,440
It really hurt to make that request here, because this is, again, like Dr. John playing at a New Orleans-themed restaurant.

584
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:46,440
Steve Miller-Benn was the last song that was just on, and I have to ask them to please turn it off. But let's give the food a try, and then stop talking, and also stop eating, because there's a lot of rice today.

585
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,440
New Orleans food is amazing.

586
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:21,440
Quite surprised to find a decent version of jambalaya so far away from home. It's a little bit sweeter than I would want it, but, you know, that's, I guess, what the local palate wants. It's delicious, honestly, and the sausage is great.

587
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:52,440
As my initial excitement wears off, and I start to realize how much we've actually eaten so far today, and how much rice we've eaten so far today, I think there's about time to wrap this up, both literally and figuratively.

588
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,440
I'm going to take this away and bring it home for Daria.

589
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:13,440
Alright, for our last bit of rice history, we return to where we started with that very first origin story, in Vietnam, except this time not in ancient history, but in the 20th century.

590
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:24,440
It's the last years of the colony of French Indochina, and in spite of what we all know now was about to happen, there was no sign yet that the country was primed for a communist revolution.

591
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,440
Hell, even Ho Chi Minh was living overseas, where he'd been for almost 30 years.

592
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:35,440
Back home, the biggest concern wasn't one of politics, it was the much more urgent matter of starvation.

593
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:45,440
See, the French had realized there was a big market for exported rice, so they were sending the local stock overseas, and at their factories, they even burned the Vietnamese rice for fuel.

594
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,440
When World War II broke out, things became dire.

595
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:59,440
The Japanese sent an army to take control of Vietnam, and to keep them at bay, the French signed a treaty, promising Japan a million tons of Vietnamese rice per year.

596
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:12,440
And then after the two countries entered a sort of shared occupation, it got even worse, with the Japanese seizing even more food while at the same time forcing subsistence farmers to switch to military production.

597
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:27,440
Between 1944 and 1945, a catastrophic famine gripped Vietnam, particularly in the north, and with Ho Chi Minh now back in trying to rally an army, he found a winning cause in promising not political change, but rice.

598
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:36,440
Back by legions of rice farmers, his revolution would pick up support, gain steam, and eventually that would lead to everything that came after.

599
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:51,440
In other words, if the French had simply understood the life or death importance of rice, the entire course of modern history might have unfolded differently, and it's possible, maybe even likely, that the Vietnam War would never have happened.

600
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,440
The truth is there are more stories like this from all throughout history.

601
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,440
It was a rice shortage that led to the fall of the Khmer.

602
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:10,440
Rice riots brought down a Japanese government in 1918, and India and Pakistan are embroiled in a bitter feud over Basmati, and that's just the tip of the rice bird.

603
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,440
If I have one takeaway from making this video, it's that there's no way to properly do it justice.

604
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:24,440
That's the thing about a subject like rice, which is so closely linked to everything from history, commerce, and mythology in countries across the planet.

605
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:31,440
The closer you look, the more layers you find, from ancient China to India to, well, pretty much everywhere.

606
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,440
Today, rice is the most widely eaten food on earth.

607
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:43,440
It's grown in 117 of the world's 195 countries, and its consumption continues to increase every single year.

608
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:53,440
It's thrown at newly married couples at weddings, celebrated with festivals across Asia and Africa, and used in religious rituals in the Indian subcontinent.

609
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:04,440
It provides billions of people with sustenance and a source of income, and is both affordable enough to feed a family, and diverse enough to please the best chefs from across the planet.

610
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:20,440
Rice tells the story of cultures, empires, and trade, and it's a story that we're still uncovering, with new research continuing to broaden our understanding of just how important this simple grain has been since the very beginning of time.

611
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,440
This might not be a complete narrative, there's so much more we could still cover.

612
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:30,440
More rebellions, and origin legends, and so many more dishes out there for us to try.

613
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:39,440
But for now, at the very least, we can say that this has been our very best attempt at covering the most important story in the history of food.

614
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,440
The story of rice.

615
00:59:50,440 --> 01:00:19,440
I mean, the concept of food wars is not new, like their stuff like kimchi, hummus, french fries, or...

616
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,440
french fries.

617
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:30,440
I mean, the concept of food wars is not new, like their stuff like kimchi, hummus, french fries.

618
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,440
Alright.

619
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:41,440
I mean, the concept of food wars is not new.

620
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,440
Let me just take french fries out.

621
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,440
Ron Burgundy.

622
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:52,440
I mean, the concept of food wars is not new, like their stuff like kimchi, hummus, french fries.
