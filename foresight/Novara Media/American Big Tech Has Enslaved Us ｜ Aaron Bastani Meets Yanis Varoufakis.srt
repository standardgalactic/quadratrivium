1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Αν δεν έχεις ένα καμπέτειο στο Google, ένα καμπέτειο στο Uber, ένα καμπέτειο στο Facebook, ένα καμπέτειο στο Apple, ένα καμπέτειο στο Amazon.com,

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:19,180
αν κάθε γερμανό ή οικογένειο ή οικογένειο ή οικογένειο πρότειο πρότειο πρέπει να πρέπει να πω σε αυτά τα κλαδελίσια για να βγω τα πράγματα,

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,580
όχι στην Ευρώπη.

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,860
Και, you know, Amazon,

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,840
κάνει 42 μιλίες κάθε χρόνια, μόνο στην Ευρώπη,

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,120
και παίρνει 0, 0 τάξι, 0.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,280
Μετά, είσαι έλεγε, είσαι τελειών.

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,520
Με όλο το χρόνο, οι κοινότητες πιστεύουν ότι ο καπτλισμός θα τελειώσει και θα θα εξεχθεί από κάτι άλλο, κάτι καλύτερο.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
Αλλά τι αν έγινε και ήταν εξεχθεί από κάτι πιστήχο, πιστήχο, πιστήχο.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,780
Τι αν είμαστε πρότειο για το καπτλισμό, αλλά αυτό δεν δημιουργεί την εξογένειο,

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,560
την οικονομία, αλλά, πραγματικά, είναι πολύ μεγάλη ενακόλυση.

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,760
Αυτό είναι το υποθοσίο της σχέσης στις εξογένειες.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,340
Ήθελε ότι είμαστε πρότειο για έναν κόσμο του φιουδολισμού,

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,460
όπου η επόμενη, σαν πιο, σαν την παράδειγμα,

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,960
αλλά με δίσκολα χρόνια.

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,660
Γιάννας Φαράφακκας, καθώς ήρθατε στο καπτλισμό.

17
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,920
Είναι πολύ καλό να είμαι πρότειο, ευχαριστούμε για την εξογένειο, είναι καλό να μιλήσω με εγώ.

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,520
Βέβαια, είπες ότι είναι καλό να είμαι πρότειο.

19
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,800
Είμαστε πρότειο για το 2015, πιστήχο.

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,060
Είσαι νιώθος τώρα, Γιάννας, όταν έγινε, έγινε 8 χρόνια, πώς έγινε.

21
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,780
Βέβαια, δεν είναι τifen, princess visiting,

22
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,820
για μια σύγχρομη και χορία λιγοφουνία χρόνια σου.

23
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,780
Αν είναι ότι είναι φίλοςuvo, είναι π από του φυγουλίου.

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,800
Από του φυγουλίου.

25
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,800
Maybe there's some advanced technology, you're not...

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,680
Very worn around the edges.

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,780
Became a very difficult year, very difficult year.

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,340
Will get on to that, particularly in regards to the politics of Greece,

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,980
but I think you mean more widely.

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,340
We're talking about your new book, which of course, is relevant,

31
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,140
Τεχνοφιουλισμό, το καπτολισμό.

32
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,540
Νομίζω, για εμένα,

33
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,540
στους τελευταίους που αντιμετωπίσεις το υποθοσύθο,

34
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,540
σε έναν μόνο,

35
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,940
τι αν έχουμε φτύξει το υποθοσύθο,

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,540
αλλά δεν είναι σωστολοσύθο.

37
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,540
Έτσι, μπορείτε να μεταξύσουμε αυτό λίγο,

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,540
επειδή, νομίζω, πιστεύουμε πιστεύουμε πιστεύουμε,

39
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,340
ότι είμαστε σε ένας υποθοσύθος,

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,140
δικαίου, δυγένουρος τρόπος του υποθοσύθο,

41
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,540
but your hypothesis is something a little bit different.

42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,940
Oh, it's very different, it's profoundly different.

43
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,540
But let me remind you that

44
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,740
I'm not the first to hypothesize

45
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,540
that if socialism as a project fails,

46
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,540
we will end up with barbarism.

47
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,940
Remember Rosa Luxemburg,

48
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,740
the famous question from her prison cell?

49
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,540
Socialism or barbarism?

50
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,340
It turns out that it is barbarism.

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,340
And of course, it's very technologically advanced.

52
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,140
It is based on huge quantities of capital.

53
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,740
So capital has triumphed

54
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,740
and that answers the second part of your question.

55
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,340
Of course, wherever you look,

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,740
you come face to face with the triumph of capital,

57
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,340
with the triumph of those who own capital, capitalists.

58
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,540
But what I'm saying here is that

59
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,140
in the end, it wasn't the left,

60
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,940
the organized labor movement

61
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,140
that appended capitalism.

62
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,340
We used to think and hope that it would be labor

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,540
that is the comeuppance of capitalism.

64
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,940
With capitalism, remember what Marx said in Engels,

65
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,340
capitalism creates its grave diggers, the proletariat.

66
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,340
The organized laborers who will rise up

67
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,740
and take possession of the means of production of capital

68
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,340
and put it to good use for society as a whole.

69
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,940
It didn't happen, as you know, as we all know, unfortunately.

70
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,740
But what happened was another construct,

71
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,740
another product of capitalism did that job

72
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,940
and that other product was capital itself.

73
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,540
So my hypothesis is that this

74
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,940
is that capital was so successful, like a very toxic virus,

75
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,540
which kills off its host and therefore it cannot propagate itself,

76
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,540
like Ebola, which is a stupid virus unlike COVID-19.

77
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,540
COVID-19 killed very few people

78
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,340
as a percentage of those who were infected

79
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,540
and therefore it spread and became a pandemic.

80
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,540
Ebola never left particular villages in Africa

81
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,740
because it killed all of them before it could spread.

82
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,340
Capital developed a mutation of itself,

83
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,340
which are called cloud capital, a particular form of capital,

84
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,540
which has killed off capitalism its host.

85
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,740
That's my hypothesis.

86
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,140
I know it's extremely controversial.

87
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,140
Most of the people on the left do not like it at all

88
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:47,940
for two reasons.

89
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,340
Firstly, because they think, hang on,

90
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,140
it's all capitalism, it's not socialism.

91
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,140
How can that be?

92
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,340
And the answer is also Luxembourg, it's barbarism.

93
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,940
And the second reason is because our task as socialists

94
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,140
is now, if I'm right, it's immensely harder.

95
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,940
Because my point now is that you don't just have exploitation

96
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,540
in the enterprise, at the level of the firm,

97
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,940
on the factory or the shop floor.

98
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,540
That continues, of course.

99
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,740
It's the main spring of surplus value.

100
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,140
It's the only spring of surplus value to this day.

101
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
That has not changed from capitalism.

102
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,540
But what has happened is, if you're Jeff Bezos,

103
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,340
if you are the owner of Google, of Apple,

104
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,340
if you're Elon Musk,

105
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,340
then you own this new form of cloud capital,

106
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,540
which allows you to extract from the rest of society

107
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,140
from proletarians, but from everyone else as well,

108
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,340
huge quantities of rents and surpluses,

109
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,340
in a manner that reconstitutes a form of feudalism.

110
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,540
The difference is that instead of the original feudalism,

111
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,740
which is a system based on private ownership of land,

112
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,740
which produces rent, now it's private ownership of the cloud,

113
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,740
of cloud capital, because the cloud is capital, right?

114
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
It's not some cloud up in the sky,

115
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,340
which yields again a form of rent.

116
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
Every time you buy something from amazon.com,

117
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,340
40% of what you pay

118
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,740
doesn't go to the capitalist who is selling you that stuff.

119
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,740
It goes to Jeff Bezos.

120
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,340
That's a cloud rent and he is a new form of feudal lord.

121
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,740
I think most people would accept this is a big new part of the global economy in the last 20 years,

122
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,540
where somebody might disagree with you as they would say,

123
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
well, Janice, this is ideological.

124
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,140
You're presuming that this is quite important, you know,

125
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,740
and highly discussed part of the economy, you know,

126
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,540
the richest person in the world, Elon Musk,

127
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,140
the world's largest companies or big tech companies.

128
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,140
I didn't ever think I'd see a $3 trillion company.

129
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,140
That's what Apple now is.

130
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,140
They would say, fine,

131
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,540
but look, wars still happen because of petrol,

132
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,540
because of food, because of access to clean drinking water.

133
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,340
The United States is worried about Taiwan because of its semiconductor manufacture.

134
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,740
So the world still revolves around resources, minerals,

135
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,540
rare earths and manufactured commodities.

136
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,340
Is that a criticism?

137
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,140
Does that disagree with what you're saying?

138
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,340
Or you presumably have a rebuttal to it?

139
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,140
Well, of course. I mean, it always did feudalism.

140
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:28,540
I mean, think of the great clashes between the medieval forces, medieval powers.

141
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,940
They were clashing over resources, over surplus distribution,

142
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,540
over ideologies, over a reach of empire.

143
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,540
That was happening well before capitalism was established.

144
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,940
So nothing has changed, feudalism, capitalism,

145
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,540
and now techno feudalism in that regard.

146
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,340
But if you're going to understand, for instance, you mentioned Taiwan,

147
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,540
why is Taiwan an issue now?

148
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
If you ask the United States government, they'll tell you,

149
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,140
because Beijing wants to gobble it up.

150
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,540
It always wanted to gobble it up.

151
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,740
I mean, the United States has never recognized Taiwan,

152
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,340
because it recognized as part of the deal between Nixon and Mao

153
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,140
that China has a claim to Taiwan.

154
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,940
So what is new exactly?

155
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,340
In my book, I try to explain what I think is new.

156
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,340
And it's the rise of cloud capital,

157
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
the shift from capitalism to techno feudalism.

158
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,540
Because if you think about it, after 1971,

159
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,540
when the gold standard died and the dollar was no longer exchangeable with gold,

160
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,540
the United States has built its power on a remarkable model of a world system,

161
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,340
whereby the United States has a huge trade surplus,

162
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,140
which acts as a vacuum cleaner, sucking into its territory

163
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,340
the products of Chinese capitalists,

164
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,340
or Chinese labor, to be precise,

165
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,740
of German, of Dutch, of Italian, Japanese, of course.

166
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,940
And how does it pay for that with IOUs called dollars?

167
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,340
Because it prints them.

168
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,940
And why do the Chinese, the Japanese, the German capitalists

169
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,140
accept those IOUs, the dollars,

170
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,740
because they use it to take it back to Wall Street

171
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,540
and to invest in real estate, in bonds,

172
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,740
effectively financing the American government.

173
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,140
So that's the model since the mid-1970s.

174
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,340
And that whole model is predicated upon what?

175
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,940
On the monopoly of the payment system of the dollar

176
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,540
and the dollar payment system.

177
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,540
What has happened in the last 10-15 years,

178
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,540
which I tried to map out in techno feudalism,

179
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,540
is that the Chinese are the only alternative locus

180
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,140
in which cloud capital emerged.

181
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,740
Europe has no cloud capital of its own.

182
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,540
We don't have a Google, we don't have a Facebook,

183
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,740
we don't have a Tesla, we don't have anything.

184
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,540
Zero. Europe, in that includes Britain.

185
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,740
The Chinese have.

186
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,940
We have only fans.

187
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,540
That's it.

188
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,140
So if you take an app like WeChat,

189
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,340
or if you take the digital currency that is being tested,

190
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,940
massively tested, 135 million accounts by the Central Bank of China,

191
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,540
they are developing the technology to have a payment system

192
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,940
which is denominated not in dollars, but in one.

193
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,740
This rise of Chinese techno feudalism,

194
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,940
if you want a Chinese cloud thief,

195
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,740
in contradiction with the American cloud thief,

196
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,140
explains why Taiwan is an issue.

197
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,940
Yeah, I think it's a really original explanation

198
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,740
for rising geopolitical tensions,

199
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,340
which I've not seen elsewhere.

200
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,540
I'm sure some people have sort of hinted at it.

201
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,540
But the idea that what's really upsetting the United States

202
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,740
is the emergence of big tech conglomerates

203
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,740
that can compete with their own ones.

204
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
And obviously, the most visible example of that

205
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,940
is the geopolitical fuel array around TikTok,

206
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,740
which you touched upon in the book.

207
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,940
And I think it is true to an extent

208
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,940
that clearly the world is diverging,

209
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,940
particularly as we move into a world of AI,

210
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,140
diverging into these two spheres of influence.

211
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,140
There was a great paper a few years ago by PricewaterhouseCooper

212
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,940
saying that AI was going to add around 17 trillion dollars

213
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,740
to the global economy by 2030-2035.

214
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,340
And almost all of this is going to China and the United States.

215
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,940
You know, none of it is going to South America or Africa.

216
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,540
Or Europe.

217
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,940
Or Europe, exactly.

218
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,740
So I find that a really original argument.

219
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,940
But to step back a bit,

220
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,740
because I think you just mentioned what you referred to

221
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,340
as the global minotaur in the book

222
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,340
and what happens after 1971,

223
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,540
which explains where we are now

224
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,140
and even things like US-China relations.

225
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,340
So let's go back to 1971.

226
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,340
We have the Disadoption of the Gold Standard by Nixon.

227
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,140
Why did that happen?

228
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,540
And what has it meant in the ensuing sort of period of 50 plus years now?

229
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,940
Thank you for the question,

230
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,140
which is very dear to my heart, as you probably know.

231
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,740
But before answering this,

232
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,740
allow me to preface it with a comment

233
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
about the thing you saw at the beginning.

234
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,940
It's not just the Americans that trumped initially in Biden later.

235
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,140
Why did that big tech in China is rising?

236
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,340
It's not just that.

237
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,140
That would not worry them so much on its own.

238
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,940
It is that Chinese big tech.

239
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,340
A company like Alibaba or Tencent

240
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,340
or Huawei is rising in a country

241
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,740
where the banking sector does not have autonomous power.

242
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,340
Unlike Britain.

243
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,940
Britain with the city of London and America with Wall Street.

244
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,540
In China,

245
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,340
because of the power of the Chinese Communist Party, the political power,

246
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,540
the big tech companies and the banks have fused to become one.

247
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,540
So you have an app like WeChat,

248
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,940
which is Elon Musk's wet dream.

249
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,740
What Elon Musk wants to do with Twitter is to replicate WeChat.

250
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,340
WeChat, imagine an app that does everything.

251
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,140
It shows you photographs, it plays music,

252
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,740
it shows movies, it allows you to communicate.

253
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,940
It's got something like Facebook on it

254
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,340
and allows you free payments, free payments.

255
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:12,540
You make payments and the bank does not retain anything either from you

256
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,940
or from the vendor.

257
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,940
The Americans do not have that.

258
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,540
And they do not have that because they don't have the technology to have that.

259
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,940
But because, you know, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America

260
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,540
will never allow Google and Apple to get away with it,

261
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,940
to take over their business.

262
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,340
But if you fuse together big tech with big finance,

263
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,940
you have something much more powerful,

264
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,140
which is what the Chinese have done,

265
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,140
than what the Americans have done, have created.

266
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,740
Another point about the Scoopta.

267
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,940
Look, I'm not into projections about what will happen in 20, 30 years time.

268
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,740
This is a book not of what is going to hit us in the next 5, 10 years.

269
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,740
This is a book about what has already happened.

270
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,140
And now to your question.

271
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,340
What happened in 1971,

272
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,740
which I explained in the Global Minuto, thank you for mentioning it,

273
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,140
and I can actually see a copy of it back there.

274
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,540
We're well read here at Navarro Media.

275
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,540
I can see that.

276
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,740
Well, thank you.

277
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,740
The story I tell in that book is that after the Second World War,

278
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:14,740
the United States created a centrally planned capitalist global economy.

279
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,940
Centrally planned.

280
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,940
Because if you think about it,

281
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,340
it's very difficult for young people today to wrap their minds around that.

282
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:27,140
Between 1944 and 1971, 72, 73, we had fixed exchange rates.

283
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,540
That is, you would never open the newspaper and try to find out

284
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,940
what the exchange rate between the pound and the French franc,

285
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,540
the pound that the US dollar was.

286
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,140
It was fixed for years.

287
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,140
I mean, I grew up in a world where there were 30 drachmas to a dollar, forever.

288
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,540
Interest rates were fixed.

289
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,340
Can you imagine a world where interest rates were not exactly fixed,

290
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,340
but more or less around 4%.

291
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,740
You knew that, you know, if you borrowed money, you would be paying 4% forever.

292
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,940
But that's like a centrally planned,

293
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,140
gospel and Soviet economy, more or less,

294
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,740
without common ownership of the means of production.

295
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,940
But it was planned.

296
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:11,740
The only way that could work was if all these currencies were effectively based on the US dollar.

297
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,140
So we had a dollar in different guises.

298
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,140
But the only way we could have the dollar in different guises

299
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,940
was that if the United States was a surplus country,

300
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,340
because if it was a surplus,

301
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,940
while it was a surplus country after the Second World War,

302
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,940
it was the only country that had a trade surplus.

303
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,340
Every time they sold a jet or a car or a washing machine to a Brit,

304
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,540
to a French person, to a German person,

305
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,140
a quantity of dollars would go to the United States.

306
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,740
So the United States would give us dollars,

307
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,140
dollarize us, martial aid, for instance,

308
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,740
other ways as well, same to Japan.

309
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,340
And then by selling us their wares,

310
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,740
we would return the dollars and that would complete the recycling loop.

311
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,140
But for that to happen, they had to have a trade surplus.

312
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,540
After 1968-69, they had a trade deficit,

313
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,340
which means that they were leaking dollars.

314
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:14,140
Dollars were a net stream or torrent of dollars

315
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,140
was coming to Europe and to Japan.

316
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,240
At some point, those who held the dollars,

317
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,640
Germans, Brits, Saudi Arabians, Japanese,

318
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,240
started worrying that they wouldn't be able to buy as much gold with the dollars

319
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,340
because there was this increasing quantity of dollars.

320
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,040
And that meant that the fixed exchange rate regime had to break down.

321
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,440
And it broke down.

322
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,840
And the Americans, instead of being yet another empire

323
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,240
that lost its power, its political power, its military power, its hegemonic power,

324
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,340
as a result of going into the red,

325
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,040
managed, and it's the only empire that has ever managed that,

326
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,640
to become more hegemonic by using their trade deficit

327
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,940
in the way that I described before,

328
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,740
to ensure that the Japanese, British, Dutch, German, French, Italian

329
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,540
and later Chinese capitalists,

330
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,640
needed the American trade deficit

331
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,640
as a source of demand for their net exports to the United States.

332
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,640
And this is the world that precipitated neoliberalism,

333
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,840
precipitated financialization,

334
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,640
the crazy bets that were placed in Wall Street

335
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,840
and, therefore, gave rise to the,

336
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,140
they gave rise, led to the crash of 2008.

337
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,340
And then, after that, the central banks of the West,

338
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,440
with the federal reserve, the American central bank,

339
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,640
leading the way, started printing all the money

340
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,940
that replaced capitalist profits.

341
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,640
This is another part of techno-feudalism.

342
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,040
So, this is more recently.

343
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,140
This is after 2009.

344
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,840
But the QE, there's an amazing,

345
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,240
before we get to 2008, 2009 and quantitative easing,

346
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,040
I think that's really important to say that any Marxist knows

347
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,240
that really, you know, the history of the last, you know,

348
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,540
75 years since World War II,

349
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,440
is a succession of trying to modify and address crises,

350
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,340
71, late 1980s, early 1990s,

351
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,740
early 2000s, 2008.

352
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,840
But what happens between 2002 and 2007,

353
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,940
with regards to financialization, is extraordinary.

354
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,540
And the numbers are just mind-blowing for me.

355
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,440
And you talk about this in the books.

356
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,040
So, in 2002, total global GDP,

357
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,940
that's all the economic transactions,

358
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,440
planetary economic transactions,

359
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,640
which are monetized, 50 trillion US dollars.

360
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,840
The worth of total global transactions by 2007 rises to 75 trillion.

361
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,940
So, it increases by 50%, which is obviously quite a lot.

362
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
But when you look at the sum of bets of what you call

363
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,840
in the global money market,

364
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,740
that rises from 70 trillion in 2002 to 750 trillion.

365
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,640
So, it's more than 10 times increased.

366
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,840
So, what happens between 2002 and 2007,

367
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,440
in terms of financialization

368
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,940
and this huge explosion in financialized debts?

369
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,840
The regulation.

370
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,440
Thatcherism and Reaganism reached its crescendo

371
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,240
with Blair, here in this country,

372
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,540
and with Clinton in the United States.

373
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,040
Effectively, the bankers were unshackled

374
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,340
from all the constraints of the New Deal,

375
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,540
the American New Deal,

376
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,540
and later the Clement Attlee

377
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,840
and 1950s government's constraints on bankers.

378
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,040
You see, governments had been burned once in 1929

379
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
because they're already in 20s,

380
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:37,640
where a period of unfettered financialization.

381
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,940
The bankers, let's not forget, create money out of thin air.

382
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,840
You know, people talk about the money tree

383
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,140
in order to lambast socialists,

384
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,740
but it is the bankers who have access to the money tree

385
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,440
and they can pluck as much money from thin air as they want.

386
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,340
And of course, when they overdo it,

387
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,340
under the weight of all those mountains of money

388
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,140
that they've created, they bugle under

389
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,440
and something like 1929 or 2008 happens.

390
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,240
After 1929...

391
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Because a certain amount of people can't pay back liabilities

392
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,140
and all of a sudden the whole thing's screwed.

393
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,440
When all these leveraged bets,

394
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,740
that is, bets based on borrowing from the future.

395
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,840
Not from other people, but from the future.

396
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Thin air.

397
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,940
You know, when...

398
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,940
Let's make this once again clear

399
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,140
that when Lloydsbank or Barclaysbank give you a loan,

400
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,040
they are not giving you money that somebody has saved.

401
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,640
They are conjuring it up like magicians.

402
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,440
So effectively, they type into your bank account,

403
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,640
10,000 pounds or 50,000 or 100,000 pounds.

404
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,340
That money doesn't exist.

405
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,440
It's out of thin air.

406
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,940
Bankers have this right that is given to them by society,

407
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,640
by you and me, by our listeners and audience.

408
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,540
And then of course, while these bets work out,

409
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,340
you know, if the borrowers manage to make this money

410
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,440
and also make the money to pay interest,

411
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,740
bankers are laughing all their way to their own banks.

412
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,840
Surprisingly, they're very profitable when it works like that.

413
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
Exactly. And then they think that they deserve the money.

414
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,540
But then at some point, all that is needed is a small pinprick

415
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,340
to deflate this or to burst that bubble.

416
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,540
And then what happens is you and I,

417
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,340
and especially the working class of our countries,

418
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,340
build them out and more money printing by central banks.

419
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,340
So after 2008-2009,

420
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,240
we had 35 trillion printed on behalf of bankers,

421
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,040
35 trillion dollars to put it in context.

422
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,540
Back then, back in 2009, when that started,

423
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,840
the total GDP income of the United States of America was 17-18.

424
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,840
So they printed 35 and they gave it to bankers.

425
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,540
Now bankers wanted to lend it to business people.

426
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,640
Business people, however, looked around at the little people out there

427
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
who were suffering under austerity,

428
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,140
who were in Pekinos, who couldn't buy anything,

429
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,640
as if they were going to invest it.

430
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:16,440
So all this money that is being printed ends up inflating asset prices,

431
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,540
artwork, house prices, and it never feeds into investment.

432
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,440
That's why in Britain now,

433
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,440
you have this ridiculously low level of productivity

434
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,540
because there's been no investment.

435
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,840
And the same thing in the European Union.

436
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,840
And the only entrepreneurs that care to take some of this liquidity

437
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,140
and not just put it back to the stock exchange

438
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,340
and instead use it to build up a new capital are the tech lords.

439
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,540
They took the money and society, in other words,

440
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:52,240
as a result of the inane handling by the establishment

441
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,740
and the central banks of the 2008 crisis,

442
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,540
effectively we have funded the build-up masses of cloud capital.

443
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,240
Cloud capital would always have been built, but not at that rate.

444
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,140
Let me put it in terms of somebody who should know,

445
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,440
McNamee, who wrote Zucht,

446
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,640
a tech investor who was part of Facebook,

447
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,840
one of the early investors in Facebook.

448
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,240
He agrees with my assessment,

449
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,340
he sent me an email recently saying so,

450
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:29,340
that nine out of the ten dollars that have been invested

451
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,940
in what I call cloud capital came from central bank money.

452
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,340
It's feudalism, remember?

453
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,240
The sovereign printed the money and the feudal lords used it

454
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,640
together with their property rights over land

455
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,640
to exploit the peasants and the vassals

456
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,240
which are today's capitalists who produce

457
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,840
in the old-fashioned way using machinery, industrial robots

458
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,340
without cloud capital.

459
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,540
And one last thing.

460
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,640
If you want to understand the difference between Volkswagen

461
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,540
and Tesla or Chinese cars,

462
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,240
understand this, Tesla is connected to the cloud.

463
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,640
That's why Elon Musk wanted Twitter.

464
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,240
Every time a Tesla goes around,

465
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,840
Tesla acquires enormous information about what music

466
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
you are listening to while you are driving, where you are going.

467
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,740
This is connected with the tweets that you send.

468
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,840
Therefore, the value added to Tesla comes increasingly from the cloud

469
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,440
and far less from the money you pay to buy the car.

470
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,240
Volkswagen, because it's German and Germany, Europe, Britain, France,

471
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Italy, Greece, we have not invested in cloud capital.

472
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,740
We cannot compete because we will never be able to compete.

473
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,340
Well, we, you and I, of course not.

474
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,040
But even our capitalists are vassals

475
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,240
to the American and Chinese cloudists,

476
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,040
the owners of cloud capital.

477
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,140
Navarro Media has been around for more than a decade.

478
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,340
It has grown to an extraordinary extent,

479
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,140
thanks to the generosity and kindness of our brilliant supporters.

480
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,740
The downstream in that context is a bit more recent.

481
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,240
It's only really appeared in the last couple of years.

482
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,340
It's now become our standout into your show here on YouTube.

483
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,240
It gives us an opportunity to talk about big ideas with brilliant minds,

484
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,440
the kinds of people wrestling with the challenges

485
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,940
we all have to confront in the 21st century.

486
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,540
If you enjoy downstream,

487
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,340
if you enjoy the rest of our content here at Navarro Media,

488
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,340
obviously click the YouTube subscribe button.

489
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,540
If you want to go further than that, support our work financially.

490
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,740
Make a one-off payment or a monthly one.

491
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,540
We obviously prefer the latter if you can.

492
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,640
And to do that, go to navarromedia.com forward slash support

493
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,540
to help build a people-powered media

494
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,140
because we can all have political commitments to change the world,

495
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,840
to get us out of the mess we find ourselves in.

496
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,940
But as long as the billionaires, the media oligarchs,

497
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,440
own media in Britain and elsewhere,

498
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
we're going to make very little progress.

499
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,840
So, like I say, help us build people-powered media.

500
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,440
Go to navarromedia.com forward slash support.

501
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,740
I mean, it's an elegant hypothesis,

502
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,440
but particularly this example you've just given of cars.

503
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,540
You talk about how basically the German car manufacturing industry is over

504
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,740
because their global comparative advantage

505
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,240
is in high-quality engineering, the combustion engine,

506
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,740
which is accumulated over 100-150 years.

507
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,240
Of engineering expertise.

508
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,840
But the cars of the 21st century require a very different skill set,

509
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,340
very different resources, and they're going to be made by,

510
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,840
if anyone, Alphabet, Apple eventually, Tesla, various Chinese companies.

511
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,840
So, I think it's very elegant in that regard.

512
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,940
And there's a really interesting point here as well.

513
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,240
You talk about it at the end of the book.

514
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,840
I don't want to talk about the end of the book just yet

515
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,740
because we're only getting started.

516
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,440
But about the kinds of coalitions you have to build.

517
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,540
There was a really fascinating side I heard recently,

518
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,040
which was the triumph of Donald Trump

519
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,840
can only be understood as a clash between national and family capital,

520
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,840
which is to say that family capital, petty bourgeois capitalists,

521
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,640
were onside with Trump against what they perceived

522
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,840
as a national variant of often cloud capital,

523
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,240
but also finance.

524
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,240
We'll talk about some big finance firms like BlackRock and whatnot.

525
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,340
And I thought that makes so much sense

526
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:16,040
because that is precisely the fragment of the capitalist class.

527
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,640
The petty bourgeois, we can talk about that.

528
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,140
It's quite a difficult one to really explain.

529
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,940
But that is the fragment which has been hammered by 15 years of QE,

530
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,840
which has been hammered by de-globalization, de-industrialization.

531
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,840
And so, for me, it's hugely interesting

532
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,940
that people who historically the left has been very ambivalent

533
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,940
about the petty bourgeois, the small business owner,

534
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,840
even the national capitalist making non-cloud commodities,

535
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,640
there's the space there for interesting forms of alignment and alliance.

536
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,040
This is absolutely correct.

537
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,440
But may I say that it is not entirely new.

538
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,340
Which social class was behind Mussolini and Hitler?

539
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,140
The petty bourgeois.

540
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:04,740
The petty bourgeois who was squashed by the crisis the 1920s in Italy

541
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,440
and then late 1920s and early 1930s in Germany.

542
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,540
Fascism is a petty bourgeois phenomenon.

543
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,040
It begins not from the working class,

544
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
it starts from the petty bourgeoisie

545
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
and then spreads to the working class

546
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:24,640
once the crisis of capitalism begins to deplete industrial workers' jobs.

547
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,240
Exactly the same happened after our generations, 1929,

548
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,640
which I keep saying happened in 2008.

549
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,340
Από 2008, the process of immiseration of the petty bourgeoisie

550
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,340
and the working class was worse than it was in the 1920s and 30s.

551
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,540
Because if you think about it, in the United States,

552
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,340
all the factories shifted to China and to Vietnam.

553
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,540
All of them, all of them, they just shifted.

554
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,740
And it was a part of what I call in the book a dark deal.

555
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,340
So the dark deal between Washington DC

556
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,540
and the Chinese Communist Party was,

557
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:10,640
okay, we will send you over our machinery, our industry.

558
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,840
You will produce the stuff.

559
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,040
We will keep the IP, the intellectual property rights,

560
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,740
in the case of Από.

561
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:23,440
So we will get a large share of the monopoly profits from selling iPhones,

562
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
but you will keep the share,

563
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,240
you'll keep the surplus value that you extract from your Chinese

564
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,840
proletariat.

565
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,540
You will be paid in dollars,

566
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,840
which of course we mint as a deficit country.

567
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,840
So they are worthless unless you send them back to Washington

568
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,040
and you will finance our government

569
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,040
and you will get an interest rate from the bonds,

570
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,840
the treasury bills that you will buy.

571
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,040
At the same time, you buy a real estate.

572
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,940
We will not let you buy companies unless they are useless

573
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,640
and not particular.

574
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,040
So you can't buy Google.

575
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,840
You can't buy Bank of America.

576
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,240
That's the same deal as they were given to the Japanese in the 1960s.

577
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,040
That is the deal that enriched Chinese capitalists

578
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
and American Reteers

579
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,740
at the expense of the American working class.

580
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,440
You know, people talk about the dominance of the dollar

581
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,640
and they assume that it's a good thing for the United States.

582
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,840
It isn't.

583
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,040
The dominance of the dollar is fantastic for Americans and Reeteers

584
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,240
and for Chinese capitalists

585
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
and Japanese capitalists and German capitalists.

586
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,040
And the people who actually suffer the most

587
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,040
as a result of the exorbitant privilege of the dollar

588
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,040
is the American working class,

589
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,240
which was serially abandoned by the Democratic Party

590
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,040
and politics hates a vacuum.

591
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Donald Trump waltzed in and took it.

592
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
And I suppose people just quickly on that, people might say,

593
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,040
oh well, we know that low income earners vote Democrat, etc.

594
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,240
Obviously, that's highly stratified on racial lines,

595
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
but in those states where Trump gets over the line in 2016,

596
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,240
former heavily industrialized states, Pennsylvania, Michigan,

597
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,640
that is precisely the story.

598
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
And I think even now, seven years later,

599
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,240
it's very hard for the left to understand that it was

600
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,440
former blue collar workers, many in trade unions

601
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,240
who took Donald Trump to the White House.

602
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
They may do again.

603
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,240
I mean, who knows, it's a different world now,

604
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,640
but you know, I think they might do again.

605
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,840
You say something as well, building on this,

606
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,440
which is the worst thing you want as a Chinese capitalist

607
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,240
is for Juan to be the global currency,

608
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,040
the global currency replacing the dollar,

609
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,640
which is quite funny because when people say

610
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,240
at the end of the dollar, you know, China is, you know,

611
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,040
heading towards hegemony status, blah, blah, blah.

612
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,640
Well, no, actually, if you're a Chinese exporter,

613
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,840
that's a terrible thing to be looking at.

614
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,240
Or a German exporter.

615
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,440
Why do you think the euro never competed with the dollar for supremacy?

616
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,640
Because the general capitalist would hate that.

617
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,840
Why do you think we have no euro bond?

618
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,240
Because the lack of the euro bond guarantees

619
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,640
that the euro will never compete with the dollar.

620
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,240
So German industrial capital does not want the euro bond,

621
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,440
doesn't care so much about, you know, fiscal union and so on.

622
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,840
It just doesn't want to lose access to the American trade deficit,

623
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,440
which is the reason why they're, you know,

624
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,440
amassing all this surplus value.

625
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,440
So, yeah, we must stop thinking in football terms, you know,

626
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
my nation against the other nation, you know,

627
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,440
England versus Argentina.

628
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,240
It's not that.

629
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,040
The division is within our countries.

630
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,240
It's between the capitalist class in China

631
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,040
and the proletariat in China.

632
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,840
The capitalist class or the rentier class,

633
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,440
not even the capitalist class, the rentiers

634
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,240
and the techno feudal lords in the United States

635
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,440
that have diametrically opposed interests

636
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,840
to those of 60% of the American population,

637
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,240
diametrically opposed interests.

638
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,840
So, yeah, let's go back to thinking as left wingers.

639
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,040
Can I ask a question?

640
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,640
This isn't in my notes,

641
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,840
but can I ask a question about the euro?

642
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,440
Because the argument you're making about euro bonds

643
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,440
is really interesting.

644
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,440
I have always been a critic of the euro

645
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,440
and I cannot understand why an Italian

646
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,440
or a French leftist supports the euro

647
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,440
because the whole euro project, as I understand it,

648
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
the whole basically that sort of political economy

649
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,640
of the euro zone seems to be premised upon the idea of,

650
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,240
well, basically it's for German exporters.

651
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,640
It's destroyed to historically powerful, you know,

652
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,240
manufacturer exporter oriented countries, particularly Italy.

653
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,640
You know, Italy is a share, the size of the economy.

654
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,640
It's a share of proportionate rather to the size of its economy.

655
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,040
Its manufacturing base wasn't about the same as Germany's,

656
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,840
even as recently as sort of 10, 15 years ago, before 2008.

657
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,040
And it seems obvious to me that membership of the euro zone

658
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,040
means permanent decline for Italians,

659
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
permanent decline for Italy's productive base.

660
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Permanent austerity.

661
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Yeah, permanent austerity, permanent.

662
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,840
And this is a G7 economy or G8 economy.

663
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,240
The same for France to a slightly lesser extent.

664
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,440
And yet there aren't major movements in either country

665
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,640
to leave the euro.

666
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,040
I find that... I find it extraordinary.

667
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,840
Now, I know there's huge downsides to leaving the euro.

668
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,040
It'd be very painful.

669
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,440
But the fact that's not even in the conversation

670
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,640
in both nations is perplexing for me.

671
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,440
It was in the conversation, but it was killed off.

672
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,640
Let me explain what the lure of the euro was for progressive people.

673
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,040
People who were not sellouts, turncoats.

674
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Because the turncoats, we know why they wanted the euro.

675
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,840
I have this memory of the 1970s,

676
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:55,040
when Greek trade unions would go on strike to gain some pay rise.

677
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,240
Strikes are always extremely painful.

678
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
There's a lot of sacrifice.

679
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,640
Usually the strikers are never compensated.

680
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
It's the strike breakers who get compensated

681
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,240
because they get the pay rise,

682
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,240
even though they have not suffered any of the costs of the strike.

683
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,040
The next day, or five days after securing a 5% wage in Greece,

684
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,440
the Bank of Greece would devalue their drachma and they would lose it all.

685
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,440
The notion of a currency that cannot be devalued

686
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,440
was very attractive even to trade unions.

687
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,640
What they did not factor in was that there was a price to pay for that.

688
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,440
The price was that there would be internal devaluation.

689
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:44,640
They would not find one morning that their currency,

690
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
the money they had in their wallet,

691
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,840
was devalued as a result of an action of the Bank of Greece.

692
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,640
But they would never get the pay rise.

693
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,040
Indeed, they would get pay cuts.

694
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,240
Don't forget that average wages today in Greece are 35% lower.

695
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,440
35% lower in nominal terms, not in absolute terms.

696
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,640
They were in 2007.

697
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
That's crazy.

698
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,040
Similarly with pensions.

699
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,840
So that they didn't factor in.

700
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,240
Once you get trapped into the Eurozone,

701
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,840
it's like being in a house which is on fire but has no fire exits.

702
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,840
You need to demolish the walls to get out.

703
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,040
You put it very nicely when you said that the costs are very large

704
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,640
because this exactly has been designed to make the costs very large.

705
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,240
You know that when we entered the Eurozone,

706
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,640
our printing presses were destroyed.

707
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,440
Did you know that?

708
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,040
No.

709
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,240
It was part of the deal.

710
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,040
No.

711
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
It was part of the deal.

712
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,840
You have to dismantle and destroy.

713
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,640
Your national myth.

714
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Like the IRA had to destroy its weapons as part of the good fighter agreement,

715
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,840
we had to destroy our printing presses as we entered the Eurozone.

716
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,840
Now somehow I don't believe that the Buddhist Bank,

717
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,640
the Germans destroyed their printing presses.

718
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,840
But we certainly did.

719
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,840
And so did the Italians.

720
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,040
That's extraordinary.

721
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,440
And what you just said there about nominal,

722
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,440
I mean, just for people to handle nominal means.

723
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Look, we're not talking about inflation or what you can buy.

724
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,040
We're literally talking about the currency.

725
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,440
And I saw a statistic recently

726
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,440
about the purchasing power of 18 to 35 year old Italians.

727
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
I can't remember the exact numbers but it's something like 50.

728
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,040
It's declined precipitously since the 1990s.

729
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,240
Yeah, I think it's basically 50% what it was 20 years ago.

730
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,040
And you think you only get to live once.

731
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,640
But that's why we have a new fascist in government.

732
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,840
Well, quite, exactly.

733
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Of course, people are going to be angry.

734
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,640
That's why the Socialist Party died.

735
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,240
That's why the Communist Party doesn't exist

736
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,040
because it accepted this process.

737
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:43,440
And the only voices that are supported by the public in Italy

738
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,040
are the ones who remain under establishment,

739
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,840
unfortunately, as descendants of Mussolini.

740
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,240
I mean, I understand why people are angry.

741
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,840
I do understand why they turn to the far right

742
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,440
because you only get one shot at life.

743
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,240
You're around for 70, 80 years

744
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,840
and there is a political settlement

745
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,040
which is screwing you over so badly.

746
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,040
It's depriving you of the life you expected,

747
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
which you deserve

748
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,840
and nobody in the political class is doing anything about it.

749
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,640
Don't forget the other great danger

750
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,840
for countries like Italy and Greece.

751
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,040
Immigration.

752
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,440
Not immigration.

753
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
Immigration.

754
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,840
The problem is not that the Africans are coming.

755
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,640
The problem is that the Greeks and the Italians are leaving.

756
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,640
Or particularly for Greece.

757
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,440
I mean, in recent years, it's extraordinary.

758
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Italy.

759
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,040
Young Italians are all over the place.

760
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
They're leaving.

761
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,240
Today, as we speak, they're leaving.

762
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,440
So do you think then, I mean,

763
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,840
so let's build on this for a moment.

764
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,240
We agree that the Eurozone

765
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
probably locks in permanent austerity industrial decline

766
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,840
for some really big countries,

767
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,040
historically France, Italy, Greece as well, of course.

768
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,640
Germany as well.

769
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,840
Because remember the class analysis?

770
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,840
The lower bottom of the German population

771
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,240
or income distribution

772
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,640
are now 15% worse off than they were 20 years ago.

773
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,240
Although, yeah, their capitalist class is doing very well.

774
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Yeah.

775
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
So the Greek capitalist class are doing extremely well.

776
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
Yeah.

777
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,840
The shipping magnets, yeah.

778
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,240
Not just the shipping magnets.

779
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
No.

780
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,040
I can give you names.

781
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,640
Please.

782
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,840
You know, Giannis Peristeris,

783
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,640
Metis Linnaeus, Melisandides.

784
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,240
They are not,

785
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,840
they don't make money so much out of shipping,

786
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,840
but they own the power generation

787
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,840
and power distribution network

788
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,840
as a result of the privatization

789
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,040
of our formerly nationalized power grid.

790
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,240
They charge an arm and leg for that.

791
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,040
The cost of living crisis, the energy crisis,

792
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,040
has allowed them to multiply by a factor of four

793
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,440
their surpluses.

794
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,840
They own every single television station

795
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,040
and anyone who dares speak their name in parliament

796
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,640
gets absolutely vilified and demonized.

797
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,040
So, you know, you have a dictatorship of those oligarchs

798
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,840
who are,

799
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,840
come to Athens and I'll take you to the northern suburbs.

800
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,640
You see the Lamborghinis and the Porsches and the Ferraris.

801
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,840
Well, I'll hold you to that, Giannis.

802
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Yeah.

803
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
You can show me.

804
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,840
It's a very ugly, very ugly scene.

805
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,040
Well, okay, so what I would say,

806
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,240
I'm not suggesting for a moment

807
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
that the German working class

808
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,040
could have better deal out of it,

809
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,240
but what I would say is

810
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,040
there is a fragment of Italian or French capital

811
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,840
who gets a really bummed deal out of this,

812
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,040
industrial capital,

813
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,240
which comparatively speaking,

814
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,040
was getting a better deal 25 years ago.

815
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,440
That's where they were giving a lot of money

816
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,440
from the coronavirus recovery fund

817
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,040
to keep them sweet.

818
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,440
And they kept them sweet.

819
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,040
They gave them something like, you know,

820
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,440
130 billion to keep them happy.

821
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,840
Let's talk about COVID,

822
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
because this is interesting, right?

823
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,040
Well, the pandemic was a major, major boon

824
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,240
because, you know, a manna from heaven

825
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,640
for the establishment.

826
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Manna from heaven.

827
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,640
I'm not talking about vaccines and all that, right?

828
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,840
I'm talking about an opportunity

829
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,040
to take on a lot more debt,

830
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,240
pile it up on the shoulders of the weaker of the working classes,

831
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,040
and distribute it amongst themselves.

832
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,640
Only in Greece, in 18 months, during the pandemic,

833
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,640
the right-wing government was allowed to borrow another 60 billion

834
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,440
in a country where GDP is 190.

835
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,440
That's a huge amount.

836
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,840
Given that we were already hugely indebted,

837
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,840
they gave them another 60 billion to spread the money around.

838
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,840
That's why they won the election.

839
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
So there are these moments that were chronicling

840
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,640
in the rise of first the global minotaur

841
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,040
and then what you call techno feudalism.

842
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,840
71, 2008, and then more recently, 2020.

843
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,640
A new claim, really, that after 2008,

844
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,640
Western capitalism has a 1929 moment.

845
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,040
But then through the years of QE and through the pandemic,

846
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,040
we basically see the end of capitalism as we know it.

847
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,040
Can you explain why all this money printing

848
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,840
that's primarily going to the top 0.01% or whatever we want to say,

849
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,840
why does that mean the end of capitalism

850
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,040
and the transition to something else?

851
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,040
You see, it depends on how you define capitalism.

852
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,440
Different people, I have a Marxist definition of capitalism,

853
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,840
but not everybody does.

854
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,840
Some people think, oh, the marketplace, buying and selling,

855
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
not having the state telling you what to buy

856
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,040
and how much to pay for it.

857
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,840
That's capitalism. No, it's not.

858
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,840
Capitalism is a system based on the private ownership

859
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:29,240
of the essential means of production

860
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,440
and a system which is predicated on profit

861
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,640
that comes out of surplus value,

862
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,440
exploitation of labor, of wage labor, and markets.

863
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,240
The whole point about the transition from feudalism to capitalism

864
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,840
was that you had had the process of commodification of land

865
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,840
as a result of the enclosures, getting rid of the peasants,

866
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,440
and commodification of labor.

867
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,440
During feudalism, land and labor didn't have markets.

868
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
Work has worked, but they couldn't quit.

869
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,440
They didn't receive a wage just at the feudal lords

870
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,040
and the sheriff over to collect rents from them.

871
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,440
So markets and profits.

872
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,840
There are two pylons on which capitalism sits.

873
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:14,840
Both of them are now optional and actually a sideshow.

874
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,440
Instead of profits, you have central bank money

875
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,040
combined with cloud rents.

876
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,240
The 40% of the price you pay on Amazon

877
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,840
but retained by Jeff Bezos.

878
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,640
All the surpluses that private equity firms get.

879
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,640
Remember, three companies, BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard,

880
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,840
own 90% of all companies in the New York Stock Exchange.

881
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,240
They don't make profits. They make rents.

882
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,040
So you have rent replacing profit

883
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:48,840
and Amazon.com-like companies, platforms, replacing markets.

884
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:53,040
Amazon.com, Alibaba, Uber, they are not markets.

885
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,240
They are platforms where trading takes place, buying and selling

886
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,240
outside the marketplace.

887
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,640
They are like digital fiefdoms

888
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,040
owned by a techno feudal lord who collects rents.

889
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,440
Remember, Uber doesn't have cars.

890
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,640
In the same way that the landlord didn't participate in production,

891
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,040
he simply collected.

892
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,440
That's what Uber does. That's what Airbnb does.

893
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,640
That's what Amazon.com does.

894
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,840
So if you replace the two pylons of capitalism

895
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,840
with rent, cloud rent primarily, and digital platforms,

896
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:31,240
and all that is founded on a foundation of cloud capital,

897
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,640
what you end up is something which is not my capitalism.

898
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,240
No, no, we could have called it capitalism.

899
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,040
I could have called the book digital capitalism.

900
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,240
I could have called it cloud capitalism.

901
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,640
I could have called it rentier capitalism.

902
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,040
Some people, some of my colleagues like Guy Standing,

903
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,440
called it rentier capitalism.

904
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,240
But you see, I think it's important to ditch the word capitalism.

905
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,640
Why? Because if this was the 1770s,

906
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,240
and we were talking about the state of the world,

907
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,840
what was going on then?

908
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,640
Capitalism was already upending and undermining feudalism,

909
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,240
taking over from feudalism.

910
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,840
We could have called the new system,

911
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,040
instead of calling it capitalism,

912
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,640
we could have called it industrial feudalism.

913
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,840
But that would have robbed us of the opportunity

914
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,440
to concentrate our mind that this is a great transformation.

915
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,040
This is not feudalism anymore.

916
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,640
Even though it would have been technically correct

917
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,840
to call it industrial feudalism or capital feudalism.

918
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,640
For the same reason,

919
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,040
I'm making the controversial claim that this is not capitalism anymore,

920
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,640
even though it is a result of the triumph of capital.

921
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,640
Before we go to the next question, the thing about Amazon,

922
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,040
I think can often be understated.

923
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
People think, oh, it's like you say,

924
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,040
these aren't necessarily market transactions.

925
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,440
It even goes beyond that to an extent.

926
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,440
So for instance, I'm sure people watching and listening

927
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,840
is just familiar with the Amazon basics range.

928
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,440
You get a product which looks almost exactly the same

929
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,240
as another one, but it's 30% cheaper or whatever.

930
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,240
Those products are created precisely

931
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,440
because they have the analytics to look at the most profitable products

932
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,440
with the best margins, with the highest volumes sold,

933
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,040
lowest customer returns, and they say,

934
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,440
let's make exactly the same thing.

935
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,840
So they don't just own the keys in terms of can I enter

936
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,840
the town square to sell my goods and services.

937
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:19,240
They also have data that the sellers don't have themselves.

938
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:19,840
Of course.

939
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
That is the whole point.

940
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,040
It's incredible.

941
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:22,840
Same with Uber.

942
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,640
Yeah, incredible.

943
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:29,040
Now, why can't Uber drivers get together and create their own app?

944
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,440
Well, they could, but that app would not have all the data

945
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,640
that Uber has on you and me, including their drivers.

946
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,240
So it is this cloud capital, the algorithm,

947
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:46,840
to put it this way, the algorithm which creates the land,

948
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,240
the digital land, where you must be in order to survive

949
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,240
as a capitalist and therefore a vassal or as a cloud surf.

950
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,840
Do you think we're going to have a war with China?

951
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,240
Very much so.

952
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,240
Very much so.

953
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:11,840
Every move that Biden is taking is one more step closer to some kind of confrontation.

954
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,040
Of course, I hope I'm wrong.

955
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,240
Maybe it won't happen.

956
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,240
Maybe it will happen, but it is a clear and present danger.

957
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,640
Because it seems to be something that people just underpriced,

958
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,240
that the idea of a conflict between two powers

959
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,840
as geopolitical influence shifts from the west to the east,

960
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,240
so that can't happen.

961
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,840
To me, it sounds like a recipe for disaster.

962
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,440
It is.

963
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,440
If you look at the nuclear war clock,

964
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,240
it's much closer to midnight now than it ever was.

965
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:48,040
So at least the nuclear scientists and the peace movement

966
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,440
that are running that particular measure of the risk

967
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,840
that we're facing as a species are not underselling it.

968
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,240
And given techno feudalism's concentration in the western hemisphere

969
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,840
and East Asia, does that mean Europe's over?

970
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,440
Does that mean just Europe is finished?

971
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,040
Yes, Europe is over.

972
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:16,240
I was chatting with Andrews Manuel, the president of Mexico a few months ago,

973
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,440
and we had this conversation.

974
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,240
And he said, Yanis, look, as a Mexican,

975
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,440
I'm closer to Europe than I am to the United States.

976
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,640
Culturally, spiritually, politically, ideologically.

977
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,240
But Europe is irrelevant to us.

978
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,440
It's a BRICS.

979
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,240
China, in other words, not a BRICS.

980
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,640
The only thing that matters from the BRICS is the sea.

981
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,040
China and our huge neighbor north of our border.

982
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,640
And I see this wherever I go, and it makes perfect sense.

983
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,840
Look, Aaron, let's just for a moment imagine with great hope

984
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,640
that there is a peace process that starts for Ukraine tomorrow.

985
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:00,040
It's a big table somewhere in the UN, Geneva, wherever.

986
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,640
We know who will represent Ukraine, Zelensky, Russia, Putin, America,

987
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,040
Biden, China, Xi, India, Modi.

988
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,840
Who's going to represent Europe?

989
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,440
You just ask yourself that question

990
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,840
and then suddenly you realize how irrelevant Europe is.

991
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,040
Because it used to be Merkel.

992
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,040
Merkel had the political power and clout to do it.

993
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,840
Schultz doesn't.

994
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,240
Macron doesn't.

995
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,640
Why?

996
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,040
Not only because they are peepsqueaks compared to Merkel.

997
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,240
They are.

998
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,640
But because anything they say will be vetoed

999
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,640
by the government of Poland, the government of Lithuania, Estonia,

1000
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,440
Finland, Sweden, who consider to them to be Putin's handmaidens,

1001
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,240
both Schultz and Macron.

1002
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,640
I'm not passing by your judgment.

1003
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,240
I'm simply describing.

1004
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,040
So the two countries that we have to pay for the reconstruction

1005
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,640
of Ukraine will not be allowed to represent the European Union

1006
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,640
in these negotiations.

1007
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,040
And so who will from the lion?

1008
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,840
I mean, she is only there because she failed as a minister

1009
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,640
in Merkel's cabinet and Merkel wanted to get rid of her

1010
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,040
and sent her to Brussels because in Brussels

1011
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,040
you can't hear them scream.

1012
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,040
Remember the line from Morgan.

1013
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,240
So Europe is politically.

1014
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,840
This political paralysis reflects the fact

1015
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,640
that we don't have any cloud capital.

1016
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,040
Yeah. Well, I would add as well.

1017
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,840
Europe's demographic pyramid is a nightmare.

1018
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,040
I mean, China's isn't great.

1019
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,240
Europe's is a nightmare.

1020
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,640
If you include obviously the Eastern Central Europe.

1021
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,040
Energy resources.

1022
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,840
You know that. That's what I insist.

1023
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,440
Cloud capital. Geography.

1024
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,640
It is cloud capital.

1025
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,640
Nothing else.

1026
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,240
Everything else we could have gotten out of.

1027
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:45,040
If you don't have a competitor to Google, a competitor to Uber,

1028
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,440
a competitor to Facebook, a competitor to Apple,

1029
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,840
a competitor to Amazon.com, if every German

1030
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:57,040
or Italian or French or British producer has to go through

1031
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,640
those cloud lists in order to sell their stuff.

1032
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,640
Even in Europe.

1033
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,040
And you know, Amazon makes 42 billion every year

1034
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:11,640
only in Europe and pays zero, zero tax, zero.

1035
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,640
Well, you're gone. You're finished.

1036
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,040
It's interesting as well with Europe

1037
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,840
because recently the sort of spokespeople

1038
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,640
and this isn't this might sound sort of like little England

1039
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,640
or something. It's not meant to be.

1040
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,240
It's just an observation.

1041
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,240
The sort of spokespersons of the last two years of Europe

1042
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,840
in the whole Ukraine, Russia conflict

1043
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,440
have really been statespeople from smaller countries.

1044
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,640
So this lady, Kaia Callas, I think, from Estonia,

1045
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,440
she's speaking on behalf of Europe

1046
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,240
and you think, well, then Europe must be buggered

1047
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,840
because if you've got, you can't have Sanamarin or Callas

1048
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,040
speaking on the behalf of the German, the French, the Italian,

1049
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,640
the British, the Spanish people

1050
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,440
with regards to big foreign policy choices

1051
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,040
because when push comes to shove,

1052
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,640
they're going to say, sod off.

1053
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,840
I don't know who you are. I've never seen you before.

1054
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,640
But within the media discourse, they've got, she's so brave.

1055
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,040
She might go work for NATO.

1056
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,840
She'll be the general secretary or whatever.

1057
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,240
We are deferring to NATO.

1058
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,440
The EU has gone.

1059
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,640
It's been replaced by NATO.

1060
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,840
Exactly.

1061
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,840
Whom we didn't know his name until the war in Ukraine.

1062
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,240
Suddenly he's running Europe and Callas.

1063
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,040
Look, I wouldn't mind if a woman, young woman from a small country

1064
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,440
represented me as European.

1065
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,240
I'd love that. Do you know what I mind?

1066
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,440
If you ask her, so what's the end game?

1067
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,440
Define victory in the war in Ukraine.

1068
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,440
The only logical answer consistent with what she wants and says

1069
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,040
is to take Moscow.

1070
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:41,040
Because she's talking about dragging Putin to the International Court.

1071
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,240
I would like all these bastards to be dragged to the International Court,

1072
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,040
including Tony Blair, right?

1073
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,040
Of course. Of course, I'd love that.

1074
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,240
But how are you going to drag Putin to the International Court?

1075
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,040
You have to take Moscow.

1076
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,440
There's no other way.

1077
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,640
Or you're going to have to incite a coup in Moscow

1078
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,440
that will bring about regime change.

1079
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,840
If that happens, because Putin has killed off all the progressives,

1080
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,640
whoever takes over from Putin will be worse than Putin.

1081
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,640
So Callas, Miss Callas,

1082
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,640
can you please tell me what your end game is?

1083
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,240
Her answer terrifies me.

1084
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,040
That's the problem I have with Miss Callas.

1085
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,040
There's this huge disconnect between foreign policy and defense preferences

1086
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,040
and the electorates, like the electorate don't matter.

1087
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,040
450, 400 million Europeans do not matter.

1088
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,640
Here's the final question.

1089
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,640
You say that we've seen the eclipse of capitalism really since 2008.

1090
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,240
You also think we've seen the death of liberalism

1091
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,640
and the idea of the liberal individual.

1092
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,840
What does that have to do with card capital?

1093
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,240
The whole point about liberalism is the celebration of the individual

1094
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,240
as a source of legitimacy.

1095
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,240
A country, a political system is legitimate in the liberal mind

1096
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:58,640
to the extent that it represents the autonomous will of individuals.

1097
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,640
Remember Thatcher?

1098
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,840
There is no such thing as a society.

1099
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,040
It's only individuals, families and individuals.

1100
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,040
But if the individual has a relationship with cloud capital,

1101
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,840
with Amazon's Alexa,

1102
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,640
whereby the individual trains Alexa to train the individual

1103
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,240
to train Alexa to train the individual to train Alexa,

1104
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,440
to put into the individual's mind what he wants,

1105
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,440
or she wants, or it wants,

1106
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,840
where is this autonomy?

1107
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,040
Hagek, the greatest guru of Thatcher,

1108
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,440
used to celebrate the market as a mechanism

1109
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,040
that not only finds the right prices to equilibrate demand and supply,

1110
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,640
but the mechanism that actually is allowing us to develop our own character.

1111
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,840
He used to say, you know, I go into a shop,

1112
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,640
come out with something I didn't even know I wanted.

1113
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,440
So the marketplace shapes me as a person,

1114
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,040
as an autonomous liberal individual on whom

1115
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,840
the whole liberal project is based.

1116
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,640
But if it's not the market, but a centrally planned system

1117
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,640
that the Soviet Union would love to have had,

1118
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,840
because that's what Amazon.com is,

1119
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,440
it's a centrally planned machine that belongs to one man,

1120
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,640
who could be Jeff Bezos or could be Joseph Stalin,

1121
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,440
then where is the liberal individual in this gone, in a buff of smoke?

1122
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,040
So basically this idea that there's a tyranny really of big tech,

1123
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,240
and it doesn't just inflect economies,

1124
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,840
but are sort of very psychic in psychology.

1125
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,040
I mean, that's a big claim.

1126
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,840
But it is Aaron, look, I was talking to some students of mine,

1127
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,240
a couple of years ago, and young people,

1128
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,840
who wanted a reference for me to find a job,

1129
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:38,240
to go and study post-graduate level,

1130
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,440
and I saw this, I saw this in full technical color.

1131
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,640
You know, they were angst-ridden, because they know,

1132
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,040
that when they go to get interviewed, for whatever,

1133
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,240
to go to university, but primarily to get a job, a good job,

1134
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,840
the interviewer will have checked their social media presence, footprint.

1135
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:58,640
Every photo that they upload, every video on TikTok, at midnight,

1136
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,040
they know, or they assume, will be seen.

1137
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,640
So there's no demarcation between work and play.

1138
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,240
And they are constantly trying to imagine what kind of self

1139
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,240
they should create in their own bosom, in their own soul,

1140
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,640
that will appeal to Google, or to Facebook, or to a good employer.

1141
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,840
That's the end of the liberal individual.

1142
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,640
To conclude, it sounds like we've returned to feudal Europe,

1143
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,040
but with a touch of the Stasi, doesn't sound good.

1144
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,040
I mean, that's a good explanation.

1145
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,040
But the Stasi would have loved Cloud Capital.

1146
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,040
They would be kicking themselves,

1147
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,840
because they created all these amazing mechanisms for surveillance.

1148
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,040
And this, we volunteered our information to this.

1149
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,840
Wiki Stasi.

1150
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,040
On that note, Yannis, it's a great book.

1151
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,240
Thanks so much for joining us today.

1152
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,040
Thank you so much.

1153
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,640
Hello, I'm Yannis Varoufakis.

1154
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:52,440
I'm at Novara Media, and I have a message for you.

1155
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:59,440
The best way of underpinning any kind of potential resistance

1156
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,040
to a very toxic establishment,

1157
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,040
without being populist anti-establishment,

1158
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,440
and by supporting good, irrational, humanist causes,

1159
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,640
is to support left-wing media like Novara Media.

1160
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,840
Novara Media and all such media need your support,

1161
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,840
because they certainly do not have the support of the establishment.

1162
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,440
Κάπη δήμ.
