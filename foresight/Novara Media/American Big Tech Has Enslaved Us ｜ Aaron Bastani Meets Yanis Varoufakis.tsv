0	10360	Αν δεν έχεις ένα καμπέτειο στο Google, ένα καμπέτειο στο Uber, ένα καμπέτειο στο Facebook, ένα καμπέτειο στο Apple, ένα καμπέτειο στο Amazon.com,
10360	19180	αν κάθε γερμανό ή οικογένειο ή οικογένειο ή οικογένειο πρότειο πρότειο πρέπει να πρέπει να πω σε αυτά τα κλαδελίσια για να βγω τα πράγματα,
19260	20580	όχι στην Ευρώπη.
21180	22860	Και, you know, Amazon,
23380	26840	κάνει 42 μιλίες κάθε χρόνια, μόνο στην Ευρώπη,
26840	30120	και παίρνει 0, 0 τάξι, 0.
31280	33280	Μετά, είσαι έλεγε, είσαι τελειών.
37720	44520	Με όλο το χρόνο, οι κοινότητες πιστεύουν ότι ο καπτλισμός θα τελειώσει και θα θα εξεχθεί από κάτι άλλο, κάτι καλύτερο.
45520	49760	Αλλά τι αν έγινε και ήταν εξεχθεί από κάτι πιστήχο, πιστήχο, πιστήχο.
50520	55780	Τι αν είμαστε πρότειο για το καπτλισμό, αλλά αυτό δεν δημιουργεί την εξογένειο,
55780	59560	την οικονομία, αλλά, πραγματικά, είναι πολύ μεγάλη ενακόλυση.
60260	62760	Αυτό είναι το υποθοσίο της σχέσης στις εξογένειες.
62760	66340	Ήθελε ότι είμαστε πρότειο για έναν κόσμο του φιουδολισμού,
66840	70460	όπου η επόμενη, σαν πιο, σαν την παράδειγμα,
70460	72960	αλλά με δίσκολα χρόνια.
73600	75660	Γιάννας Φαράφακκας, καθώς ήρθατε στο καπτλισμό.
76160	79920	Είναι πολύ καλό να είμαι πρότειο, ευχαριστούμε για την εξογένειο, είναι καλό να μιλήσω με εγώ.
79920	82520	Βέβαια, είπες ότι είναι καλό να είμαι πρότειο.
82520	85800	Είμαστε πρότειο για το 2015, πιστήχο.
86300	90060	Είσαι νιώθος τώρα, Γιάννας, όταν έγινε, έγινε 8 χρόνια, πώς έγινε.
90760	93780	Βέβαια, δεν είναι τifen, princess visiting,
93780	96820	για μια σύγχρομη και χορία λιγοφουνία χρόνια σου.
97460	99780	Αν είναι ότι είναι φίλοςuvo, είναι π από του φυγουλίου.
100080	100800	Από του φυγουλίου.
101180	102800	Maybe there's some advanced technology, you're not...
104800	106680	Very worn around the edges.
107200	109780	Became a very difficult year, very difficult year.
109780	112340	Will get on to that, particularly in regards to the politics of Greece,
112340	113980	but I think you mean more widely.
114140	118340	We're talking about your new book, which of course, is relevant,
118340	120140	Τεχνοφιουλισμό, το καπτολισμό.
122140	123540	Νομίζω, για εμένα,
123940	126540	στους τελευταίους που αντιμετωπίσεις το υποθοσύθο,
126540	127540	σε έναν μόνο,
128140	129940	τι αν έχουμε φτύξει το υποθοσύθο,
130340	131540	αλλά δεν είναι σωστολοσύθο.
132740	134540	Έτσι, μπορείτε να μεταξύσουμε αυτό λίγο,
134540	136540	επειδή, νομίζω, πιστεύουμε πιστεύουμε πιστεύουμε,
136540	139340	ότι είμαστε σε ένας υποθοσύθος,
139740	142140	δικαίου, δυγένουρος τρόπος του υποθοσύθο,
142140	144540	but your hypothesis is something a little bit different.
144940	146940	Oh, it's very different, it's profoundly different.
147540	150540	But let me remind you that
151340	154740	I'm not the first to hypothesize
155140	158540	that if socialism as a project fails,
158940	160540	we will end up with barbarism.
160540	161940	Remember Rosa Luxemburg,
162140	164740	the famous question from her prison cell?
165140	166540	Socialism or barbarism?
166540	168340	It turns out that it is barbarism.
168540	171340	And of course, it's very technologically advanced.
171940	175140	It is based on huge quantities of capital.
175140	176740	So capital has triumphed
177740	180740	and that answers the second part of your question.
180740	182340	Of course, wherever you look,
182940	186740	you come face to face with the triumph of capital,
187340	191340	with the triumph of those who own capital, capitalists.
191940	193540	But what I'm saying here is that
194940	197140	in the end, it wasn't the left,
197740	201940	the organized labor movement
202340	205140	that appended capitalism.
205340	208340	We used to think and hope that it would be labor
208540	211540	that is the comeuppance of capitalism.
211540	213940	With capitalism, remember what Marx said in Engels,
214140	217340	capitalism creates its grave diggers, the proletariat.
217740	220340	The organized laborers who will rise up
220540	223740	and take possession of the means of production of capital
223940	227340	and put it to good use for society as a whole.
227340	230940	It didn't happen, as you know, as we all know, unfortunately.
231340	234740	But what happened was another construct,
234740	238740	another product of capitalism did that job
238740	242940	and that other product was capital itself.
242940	244540	So my hypothesis is that this
246940	251940	is that capital was so successful, like a very toxic virus,
252540	256540	which kills off its host and therefore it cannot propagate itself,
256540	259540	like Ebola, which is a stupid virus unlike COVID-19.
259540	261540	COVID-19 killed very few people
262340	264340	as a percentage of those who were infected
264340	266540	and therefore it spread and became a pandemic.
266540	269540	Ebola never left particular villages in Africa
269540	271740	because it killed all of them before it could spread.
272540	276340	Capital developed a mutation of itself,
276540	279340	which are called cloud capital, a particular form of capital,
279740	281540	which has killed off capitalism its host.
281540	283740	That's my hypothesis.
283740	285140	I know it's extremely controversial.
285140	287140	Most of the people on the left do not like it at all
287140	287940	for two reasons.
287940	290340	Firstly, because they think, hang on,
291340	293140	it's all capitalism, it's not socialism.
293140	294140	How can that be?
294940	297340	And the answer is also Luxembourg, it's barbarism.
297740	301940	And the second reason is because our task as socialists
301940	305140	is now, if I'm right, it's immensely harder.
305740	308940	Because my point now is that you don't just have exploitation
308940	314540	in the enterprise, at the level of the firm,
314540	316940	on the factory or the shop floor.
317340	319540	That continues, of course.
319540	322740	It's the main spring of surplus value.
322740	325140	It's the only spring of surplus value to this day.
325140	327140	That has not changed from capitalism.
327140	329540	But what has happened is, if you're Jeff Bezos,
330140	333340	if you are the owner of Google, of Apple,
333340	335340	if you're Elon Musk,
335540	339340	then you own this new form of cloud capital,
339540	344540	which allows you to extract from the rest of society
344740	348140	from proletarians, but from everyone else as well,
349940	352340	huge quantities of rents and surpluses,
352940	357340	in a manner that reconstitutes a form of feudalism.
357540	361540	The difference is that instead of the original feudalism,
361540	365740	which is a system based on private ownership of land,
365740	369740	which produces rent, now it's private ownership of the cloud,
369740	371740	of cloud capital, because the cloud is capital, right?
371740	373740	It's not some cloud up in the sky,
374140	376340	which yields again a form of rent.
376340	378340	Every time you buy something from amazon.com,
378740	380340	40% of what you pay
380740	383740	doesn't go to the capitalist who is selling you that stuff.
383740	384740	It goes to Jeff Bezos.
384740	388340	That's a cloud rent and he is a new form of feudal lord.
389340	393740	I think most people would accept this is a big new part of the global economy in the last 20 years,
394540	396540	where somebody might disagree with you as they would say,
396540	398540	well, Janice, this is ideological.
398740	401140	You're presuming that this is quite important, you know,
401140	403740	and highly discussed part of the economy, you know,
403740	405540	the richest person in the world, Elon Musk,
405740	408140	the world's largest companies or big tech companies.
408140	410140	I didn't ever think I'd see a $3 trillion company.
410140	412140	That's what Apple now is.
412740	414140	They would say, fine,
414940	417540	but look, wars still happen because of petrol,
417740	420540	because of food, because of access to clean drinking water.
420740	424340	The United States is worried about Taiwan because of its semiconductor manufacture.
424740	429740	So the world still revolves around resources, minerals,
429740	432540	rare earths and manufactured commodities.
433140	434340	Is that a criticism?
434340	436140	Does that disagree with what you're saying?
436140	439340	Or you presumably have a rebuttal to it?
439340	442140	Well, of course. I mean, it always did feudalism.
442140	448540	I mean, think of the great clashes between the medieval forces, medieval powers.
449940	454940	They were clashing over resources, over surplus distribution,
454940	458540	over ideologies, over a reach of empire.
459140	461540	That was happening well before capitalism was established.
461740	464940	So nothing has changed, feudalism, capitalism,
464940	467540	and now techno feudalism in that regard.
468540	471340	But if you're going to understand, for instance, you mentioned Taiwan,
471340	472540	why is Taiwan an issue now?
474140	476140	If you ask the United States government, they'll tell you,
476140	480140	because Beijing wants to gobble it up.
480140	481540	It always wanted to gobble it up.
481740	483740	I mean, the United States has never recognized Taiwan,
483740	487340	because it recognized as part of the deal between Nixon and Mao
487740	490140	that China has a claim to Taiwan.
490340	491940	So what is new exactly?
492340	494340	In my book, I try to explain what I think is new.
494740	496340	And it's the rise of cloud capital,
496540	498540	the shift from capitalism to techno feudalism.
498940	503540	Because if you think about it, after 1971,
503940	508540	when the gold standard died and the dollar was no longer exchangeable with gold,
509740	516540	the United States has built its power on a remarkable model of a world system,
516540	521340	whereby the United States has a huge trade surplus,
521340	524140	which acts as a vacuum cleaner, sucking into its territory
524540	526340	the products of Chinese capitalists,
526740	528340	or Chinese labor, to be precise,
528940	532740	of German, of Dutch, of Italian, Japanese, of course.
533340	536940	And how does it pay for that with IOUs called dollars?
537540	538340	Because it prints them.
539140	541940	And why do the Chinese, the Japanese, the German capitalists
541940	544140	accept those IOUs, the dollars,
544140	547740	because they use it to take it back to Wall Street
547940	551540	and to invest in real estate, in bonds,
551540	553740	effectively financing the American government.
553740	557140	So that's the model since the mid-1970s.
557540	560340	And that whole model is predicated upon what?
560940	565940	On the monopoly of the payment system of the dollar
566340	567540	and the dollar payment system.
568940	571540	What has happened in the last 10-15 years,
571540	574540	which I tried to map out in techno feudalism,
574940	580540	is that the Chinese are the only alternative locus
581140	584140	in which cloud capital emerged.
584140	585740	Europe has no cloud capital of its own.
585740	587540	We don't have a Google, we don't have a Facebook,
587540	589740	we don't have a Tesla, we don't have anything.
590140	592540	Zero. Europe, in that includes Britain.
592940	593740	The Chinese have.
593740	594940	We have only fans.
595940	596540	That's it.
597540	601140	So if you take an app like WeChat,
601540	605340	or if you take the digital currency that is being tested,
605340	609940	massively tested, 135 million accounts by the Central Bank of China,
610140	612540	they are developing the technology to have a payment system
612540	614940	which is denominated not in dollars, but in one.
615340	619740	This rise of Chinese techno feudalism,
619740	622940	if you want a Chinese cloud thief,
623940	626740	in contradiction with the American cloud thief,
626740	629140	explains why Taiwan is an issue.
629140	630940	Yeah, I think it's a really original explanation
630940	632740	for rising geopolitical tensions,
633140	634340	which I've not seen elsewhere.
634340	636540	I'm sure some people have sort of hinted at it.
636740	639540	But the idea that what's really upsetting the United States
639540	641740	is the emergence of big tech conglomerates
642140	643740	that can compete with their own ones.
643740	645740	And obviously, the most visible example of that
645740	647940	is the geopolitical fuel array around TikTok,
648940	650740	which you touched upon in the book.
651140	652940	And I think it is true to an extent
652940	654940	that clearly the world is diverging,
654940	656940	particularly as we move into a world of AI,
657340	660140	diverging into these two spheres of influence.
660140	663140	There was a great paper a few years ago by PricewaterhouseCooper
663540	665940	saying that AI was going to add around 17 trillion dollars
665940	668740	to the global economy by 2030-2035.
669140	671340	And almost all of this is going to China and the United States.
671540	673940	You know, none of it is going to South America or Africa.
673940	674540	Or Europe.
674540	675940	Or Europe, exactly.
676340	679740	So I find that a really original argument.
680540	681940	But to step back a bit,
681940	684740	because I think you just mentioned what you referred to
684740	686340	as the global minotaur in the book
686340	688340	and what happens after 1971,
688540	691540	which explains where we are now
692740	695140	and even things like US-China relations.
695340	697340	So let's go back to 1971.
697540	701340	We have the Disadoption of the Gold Standard by Nixon.
702740	704140	Why did that happen?
704540	709540	And what has it meant in the ensuing sort of period of 50 plus years now?
710740	711940	Thank you for the question,
711940	714140	which is very dear to my heart, as you probably know.
714340	715740	But before answering this,
715740	717740	allow me to preface it with a comment
717740	719740	about the thing you saw at the beginning.
720140	723940	It's not just the Americans that trumped initially in Biden later.
724740	727140	Why did that big tech in China is rising?
727340	728340	It's not just that.
728340	731140	That would not worry them so much on its own.
731740	733940	It is that Chinese big tech.
735540	738340	A company like Alibaba or Tencent
739340	742340	or Huawei is rising in a country
742940	747740	where the banking sector does not have autonomous power.
747940	749340	Unlike Britain.
749540	752940	Britain with the city of London and America with Wall Street.
753340	754540	In China,
754940	758340	because of the power of the Chinese Communist Party, the political power,
759140	763540	the big tech companies and the banks have fused to become one.
764140	766540	So you have an app like WeChat,
766940	768940	which is Elon Musk's wet dream.
769540	772740	What Elon Musk wants to do with Twitter is to replicate WeChat.
772740	775340	WeChat, imagine an app that does everything.
775740	779140	It shows you photographs, it plays music,
779140	781740	it shows movies, it allows you to communicate.
782140	783940	It's got something like Facebook on it
784340	788340	and allows you free payments, free payments.
788940	792540	You make payments and the bank does not retain anything either from you
792540	793940	or from the vendor.
794740	795940	The Americans do not have that.
795940	798540	And they do not have that because they don't have the technology to have that.
798540	801940	But because, you know, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America
801940	805540	will never allow Google and Apple to get away with it,
805740	806940	to take over their business.
807540	810340	But if you fuse together big tech with big finance,
810340	811940	you have something much more powerful,
811940	813140	which is what the Chinese have done,
813140	817140	than what the Americans have done, have created.
817140	818740	Another point about the Scoopta.
819540	822940	Look, I'm not into projections about what will happen in 20, 30 years time.
822940	827740	This is a book not of what is going to hit us in the next 5, 10 years.
827740	829740	This is a book about what has already happened.
829740	831140	And now to your question.
831140	833340	What happened in 1971,
833340	835740	which I explained in the Global Minuto, thank you for mentioning it,
835740	838140	and I can actually see a copy of it back there.
839140	840540	We're well read here at Navarro Media.
840540	841540	I can see that.
841540	842740	Well, thank you.
842740	847740	The story I tell in that book is that after the Second World War,
847740	854740	the United States created a centrally planned capitalist global economy.
854740	855940	Centrally planned.
855940	856940	Because if you think about it,
856940	860340	it's very difficult for young people today to wrap their minds around that.
860340	867140	Between 1944 and 1971, 72, 73, we had fixed exchange rates.
867140	869540	That is, you would never open the newspaper and try to find out
869540	872940	what the exchange rate between the pound and the French franc,
872940	874540	the pound that the US dollar was.
874540	876140	It was fixed for years.
876140	881140	I mean, I grew up in a world where there were 30 drachmas to a dollar, forever.
881140	882540	Interest rates were fixed.
882540	886340	Can you imagine a world where interest rates were not exactly fixed,
886340	888340	but more or less around 4%.
888340	893740	You knew that, you know, if you borrowed money, you would be paying 4% forever.
894740	896940	But that's like a centrally planned,
896940	899140	gospel and Soviet economy, more or less,
899140	902740	without common ownership of the means of production.
902740	903940	But it was planned.
903940	911740	The only way that could work was if all these currencies were effectively based on the US dollar.
911740	915140	So we had a dollar in different guises.
915140	918140	But the only way we could have the dollar in different guises
918140	923940	was that if the United States was a surplus country,
923940	925340	because if it was a surplus,
925340	927940	while it was a surplus country after the Second World War,
927940	930940	it was the only country that had a trade surplus.
930940	937340	Every time they sold a jet or a car or a washing machine to a Brit,
937340	940540	to a French person, to a German person,
940540	943140	a quantity of dollars would go to the United States.
943140	945740	So the United States would give us dollars,
945740	948140	dollarize us, martial aid, for instance,
948140	950740	other ways as well, same to Japan.
950740	953340	And then by selling us their wares,
953340	957740	we would return the dollars and that would complete the recycling loop.
957740	961140	But for that to happen, they had to have a trade surplus.
961140	964540	After 1968-69, they had a trade deficit,
964540	968340	which means that they were leaking dollars.
968340	974140	Dollars were a net stream or torrent of dollars
974140	976140	was coming to Europe and to Japan.
976140	980240	At some point, those who held the dollars,
980240	983640	Germans, Brits, Saudi Arabians, Japanese,
983640	987240	started worrying that they wouldn't be able to buy as much gold with the dollars
987240	990340	because there was this increasing quantity of dollars.
990340	995040	And that meant that the fixed exchange rate regime had to break down.
995040	996440	And it broke down.
996440	1000840	And the Americans, instead of being yet another empire
1000840	1006240	that lost its power, its political power, its military power, its hegemonic power,
1006240	1008340	as a result of going into the red,
1008340	1012040	managed, and it's the only empire that has ever managed that,
1012040	1015640	to become more hegemonic by using their trade deficit
1015640	1017940	in the way that I described before,
1017940	1022740	to ensure that the Japanese, British, Dutch, German, French, Italian
1022740	1024540	and later Chinese capitalists,
1024540	1028640	needed the American trade deficit
1028640	1032640	as a source of demand for their net exports to the United States.
1032640	1036640	And this is the world that precipitated neoliberalism,
1036640	1040840	precipitated financialization,
1040840	1044640	the crazy bets that were placed in Wall Street
1044640	1046840	and, therefore, gave rise to the,
1046840	1050140	they gave rise, led to the crash of 2008.
1050140	1054340	And then, after that, the central banks of the West,
1054340	1056440	with the federal reserve, the American central bank,
1056440	1058640	leading the way, started printing all the money
1058640	1061940	that replaced capitalist profits.
1061940	1063640	This is another part of techno-feudalism.
1063640	1065040	So, this is more recently.
1065040	1066140	This is after 2009.
1066140	1067840	But the QE, there's an amazing,
1067840	1070240	before we get to 2008, 2009 and quantitative easing,
1070240	1074040	I think that's really important to say that any Marxist knows
1074040	1077240	that really, you know, the history of the last, you know,
1077540	1079540	75 years since World War II,
1079540	1083440	is a succession of trying to modify and address crises,
1083440	1087340	71, late 1980s, early 1990s,
1087340	1089740	early 2000s, 2008.
1089740	1092840	But what happens between 2002 and 2007,
1092840	1094940	with regards to financialization, is extraordinary.
1094940	1097540	And the numbers are just mind-blowing for me.
1097540	1098440	And you talk about this in the books.
1098440	1101040	So, in 2002, total global GDP,
1101040	1102940	that's all the economic transactions,
1102940	1104440	planetary economic transactions,
1104440	1107640	which are monetized, 50 trillion US dollars.
1107640	1113840	The worth of total global transactions by 2007 rises to 75 trillion.
1113840	1116940	So, it increases by 50%, which is obviously quite a lot.
1116940	1118940	But when you look at the sum of bets of what you call
1118940	1120840	in the global money market,
1120840	1126740	that rises from 70 trillion in 2002 to 750 trillion.
1126740	1128640	So, it's more than 10 times increased.
1128640	1131840	So, what happens between 2002 and 2007,
1131840	1133440	in terms of financialization
1133440	1137940	and this huge explosion in financialized debts?
1137940	1139840	The regulation.
1139840	1143440	Thatcherism and Reaganism reached its crescendo
1143440	1146240	with Blair, here in this country,
1146240	1149540	and with Clinton in the United States.
1149540	1154040	Effectively, the bankers were unshackled
1154040	1157340	from all the constraints of the New Deal,
1157340	1158540	the American New Deal,
1158540	1161540	and later the Clement Attlee
1161540	1166840	and 1950s government's constraints on bankers.
1166840	1171040	You see, governments had been burned once in 1929
1171040	1173040	because they're already in 20s,
1173040	1177640	where a period of unfettered financialization.
1177640	1183940	The bankers, let's not forget, create money out of thin air.
1183940	1186840	You know, people talk about the money tree
1186940	1189140	in order to lambast socialists,
1189140	1192740	but it is the bankers who have access to the money tree
1192740	1196440	and they can pluck as much money from thin air as they want.
1196440	1198340	And of course, when they overdo it,
1198340	1201340	under the weight of all those mountains of money
1201340	1204140	that they've created, they bugle under
1204140	1207440	and something like 1929 or 2008 happens.
1207440	1208240	After 1929...
1208240	1210240	Because a certain amount of people can't pay back liabilities
1210240	1212140	and all of a sudden the whole thing's screwed.
1212140	1215440	When all these leveraged bets,
1215440	1220740	that is, bets based on borrowing from the future.
1220740	1222840	Not from other people, but from the future.
1222840	1223840	Thin air.
1223840	1224940	You know, when...
1224940	1227940	Let's make this once again clear
1227940	1231140	that when Lloydsbank or Barclaysbank give you a loan,
1231140	1234040	they are not giving you money that somebody has saved.
1234040	1236640	They are conjuring it up like magicians.
1236640	1239440	So effectively, they type into your bank account,
1239440	1242640	10,000 pounds or 50,000 or 100,000 pounds.
1242640	1244340	That money doesn't exist.
1244340	1245440	It's out of thin air.
1245440	1249940	Bankers have this right that is given to them by society,
1249940	1253640	by you and me, by our listeners and audience.
1253640	1258540	And then of course, while these bets work out,
1258540	1262340	you know, if the borrowers manage to make this money
1262340	1265440	and also make the money to pay interest,
1265440	1267740	bankers are laughing all their way to their own banks.
1267740	1269840	Surprisingly, they're very profitable when it works like that.
1269840	1272240	Exactly. And then they think that they deserve the money.
1272240	1278540	But then at some point, all that is needed is a small pinprick
1278540	1282340	to deflate this or to burst that bubble.
1282340	1284540	And then what happens is you and I,
1284540	1287340	and especially the working class of our countries,
1287340	1292340	build them out and more money printing by central banks.
1292340	1296340	So after 2008-2009,
1296340	1300240	we had 35 trillion printed on behalf of bankers,
1300240	1304040	35 trillion dollars to put it in context.
1304040	1307540	Back then, back in 2009, when that started,
1307540	1311840	the total GDP income of the United States of America was 17-18.
1311840	1315840	So they printed 35 and they gave it to bankers.
1315840	1319540	Now bankers wanted to lend it to business people.
1319540	1322640	Business people, however, looked around at the little people out there
1322640	1324640	who were suffering under austerity,
1324640	1327140	who were in Pekinos, who couldn't buy anything,
1327140	1328640	as if they were going to invest it.
1328640	1336440	So all this money that is being printed ends up inflating asset prices,
1336440	1341540	artwork, house prices, and it never feeds into investment.
1341540	1343440	That's why in Britain now,
1343440	1346440	you have this ridiculously low level of productivity
1346440	1347540	because there's been no investment.
1347540	1349840	And the same thing in the European Union.
1349840	1356840	And the only entrepreneurs that care to take some of this liquidity
1356840	1359140	and not just put it back to the stock exchange
1359140	1364340	and instead use it to build up a new capital are the tech lords.
1364340	1367540	They took the money and society, in other words,
1367540	1372240	as a result of the inane handling by the establishment
1372240	1374740	and the central banks of the 2008 crisis,
1374740	1379540	effectively we have funded the build-up masses of cloud capital.
1379540	1383240	Cloud capital would always have been built, but not at that rate.
1383240	1389140	Let me put it in terms of somebody who should know,
1389140	1392440	McNamee, who wrote Zucht,
1392440	1395640	a tech investor who was part of Facebook,
1395640	1397840	one of the early investors in Facebook.
1397840	1400240	He agrees with my assessment,
1400240	1403340	he sent me an email recently saying so,
1403340	1409340	that nine out of the ten dollars that have been invested
1409340	1413940	in what I call cloud capital came from central bank money.
1413940	1417340	It's feudalism, remember?
1417340	1422240	The sovereign printed the money and the feudal lords used it
1422240	1424640	together with their property rights over land
1424640	1427640	to exploit the peasants and the vassals
1427640	1431240	which are today's capitalists who produce
1431240	1434840	in the old-fashioned way using machinery, industrial robots
1434840	1437340	without cloud capital.
1437340	1438540	And one last thing.
1438540	1440640	If you want to understand the difference between Volkswagen
1440640	1443540	and Tesla or Chinese cars,
1443540	1446240	understand this, Tesla is connected to the cloud.
1446240	1448640	That's why Elon Musk wanted Twitter.
1448640	1451240	Every time a Tesla goes around,
1451240	1453840	Tesla acquires enormous information about what music
1453840	1455840	you are listening to while you are driving, where you are going.
1455840	1458740	This is connected with the tweets that you send.
1458740	1462840	Therefore, the value added to Tesla comes increasingly from the cloud
1462840	1465440	and far less from the money you pay to buy the car.
1465440	1469240	Volkswagen, because it's German and Germany, Europe, Britain, France,
1469240	1472240	Italy, Greece, we have not invested in cloud capital.
1472240	1475740	We cannot compete because we will never be able to compete.
1475740	1477340	Well, we, you and I, of course not.
1477340	1481040	But even our capitalists are vassals
1481040	1484240	to the American and Chinese cloudists,
1484240	1486040	the owners of cloud capital.
1486040	1488140	Navarro Media has been around for more than a decade.
1488140	1490340	It has grown to an extraordinary extent,
1490340	1495140	thanks to the generosity and kindness of our brilliant supporters.
1495140	1497740	The downstream in that context is a bit more recent.
1497740	1500240	It's only really appeared in the last couple of years.
1500240	1504340	It's now become our standout into your show here on YouTube.
1504340	1508240	It gives us an opportunity to talk about big ideas with brilliant minds,
1508240	1511440	the kinds of people wrestling with the challenges
1511440	1513940	we all have to confront in the 21st century.

1527740	1530540	We obviously prefer the latter if you can.
1530540	1534640	And to do that, go to navarromedia.com forward slash support
1534640	1537540	to help build a people-powered media
1537540	1541140	because we can all have political commitments to change the world,
1541140	1544840	to get us out of the mess we find ourselves in.
1544840	1547940	But as long as the billionaires, the media oligarchs,
1547940	1551440	own media in Britain and elsewhere,
1551440	1553440	we're going to make very little progress.
1553440	1555840	So, like I say, help us build people-powered media.
1555840	1560440	Go to navarromedia.com forward slash support.
1560440	1562740	I mean, it's an elegant hypothesis,
1562740	1565440	but particularly this example you've just given of cars.
1565440	1568540	You talk about how basically the German car manufacturing industry is over
1568540	1571740	because their global comparative advantage
1571740	1575240	is in high-quality engineering, the combustion engine,
1575240	1577740	which is accumulated over 100-150 years.
1577740	1579240	Of engineering expertise.
1579240	1582840	But the cars of the 21st century require a very different skill set,
1582840	1585340	very different resources, and they're going to be made by,
1585340	1589840	if anyone, Alphabet, Apple eventually, Tesla, various Chinese companies.
1589840	1591840	So, I think it's very elegant in that regard.
1591840	1593940	And there's a really interesting point here as well.
1593940	1595240	You talk about it at the end of the book.
1595240	1596840	I don't want to talk about the end of the book just yet
1596840	1597740	because we're only getting started.
1597740	1601440	But about the kinds of coalitions you have to build.
1601440	1604540	There was a really fascinating side I heard recently,
1604540	1608040	which was the triumph of Donald Trump
1608040	1612840	can only be understood as a clash between national and family capital,
1612840	1617840	which is to say that family capital, petty bourgeois capitalists,
1617840	1620640	were onside with Trump against what they perceived
1620640	1623840	as a national variant of often cloud capital,
1623840	1625240	but also finance.
1625240	1628240	We'll talk about some big finance firms like BlackRock and whatnot.
1628240	1630340	And I thought that makes so much sense
1630340	1636040	because that is precisely the fragment of the capitalist class.
1636040	1637640	The petty bourgeois, we can talk about that.
1637640	1640140	It's quite a difficult one to really explain.
1640140	1643940	But that is the fragment which has been hammered by 15 years of QE,
1643940	1649840	which has been hammered by de-globalization, de-industrialization.
1649840	1652840	And so, for me, it's hugely interesting
1652840	1655940	that people who historically the left has been very ambivalent
1655940	1658940	about the petty bourgeois, the small business owner,
1658940	1662840	even the national capitalist making non-cloud commodities,
1662840	1666640	there's the space there for interesting forms of alignment and alliance.
1666640	1668040	This is absolutely correct.
1668040	1672440	But may I say that it is not entirely new.
1672440	1677340	Which social class was behind Mussolini and Hitler?
1677340	1679140	The petty bourgeois.
1679140	1684740	The petty bourgeois who was squashed by the crisis the 1920s in Italy
1684740	1689440	and then late 1920s and early 1930s in Germany.
1689440	1692540	Fascism is a petty bourgeois phenomenon.
1692540	1694040	It begins not from the working class,
1694040	1696040	it starts from the petty bourgeoisie
1696040	1698040	and then spreads to the working class
1698040	1704640	once the crisis of capitalism begins to deplete industrial workers' jobs.
1704640	1708240	Exactly the same happened after our generations, 1929,
1708240	1711640	which I keep saying happened in 2008.
1711640	1718340	Από 2008, the process of immiseration of the petty bourgeoisie
1718340	1722340	and the working class was worse than it was in the 1920s and 30s.
1722340	1726540	Because if you think about it, in the United States,
1726540	1729340	all the factories shifted to China and to Vietnam.
1729340	1732540	All of them, all of them, they just shifted.
1732540	1736740	And it was a part of what I call in the book a dark deal.
1736740	1739340	So the dark deal between Washington DC
1739340	1741540	and the Chinese Communist Party was,
1741540	1750640	okay, we will send you over our machinery, our industry.
1750640	1752840	You will produce the stuff.
1752840	1756040	We will keep the IP, the intellectual property rights,
1756040	1757740	in the case of Από.
1757740	1763440	So we will get a large share of the monopoly profits from selling iPhones,
1763440	1765840	but you will keep the share,
1765840	1769240	you'll keep the surplus value that you extract from your Chinese
1769240	1771840	proletariat.
1771840	1773540	You will be paid in dollars,
1773540	1776840	which of course we mint as a deficit country.
1776840	1780840	So they are worthless unless you send them back to Washington
1780840	1785040	and you will finance our government
1785040	1787040	and you will get an interest rate from the bonds,
1787040	1788840	the treasury bills that you will buy.
1788840	1790040	At the same time, you buy a real estate.
1790040	1793940	We will not let you buy companies unless they are useless
1793940	1794640	and not particular.
1794640	1796040	So you can't buy Google.
1796040	1798840	You can't buy Bank of America.
1798840	1804240	That's the same deal as they were given to the Japanese in the 1960s.
1804240	1810040	That is the deal that enriched Chinese capitalists
1810040	1812040	and American Reteers
1812040	1814740	at the expense of the American working class.
1814740	1817440	You know, people talk about the dominance of the dollar
1817440	1820640	and they assume that it's a good thing for the United States.
1820640	1821840	It isn't.
1821840	1825040	The dominance of the dollar is fantastic for Americans and Reeteers
1825040	1826240	and for Chinese capitalists
1826240	1829240	and Japanese capitalists and German capitalists.
1829240	1833040	And the people who actually suffer the most
1833040	1836040	as a result of the exorbitant privilege of the dollar
1836040	1838040	is the American working class,
1838040	1842240	which was serially abandoned by the Democratic Party
1842240	1845040	and politics hates a vacuum.
1845040	1849040	Donald Trump waltzed in and took it.
1849040	1851040	And I suppose people just quickly on that, people might say,
1851040	1854040	oh well, we know that low income earners vote Democrat, etc.
1854040	1856240	Obviously, that's highly stratified on racial lines,
1856240	1861440	but in those states where Trump gets over the line in 2016,
1861440	1865240	former heavily industrialized states, Pennsylvania, Michigan,
1865240	1866640	that is precisely the story.
1866640	1868640	And I think even now, seven years later,
1868640	1871240	it's very hard for the left to understand that it was
1871240	1873440	former blue collar workers, many in trade unions
1873440	1875240	who took Donald Trump to the White House.
1875240	1876240	They may do again.
1876240	1879240	I mean, who knows, it's a different world now,
1879240	1881640	but you know, I think they might do again.
1881640	1883840	You say something as well, building on this,
1883840	1887440	which is the worst thing you want as a Chinese capitalist
1887440	1891240	is for Juan to be the global currency,
1891240	1893040	the global currency replacing the dollar,
1893040	1894640	which is quite funny because when people say
1894640	1898240	at the end of the dollar, you know, China is, you know,
1898240	1901040	heading towards hegemony status, blah, blah, blah.
1901040	1902640	Well, no, actually, if you're a Chinese exporter,
1902640	1904840	that's a terrible thing to be looking at.
1904840	1906240	Or a German exporter.
1906240	1911440	Why do you think the euro never competed with the dollar for supremacy?
1911440	1914640	Because the general capitalist would hate that.
1914640	1916840	Why do you think we have no euro bond?
1916840	1920240	Because the lack of the euro bond guarantees
1920240	1922640	that the euro will never compete with the dollar.
1922640	1925240	So German industrial capital does not want the euro bond,
1925240	1929440	doesn't care so much about, you know, fiscal union and so on.
1929440	1933840	It just doesn't want to lose access to the American trade deficit,
1933840	1937440	which is the reason why they're, you know,
1937440	1940440	amassing all this surplus value.
1940440	1946440	So, yeah, we must stop thinking in football terms, you know,
1946440	1948440	my nation against the other nation, you know,
1948440	1951440	England versus Argentina.
1951440	1954240	It's not that.
1954240	1956040	The division is within our countries.
1956040	1960240	It's between the capitalist class in China
1960240	1962040	and the proletariat in China.
1962040	1963840	The capitalist class or the rentier class,
1963840	1965440	not even the capitalist class, the rentiers
1965440	1968240	and the techno feudal lords in the United States
1968240	1972440	that have diametrically opposed interests
1972440	1974840	to those of 60% of the American population,
1974840	1977240	diametrically opposed interests.
1977240	1980840	So, yeah, let's go back to thinking as left wingers.
1980840	1982040	Can I ask a question?
1982040	1983640	This isn't in my notes,
1983640	1985840	but can I ask a question about the euro?
1985840	1988440	Because the argument you're making about euro bonds
1988440	1990440	is really interesting.
1990440	1994440	I have always been a critic of the euro
1994440	1997440	and I cannot understand why an Italian
1997440	2000440	or a French leftist supports the euro
2000440	2003440	because the whole euro project, as I understand it,
2003440	2005440	the whole basically that sort of political economy
2005440	2008640	of the euro zone seems to be premised upon the idea of,
2008640	2011240	well, basically it's for German exporters.
2011240	2015640	It's destroyed to historically powerful, you know,
2015640	2019240	manufacturer exporter oriented countries, particularly Italy.
2019240	2021640	You know, Italy is a share, the size of the economy.
2021640	2024640	It's a share of proportionate rather to the size of its economy.
2024640	2027040	Its manufacturing base wasn't about the same as Germany's,
2027040	2030840	even as recently as sort of 10, 15 years ago, before 2008.
2030840	2034040	And it seems obvious to me that membership of the euro zone
2034040	2037040	means permanent decline for Italians,
2037040	2039040	permanent decline for Italy's productive base.
2039040	2040040	Permanent austerity.
2040040	2042040	Yeah, permanent austerity, permanent.
2042040	2046840	And this is a G7 economy or G8 economy.
2046840	2049240	The same for France to a slightly lesser extent.
2049240	2051440	And yet there aren't major movements in either country
2051440	2052640	to leave the euro.
2052640	2055040	I find that... I find it extraordinary.
2055040	2056840	Now, I know there's huge downsides to leaving the euro.
2056840	2058040	It'd be very painful.
2058040	2060440	But the fact that's not even in the conversation
2060440	2062640	in both nations is perplexing for me.
2062640	2066440	It was in the conversation, but it was killed off.
2066440	2072640	Let me explain what the lure of the euro was for progressive people.
2072640	2076040	People who were not sellouts, turncoats.
2076040	2079040	Because the turncoats, we know why they wanted the euro.
2081440	2086840	I have this memory of the 1970s,
2086840	2095040	when Greek trade unions would go on strike to gain some pay rise.
2095040	2097240	Strikes are always extremely painful.
2097240	2099240	There's a lot of sacrifice.
2099240	2102640	Usually the strikers are never compensated.
2102640	2104640	It's the strike breakers who get compensated
2104640	2106240	because they get the pay rise,
2106240	2110240	even though they have not suffered any of the costs of the strike.
2110240	2116040	The next day, or five days after securing a 5% wage in Greece,
2116040	2120440	the Bank of Greece would devalue their drachma and they would lose it all.
2120440	2125440	The notion of a currency that cannot be devalued
2125440	2128440	was very attractive even to trade unions.
2128440	2132640	What they did not factor in was that there was a price to pay for that.
2132640	2135440	The price was that there would be internal devaluation.
2135440	2144640	They would not find one morning that their currency,
2144640	2146640	the money they had in their wallet,
2146640	2150840	was devalued as a result of an action of the Bank of Greece.
2150840	2153640	But they would never get the pay rise.
2153640	2155040	Indeed, they would get pay cuts.
2155040	2160240	Don't forget that average wages today in Greece are 35% lower.
2160240	2164440	35% lower in nominal terms, not in absolute terms.
2164440	2166640	They were in 2007.
2166640	2167640	That's crazy.
2167640	2169040	Similarly with pensions.
2169040	2170840	So that they didn't factor in.
2170840	2175240	Once you get trapped into the Eurozone,
2175240	2179840	it's like being in a house which is on fire but has no fire exits.
2179840	2182840	You need to demolish the walls to get out.
2182840	2186040	You put it very nicely when you said that the costs are very large
2186040	2189640	because this exactly has been designed to make the costs very large.
2189640	2192240	You know that when we entered the Eurozone,
2192240	2194640	our printing presses were destroyed.
2194640	2195440	Did you know that?
2195440	2196040	No.
2196040	2197240	It was part of the deal.
2197240	2198040	No.
2198040	2199040	It was part of the deal.
2199040	2202840	You have to dismantle and destroy.
2202840	2203640	Your national myth.
2203640	2207640	Like the IRA had to destroy its weapons as part of the good fighter agreement,
2207640	2211840	we had to destroy our printing presses as we entered the Eurozone.
2211840	2214840	Now somehow I don't believe that the Buddhist Bank,
2214840	2217640	the Germans destroyed their printing presses.
2217640	2218840	But we certainly did.
2218840	2219840	And so did the Italians.
2219840	2221040	That's extraordinary.
2221040	2222440	And what you just said there about nominal,
2222440	2224440	I mean, just for people to handle nominal means.
2224440	2226440	Look, we're not talking about inflation or what you can buy.
2226440	2229040	We're literally talking about the currency.
2229040	2231440	And I saw a statistic recently
2231440	2235440	about the purchasing power of 18 to 35 year old Italians.
2235440	2237440	I can't remember the exact numbers but it's something like 50.
2237440	2240040	It's declined precipitously since the 1990s.
2240040	2243240	Yeah, I think it's basically 50% what it was 20 years ago.
2243240	2246040	And you think you only get to live once.
2246040	2247640	But that's why we have a new fascist in government.
2247640	2248840	Well, quite, exactly.
2248840	2249840	Of course, people are going to be angry.
2249840	2251640	That's why the Socialist Party died.
2251640	2253240	That's why the Communist Party doesn't exist
2253240	2256040	because it accepted this process.
2256040	2263440	And the only voices that are supported by the public in Italy
2263440	2267040	are the ones who remain under establishment,
2267040	2270840	unfortunately, as descendants of Mussolini.
2270840	2273240	I mean, I understand why people are angry.
2273240	2274840	I do understand why they turn to the far right
2274840	2276440	because you only get one shot at life.
2276440	2278240	You're around for 70, 80 years
2278240	2279840	and there is a political settlement
2279840	2283040	which is screwing you over so badly.
2283040	2285040	It's depriving you of the life you expected,
2285040	2287040	which you deserve
2287040	2289840	and nobody in the political class is doing anything about it.
2289840	2293640	Don't forget the other great danger
2293640	2295840	for countries like Italy and Greece.
2295840	2297040	Immigration.
2297040	2298440	Not immigration.
2298440	2299440	Immigration.
2299440	2303840	The problem is not that the Africans are coming.
2303840	2306640	The problem is that the Greeks and the Italians are leaving.
2306640	2307640	Or particularly for Greece.
2307640	2309440	I mean, in recent years, it's extraordinary.
2309440	2310440	Italy.
2310440	2312040	Young Italians are all over the place.
2312040	2313040	They're leaving.
2313040	2314240	Today, as we speak, they're leaving.
2314240	2315440	So do you think then, I mean,
2315440	2317840	so let's build on this for a moment.
2317840	2319240	We agree that the Eurozone
2319240	2321240	probably locks in permanent austerity industrial decline
2321240	2322840	for some really big countries,
2322840	2326040	historically France, Italy, Greece as well, of course.
2326040	2327640	Germany as well.
2327640	2329840	Because remember the class analysis?
2329840	2333840	The lower bottom of the German population
2333840	2335240	or income distribution
2335240	2338640	are now 15% worse off than they were 20 years ago.
2338640	2341240	Although, yeah, their capitalist class is doing very well.
2341240	2342240	Yeah.
2342240	2344240	So the Greek capitalist class are doing extremely well.
2344240	2345240	Yeah.
2345240	2346840	The shipping magnets, yeah.
2346840	2348240	Not just the shipping magnets.
2348240	2349240	No.
2349240	2350040	I can give you names.
2350040	2350640	Please.
2350640	2351840	You know, Giannis Peristeris,
2351840	2353640	Metis Linnaeus, Melisandides.
2353640	2355240	They are not,
2355240	2357840	they don't make money so much out of shipping,
2357840	2361840	but they own the power generation
2361840	2363840	and power distribution network
2363840	2365840	as a result of the privatization
2365840	2370040	of our formerly nationalized power grid.
2370040	2373240	They charge an arm and leg for that.
2373240	2375040	The cost of living crisis, the energy crisis,
2375040	2380040	has allowed them to multiply by a factor of four
2380040	2382440	their surpluses.
2382440	2385840	They own every single television station
2385840	2390040	and anyone who dares speak their name in parliament
2390040	2393640	gets absolutely vilified and demonized.
2393640	2396040	So, you know, you have a dictatorship of those oligarchs
2396040	2398840	who are,
2398840	2400840	come to Athens and I'll take you to the northern suburbs.
2400840	2403640	You see the Lamborghinis and the Porsches and the Ferraris.
2403640	2404840	Well, I'll hold you to that, Giannis.
2404840	2405840	Yeah.
2405840	2406840	You can show me.
2406840	2408840	It's a very ugly, very ugly scene.
2408840	2410040	Well, okay, so what I would say,
2410040	2411240	I'm not suggesting for a moment
2411240	2412240	that the German working class
2412240	2413040	could have better deal out of it,
2413040	2415240	but what I would say is
2415240	2418040	there is a fragment of Italian or French capital
2418040	2419840	who gets a really bummed deal out of this,
2419840	2421040	industrial capital,
2421040	2422240	which comparatively speaking,
2422240	2424040	was getting a better deal 25 years ago.
2424040	2425440	That's where they were giving a lot of money
2425440	2431440	from the coronavirus recovery fund
2431440	2433040	to keep them sweet.
2433040	2434440	And they kept them sweet.
2434440	2436040	They gave them something like, you know,
2436040	2440440	130 billion to keep them happy.
2440440	2441840	Let's talk about COVID,
2441840	2442840	because this is interesting, right?
2442840	2446040	Well, the pandemic was a major, major boon
2446040	2449240	because, you know, a manna from heaven
2449240	2450640	for the establishment.
2450640	2451640	Manna from heaven.
2451640	2454640	I'm not talking about vaccines and all that, right?
2454640	2457840	I'm talking about an opportunity
2457840	2461040	to take on a lot more debt,
2461040	2466240	pile it up on the shoulders of the weaker of the working classes,
2466240	2468040	and distribute it amongst themselves.
2468040	2472640	Only in Greece, in 18 months, during the pandemic,
2472640	2475640	the right-wing government was allowed to borrow another 60 billion
2475640	2478440	in a country where GDP is 190.
2478440	2480440	That's a huge amount.
2480440	2483840	Given that we were already hugely indebted,
2483840	2486840	they gave them another 60 billion to spread the money around.
2486840	2488840	That's why they won the election.
2488840	2490840	So there are these moments that were chronicling
2490840	2492640	in the rise of first the global minotaur
2492640	2495040	and then what you call techno feudalism.
2495040	2499840	71, 2008, and then more recently, 2020.
2499840	2503640	A new claim, really, that after 2008,
2503640	2507640	Western capitalism has a 1929 moment.
2507640	2512040	But then through the years of QE and through the pandemic,
2512040	2515040	we basically see the end of capitalism as we know it.
2515040	2517040	Can you explain why all this money printing
2517040	2520840	that's primarily going to the top 0.01% or whatever we want to say,
2520840	2522840	why does that mean the end of capitalism
2522840	2524040	and the transition to something else?
2524040	2527040	You see, it depends on how you define capitalism.
2527040	2530440	Different people, I have a Marxist definition of capitalism,
2530440	2531840	but not everybody does.
2531840	2534840	Some people think, oh, the marketplace, buying and selling,
2534840	2536840	not having the state telling you what to buy
2536840	2538040	and how much to pay for it.
2538040	2539840	That's capitalism. No, it's not.
2539840	2543840	Capitalism is a system based on the private ownership
2543840	2549240	of the essential means of production
2549240	2552440	and a system which is predicated on profit
2552440	2554640	that comes out of surplus value,
2554640	2558440	exploitation of labor, of wage labor, and markets.
2558440	2562240	The whole point about the transition from feudalism to capitalism
2562240	2566840	was that you had had the process of commodification of land
2566840	2569840	as a result of the enclosures, getting rid of the peasants,
2569840	2571440	and commodification of labor.
2571440	2575440	During feudalism, land and labor didn't have markets.
2575440	2577440	Work has worked, but they couldn't quit.
2577440	2579440	They didn't receive a wage just at the feudal lords
2579440	2583040	and the sheriff over to collect rents from them.
2583040	2584440	So markets and profits.
2584440	2587840	There are two pylons on which capitalism sits.
2587840	2594840	Both of them are now optional and actually a sideshow.
2594840	2597440	Instead of profits, you have central bank money
2597440	2600040	combined with cloud rents.
2600040	2603240	The 40% of the price you pay on Amazon
2603240	2605840	but retained by Jeff Bezos.
2605840	2609640	All the surpluses that private equity firms get.
2609640	2613640	Remember, three companies, BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard,
2613640	2617840	own 90% of all companies in the New York Stock Exchange.
2617840	2620240	They don't make profits. They make rents.
2620240	2624040	So you have rent replacing profit
2624040	2628840	and Amazon.com-like companies, platforms, replacing markets.
2628840	2633040	Amazon.com, Alibaba, Uber, they are not markets.
2633040	2637240	They are platforms where trading takes place, buying and selling
2637240	2639240	outside the marketplace.
2639440	2641640	They are like digital fiefdoms
2641640	2646040	owned by a techno feudal lord who collects rents.
2646040	2648440	Remember, Uber doesn't have cars.
2648440	2651640	In the same way that the landlord didn't participate in production,
2651640	2653040	he simply collected.
2653040	2656440	That's what Uber does. That's what Airbnb does.
2656440	2658640	That's what Amazon.com does.
2658640	2661840	So if you replace the two pylons of capitalism
2661840	2665840	with rent, cloud rent primarily, and digital platforms,
2665840	2671240	and all that is founded on a foundation of cloud capital,
2671240	2673640	what you end up is something which is not my capitalism.
2673640	2675240	No, no, we could have called it capitalism.
2675240	2680040	I could have called the book digital capitalism.
2680040	2682240	I could have called it cloud capitalism.
2682240	2685640	I could have called it rentier capitalism.
2685640	2688040	Some people, some of my colleagues like Guy Standing,
2688040	2690440	called it rentier capitalism.
2690440	2693240	But you see, I think it's important to ditch the word capitalism.
2693240	2697640	Why? Because if this was the 1770s,
2697640	2700240	and we were talking about the state of the world,
2700240	2701840	what was going on then?
2701840	2706640	Capitalism was already upending and undermining feudalism,
2706640	2708240	taking over from feudalism.
2708240	2710840	We could have called the new system,
2710840	2712040	instead of calling it capitalism,
2712040	2714640	we could have called it industrial feudalism.
2714640	2716840	But that would have robbed us of the opportunity
2716840	2719440	to concentrate our mind that this is a great transformation.
2719440	2721040	This is not feudalism anymore.
2721040	2722640	Even though it would have been technically correct
2722640	2726840	to call it industrial feudalism or capital feudalism.
2726840	2728640	For the same reason,
2728640	2732040	I'm making the controversial claim that this is not capitalism anymore,
2732040	2734640	even though it is a result of the triumph of capital.
2734640	2737640	Before we go to the next question, the thing about Amazon,
2737640	2739040	I think can often be understated.
2739040	2741040	People think, oh, it's like you say,
2741040	2743040	these aren't necessarily market transactions.
2743040	2744440	It even goes beyond that to an extent.
2744440	2747440	So for instance, I'm sure people watching and listening
2747440	2749840	is just familiar with the Amazon basics range.
2749840	2752440	You get a product which looks almost exactly the same
2752440	2755240	as another one, but it's 30% cheaper or whatever.
2755240	2757240	Those products are created precisely
2757240	2760440	because they have the analytics to look at the most profitable products
2760440	2764440	with the best margins, with the highest volumes sold,
2764440	2767040	lowest customer returns, and they say,
2767040	2768440	let's make exactly the same thing.
2768440	2772840	So they don't just own the keys in terms of can I enter
2772840	2775840	the town square to sell my goods and services.
2775840	2779240	They also have data that the sellers don't have themselves.
2779240	2779840	Of course.
2779840	2780840	That is the whole point.
2780840	2782040	It's incredible.
2782040	2782840	Same with Uber.
2782840	2783640	Yeah, incredible.
2783640	2789040	Now, why can't Uber drivers get together and create their own app?
2789040	2792440	Well, they could, but that app would not have all the data
2792440	2796640	that Uber has on you and me, including their drivers.
2796640	2801240	So it is this cloud capital, the algorithm,
2801240	2806840	to put it this way, the algorithm which creates the land,
2806840	2811240	the digital land, where you must be in order to survive
2811240	2817240	as a capitalist and therefore a vassal or as a cloud surf.
2817240	2819840	Do you think we're going to have a war with China?
2819840	2821240	Very much so.
2821240	2822240	Very much so.
2822240	2831840	Every move that Biden is taking is one more step closer to some kind of confrontation.
2831840	2835040	Of course, I hope I'm wrong.
2835040	2836240	Maybe it won't happen.
2836240	2841240	Maybe it will happen, but it is a clear and present danger.
2841240	2843640	Because it seems to be something that people just underpriced,
2843640	2847240	that the idea of a conflict between two powers
2847240	2850840	as geopolitical influence shifts from the west to the east,
2850840	2852240	so that can't happen.
2852240	2854840	To me, it sounds like a recipe for disaster.
2854840	2856440	It is.
2856440	2858440	If you look at the nuclear war clock,
2858440	2861240	it's much closer to midnight now than it ever was.
2861240	2868040	So at least the nuclear scientists and the peace movement
2868040	2872440	that are running that particular measure of the risk
2872440	2876840	that we're facing as a species are not underselling it.
2876840	2881240	And given techno feudalism's concentration in the western hemisphere
2881240	2884840	and East Asia, does that mean Europe's over?
2884840	2886440	Does that mean just Europe is finished?
2886440	2889040	Yes, Europe is over.
2889040	2896240	I was chatting with Andrews Manuel, the president of Mexico a few months ago,
2896240	2899440	and we had this conversation.
2899440	2902240	And he said, Yanis, look, as a Mexican,
2902240	2904440	I'm closer to Europe than I am to the United States.
2904440	2907640	Culturally, spiritually, politically, ideologically.
2907640	2910240	But Europe is irrelevant to us.
2910240	2911440	It's a BRICS.
2911440	2913240	China, in other words, not a BRICS.
2913240	2916640	The only thing that matters from the BRICS is the sea.
2916640	2922040	China and our huge neighbor north of our border.
2922040	2925640	And I see this wherever I go, and it makes perfect sense.
2925640	2931840	Look, Aaron, let's just for a moment imagine with great hope
2931840	2935640	that there is a peace process that starts for Ukraine tomorrow.
2935640	2940040	It's a big table somewhere in the UN, Geneva, wherever.
2940040	2945640	We know who will represent Ukraine, Zelensky, Russia, Putin, America,
2945640	2949040	Biden, China, Xi, India, Modi.
2949040	2951840	Who's going to represent Europe?
2951840	2953440	You just ask yourself that question
2953440	2955840	and then suddenly you realize how irrelevant Europe is.
2955840	2959040	Because it used to be Merkel.
2959040	2962040	Merkel had the political power and clout to do it.
2962040	2963840	Schultz doesn't.
2963840	2965240	Macron doesn't.
2965240	2966640	Why?
2966640	2970040	Not only because they are peepsqueaks compared to Merkel.
2970040	2971240	They are.
2971240	2974640	But because anything they say will be vetoed
2974640	2978640	by the government of Poland, the government of Lithuania, Estonia,
2978640	2983440	Finland, Sweden, who consider to them to be Putin's handmaidens,
2983440	2986240	both Schultz and Macron.
2986240	2987640	I'm not passing by your judgment.
2987640	2989240	I'm simply describing.
2989240	2992040	So the two countries that we have to pay for the reconstruction
2992040	2995640	of Ukraine will not be allowed to represent the European Union
2995640	2996640	in these negotiations.
2996640	2999040	And so who will from the lion?
2999040	3002840	I mean, she is only there because she failed as a minister
3002840	3005640	in Merkel's cabinet and Merkel wanted to get rid of her
3005640	3008040	and sent her to Brussels because in Brussels
3008040	3010040	you can't hear them scream.
3010040	3013040	Remember the line from Morgan.
3013040	3015240	So Europe is politically.
3015240	3017840	This political paralysis reflects the fact
3017840	3019640	that we don't have any cloud capital.
3019640	3022040	Yeah. Well, I would add as well.
3022040	3024840	Europe's demographic pyramid is a nightmare.
3024840	3026040	I mean, China's isn't great.
3026040	3027240	Europe's is a nightmare.
3027240	3029640	If you include obviously the Eastern Central Europe.
3029640	3031040	Energy resources.
3031040	3032840	You know that. That's what I insist.
3032840	3034440	Cloud capital. Geography.
3034440	3035640	It is cloud capital.
3035640	3036640	Nothing else.
3036640	3040240	Everything else we could have gotten out of.
3040240	3045040	If you don't have a competitor to Google, a competitor to Uber,
3045040	3048440	a competitor to Facebook, a competitor to Apple,
3048440	3052840	a competitor to Amazon.com, if every German
3052840	3057040	or Italian or French or British producer has to go through
3057040	3059640	those cloud lists in order to sell their stuff.
3059640	3061640	Even in Europe.
3061640	3066040	And you know, Amazon makes 42 billion every year
3066040	3071640	only in Europe and pays zero, zero tax, zero.
3071640	3073640	Well, you're gone. You're finished.
3073640	3075040	It's interesting as well with Europe
3075040	3076840	because recently the sort of spokespeople
3076840	3079640	and this isn't this might sound sort of like little England
3079640	3080640	or something. It's not meant to be.
3080640	3082240	It's just an observation.
3082240	3085240	The sort of spokespersons of the last two years of Europe
3085240	3088840	in the whole Ukraine, Russia conflict
3088840	3091440	have really been statespeople from smaller countries.
3091440	3094640	So this lady, Kaia Callas, I think, from Estonia,
3094640	3097440	she's speaking on behalf of Europe
3097440	3101240	and you think, well, then Europe must be buggered
3101240	3105840	because if you've got, you can't have Sanamarin or Callas
3105840	3109040	speaking on the behalf of the German, the French, the Italian,
3109040	3110640	the British, the Spanish people
3110640	3112440	with regards to big foreign policy choices
3112440	3114040	because when push comes to shove,
3114040	3115640	they're going to say, sod off.
3115640	3117840	I don't know who you are. I've never seen you before.
3117840	3120640	But within the media discourse, they've got, she's so brave.
3120640	3122040	She might go work for NATO.
3122040	3123840	She'll be the general secretary or whatever.
3123840	3125240	We are deferring to NATO.
3125240	3126440	The EU has gone.
3126440	3127640	It's been replaced by NATO.
3127640	3128840	Exactly.
3128840	3131840	Whom we didn't know his name until the war in Ukraine.
3131840	3134240	Suddenly he's running Europe and Callas.
3134240	3138040	Look, I wouldn't mind if a woman, young woman from a small country
3138040	3139440	represented me as European.
3139440	3142240	I'd love that. Do you know what I mind?
3142240	3145440	If you ask her, so what's the end game?
3145440	3149440	Define victory in the war in Ukraine.
3149440	3153440	The only logical answer consistent with what she wants and says
3153440	3156040	is to take Moscow.
3156040	3161040	Because she's talking about dragging Putin to the International Court.
3161040	3163240	I would like all these bastards to be dragged to the International Court,
3163240	3166040	including Tony Blair, right?
3166040	3168040	Of course. Of course, I'd love that.
3168040	3170240	But how are you going to drag Putin to the International Court?
3170240	3172040	You have to take Moscow.
3172040	3173440	There's no other way.
3173440	3177640	Or you're going to have to incite a coup in Moscow
3177640	3179440	that will bring about regime change.
3179440	3182840	If that happens, because Putin has killed off all the progressives,
3182840	3185640	whoever takes over from Putin will be worse than Putin.
3185640	3187640	So Callas, Miss Callas,
3187640	3190640	can you please tell me what your end game is?
3190640	3194240	Her answer terrifies me.
3194240	3196040	That's the problem I have with Miss Callas.
3196040	3200040	There's this huge disconnect between foreign policy and defense preferences
3200040	3202040	and the electorates, like the electorate don't matter.
3202040	3205040	450, 400 million Europeans do not matter.
3205040	3206640	Here's the final question.
3206640	3211640	You say that we've seen the eclipse of capitalism really since 2008.
3211640	3214240	You also think we've seen the death of liberalism
3214240	3216640	and the idea of the liberal individual.
3216640	3218840	What does that have to do with card capital?
3218840	3223240	The whole point about liberalism is the celebration of the individual
3223240	3226240	as a source of legitimacy.
3226240	3231240	A country, a political system is legitimate in the liberal mind
3231240	3238640	to the extent that it represents the autonomous will of individuals.
3238640	3239640	Remember Thatcher?
3239640	3240840	There is no such thing as a society.
3240840	3244040	It's only individuals, families and individuals.
3244040	3248040	But if the individual has a relationship with cloud capital,
3248040	3249840	with Amazon's Alexa,
3249840	3252640	whereby the individual trains Alexa to train the individual
3252640	3255240	to train Alexa to train the individual to train Alexa,
3255240	3257440	to put into the individual's mind what he wants,
3257440	3259440	or she wants, or it wants,
3259440	3261840	where is this autonomy?
3261840	3266040	Hagek, the greatest guru of Thatcher,
3266040	3268440	used to celebrate the market as a mechanism
3268440	3272040	that not only finds the right prices to equilibrate demand and supply,
3272040	3276640	but the mechanism that actually is allowing us to develop our own character.
3276640	3278840	He used to say, you know, I go into a shop,
3278840	3281640	come out with something I didn't even know I wanted.
3281640	3285440	So the marketplace shapes me as a person,
3285440	3290040	as an autonomous liberal individual on whom
3290040	3292840	the whole liberal project is based.
3292840	3296640	But if it's not the market, but a centrally planned system
3296640	3298640	that the Soviet Union would love to have had,
3298640	3300840	because that's what Amazon.com is,
3300840	3304440	it's a centrally planned machine that belongs to one man,
3304440	3308640	who could be Jeff Bezos or could be Joseph Stalin,
3308640	3313440	then where is the liberal individual in this gone, in a buff of smoke?
3313440	3317040	So basically this idea that there's a tyranny really of big tech,
3317040	3319240	and it doesn't just inflect economies,
3319240	3321840	but are sort of very psychic in psychology.
3321840	3324040	I mean, that's a big claim.
3324040	3327840	But it is Aaron, look, I was talking to some students of mine,
3327840	3331240	a couple of years ago, and young people,
3331240	3333840	who wanted a reference for me to find a job,
3333840	3338240	to go and study post-graduate level,
3338240	3341440	and I saw this, I saw this in full technical color.
3341440	3343640	You know, they were angst-ridden, because they know,
3343640	3346040	that when they go to get interviewed, for whatever,
3346040	3349240	to go to university, but primarily to get a job, a good job,
3349240	3352840	the interviewer will have checked their social media presence, footprint.
3352840	3358640	Every photo that they upload, every video on TikTok, at midnight,
3358640	3362040	they know, or they assume, will be seen.
3362040	3365640	So there's no demarcation between work and play.
3365640	3370240	And they are constantly trying to imagine what kind of self
3370240	3374240	they should create in their own bosom, in their own soul,
3374240	3378640	that will appeal to Google, or to Facebook, or to a good employer.
3378640	3380840	That's the end of the liberal individual.
3380840	3383640	To conclude, it sounds like we've returned to feudal Europe,
3383640	3387040	but with a touch of the Stasi, doesn't sound good.
3387040	3388040	I mean, that's a good explanation.
3388040	3390040	But the Stasi would have loved Cloud Capital.
3390040	3392040	They would be kicking themselves,
3392040	3395840	because they created all these amazing mechanisms for surveillance.
3395840	3399040	And this, we volunteered our information to this.
3399040	3400840	Wiki Stasi.
3400840	3403040	On that note, Yannis, it's a great book.
3403040	3404240	Thanks so much for joining us today.
3404240	3406040	Thank you so much.
3406040	3407640	Hello, I'm Yannis Varoufakis.
3407640	3412440	I'm at Novara Media, and I have a message for you.
3412440	3419440	The best way of underpinning any kind of potential resistance
3419440	3423040	to a very toxic establishment,
3423040	3427040	without being populist anti-establishment,
3427040	3432440	and by supporting good, irrational, humanist causes,
3432440	3436640	is to support left-wing media like Novara Media.
3436640	3440840	Novara Media and all such media need your support,
3440840	3444840	because they certainly do not have the support of the establishment.
3444840	3446440	Κάπη δήμ.
