00:00.000 --> 00:08.920
Neoliberalism has devastated so many people's ways of living and ways of working, forced

00:08.920 --> 00:13.600
them from their homes and their jobs, or made life increasingly precarious.

00:13.600 --> 00:19.240
So people are made nervous, they're made nervous by climate change, by war escalating

00:19.240 --> 00:23.360
as we speak.

00:23.360 --> 00:28.600
As a right-wing political operator, if you reach into that fear and say, guess what?

00:28.600 --> 00:35.520
The reason you're so afraid, the reason you're so anxious, the reason that the future is unclear,

00:35.520 --> 00:47.600
is gender or race or migration, you're able to reorganize and stoke those fears and anxieties

00:47.600 --> 00:55.080
in a direction that moves against those minorities or against those populations in favor of

00:55.080 --> 01:02.200
a really strong state.

01:02.200 --> 01:11.480
Hello and welcome to this very special edition of Downstream IRL, very kindly hosted by Reference

01:11.480 --> 01:12.720
Point.

01:12.720 --> 01:18.000
If you're watching this on YouTube, you've got no idea that 100 people have dragged their

01:18.000 --> 01:25.240
carcasses early in the morning to be with us today, and that's for a very special reason

01:25.240 --> 01:38.480
that I'm delighted to say that we are joined by Judith Butler, philosopher, author and

01:38.480 --> 01:44.320
as I found out this morning, fan of hard-boiled eggs.

01:44.320 --> 01:48.280
They need no introduction, but I'm going to do it anyway.

01:48.280 --> 01:54.120
They are the author of seminal works such as Gender Trouble, Bodies That Matter, Frames

01:54.120 --> 02:01.320
of War and their new book, Who's Afraid of Gender, which examines how a transphobic backlash

02:01.320 --> 02:06.760
morphed into an all-out war against so-called gender ideology.

02:06.760 --> 02:13.680
It takes us from the Vatican to the conservative right, and it best of all dissects how Britain

02:13.680 --> 02:19.840
became turf island.

02:19.840 --> 02:25.240
I'm so sorry that you have to be with us today, but I'm glad to be here, glad to be here.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.680
Very honored actually.

02:27.680 --> 02:34.880
So I guess my first question is, when someone pops up and says, what is a woman, what are

02:34.880 --> 02:35.880
they really asking?

02:35.880 --> 02:40.120
How is that such a good question?

02:40.120 --> 02:49.520
Well, it depends who's asking and to whom the question is addressed.

02:49.520 --> 02:55.520
But if Rishi Sunak asks that question of the Labour Party more generally, or its current

02:55.520 --> 03:02.440
representative, he's trying to ridicule them or catch them out because you look kind of

03:02.440 --> 03:09.200
foolish if you don't know, or you say, well, I'm not sure, or actually the category is

03:09.280 --> 03:10.280
open.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.240
It's like, oh, come on, it's common sense.

03:13.240 --> 03:24.200
Everybody knows you're like in some airy, obscurantist, woke ether, and you're having

03:24.200 --> 03:28.160
a problem with a very commonsensical question.

03:28.160 --> 03:36.720
So the person who asks it in that way is trying to ally with common sense or with the common

03:36.720 --> 03:38.600
people who share a common sense.

03:38.600 --> 03:43.400
But the so-called common people who share a common sense also might have a trans kid

03:43.400 --> 03:49.240
or a cousin or have a gender non-conforming uncle, didn't we all have a gender non-conforming

03:49.240 --> 03:50.240
uncle?

03:50.240 --> 03:52.320
I'm going to ask him.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.320
Yeah.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.320
No.

03:54.320 --> 04:00.840
I mean, it's a way of re-consolidating this idea of common sense, of natural difference,

04:00.840 --> 04:08.840
debunking those who open up the question as either detached intellectuals out of touch

04:08.840 --> 04:18.920
with common sense or with some kind of wokeism understood as a set of principles that are

04:18.920 --> 04:25.440
being imposed on common sense reality from a doctrinaire position.

04:25.440 --> 04:31.920
Is there a way to answer that question in good faith, in a way which is inclusive and

04:31.920 --> 04:38.360
acknowledges the variety of the human species, but also is able to grapple with that when

04:38.360 --> 04:42.880
someone says, woman, it doesn't mean something to most people?

04:42.880 --> 04:49.040
Well, I think if we were even to try to answer the question, we would need a multilingual

04:49.040 --> 04:50.040
framework.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.040
Right?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.040
What's that?

04:52.040 --> 05:01.560
Well, how are women referred to or understood in various languages, in various ways of speaking?

05:01.560 --> 05:04.760
How are women thought about in history?

05:04.760 --> 05:09.640
How has the idea of what a woman is changed in different histories, in different parts

05:09.640 --> 05:10.880
of the globe?

05:10.880 --> 05:13.320
So we would need a global framework.

05:13.320 --> 05:18.320
We would need a multilingual framework looking at different ways that women are defined.

05:18.320 --> 05:23.960
We would then need to understand why it was always so important to feminism to keep the

05:23.960 --> 05:24.960
question open.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.120
Why would feminists do that?

05:27.120 --> 05:33.280
Well, because they didn't like received ideas of what a woman is or is supposed to be, right?

05:33.280 --> 05:38.840
Stays at home, involved in reproductive labor alone, supposed to be sentimental, not supposed

05:38.840 --> 05:46.440
to be rational, not capable of certain kinds of labor, uniquely capable for other kinds

05:46.440 --> 05:48.360
of labor.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.880
We opened the question, what is a woman?

05:50.880 --> 05:56.360
We even opened the question, what does a woman want in psychoanalysis?

05:56.360 --> 06:02.280
We opened those questions because we were not happy with the ways in which those definitions

06:02.280 --> 06:05.360
were operating.

06:05.360 --> 06:14.680
And people did, of course, have some pretty intense ways of thinking about this.

06:14.680 --> 06:21.960
So if you live in a society in which women aren't supposed to do certain labor or aren't

06:21.960 --> 06:27.080
supposed to look a certain way, are you still a woman if you do that labor or you look a

06:27.080 --> 06:28.080
certain way?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.080
Right?

06:29.080 --> 06:33.440
We, as feminists, I thought, we're saying, yeah, you are, of course you are.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.080
You want to be a woman, come on in, of course you are.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.600
Let's expand that category.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.720
Let's make it more inclusive.

06:39.720 --> 06:46.680
So it's been important to an emancipatory project to keep the question of what a woman

06:46.680 --> 06:48.240
is open.

06:48.240 --> 06:53.800
So why would we, at a certain point in our illustrious history, as feminists, ever decide,

06:53.800 --> 06:56.840
no, we're closing the door.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.360
We're not going to extend the category.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.600
You can't claim it.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.960
Well, why not?

07:00.960 --> 07:05.840
We've been expanding that category, accepting its internal diversification for a really

07:05.840 --> 07:06.840
long time.

07:06.840 --> 07:10.360
We've gone on the streets for that purpose.

07:10.360 --> 07:14.520
Why would we suddenly decide, oh, this is the limit case?

07:14.520 --> 07:18.720
I mean, you're referring a lot to feminism there, and I suppose that leads me onto the

07:18.720 --> 07:25.600
question of why is it that in the UK, transphobia has come in the guise of feminism, so-called

07:25.600 --> 07:32.840
gender critical feminism, as opposed to the much more explicitly right-wing, family-oriented,

07:32.840 --> 07:36.360
religiously inflected iterations of other countries?

07:36.360 --> 07:37.840
That's such a good question.

07:37.840 --> 07:45.960
Well, first of all, let me just say, I think we need to reclaim feminism, transfeminism,

07:45.960 --> 07:50.360
intersectional feminism, post-ND colonial feminism.

07:50.360 --> 07:54.920
There are all kinds of feminisms out there that are really important abolitionists.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.320
Black feminism, we do not give feminism away.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.320
We do not.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.520
We reclaim it.

07:59.520 --> 08:08.240
We make sure that we know how to keep it open, keep it thoughtful, keep it self-critical.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.880
We talk about critical, gender-critical.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.920
I never understand what's being said.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.120
Because critical means, what does it mean if you're a feminist and you're critical?

08:18.120 --> 08:24.040
That means you call into question the presuppositions that you have received unthinkingly.

08:24.040 --> 08:27.400
It's like you become more thoughtful.

08:27.400 --> 08:32.680
You ask, well, why have I proceeded with that category in that way?

08:32.680 --> 08:38.600
You allow yourself to be changed by the history of emancipatory movements to rethink the fundamental

08:38.600 --> 08:44.680
categories and you have humility and you change and you become more inclusive and you

08:44.680 --> 08:50.440
offer more recognition and you accept that the categories that we often consider to be

08:50.440 --> 08:55.440
so fundamental are historically changing and it's a good thing because we want to be part

08:55.440 --> 08:57.360
of that historical change.

08:57.360 --> 09:07.880
I think that I can't give you the so-called account diagnosis of UK turfism.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.880
I think...

09:08.880 --> 09:13.800
We're undiagnosable as a country and they take great pride in that.

09:13.800 --> 09:22.680
But I do think it's against the background of a shattered left that these kinds of intensely

09:22.680 --> 09:27.520
sectarian fights start happening.

09:27.520 --> 09:32.640
The only way to have a political position is to identify perhaps as a woman or perhaps

09:32.640 --> 09:43.280
as a lesbian and to guard that territory and to make it into a kind of vault or a gated

09:43.280 --> 09:51.240
community that controls who can enter and who belongs.

09:51.240 --> 09:58.160
And I think that kind of territoriality happens when people are very unsure about their alliances

09:58.160 --> 10:05.600
or where they belong and what their broader political aims are.

10:05.600 --> 10:14.720
So I don't exactly know how to account for it but I do think that there are great fears

10:14.720 --> 10:22.880
that I hear trans-exclusionary feminists speaking about.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.400
They're afraid of being replaced.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.800
They're afraid of being violated.

10:26.800 --> 10:37.920
They're afraid of having the definition of womanhood appropriated.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.560
And I think it's worth thinking about, well, what are the conditions under which those

10:41.560 --> 10:43.360
become primary fears?

10:43.360 --> 10:48.200
And what are the ways of addressing that fear without seeking recourse to an exclusionary

10:48.200 --> 10:49.600
politics?

10:49.600 --> 10:54.520
It would be great if that could be opened as a debate, as a really serious question.

10:54.520 --> 11:00.000
I think we should take other people's fears seriously, especially when they turn quickly

11:00.000 --> 11:05.680
to either to hatred or to discriminatory or exclusionary politics.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.880
But maybe there's a way to go back to the fear and say, well, let's talk about that

11:08.880 --> 11:12.320
first and see whether another path is possible.

11:13.320 --> 11:17.600
I'm using the word transphobia quite broadly and of course a lot of the time what we're

11:17.600 --> 11:22.840
talking about is the demonization of trans women in particular.

11:22.840 --> 11:27.160
We're not talking about the demonization of trans men, though of course that does happen.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.560
I don't know.

11:29.560 --> 11:37.040
Trans men are called self-hating lesbians or whatever happened to the butch.

11:37.040 --> 11:45.440
The butch is being effaced from the earth and the trans, you know, you know.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.880
How are the butches getting along?

11:47.880 --> 11:48.880
Still there?

11:48.880 --> 11:49.880
Still all right?

11:49.880 --> 12:00.080
I mean, well, you can affirm a history as a butch and be a trans man and Jack Halberstam

12:00.080 --> 12:08.720
has taught us a little bit about how trans-astrics works in that way to be a more inclusive category.

12:08.720 --> 12:13.040
But why is it trans women in particular?

12:13.040 --> 12:18.080
Because when I try and sort of extract what the big story is from a lot of the things that

12:18.080 --> 12:22.560
I'm reading, whether it's in The Times of the Guardian, it's sort of this idea of, you

12:22.560 --> 12:29.120
know, here's someone who's assigned male at birth and they've got this power and they

12:29.120 --> 12:33.800
can only be using it for ill, they're becoming like a wolf in sheep's clothing or something

12:33.800 --> 12:35.680
like that.

12:35.680 --> 12:44.560
Is that a genuine fear or is it a convenient way of appropriating the position of the victim

12:44.560 --> 12:48.120
when wanting to oppress others?

12:48.120 --> 13:00.200
You know, I think the fear does rest on a misunderstanding or perhaps a willful ignorance

13:00.200 --> 13:07.280
about what trans masculinity is and how it operates or what trans femininity is and

13:07.280 --> 13:09.560
how it operates.

13:09.560 --> 13:15.480
And I think we need to go back to some fundamentals here.

13:15.960 --> 13:20.600
If you're assigned male at birth that doesn't immediately give you power.

13:20.600 --> 13:27.560
It's once you enter into the social world that you see what that assignment can mean.

13:27.560 --> 13:33.280
A lot of people assigned male at birth are really unhappy with that assignment and it

13:33.280 --> 13:37.320
doesn't serve them and in fact they suffer under it.

13:37.320 --> 13:44.360
And they may well not like the expectations of sexuality or the expectations of gender

13:44.360 --> 13:48.840
that go along with that assignment and contest it.

13:48.840 --> 13:56.080
Those folks have to go through some real social challenges to secure the sex assignment that

13:56.080 --> 14:01.360
they do want and need to live in the way that they want.

14:01.360 --> 14:12.000
So that history of suffering, of aspiration, of desire, that deep sense of self that needs

14:12.000 --> 14:19.920
and ought to have social recognition is not properly honored by those who would reduce

14:19.920 --> 14:30.080
somebody to their sex assignment or even the fact that they may well have a penis.

14:30.080 --> 14:35.760
Having a penis does not immediately give you social power, especially if you don't want

14:35.840 --> 14:37.840
it.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.200
It's just kind of complicated.

14:40.200 --> 14:45.120
Or you want it out of play or some other things are more erotic for you.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.000
We don't even have that discussion openly.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.920
It's just assumed like, oh, you're assigned male, you have a penis, therefore you are

14:52.920 --> 14:54.200
a potential rapist.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.320
Is that the way we feel about our sons?

14:56.320 --> 14:57.320
No.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.280
Our fathers, our friends, our lovers, no.

15:00.280 --> 15:05.400
We know that men negotiate social violence in different ways that a lot of men can be

15:05.720 --> 15:11.480
ethical and that masculinity is in the process of being reproduced in some interesting ways

15:11.480 --> 15:20.720
by trans men, by younger men who've been brought up by feminist parents or who've entered culture

15:20.720 --> 15:27.440
and learned a lot about what it is ethically to be a man, how to comport yourself ethically

15:27.440 --> 15:30.920
as a man in this world.

15:30.920 --> 15:31.920
We want that.

15:31.920 --> 15:32.920
We hope for that.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.280
We support that.

15:35.160 --> 15:42.520
Like I was saying about the category of woman, the category of man is also historical.

15:42.520 --> 15:48.800
We need to be interested in the social reproduction of masculinity and make sure it's being reproduced

15:48.800 --> 15:52.280
in some good ways.

15:52.280 --> 15:57.120
Not that the devil needs an advocate, but someone like J.K. Rowling or Julie Bindle,

15:57.120 --> 16:04.160
they would say that they're speaking up for the most disadvantaged women in society.

16:04.160 --> 16:09.760
Women in prison, survivors of domestic violence, and sure, debating who goes in what prison

16:09.760 --> 16:16.800
might be an edge case, but it certainly does matter if you're a woman in that prison.

16:16.800 --> 16:21.480
So what would you say to those people who would say that actually they're coming at

16:21.480 --> 16:23.960
it from a perspective of risk management?

16:23.960 --> 16:24.960
Yes.

16:24.960 --> 16:32.200
I wonder whether we could easily in the U.K., in the U.S. and elsewhere find statistics that

16:32.200 --> 16:38.560
support the notion that prison guards are actually more dangerous to women in prison.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.880
By whom are women in prison violated?

16:41.880 --> 16:46.640
Sometimes by other women, sometimes by prison guards, both men and women.

16:46.640 --> 16:51.400
I think the way gender operates, the way power operates in prison, the way sexual violation

16:51.400 --> 16:52.920
operates is a larger picture.

16:52.920 --> 17:00.440
I'd like to see the larger picture first, and then we can ask that question about this

17:00.440 --> 17:05.800
trans woman who happens to be in a women's prison rather than a men's, because what's

17:05.800 --> 17:11.440
going to happen to that trans woman in a men's prison, that trans woman is going to be the

17:11.440 --> 17:13.360
object of sexual violation.

17:13.360 --> 17:20.880
So if you say that person should, out of concern for the sexual violation of women, and we'll

17:20.880 --> 17:29.400
just leave that open category, that a trans woman should be in a men's prison, what you're

17:29.400 --> 17:37.920
doing is recommending sexual violation over there in order to protect yourself against

17:37.920 --> 17:42.200
the prospect, the fantasy of a sexual violation over here.

17:42.200 --> 17:47.320
Maybe we need the broader picture of how is sexual violation actually happening in prisons,

17:47.320 --> 17:51.240
and then we can make a more grounded judgment.

17:51.240 --> 17:56.640
I mean, what we know is that trans women in prisons in England or Wales are much more

17:56.640 --> 18:01.760
likely to be victims of sexual violation than perpetrators of sexual violation, and

18:01.760 --> 18:07.720
that broader picture of statistics bears that out, but someone might say, okay, drawing

18:07.720 --> 18:12.040
back to that bigger picture isn't telling me what to do with this immediate situation

18:12.040 --> 18:14.240
as and when it arises.

18:14.240 --> 18:19.320
There's a question of rights here and how you balance them, and I suppose I'm interested

18:19.320 --> 18:25.320
in, do you buy that there are conflicts of rights here, or are there ways to integrate

18:25.320 --> 18:26.320
them?

18:27.040 --> 18:35.040
The question for anybody who is at risk of being sexually violated in prison is what

18:35.040 --> 18:40.920
is the recourse within prison to protect oneself against it?

18:40.920 --> 18:47.840
So the group that we would want women to be protected against are all those who might

18:47.840 --> 18:49.320
violate them.

18:49.320 --> 18:59.720
So the same procedure that would be used against a male guard or a woman guard or the exceptional

18:59.720 --> 19:06.800
trans woman would hold.

19:06.800 --> 19:12.840
We wouldn't single out a particular group, especially if statistically that group is

19:12.840 --> 19:16.760
not primarily responsible for sexual violation in prison.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.960
So it's not on the basis of identity or classification that we make that decision.

19:21.960 --> 19:30.800
We say anybody who violates another person sexually needs to be held accountable, and

19:30.800 --> 19:36.560
we need procedures for that, but we don't discriminate against kinds of violators.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.040
They're all bad.

19:39.040 --> 19:43.240
But look, there's an obvious point here that probably needs to be restated, and I always

19:43.240 --> 19:45.640
forget.

19:45.640 --> 19:54.760
You can find your example of a trans woman who did, in fact, threaten or violate another

19:54.760 --> 19:55.880
woman in prison.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.440
You can find your example.

19:57.440 --> 20:05.200
But if you make that example into then the general truth of the category, all trans women

20:05.200 --> 20:12.360
are this way, or all trans women represent this risk, then you are actually engaging

20:12.360 --> 20:16.400
in what's technically transphobia.

20:16.400 --> 20:24.720
Because we wouldn't say, oh, you know, I went into this store, and I bought something from

20:24.720 --> 20:30.440
a Jewish store owner, and I think I was overcharged.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.720
Somebody said to you, oh yeah, all the Jews do that.

20:33.720 --> 20:38.920
You would say, fuck you, that's like, excuse my language, sorry, you would say that's anti-Semitism.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.640
Don't worry, I've heard that before.

20:41.640 --> 20:47.480
No, no, no, no, no, but seriously, or one black person does one thing, well, that's what

20:47.480 --> 20:51.880
black people, and that's what happens in right wing propaganda.

20:51.880 --> 20:56.200
That is exactly how presidential elections are run in the US.

20:56.200 --> 21:01.240
You find one migrant who did this one thing, and then that stands for all migrants.

21:01.240 --> 21:07.560
So that's a right wing strategy, it's a racist, it's a transphobic, it's an anti-Semitic

21:07.560 --> 21:08.560
strategy.

21:08.560 --> 21:12.880
You know how that works, you take the instance, you inflate it into the general category.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.760
So that needs to be stopped.

21:15.760 --> 21:19.080
Before we move on from this discussion about gender critical feminism, I'm going to do

21:19.080 --> 21:23.200
something really annoying and quote your own partner back to you, but as I was reading

21:23.200 --> 21:30.640
your book, I was wondering about whether this narrative that you get from gender critical

21:30.640 --> 21:35.640
feminists that trans and non-binary people are taking something from them.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.160
Yeah, what are they taking?

21:37.160 --> 21:44.120
Taking language, taking attention, taking social capital status from them.

21:44.120 --> 21:48.360
I wonder if that could be linked to Wendy Brown's idea of wounded attachment, that you have

21:48.360 --> 21:52.920
a wounded attachment to a position of marginality and there is a certain amount of social capital

21:52.920 --> 21:56.200
that comes with it, and you don't want to let it go.

21:56.200 --> 22:06.200
Well, if I understand Wendy Brown correctly.

22:06.200 --> 22:10.000
This is the scariest moment of my life, by the way.

22:10.000 --> 22:16.880
She's actually up the road, we could probably call her.

22:16.880 --> 22:25.000
We do suffer wounds, many of us, gay, lesbian, trans, women, people of color, workers, a

22:25.000 --> 22:31.040
lot of us have been wounded, exploited, violated, we come with histories of wounds, there's

22:31.040 --> 22:33.040
no question about it.

22:33.040 --> 22:37.400
The question is, do we then stay attached to that wound, and does that wound become

22:37.400 --> 22:43.280
the source of our identity, and we just stay as a wounded identity in the political sphere,

22:43.280 --> 22:49.520
and that's our operation to assert that wounded identity and stay attached to it?

22:49.520 --> 22:54.560
Or do we look around and say, well, who else got wounded, and what did they do to overcome

22:54.560 --> 22:58.120
those wounds, and what kind of alliances are necessary to make sure other people don't

22:58.120 --> 23:03.680
get wounded in this way, and that we can affirm life, not just from a wounded position, but

23:03.680 --> 23:11.600
from a place of what she's now calling reparation, or a place indeed of emancipation or social

23:11.600 --> 23:12.600
struggle.

23:12.600 --> 23:17.160
So, there are different trajectories that you can go through, but the question is, what

23:17.160 --> 23:25.440
is the wound to feminism, what's the wound to lesbianism really, if the category of

23:25.440 --> 23:30.600
women is expanded to include trans women?

23:30.600 --> 23:36.280
How do any of the people who live in that category, how are they actually suffering?

23:36.280 --> 23:41.540
It seems to me that what they're suffering from is a kind of hatred or phobia that is

23:41.540 --> 23:50.440
overwhelming to them, and that that's a corrosive set of emotions to live with, but I do understand

23:50.440 --> 23:53.560
that as, unfortunately, self-inflicted.

23:53.560 --> 23:59.360
I do think some of the debates here in the UK, especially online, where people are free

23:59.360 --> 24:05.000
to be as mean as they possibly can, some of the debates on all sides in the UK have been

24:05.000 --> 24:06.320
very disturbing to me.

24:06.320 --> 24:13.600
I don't think hideous insults and condemnations and accusations and vile ways of referring

24:13.600 --> 24:15.200
to other people are okay.

24:15.200 --> 24:22.560
I'd rather see kind of meaningful open debate on these issues, so I don't think social media

24:22.560 --> 24:30.120
has helped this so-called conflict, because it does escalate and foreground the cruelest

24:30.120 --> 24:37.640
and the meanest kinds of utterances, and maybe it's important to stay away from those.

24:37.640 --> 24:43.480
It's hard when you're fighting, you want to be cruel, you want to be snide, you want

24:43.480 --> 24:49.280
to ridicule people, you want to show that their position is preposterous.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.800
It's not going to persuade anybody.

24:51.800 --> 24:56.560
I think it might be better to figure out what are people really fearing and do they need

24:56.560 --> 24:59.880
to, and is there another way to talk about that?

24:59.880 --> 25:04.360
I want to move the conversation on a little bit.

25:04.360 --> 25:10.920
When somebody says, I'm a man, I'm a woman, I'm non-binary, it's not just about their

25:10.920 --> 25:15.040
right to perceive themselves in a certain way, it's also about the right to be perceived

25:15.040 --> 25:17.720
and affirmed and addressed in a certain way.

25:18.200 --> 25:23.240
I'm interested in the bit which is socially negotiated, so it's not just about what I

25:23.240 --> 25:29.240
say about myself, it's also about how other people address me, perceive me.

25:29.240 --> 25:34.680
Are there limits to the powers of self-definition?

25:34.680 --> 25:36.760
Tell me what you have in mind.

25:36.760 --> 25:43.480
So for instance, if I was to continue presenting in the way that I am now exactly the same

25:43.560 --> 25:48.120
and I was to say, actually, my preference would be for he, him pronouns, I'd like to

25:48.120 --> 25:53.160
be addressed as a man, there are lots of people who would say, I find this very challenging

25:53.160 --> 25:58.120
what I'm seeing in front of me and what you're asking me to do.

25:58.120 --> 26:03.840
There's a challenge here, so I've got the right to say, live with it, live with the

26:03.840 --> 26:05.840
challenge.

26:06.800 --> 26:12.800
I do think your question raises something interesting, the term gender.

26:16.800 --> 26:24.080
Back in the day, we would talk about the gender division of labor and some socialist

26:24.080 --> 26:28.040
feminists still do, and it's important to do that, especially as we think about care

26:28.040 --> 26:32.800
work and social reproduction, and their gender is not about identity, it's actually about

26:33.760 --> 26:39.120
how society is organized according to this exceedingly important power differential.

26:39.120 --> 26:44.400
So gender is a framework, it's a structure, and then there's gender identity, and some

26:44.400 --> 26:50.800
people think, oh, gender is just gender identity, it's become synonymous with or shorthand for.

26:51.840 --> 26:57.600
And then once we go into the question of gender identity, we see that there's gender

26:57.680 --> 27:03.280
presentation, how we appear to ourselves, perhaps or to others, and that can be very

27:03.280 --> 27:08.400
divergent, but that's divergent anyway, even among like so-called cis people.

27:08.400 --> 27:12.640
It's like, I think I look a certain way and you think I don't, and it's like, well, why?

27:12.640 --> 27:18.800
Well, because the way we perceive ourselves in the ways others perceive us can differ,

27:18.800 --> 27:21.200
and they can differ actually rather radically.

27:22.160 --> 27:32.560
So let's hold that in mind, that there's no bridging of that gap once and for all

27:33.120 --> 27:38.880
in my mind, even if you say, I'm a woman, and I say, yeah, I think you probably are,

27:39.760 --> 27:44.080
do we mean the same thing at that moment? Maybe not, maybe I'm thinking one thing

27:44.080 --> 27:50.880
and you're thinking another, okay. And there are different ways of being and presenting as a woman,

27:50.880 --> 27:54.480
right? And then it gets controversial. It's like, well, I don't think that presentation is,

27:54.480 --> 28:04.960
okay, in any case, my point is simply that very often of a felt sense of who one is

28:04.960 --> 28:13.200
and how one identifies is not always matched by a socially perceived gender presentation.

28:14.080 --> 28:22.000
And so if somebody tells you this is actually how I understand myself, this is my lived reality,

28:24.160 --> 28:31.520
you do have a challenge, but you have a challenge because you are, if you're having trouble

28:32.480 --> 28:36.480
reconciling a certain gender presentation with that person's self-definition,

28:37.200 --> 28:45.120
you're assuming that gender identification can be read off of gender presentation and it is not

28:45.120 --> 28:50.480
always the case. I understand that, and I understand that it's not always the case,

28:51.440 --> 28:57.040
but if I was talking to someone who was outside of this room, not super duper political, they say,

28:57.040 --> 29:04.640
it is quite often the case though. And as a society, we live by rules of thumb, we can change

29:04.640 --> 29:08.960
those rules of thumb when we come across an exception, but I make judgments in a generalized

29:08.960 --> 29:13.680
way. That's how I get through my day. We do, and it's actually one of the reasons why queer and

29:14.560 --> 29:20.000
gender non-conforming and trans kids have had such a hard time, because they're coming to school,

29:20.000 --> 29:25.120
they're looking the way they're supposed to look, more or less, where they're challenging that and

29:25.120 --> 29:30.320
people are just saying, you're in this category, you're in this one, we need to order society in a

29:30.320 --> 29:37.600
certain way. And what is the internal sense of suffering happens when you're put into a

29:37.600 --> 29:43.040
category that actually effaces who you are because you look a certain way to somebody

29:43.040 --> 29:51.360
who's imposing a set of social expectations on you at school, in religious institutions,

29:51.360 --> 29:55.840
on the street, in the family. It's like, but that's who you are, but that's how you look,

29:55.920 --> 30:03.600
but that's how I understand you. It's like, how to live with that deep sense of disjunction,

30:03.600 --> 30:09.520
and you're effaced by the very category by which you are generally recognized.

30:10.720 --> 30:14.720
So it seems to me that a lot of the time when I'm talking to people, I'm very, very much

30:14.720 --> 30:18.880
involved with trans rights. There's sort of two ways of understanding it. There's one way where

30:18.880 --> 30:24.000
you sort of say, okay, what we're asking for isn't very much at all. It is the right to be

30:24.000 --> 30:28.320
affirmed in our chosen gender, and that is not an imposition on anyone else at all.

30:29.360 --> 30:35.920
Changing how you speak, and it's coming from a respect for my humanity. And then there's

30:35.920 --> 30:41.920
another way of looking at it, which is saying, well, actually, people choosing to live in a gender,

30:41.920 --> 30:45.520
which is not the one they were assigned at birth, and straining against these categories,

30:45.520 --> 30:50.560
and challenging these categories, and the connections between gender identification,

30:50.560 --> 30:55.680
gender presentation, and socially recognized gender, that that is actually a really big deal.

30:56.240 --> 31:00.560
And so I suppose my question is, how much of a big deal is it? Is it a small

31:01.680 --> 31:07.600
alteration of social norms, or is it actually something which is a lot more fundamental

31:07.600 --> 31:14.000
that's being posed here? Inherently, we're talking about blowing up some of these categories of gender.

31:14.320 --> 31:22.800
Well, if you're a biological essentialist, it's a revolution. If you are

31:26.480 --> 31:33.040
a member of a right-wing partisan of the Catholic Church, and you believe in the

31:33.040 --> 31:38.080
natural family and creationism, and that God created male and female, it's revolutionary.

31:38.640 --> 31:45.120
Okay, so for all those folks, it's really rough. And I'm sorry that they're having a hard time,

31:45.120 --> 31:50.800
but I think they need to go through it, and come out the other end, and join the rest of us in a

31:50.800 --> 32:00.160
better world. So it's okay, you know. I mean, I accept it's hard. Sure, it's like deeply

32:00.160 --> 32:07.600
sentimented, kind of the lease and habits and ways of seeing. But it is true that a lot of people

32:07.600 --> 32:12.880
just want to be left alone and live without being pathologized and discriminated against,

32:12.880 --> 32:19.680
or the object of violence or disdain. And that seems right to be able to,

32:22.160 --> 32:27.360
like, natal women, they want to walk down the street without being harassed.

32:28.320 --> 32:34.880
Like natal women, they want to get a job without being discriminated against. They want to love

32:34.880 --> 32:40.640
who they want to love. They want their lives and their loves to be recognized minimally or

32:40.640 --> 32:48.160
maximally by society and to live in freedom and without fear. Seems pretty reasonable.

32:49.920 --> 32:55.680
One of the things that you object to in the book is an idea of self-definition as being

32:55.680 --> 32:59.280
simply a form of radical liberty. The idea of, well, anyone can do anything now.

32:59.280 --> 32:59.920
That's right.

32:59.920 --> 33:06.000
So what is self-definition if not a form of radical liberty? And not a simply a

33:06.000 --> 33:11.200
volunteerist decision of I'm just now? I think it's really important to understand

33:12.720 --> 33:22.480
that there's a wide range of positions about gender identification or what some would insist is

33:22.480 --> 33:29.040
sex identifications. Identify as the sex, right? So I don't want to any more at least make a

33:29.040 --> 33:34.240
distinction between sex as somehow natural and gender is somehow cultural and social.

33:34.800 --> 33:40.720
I think sex assignment is already political. It's already the act of social institutions.

33:40.720 --> 33:45.600
It's a way of organizing our bodies at the very beginning of time. So sex assignment is

33:45.600 --> 33:50.080
already the work of gender in my framework. You don't have to accept my framework.

33:50.960 --> 33:55.360
But I think for many people,

33:59.600 --> 34:04.160
the sex assignment they receive is deeply right and true and absolutely

34:04.720 --> 34:08.800
incontrovertible and they would never change it and they kind of like it or they really like it

34:08.800 --> 34:13.680
and they're living it out and it's all good. Okay, but that's a relationship to a sex assignment.

34:13.680 --> 34:18.960
Happens to be a very harmonious one. It's like, yeah, I was called a girl. Now I'm a girl and

34:18.960 --> 34:26.320
this girl is great and I'm working with this category and I love it. Okay, good. Go live, enjoy.

34:27.360 --> 34:30.800
I feel like you are channeling every member of the Spice Girls at once for that.

34:31.840 --> 34:36.480
We really, really were. Well, but it's also kind of, it's always been amazing to me how people

34:36.480 --> 34:43.280
like do their girl thing. It's like, wow. You know, and I'm still kind of a child. I think I was,

34:43.360 --> 34:49.600
and I was a child ethnographer. It's like, wow. Look at these people. They're like doing their

34:49.600 --> 34:55.680
gender in this way. It's like so amazing. It's like, wow, it's like a boy. It's like boy, boy.

34:56.240 --> 35:01.600
It's like doing this boy thing. It's like, wow. And I was like, you know, I was, I was in this

35:01.600 --> 35:10.000
ethnographic, you know, interval, like, not sure, not sure, can do either one very well.

35:10.640 --> 35:18.240
You know, so it's, but it's interesting. But then look for some people, it's very fundamental.

35:18.240 --> 35:23.600
Like this was never right. And for some, it's like, well, this was right for a while. That

35:23.600 --> 35:29.360
don't really wasn't right. Or this was okay for a while. And then it was not right. Or I'm able to

35:29.360 --> 35:36.560
change this category and the expectations that it makes of me and still stay within it. And others

35:36.560 --> 35:42.720
are like, I can't stay within this category. It's unlivable to me. So I think what we're asking

35:42.720 --> 35:48.720
about is what is the threshold of livability for people? And why wouldn't we respect that?

35:48.720 --> 35:54.480
If somebody says this, this is not livable. And this is, and this is my chance for a livable life.

35:54.480 --> 36:00.880
Why would we say, oh, no, no, no, sorry, you stay in the unlivable category and deprive you and we

36:00.960 --> 36:09.200
will deprive you of a livable life? No, I think if we're not cruel people, we accept that somebody

36:09.200 --> 36:14.800
is telling us what's livable and what's unlivable. But do we call that a choice? It's like, well,

36:16.800 --> 36:23.440
it may be that the deepest sense of who one is as a sexed being or

36:24.400 --> 36:32.080
as a gender if we're using that language is not fully formed by us, right? We find ourselves

36:32.080 --> 36:36.800
feeling a certain way. We find ourselves understanding ourselves in a certain way.

36:36.800 --> 36:44.320
We come to grips with our sense of reality. And it's, we're formed, we're formed by

36:45.360 --> 36:52.480
many different social familial institutional powers, but we also form ourselves or we come

36:52.480 --> 36:59.520
to understand ourselves. And it's at that point that we do make a choice, but it doesn't mean

36:59.520 --> 37:05.760
it's a choice from the very beginning. I mean, thinking about, you know, something that you

37:05.760 --> 37:11.760
said in your book is that no one individual or class owns a gender category. So you can't say

37:11.760 --> 37:20.160
what Beyonce does. So glad you said that. That was such an easy derailment. It really threw me

37:21.040 --> 37:24.240
like she's doing country music now, guys, and I really feel we need to discuss it.

37:25.520 --> 37:32.160
Taking over, just taking over. It's so easy to distract me. So easy. But like, you know,

37:32.160 --> 37:38.160
no one individual class owns gender categories apart from Beyonce, the exception to every

37:38.160 --> 37:45.360
philosophical rule. We're clear. Yeah, we are very, very clear. Does the same apply to race?

37:45.360 --> 37:50.240
Because when I saw Rachel Dollars out, I had this instinctive sense that there's something

37:50.240 --> 37:57.760
wrong here. Yes. But I don't own the category of race, right, no individual black person or class,

37:57.760 --> 38:02.400
right, socially constructed class of black people in the category of race. Rachel Dollars out saying,

38:02.400 --> 38:07.040
well, look, I'm identifying as a black woman, I live my life as a black woman. My appearance is

38:07.040 --> 38:12.720
such that people are treating me as a black woman. Is it logically coherent to have different rules

38:13.280 --> 38:19.840
for gender as opposed to race? Was it coherent for me to feel very differently about

38:19.840 --> 38:27.840
Rachel Dollars out than I intuitively think about gender identity? Well, first of all, I agree with

38:27.840 --> 38:40.880
you that what Rachel Dollars out did and what white people do who want to capitalize on

38:42.720 --> 38:51.600
cross-racial definition, identification, is completely objectionable. But they're not exactly

38:51.680 --> 38:59.280
parallel. As I was just saying, you know, gender is formed. It's very complicated.

39:00.160 --> 39:08.640
Race as a category, race as a classification has a different history. And anybody who works in

39:08.640 --> 39:15.200
intersectional feminism would know that you don't tell the history of gender in the exact same way

39:15.200 --> 39:20.960
you tell the history of race, you actually look to see how these categories are intersecting

39:20.960 --> 39:31.360
in specific sites and through historical practices. But I don't think that they are parallel

39:31.360 --> 39:40.480
because I don't even accept the idea that you just arbitrarily announce what your gender is.

39:40.480 --> 39:47.920
There's a formation process there. But racial identification is so intensely a

39:47.920 --> 39:53.360
matter of interpolation like how you have been born into the world in and through a set of

39:53.360 --> 40:00.640
racial categories and formed as part of a community or part of a demographic classification,

40:02.560 --> 40:08.480
how you've been treated, how your self-understanding emerges. So we need to tell the specific history

40:08.480 --> 40:19.200
of that in order to understand why what Donazal did was so inappropriate and wrong.

40:19.200 --> 40:30.080
And she wasn't... I think when this question gets posed in this way, it assumes like, oh,

40:30.080 --> 40:39.440
I'm just going to choose a new sex because I'm going to get some kind of publicity for this,

40:40.480 --> 40:48.960
like a fully volunteeristic notion. So I neither think of trans reassignment or self-definition

40:48.960 --> 40:58.400
as radically arbitrary, nor do I think it is possible or right for that to happen,

40:59.280 --> 41:14.080
for that particular kind of volunteeristic self-interested claim on blackness.

41:14.080 --> 41:22.880
I don't think that's ever justified. She didn't have that history. She didn't come into the world

41:22.880 --> 41:28.720
that way. She has not been interpolated. She has not lived through the history of that interpolation

41:28.720 --> 41:32.640
in the way that black people actually have. And that's a violation of that history.

41:33.840 --> 41:39.680
But when we're talking about the history of a trans person, well, they have been violated

41:39.760 --> 41:44.960
by categories, the wrong ones, and they're trying to emerge from violation. So let's think about

41:44.960 --> 41:50.320
where and how do we locate violation in both of those scenes? I mean, to take it away from

41:50.320 --> 41:57.920
Rachel Dolezal, perhaps locate it in someone who is racialized in a way which marginalizes them,

41:58.960 --> 42:02.560
you talk about the threshold of livability. For lots of people of color, they'd say, well,

42:02.560 --> 42:07.200
this racial category is a violation of my humanity, how it's been made and how I'm

42:07.200 --> 42:13.520
made to live in it the way society treats me. It is a violation. But the only thing there is to do

42:13.520 --> 42:20.480
is to sort of strain at what it might mean to be South Asian, to be Muslim, to be black, to be

42:20.480 --> 42:28.720
indigenous. And again, it's sort of saying, you know, is it okay to have just different rules for

42:28.720 --> 42:35.200
it? Like different rules, different pathways to go down when you are at that threshold of livability

42:35.200 --> 42:40.960
that is just different for race and for gender? Well, it is, although, you know,

42:43.200 --> 42:52.480
it's very funny that we're involved in a discussion about analogy, because race and gender are lived

42:52.480 --> 42:59.600
together. Like gender is never unmarked by race, race is never unmarked by gender, and we know this.

43:00.320 --> 43:07.680
And yet, analytically, we set up this kind of hypothesis, which forces us into a kind of separation

43:08.720 --> 43:15.360
that's problematic. But just to stay with your example, I mean, isn't the lived historical

43:15.360 --> 43:20.960
reality that there are people who are like, don't racialize me, I'm just a human, treat me like a

43:20.960 --> 43:27.680
human. Others are like, don't racialize me in this way. This is the way I am participating in and

43:27.680 --> 43:38.080
living out my racial affinity, identity, community. I may be straining against an interpolation that

43:38.080 --> 43:44.720
I feel like is falsifying or discriminatory, but I am also reproducing it in a way that I find to

43:44.720 --> 43:52.320
be affirmative, and actually making connections and coalitions among people of color or across

43:52.320 --> 43:59.440
even larger alliances. So we see that this is all lived out differently. I don't know if that answers

43:59.440 --> 44:05.600
your question, but I mean, that's the norm. That's the descriptive fact. I mean, moving on a little

44:05.600 --> 44:11.840
bit. In the book, you distinguish between the demonization of so-called gender ideology and

44:11.840 --> 44:17.600
legitimate fears like forced migration, climate change, economic inequality, so on and so forth.

44:18.160 --> 44:24.480
An imaginary thoughtful right-winger might say, well, look, actually

44:26.000 --> 44:33.120
fearing the breakdown of social reproduction is a legitimate fear. You look at what happens in

44:33.120 --> 44:40.960
countries which are richer, which have got more rights for women in terms of reproduction and

44:40.960 --> 44:47.920
the labor market, you get falling birth rates. And so without the sort of coercive stick of gender

44:47.920 --> 44:55.200
roles, you don't get babies. I mean, how would you respond to this? Well, that is Victor Orban's

44:55.200 --> 45:02.480
argument, right? But he's also really worried, not just that he won't get babies, but that they

45:02.480 --> 45:08.880
won't be reproducing the nation in its purity, which is why he's opposed to miscegenation.

45:09.600 --> 45:17.440
So I think we actually have to think about how the emphasis on birth rates is linked to nationalism

45:17.440 --> 45:29.200
and also the war against migration, right? So the same people, Orban is one, Maloney is another,

45:29.200 --> 45:35.520
who want to reproduce the nation and want to have control over social reproduction in that way

45:36.320 --> 45:45.840
are, tend to be both racist and homophobic and transphobic. I'm sorry, not both, but all of these

45:45.840 --> 45:53.040
things are working together. There's an anti-migrant, pro-heteronormative family, anti-gay lesbian

45:53.040 --> 45:59.040
family in most cases, not Israel, because if you're reproducing the demographic advantage for

45:59.040 --> 46:07.120
Jewish people, they will give you technology. So I think we have to put it in that context.

46:07.120 --> 46:11.680
I'm not worried about falling birth rates. I think the earth could probably handle that.

46:13.040 --> 46:20.080
I mean, is there a way to talk about demographic aging without falling into, as you say, these

46:20.080 --> 46:24.720
very homophobic, very transphobic and often very nationalist and racist discourses?

46:24.720 --> 46:32.160
Yes. Well, give me an example. Okay. So for instance, if I'm looking at the UK and I go,

46:32.160 --> 46:42.000
okay, we have an aging population, my friends, we have a economy which is then going to require

46:42.000 --> 46:46.720
much more taxation on the working age population to support people who are aging. So a way to talk

46:46.720 --> 46:54.000
about that and talk about the, I mean, to put it really crudely, the sort of needs of the labor

46:54.000 --> 46:59.280
market and how it relates to social reproduction without falling into something which is inherently,

47:00.800 --> 47:06.000
yeah, like a patriarch or forcing people into these categories which might not fit with

47:06.000 --> 47:11.760
them, some humanity. I think opening the door to further migration would be a great idea,

47:11.760 --> 47:16.480
emptying your indefinite detention camps. Yeah, I think that would be good. You'd have labor,

47:17.360 --> 47:28.080
more people. Seems like a great idea. I'm with you. You in the book, you connect this war on

47:28.080 --> 47:34.720
so-called gender ideology to fascism, to climate catastrophe and saying these are not things that

47:34.720 --> 47:39.920
you can separate off from one another. These are all working to support one another. And then when

47:39.920 --> 47:44.880
it comes to what is to be done about it, you talk about developing a counter-imaginary. And I suppose

47:44.880 --> 47:50.800
I'm wondering, what is a counter-imaginary? Yeah, what's what we're doing right now? We're

47:50.800 --> 47:57.040
developing one together. I don't think it can defeat Victor Orban though. We're just getting started.

47:59.040 --> 48:04.320
But I mean, to talk about, you know, what we're doing now and to be harsh on it, like,

48:04.320 --> 48:09.680
are we not sort of, this is a self-selecting group of people? Yes, but we are interested in this.

48:09.680 --> 48:17.920
We all go out in the world. Is the sort of the ambition of political activity to sort of get

48:17.920 --> 48:23.360
self-selecting groups of people to change how they talk and think and the hope that it will change

48:23.360 --> 48:27.680
how other people talk and think? Because the other side, they've got newspapers. I know, I know.

48:27.680 --> 48:31.760
Fuck ton of money. Think tanks. I know. Are we bringing vibes to a gunfight?

48:31.920 --> 48:40.800
I hear what you're saying. Well, let me take a couple of steps back and

48:42.720 --> 48:49.680
quit my vocation as a comedian, although it was always an alternative path for me.

48:50.400 --> 48:54.800
I do regret not having taken it sometimes, especially last week when the media was so

48:54.800 --> 49:07.040
rough on me. Okay. This is what I think. First of all, I just think it needs to be known that the

49:07.040 --> 49:13.040
anti-gender ideology movement, as it works throughout Eastern Europe, Latin America,

49:13.040 --> 49:26.080
parts of Africa, East Asia, certainly Russia as well, as we know, that it is not just focused

49:26.080 --> 49:32.640
on trans. It's focused on gay and lesbian rights, gay and lesbian parenting and families.

49:32.640 --> 49:39.040
It's focused on women, women's reproductive rights. It's focused on gender-based violence,

49:39.040 --> 49:49.680
wanting to undermine international protections against gender-based violence, as, for instance,

49:49.680 --> 49:57.120
encoded in the Istanbul Convention. Many countries have now, under the influence of the

49:57.120 --> 50:04.560
anti-gender ideology movement, withdrawn from that convention, including Turkey.

50:05.520 --> 50:15.600
Okay. So this movement is not just focused on trans. It certainly is. But it's actually

50:15.600 --> 50:25.200
sex education, books, books for children, activism, lesbian, gay, trans feminist activism in Russia

50:25.200 --> 50:31.920
elsewhere, in Hungary, very rough going, Poland's opening a little bit more now. We should ask about

50:31.920 --> 50:36.480
their mobilizations and why that's happening in the way that it is. It's really exciting.

50:37.840 --> 50:47.920
But I think we have to remember that this right-wing movement, it's a movement, but it's also a trend

50:47.920 --> 50:54.080
within several right-wing movements, which is a distinction, that this is targeting all these

50:54.080 --> 51:00.400
people who are arguing with each other here. Okay. We think we're on different sides of the debate,

51:00.400 --> 51:06.160
but we're being targeted by the exact same people. And we would be very foolish to let them

51:06.960 --> 51:16.160
target us and unify us as a target better than we unify ourselves as a movement of

51:16.160 --> 51:23.600
resistance and social transformation. So this book is trying to produce a more global framework

51:23.600 --> 51:27.840
for some of these local debates so that we might remind ourselves what the stakes are.

51:28.800 --> 51:34.240
And if you look in Latin America, for instance, in Chile or Argentina, the feminist movements

51:34.240 --> 51:41.840
are saying we're against violence and genocide, we're also against the killing of trans people,

51:41.840 --> 51:51.840
we're against the abandonment and injury of Indigenous people and the killing of Indigenous

51:51.840 --> 52:00.480
people. We actually are seeing that the same powers or an interlocking set of powers are

52:01.120 --> 52:07.440
hurting a wide range of people in very similar ways, and we need to bond together. And that's

52:07.440 --> 52:12.960
what an expansive coalition is. So if you ask me about a counter-imaginary, I want to say,

52:12.960 --> 52:18.800
let's look at the expansive coalitions and see how they're operating, how they represent themselves,

52:18.800 --> 52:26.880
how they persuade broader publics. And they went into churches, they went into factories,

52:26.880 --> 52:38.080
they helped unionize the women janitors. They went into a wide number of communities where it

52:38.080 --> 52:43.840
was not clear that they would be welcomed, both to listen and to also revise their analysis on

52:43.840 --> 52:51.360
the basis of what they heard. Oh, great idea. And to make broader alliances, which is why they

52:51.360 --> 52:58.560
could have a million people on the street just, I think, 10 days ago. So I think the counter-imaginary

52:58.560 --> 53:04.080
is with us, but it has to do with being willing to be part of alliances where we don't love each

53:04.080 --> 53:10.560
other. We don't want to have dinner together. We're not going to be reading the same books,

53:10.560 --> 53:15.840
maybe some of the same books. That would be good if we could have a reading list for a potential

53:15.840 --> 53:22.000
future alliance. You know, alliance is not love. Alliance can be really rough. But right now,

53:22.000 --> 53:29.680
it seems to me, given how I do think that there are fascist passions being stoked, like

53:30.480 --> 53:35.120
migrants are going to come take your job, the Great Replacement Theory, trans people are going

53:35.840 --> 53:40.880
to come take your status as a woman away. Trans people are going to de-sex you. You're not going

53:40.880 --> 53:47.280
to be able to be a male or a female anymore. They're going to destroy your family. They're going to

53:49.040 --> 53:55.760
insert the devil into your children's curriculum rather than God's word.

53:57.600 --> 54:02.800
You know, we actually need to get smarter about how this is working, because all those people

54:02.800 --> 54:12.800
who are now afraid, oh, race, gender, ethnic studies, migrants, trans people, those fears

54:14.160 --> 54:20.960
help support increasingly authoritarian regimes that promise order, authority, a return to a

54:21.840 --> 54:27.520
time past when everything was ordered and you knew who you were and what your life was and your

54:27.520 --> 54:32.800
livelihood was secured. Now, when I say your livelihood was secured, we see

54:35.360 --> 54:40.400
a lot of people are afraid that their livelihood is no longer secured. Most young people I know

54:40.400 --> 54:49.040
don't believe their livelihood is secured. Neoliberalism has devastated so many people's

54:49.040 --> 54:54.800
ways of living and ways of working, forced them from their homes and their jobs or made life

54:54.800 --> 55:00.800
increasingly precarious. So people are made nervous. They're made nervous by climate change,

55:00.800 --> 55:09.920
by war escalating as we speak. As a right-wing political operator, if you reach into that fear

55:09.920 --> 55:15.440
and say, guess what? The reason you're so afraid, the reason you're so anxious, the reason that the

55:15.440 --> 55:28.880
future is unclear, is gender or race or migration, you're able to reorganize and stoke those fears

55:28.880 --> 55:37.200
and anxieties in a direction that moves against those minorities or against those populations

55:37.200 --> 55:44.320
in favor of a really strong state and that promises you a reactionary and impossible dream of return.

55:44.960 --> 55:50.400
So I think we have to get wise that this is happening. And for my friends on the left,

55:50.400 --> 55:58.320
I would also say I would not dismiss gender as some distraction or problem or mere identity

55:58.320 --> 56:03.920
politics that's getting in the way of a broader left coalition. No, no, there is no broader left

56:03.920 --> 56:07.920
coalition without having this at its center because the attack on gender isn't an attack on

56:07.920 --> 56:16.080
democracy. It's also an attack on education. So we should not be letting them assign us a

56:16.080 --> 56:20.160
tertiary place in the hierarchy of oppression. I'm just not going to do that.

56:20.800 --> 56:25.760
That's all we have time for. And I want to say thank you all for coming this morning and thank

56:25.760 --> 56:40.800
you so much, Judith, for joining us. It's been a delight.
