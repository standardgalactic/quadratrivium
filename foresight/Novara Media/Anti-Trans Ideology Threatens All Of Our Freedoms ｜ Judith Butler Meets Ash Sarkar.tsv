0	8920	Neoliberalism has devastated so many people's ways of living and ways of working, forced
8920	13600	them from their homes and their jobs, or made life increasingly precarious.
13600	19240	So people are made nervous, they're made nervous by climate change, by war escalating
19240	23360	as we speak.
23360	28600	As a right-wing political operator, if you reach into that fear and say, guess what?
28600	35520	The reason you're so afraid, the reason you're so anxious, the reason that the future is unclear,
35520	47600	is gender or race or migration, you're able to reorganize and stoke those fears and anxieties
47600	55080	in a direction that moves against those minorities or against those populations in favor of
55080	62200	a really strong state.
62200	71480	Hello and welcome to this very special edition of Downstream IRL, very kindly hosted by Reference
71480	72720	Point.
72720	78000	If you're watching this on YouTube, you've got no idea that 100 people have dragged their
78000	85240	carcasses early in the morning to be with us today, and that's for a very special reason
85240	98480	that I'm delighted to say that we are joined by Judith Butler, philosopher, author and
98480	104320	as I found out this morning, fan of hard-boiled eggs.
104320	108280	They need no introduction, but I'm going to do it anyway.
108280	114120	They are the author of seminal works such as Gender Trouble, Bodies That Matter, Frames
114120	121320	of War and their new book, Who's Afraid of Gender, which examines how a transphobic backlash
121320	126760	morphed into an all-out war against so-called gender ideology.
126760	133680	It takes us from the Vatican to the conservative right, and it best of all dissects how Britain
133680	139840	became turf island.
139840	145240	I'm so sorry that you have to be with us today, but I'm glad to be here, glad to be here.
145240	147680	Very honored actually.
147680	154880	So I guess my first question is, when someone pops up and says, what is a woman, what are
154880	155880	they really asking?
155880	160120	How is that such a good question?
160120	169520	Well, it depends who's asking and to whom the question is addressed.
169520	175520	But if Rishi Sunak asks that question of the Labour Party more generally, or its current
175520	182440	representative, he's trying to ridicule them or catch them out because you look kind of
182440	189200	foolish if you don't know, or you say, well, I'm not sure, or actually the category is
189280	190280	open.
190280	193240	It's like, oh, come on, it's common sense.
193240	204200	Everybody knows you're like in some airy, obscurantist, woke ether, and you're having
204200	208160	a problem with a very commonsensical question.
208160	216720	So the person who asks it in that way is trying to ally with common sense or with the common
216720	218600	people who share a common sense.
218600	223400	But the so-called common people who share a common sense also might have a trans kid
223400	229240	or a cousin or have a gender non-conforming uncle, didn't we all have a gender non-conforming
229240	230240	uncle?
230240	232320	I'm going to ask him.
232320	233320	Yeah.
233320	234320	No.
234320	240840	I mean, it's a way of re-consolidating this idea of common sense, of natural difference,
240840	248840	debunking those who open up the question as either detached intellectuals out of touch
248840	258920	with common sense or with some kind of wokeism understood as a set of principles that are
258920	265440	being imposed on common sense reality from a doctrinaire position.
265440	271920	Is there a way to answer that question in good faith, in a way which is inclusive and
271920	278360	acknowledges the variety of the human species, but also is able to grapple with that when
278360	282880	someone says, woman, it doesn't mean something to most people?
282880	289040	Well, I think if we were even to try to answer the question, we would need a multilingual
289040	290040	framework.
290040	291040	Right?
291040	292040	What's that?
292040	301560	Well, how are women referred to or understood in various languages, in various ways of speaking?
301560	304760	How are women thought about in history?
304760	309640	How has the idea of what a woman is changed in different histories, in different parts
309640	310880	of the globe?
310880	313320	So we would need a global framework.
313320	318320	We would need a multilingual framework looking at different ways that women are defined.
318320	323960	We would then need to understand why it was always so important to feminism to keep the
323960	324960	question open.
324960	327120	Why would feminists do that?
327120	333280	Well, because they didn't like received ideas of what a woman is or is supposed to be, right?
333280	338840	Stays at home, involved in reproductive labor alone, supposed to be sentimental, not supposed
338840	346440	to be rational, not capable of certain kinds of labor, uniquely capable for other kinds
346440	348360	of labor.
348360	350880	We opened the question, what is a woman?
350880	356360	We even opened the question, what does a woman want in psychoanalysis?
356360	362280	We opened those questions because we were not happy with the ways in which those definitions
362280	365360	were operating.
365360	374680	And people did, of course, have some pretty intense ways of thinking about this.
374680	381960	So if you live in a society in which women aren't supposed to do certain labor or aren't
381960	387080	supposed to look a certain way, are you still a woman if you do that labor or you look a
387080	388080	certain way?
388080	389080	Right?
389080	393440	We, as feminists, I thought, we're saying, yeah, you are, of course you are.
393440	396080	You want to be a woman, come on in, of course you are.
396080	397600	Let's expand that category.
397600	399720	Let's make it more inclusive.
399720	406680	So it's been important to an emancipatory project to keep the question of what a woman
406680	408240	is open.
408240	413800	So why would we, at a certain point in our illustrious history, as feminists, ever decide,
413800	416840	no, we're closing the door.
416840	418360	We're not going to extend the category.
418360	419600	You can't claim it.
419600	420960	Well, why not?
420960	425840	We've been expanding that category, accepting its internal diversification for a really
425840	426840	long time.
426840	430360	We've gone on the streets for that purpose.
430360	434520	Why would we suddenly decide, oh, this is the limit case?
434520	438720	I mean, you're referring a lot to feminism there, and I suppose that leads me onto the
438720	445600	question of why is it that in the UK, transphobia has come in the guise of feminism, so-called
445600	452840	gender critical feminism, as opposed to the much more explicitly right-wing, family-oriented,
452840	456360	religiously inflected iterations of other countries?
456360	457840	That's such a good question.
457840	465960	Well, first of all, let me just say, I think we need to reclaim feminism, transfeminism,
465960	470360	intersectional feminism, post-ND colonial feminism.
470360	474920	There are all kinds of feminisms out there that are really important abolitionists.
474920	477320	Black feminism, we do not give feminism away.
477320	478320	We do not.
478320	479520	We reclaim it.
479520	488240	We make sure that we know how to keep it open, keep it thoughtful, keep it self-critical.
488240	490880	We talk about critical, gender-critical.
490880	494920	I never understand what's being said.
494920	498120	Because critical means, what does it mean if you're a feminist and you're critical?
498120	504040	That means you call into question the presuppositions that you have received unthinkingly.
504040	507400	It's like you become more thoughtful.
507400	512680	You ask, well, why have I proceeded with that category in that way?
512680	518600	You allow yourself to be changed by the history of emancipatory movements to rethink the fundamental
518600	524680	categories and you have humility and you change and you become more inclusive and you
524680	530440	offer more recognition and you accept that the categories that we often consider to be
530440	535440	so fundamental are historically changing and it's a good thing because we want to be part
535440	537360	of that historical change.
537360	547880	I think that I can't give you the so-called account diagnosis of UK turfism.
547880	548880	I think...
548880	553800	We're undiagnosable as a country and they take great pride in that.
553800	562680	But I do think it's against the background of a shattered left that these kinds of intensely
562680	567520	sectarian fights start happening.
567520	572640	The only way to have a political position is to identify perhaps as a woman or perhaps
572640	583280	as a lesbian and to guard that territory and to make it into a kind of vault or a gated
583280	591240	community that controls who can enter and who belongs.
591240	598160	And I think that kind of territoriality happens when people are very unsure about their alliances
598160	605600	or where they belong and what their broader political aims are.
605600	614720	So I don't exactly know how to account for it but I do think that there are great fears
614720	622880	that I hear trans-exclusionary feminists speaking about.
622880	624400	They're afraid of being replaced.
624400	626800	They're afraid of being violated.
626800	637920	They're afraid of having the definition of womanhood appropriated.
637920	641560	And I think it's worth thinking about, well, what are the conditions under which those
641560	643360	become primary fears?
643360	648200	And what are the ways of addressing that fear without seeking recourse to an exclusionary
648200	649600	politics?
649600	654520	It would be great if that could be opened as a debate, as a really serious question.
654520	660000	I think we should take other people's fears seriously, especially when they turn quickly
660000	665680	to either to hatred or to discriminatory or exclusionary politics.
665680	668880	But maybe there's a way to go back to the fear and say, well, let's talk about that
668880	672320	first and see whether another path is possible.
673320	677600	I'm using the word transphobia quite broadly and of course a lot of the time what we're
677600	682840	talking about is the demonization of trans women in particular.
682840	687160	We're not talking about the demonization of trans men, though of course that does happen.
687160	689560	I don't know.
689560	697040	Trans men are called self-hating lesbians or whatever happened to the butch.
697040	705440	The butch is being effaced from the earth and the trans, you know, you know.
705440	707880	How are the butches getting along?
707880	708880	Still there?
708880	709880	Still all right?
709880	720080	I mean, well, you can affirm a history as a butch and be a trans man and Jack Halberstam
720080	728720	has taught us a little bit about how trans-astrics works in that way to be a more inclusive category.
728720	733040	But why is it trans women in particular?
733040	738080	Because when I try and sort of extract what the big story is from a lot of the things that
738080	742560	I'm reading, whether it's in The Times of the Guardian, it's sort of this idea of, you
742560	749120	know, here's someone who's assigned male at birth and they've got this power and they
749120	753800	can only be using it for ill, they're becoming like a wolf in sheep's clothing or something
753800	755680	like that.
755680	764560	Is that a genuine fear or is it a convenient way of appropriating the position of the victim
764560	768120	when wanting to oppress others?
768120	780200	You know, I think the fear does rest on a misunderstanding or perhaps a willful ignorance
780200	787280	about what trans masculinity is and how it operates or what trans femininity is and
787280	789560	how it operates.
789560	795480	And I think we need to go back to some fundamentals here.
795960	800600	If you're assigned male at birth that doesn't immediately give you power.
800600	807560	It's once you enter into the social world that you see what that assignment can mean.
807560	813280	A lot of people assigned male at birth are really unhappy with that assignment and it
813280	817320	doesn't serve them and in fact they suffer under it.
817320	824360	And they may well not like the expectations of sexuality or the expectations of gender
824360	828840	that go along with that assignment and contest it.
828840	836080	Those folks have to go through some real social challenges to secure the sex assignment that
836080	841360	they do want and need to live in the way that they want.
841360	852000	So that history of suffering, of aspiration, of desire, that deep sense of self that needs
852000	859920	and ought to have social recognition is not properly honored by those who would reduce
859920	870080	somebody to their sex assignment or even the fact that they may well have a penis.
870080	875760	Having a penis does not immediately give you social power, especially if you don't want
875840	877840	it.
877840	880200	It's just kind of complicated.
880200	885120	Or you want it out of play or some other things are more erotic for you.
885120	888000	We don't even have that discussion openly.
888000	892920	It's just assumed like, oh, you're assigned male, you have a penis, therefore you are
892920	894200	a potential rapist.
894200	896320	Is that the way we feel about our sons?
896320	897320	No.
897320	900280	Our fathers, our friends, our lovers, no.
900280	905400	We know that men negotiate social violence in different ways that a lot of men can be
905720	911480	ethical and that masculinity is in the process of being reproduced in some interesting ways
911480	920720	by trans men, by younger men who've been brought up by feminist parents or who've entered culture
920720	927440	and learned a lot about what it is ethically to be a man, how to comport yourself ethically
927440	930920	as a man in this world.
930920	931920	We want that.
931920	932920	We hope for that.
932920	934280	We support that.
935160	942520	Like I was saying about the category of woman, the category of man is also historical.
942520	948800	We need to be interested in the social reproduction of masculinity and make sure it's being reproduced
948800	952280	in some good ways.
952280	957120	Not that the devil needs an advocate, but someone like J.K. Rowling or Julie Bindle,
957120	964160	they would say that they're speaking up for the most disadvantaged women in society.
964160	969760	Women in prison, survivors of domestic violence, and sure, debating who goes in what prison
969760	976800	might be an edge case, but it certainly does matter if you're a woman in that prison.
976800	981480	So what would you say to those people who would say that actually they're coming at
981480	983960	it from a perspective of risk management?
983960	984960	Yes.
984960	992200	I wonder whether we could easily in the U.K., in the U.S. and elsewhere find statistics that
992200	998560	support the notion that prison guards are actually more dangerous to women in prison.
998560	1001880	By whom are women in prison violated?
1001880	1006640	Sometimes by other women, sometimes by prison guards, both men and women.
1006640	1011400	I think the way gender operates, the way power operates in prison, the way sexual violation
1011400	1012920	operates is a larger picture.
1012920	1020440	I'd like to see the larger picture first, and then we can ask that question about this
1020440	1025800	trans woman who happens to be in a women's prison rather than a men's, because what's
1025800	1031440	going to happen to that trans woman in a men's prison, that trans woman is going to be the
1031440	1033360	object of sexual violation.
1033360	1040880	So if you say that person should, out of concern for the sexual violation of women, and we'll
1040880	1049400	just leave that open category, that a trans woman should be in a men's prison, what you're
1049400	1057920	doing is recommending sexual violation over there in order to protect yourself against
1057920	1062200	the prospect, the fantasy of a sexual violation over here.
1062200	1067320	Maybe we need the broader picture of how is sexual violation actually happening in prisons,
1067320	1071240	and then we can make a more grounded judgment.
1071240	1076640	I mean, what we know is that trans women in prisons in England or Wales are much more
1076640	1081760	likely to be victims of sexual violation than perpetrators of sexual violation, and
1081760	1087720	that broader picture of statistics bears that out, but someone might say, okay, drawing
1087720	1092040	back to that bigger picture isn't telling me what to do with this immediate situation
1092040	1094240	as and when it arises.
1094240	1099320	There's a question of rights here and how you balance them, and I suppose I'm interested
1099320	1105320	in, do you buy that there are conflicts of rights here, or are there ways to integrate
1105320	1106320	them?
1107040	1115040	The question for anybody who is at risk of being sexually violated in prison is what
1115040	1120920	is the recourse within prison to protect oneself against it?
1120920	1127840	So the group that we would want women to be protected against are all those who might
1127840	1129320	violate them.
1129320	1139720	So the same procedure that would be used against a male guard or a woman guard or the exceptional
1139720	1146800	trans woman would hold.
1146800	1152840	We wouldn't single out a particular group, especially if statistically that group is
1152840	1156760	not primarily responsible for sexual violation in prison.
1156760	1161960	So it's not on the basis of identity or classification that we make that decision.
1161960	1170800	We say anybody who violates another person sexually needs to be held accountable, and
1170800	1176560	we need procedures for that, but we don't discriminate against kinds of violators.
1176560	1179040	They're all bad.
1179040	1183240	But look, there's an obvious point here that probably needs to be restated, and I always
1183240	1185640	forget.
1185640	1194760	You can find your example of a trans woman who did, in fact, threaten or violate another
1194760	1195880	woman in prison.
1195880	1197440	You can find your example.
1197440	1205200	But if you make that example into then the general truth of the category, all trans women
1205200	1212360	are this way, or all trans women represent this risk, then you are actually engaging
1212360	1216400	in what's technically transphobia.
1216400	1224720	Because we wouldn't say, oh, you know, I went into this store, and I bought something from
1224720	1230440	a Jewish store owner, and I think I was overcharged.
1230440	1233720	Somebody said to you, oh yeah, all the Jews do that.
1233720	1238920	You would say, fuck you, that's like, excuse my language, sorry, you would say that's anti-Semitism.
1238920	1241640	Don't worry, I've heard that before.
1241640	1247480	No, no, no, no, no, but seriously, or one black person does one thing, well, that's what
1247480	1251880	black people, and that's what happens in right wing propaganda.
1251880	1256200	That is exactly how presidential elections are run in the US.
1256200	1261240	You find one migrant who did this one thing, and then that stands for all migrants.
1261240	1267560	So that's a right wing strategy, it's a racist, it's a transphobic, it's an anti-Semitic
1267560	1268560	strategy.
1268560	1272880	You know how that works, you take the instance, you inflate it into the general category.
1272880	1275760	So that needs to be stopped.
1275760	1279080	Before we move on from this discussion about gender critical feminism, I'm going to do
1279080	1283200	something really annoying and quote your own partner back to you, but as I was reading
1283200	1290640	your book, I was wondering about whether this narrative that you get from gender critical
1290640	1295640	feminists that trans and non-binary people are taking something from them.
1295640	1297160	Yeah, what are they taking?
1297160	1304120	Taking language, taking attention, taking social capital status from them.
1304120	1308360	I wonder if that could be linked to Wendy Brown's idea of wounded attachment, that you have
1308360	1312920	a wounded attachment to a position of marginality and there is a certain amount of social capital
1312920	1316200	that comes with it, and you don't want to let it go.
1316200	1326200	Well, if I understand Wendy Brown correctly.
1326200	1330000	This is the scariest moment of my life, by the way.
1330000	1336880	She's actually up the road, we could probably call her.
1336880	1345000	We do suffer wounds, many of us, gay, lesbian, trans, women, people of color, workers, a
1345000	1351040	lot of us have been wounded, exploited, violated, we come with histories of wounds, there's
1351040	1353040	no question about it.
1353040	1357400	The question is, do we then stay attached to that wound, and does that wound become
1357400	1363280	the source of our identity, and we just stay as a wounded identity in the political sphere,
1363280	1369520	and that's our operation to assert that wounded identity and stay attached to it?
1369520	1374560	Or do we look around and say, well, who else got wounded, and what did they do to overcome
1374560	1378120	those wounds, and what kind of alliances are necessary to make sure other people don't
1378120	1383680	get wounded in this way, and that we can affirm life, not just from a wounded position, but
1383680	1391600	from a place of what she's now calling reparation, or a place indeed of emancipation or social
1391600	1392600	struggle.
1392600	1397160	So, there are different trajectories that you can go through, but the question is, what
1397160	1405440	is the wound to feminism, what's the wound to lesbianism really, if the category of
1405440	1410600	women is expanded to include trans women?
1410600	1416280	How do any of the people who live in that category, how are they actually suffering?
1416280	1421540	It seems to me that what they're suffering from is a kind of hatred or phobia that is
1421540	1430440	overwhelming to them, and that that's a corrosive set of emotions to live with, but I do understand
1430440	1433560	that as, unfortunately, self-inflicted.
1433560	1439360	I do think some of the debates here in the UK, especially online, where people are free
1439360	1445000	to be as mean as they possibly can, some of the debates on all sides in the UK have been
1445000	1446320	very disturbing to me.
1446320	1453600	I don't think hideous insults and condemnations and accusations and vile ways of referring
1453600	1455200	to other people are okay.
1455200	1462560	I'd rather see kind of meaningful open debate on these issues, so I don't think social media
1462560	1470120	has helped this so-called conflict, because it does escalate and foreground the cruelest
1470120	1477640	and the meanest kinds of utterances, and maybe it's important to stay away from those.
1477640	1483480	It's hard when you're fighting, you want to be cruel, you want to be snide, you want
1483480	1489280	to ridicule people, you want to show that their position is preposterous.
1489280	1491800	It's not going to persuade anybody.
1491800	1496560	I think it might be better to figure out what are people really fearing and do they need
1496560	1499880	to, and is there another way to talk about that?
1499880	1504360	I want to move the conversation on a little bit.
1504360	1510920	When somebody says, I'm a man, I'm a woman, I'm non-binary, it's not just about their
1510920	1515040	right to perceive themselves in a certain way, it's also about the right to be perceived
1515040	1517720	and affirmed and addressed in a certain way.
1518200	1523240	I'm interested in the bit which is socially negotiated, so it's not just about what I
1523240	1529240	say about myself, it's also about how other people address me, perceive me.
1529240	1534680	Are there limits to the powers of self-definition?
1534680	1536760	Tell me what you have in mind.
1536760	1543480	So for instance, if I was to continue presenting in the way that I am now exactly the same
1543560	1548120	and I was to say, actually, my preference would be for he, him pronouns, I'd like to
1548120	1553160	be addressed as a man, there are lots of people who would say, I find this very challenging
1553160	1558120	what I'm seeing in front of me and what you're asking me to do.
1558120	1563840	There's a challenge here, so I've got the right to say, live with it, live with the
1563840	1565840	challenge.
1566800	1572800	I do think your question raises something interesting, the term gender.
1576800	1584080	Back in the day, we would talk about the gender division of labor and some socialist
1584080	1588040	feminists still do, and it's important to do that, especially as we think about care
1588040	1592800	work and social reproduction, and their gender is not about identity, it's actually about
1593760	1599120	how society is organized according to this exceedingly important power differential.
1599120	1604400	So gender is a framework, it's a structure, and then there's gender identity, and some
1604400	1610800	people think, oh, gender is just gender identity, it's become synonymous with or shorthand for.
1611840	1617600	And then once we go into the question of gender identity, we see that there's gender
1617680	1623280	presentation, how we appear to ourselves, perhaps or to others, and that can be very
1623280	1628400	divergent, but that's divergent anyway, even among like so-called cis people.
1628400	1632640	It's like, I think I look a certain way and you think I don't, and it's like, well, why?
1632640	1638800	Well, because the way we perceive ourselves in the ways others perceive us can differ,
1638800	1641200	and they can differ actually rather radically.
1642160	1652560	So let's hold that in mind, that there's no bridging of that gap once and for all
1653120	1658880	in my mind, even if you say, I'm a woman, and I say, yeah, I think you probably are,
1659760	1664080	do we mean the same thing at that moment? Maybe not, maybe I'm thinking one thing
1664080	1670880	and you're thinking another, okay. And there are different ways of being and presenting as a woman,
1670880	1674480	right? And then it gets controversial. It's like, well, I don't think that presentation is,
1674480	1684960	okay, in any case, my point is simply that very often of a felt sense of who one is
1684960	1693200	and how one identifies is not always matched by a socially perceived gender presentation.
1694080	1702000	And so if somebody tells you this is actually how I understand myself, this is my lived reality,
1704160	1711520	you do have a challenge, but you have a challenge because you are, if you're having trouble
1712480	1716480	reconciling a certain gender presentation with that person's self-definition,
1717200	1725120	you're assuming that gender identification can be read off of gender presentation and it is not
1725120	1730480	always the case. I understand that, and I understand that it's not always the case,
1731440	1737040	but if I was talking to someone who was outside of this room, not super duper political, they say,
1737040	1744640	it is quite often the case though. And as a society, we live by rules of thumb, we can change
1744640	1748960	those rules of thumb when we come across an exception, but I make judgments in a generalized
1748960	1753680	way. That's how I get through my day. We do, and it's actually one of the reasons why queer and
1754560	1760000	gender non-conforming and trans kids have had such a hard time, because they're coming to school,
1760000	1765120	they're looking the way they're supposed to look, more or less, where they're challenging that and
1765120	1770320	people are just saying, you're in this category, you're in this one, we need to order society in a
1770320	1777600	certain way. And what is the internal sense of suffering happens when you're put into a
1777600	1783040	category that actually effaces who you are because you look a certain way to somebody
1783040	1791360	who's imposing a set of social expectations on you at school, in religious institutions,
1791360	1795840	on the street, in the family. It's like, but that's who you are, but that's how you look,
1795920	1803600	but that's how I understand you. It's like, how to live with that deep sense of disjunction,
1803600	1809520	and you're effaced by the very category by which you are generally recognized.
1810720	1814720	So it seems to me that a lot of the time when I'm talking to people, I'm very, very much
1814720	1818880	involved with trans rights. There's sort of two ways of understanding it. There's one way where
1818880	1824000	you sort of say, okay, what we're asking for isn't very much at all. It is the right to be
1824000	1828320	affirmed in our chosen gender, and that is not an imposition on anyone else at all.
1829360	1835920	Changing how you speak, and it's coming from a respect for my humanity. And then there's
1835920	1841920	another way of looking at it, which is saying, well, actually, people choosing to live in a gender,
1841920	1845520	which is not the one they were assigned at birth, and straining against these categories,
1845520	1850560	and challenging these categories, and the connections between gender identification,
1850560	1855680	gender presentation, and socially recognized gender, that that is actually a really big deal.
1856240	1860560	And so I suppose my question is, how much of a big deal is it? Is it a small
1861680	1867600	alteration of social norms, or is it actually something which is a lot more fundamental
1867600	1874000	that's being posed here? Inherently, we're talking about blowing up some of these categories of gender.
1874320	1882800	Well, if you're a biological essentialist, it's a revolution. If you are
1886480	1893040	a member of a right-wing partisan of the Catholic Church, and you believe in the
1893040	1898080	natural family and creationism, and that God created male and female, it's revolutionary.
1898640	1905120	Okay, so for all those folks, it's really rough. And I'm sorry that they're having a hard time,
1905120	1910800	but I think they need to go through it, and come out the other end, and join the rest of us in a
1910800	1920160	better world. So it's okay, you know. I mean, I accept it's hard. Sure, it's like deeply
1920160	1927600	sentimented, kind of the lease and habits and ways of seeing. But it is true that a lot of people
1927600	1932880	just want to be left alone and live without being pathologized and discriminated against,
1932880	1939680	or the object of violence or disdain. And that seems right to be able to,
1942160	1947360	like, natal women, they want to walk down the street without being harassed.
1948320	1954880	Like natal women, they want to get a job without being discriminated against. They want to love
1954880	1960640	who they want to love. They want their lives and their loves to be recognized minimally or
1960640	1968160	maximally by society and to live in freedom and without fear. Seems pretty reasonable.
1969920	1975680	One of the things that you object to in the book is an idea of self-definition as being
1975680	1979280	simply a form of radical liberty. The idea of, well, anyone can do anything now.
1979280	1979920	That's right.
1979920	1986000	So what is self-definition if not a form of radical liberty? And not a simply a
1986000	1991200	volunteerist decision of I'm just now? I think it's really important to understand
1992720	2002480	that there's a wide range of positions about gender identification or what some would insist is
2002480	2009040	sex identifications. Identify as the sex, right? So I don't want to any more at least make a
2009040	2014240	distinction between sex as somehow natural and gender is somehow cultural and social.
2014800	2020720	I think sex assignment is already political. It's already the act of social institutions.
2020720	2025600	It's a way of organizing our bodies at the very beginning of time. So sex assignment is
2025600	2030080	already the work of gender in my framework. You don't have to accept my framework.
2030960	2035360	But I think for many people,
2039600	2044160	the sex assignment they receive is deeply right and true and absolutely
2044720	2048800	incontrovertible and they would never change it and they kind of like it or they really like it
2048800	2053680	and they're living it out and it's all good. Okay, but that's a relationship to a sex assignment.
2053680	2058960	Happens to be a very harmonious one. It's like, yeah, I was called a girl. Now I'm a girl and
2058960	2066320	this girl is great and I'm working with this category and I love it. Okay, good. Go live, enjoy.
2067360	2070800	I feel like you are channeling every member of the Spice Girls at once for that.
2071840	2076480	We really, really were. Well, but it's also kind of, it's always been amazing to me how people
2076480	2083280	like do their girl thing. It's like, wow. You know, and I'm still kind of a child. I think I was,
2083360	2089600	and I was a child ethnographer. It's like, wow. Look at these people. They're like doing their
2089600	2095680	gender in this way. It's like so amazing. It's like, wow, it's like a boy. It's like boy, boy.
2096240	2101600	It's like doing this boy thing. It's like, wow. And I was like, you know, I was, I was in this
2101600	2110000	ethnographic, you know, interval, like, not sure, not sure, can do either one very well.
2110640	2118240	You know, so it's, but it's interesting. But then look for some people, it's very fundamental.
2118240	2123600	Like this was never right. And for some, it's like, well, this was right for a while. That
2123600	2129360	don't really wasn't right. Or this was okay for a while. And then it was not right. Or I'm able to
2129360	2136560	change this category and the expectations that it makes of me and still stay within it. And others
2136560	2142720	are like, I can't stay within this category. It's unlivable to me. So I think what we're asking
2142720	2148720	about is what is the threshold of livability for people? And why wouldn't we respect that?
2148720	2154480	If somebody says this, this is not livable. And this is, and this is my chance for a livable life.
2154480	2160880	Why would we say, oh, no, no, no, sorry, you stay in the unlivable category and deprive you and we
2160960	2169200	will deprive you of a livable life? No, I think if we're not cruel people, we accept that somebody
2169200	2174800	is telling us what's livable and what's unlivable. But do we call that a choice? It's like, well,
2176800	2183440	it may be that the deepest sense of who one is as a sexed being or
2184400	2192080	as a gender if we're using that language is not fully formed by us, right? We find ourselves
2192080	2196800	feeling a certain way. We find ourselves understanding ourselves in a certain way.
2196800	2204320	We come to grips with our sense of reality. And it's, we're formed, we're formed by
2205360	2212480	many different social familial institutional powers, but we also form ourselves or we come
2212480	2219520	to understand ourselves. And it's at that point that we do make a choice, but it doesn't mean
2219520	2225760	it's a choice from the very beginning. I mean, thinking about, you know, something that you
2225760	2231760	said in your book is that no one individual or class owns a gender category. So you can't say
2231760	2240160	what Beyonce does. So glad you said that. That was such an easy derailment. It really threw me
2241040	2244240	like she's doing country music now, guys, and I really feel we need to discuss it.
2245520	2252160	Taking over, just taking over. It's so easy to distract me. So easy. But like, you know,
2252160	2258160	no one individual class owns gender categories apart from Beyonce, the exception to every
2258160	2265360	philosophical rule. We're clear. Yeah, we are very, very clear. Does the same apply to race?
2265360	2270240	Because when I saw Rachel Dollars out, I had this instinctive sense that there's something
2270240	2277760	wrong here. Yes. But I don't own the category of race, right, no individual black person or class,
2277760	2282400	right, socially constructed class of black people in the category of race. Rachel Dollars out saying,
2282400	2287040	well, look, I'm identifying as a black woman, I live my life as a black woman. My appearance is
2287040	2292720	such that people are treating me as a black woman. Is it logically coherent to have different rules
2293280	2299840	for gender as opposed to race? Was it coherent for me to feel very differently about
2299840	2307840	Rachel Dollars out than I intuitively think about gender identity? Well, first of all, I agree with
2307840	2320880	you that what Rachel Dollars out did and what white people do who want to capitalize on
2322720	2331600	cross-racial definition, identification, is completely objectionable. But they're not exactly
2331680	2339280	parallel. As I was just saying, you know, gender is formed. It's very complicated.
2340160	2348640	Race as a category, race as a classification has a different history. And anybody who works in
2348640	2355200	intersectional feminism would know that you don't tell the history of gender in the exact same way
2355200	2360960	you tell the history of race, you actually look to see how these categories are intersecting
2360960	2371360	in specific sites and through historical practices. But I don't think that they are parallel
2371360	2380480	because I don't even accept the idea that you just arbitrarily announce what your gender is.
2380480	2387920	There's a formation process there. But racial identification is so intensely a
2387920	2393360	matter of interpolation like how you have been born into the world in and through a set of
2393360	2400640	racial categories and formed as part of a community or part of a demographic classification,
2402560	2408480	how you've been treated, how your self-understanding emerges. So we need to tell the specific history
2408480	2419200	of that in order to understand why what Donazal did was so inappropriate and wrong.
2419200	2430080	And she wasn't... I think when this question gets posed in this way, it assumes like, oh,
2430080	2439440	I'm just going to choose a new sex because I'm going to get some kind of publicity for this,
2440480	2448960	like a fully volunteeristic notion. So I neither think of trans reassignment or self-definition
2448960	2458400	as radically arbitrary, nor do I think it is possible or right for that to happen,
2459280	2474080	for that particular kind of volunteeristic self-interested claim on blackness.
2474080	2482880	I don't think that's ever justified. She didn't have that history. She didn't come into the world
2482880	2488720	that way. She has not been interpolated. She has not lived through the history of that interpolation
2488720	2492640	in the way that black people actually have. And that's a violation of that history.
2493840	2499680	But when we're talking about the history of a trans person, well, they have been violated
2499760	2504960	by categories, the wrong ones, and they're trying to emerge from violation. So let's think about
2504960	2510320	where and how do we locate violation in both of those scenes? I mean, to take it away from
2510320	2517920	Rachel Dolezal, perhaps locate it in someone who is racialized in a way which marginalizes them,
2518960	2522560	you talk about the threshold of livability. For lots of people of color, they'd say, well,
2522560	2527200	this racial category is a violation of my humanity, how it's been made and how I'm
2527200	2533520	made to live in it the way society treats me. It is a violation. But the only thing there is to do
2533520	2540480	is to sort of strain at what it might mean to be South Asian, to be Muslim, to be black, to be
2540480	2548720	indigenous. And again, it's sort of saying, you know, is it okay to have just different rules for
2548720	2555200	it? Like different rules, different pathways to go down when you are at that threshold of livability
2555200	2560960	that is just different for race and for gender? Well, it is, although, you know,
2563200	2572480	it's very funny that we're involved in a discussion about analogy, because race and gender are lived
2572480	2579600	together. Like gender is never unmarked by race, race is never unmarked by gender, and we know this.
2580320	2587680	And yet, analytically, we set up this kind of hypothesis, which forces us into a kind of separation
2588720	2595360	that's problematic. But just to stay with your example, I mean, isn't the lived historical
2595360	2600960	reality that there are people who are like, don't racialize me, I'm just a human, treat me like a
2600960	2607680	human. Others are like, don't racialize me in this way. This is the way I am participating in and
2607680	2618080	living out my racial affinity, identity, community. I may be straining against an interpolation that
2618080	2624720	I feel like is falsifying or discriminatory, but I am also reproducing it in a way that I find to
2624720	2632320	be affirmative, and actually making connections and coalitions among people of color or across
2632320	2639440	even larger alliances. So we see that this is all lived out differently. I don't know if that answers
2639440	2645600	your question, but I mean, that's the norm. That's the descriptive fact. I mean, moving on a little
2645600	2651840	bit. In the book, you distinguish between the demonization of so-called gender ideology and
2651840	2657600	legitimate fears like forced migration, climate change, economic inequality, so on and so forth.
2658160	2664480	An imaginary thoughtful right-winger might say, well, look, actually
2666000	2673120	fearing the breakdown of social reproduction is a legitimate fear. You look at what happens in
2673120	2680960	countries which are richer, which have got more rights for women in terms of reproduction and
2680960	2687920	the labor market, you get falling birth rates. And so without the sort of coercive stick of gender
2687920	2695200	roles, you don't get babies. I mean, how would you respond to this? Well, that is Victor Orban's
2695200	2702480	argument, right? But he's also really worried, not just that he won't get babies, but that they
2702480	2708880	won't be reproducing the nation in its purity, which is why he's opposed to miscegenation.
2709600	2717440	So I think we actually have to think about how the emphasis on birth rates is linked to nationalism
2717440	2729200	and also the war against migration, right? So the same people, Orban is one, Maloney is another,
2729200	2735520	who want to reproduce the nation and want to have control over social reproduction in that way
2736320	2745840	are, tend to be both racist and homophobic and transphobic. I'm sorry, not both, but all of these
2745840	2753040	things are working together. There's an anti-migrant, pro-heteronormative family, anti-gay lesbian
2753040	2759040	family in most cases, not Israel, because if you're reproducing the demographic advantage for
2759040	2767120	Jewish people, they will give you technology. So I think we have to put it in that context.
2767120	2771680	I'm not worried about falling birth rates. I think the earth could probably handle that.
2773040	2780080	I mean, is there a way to talk about demographic aging without falling into, as you say, these
2780080	2784720	very homophobic, very transphobic and often very nationalist and racist discourses?
2784720	2792160	Yes. Well, give me an example. Okay. So for instance, if I'm looking at the UK and I go,
2792160	2802000	okay, we have an aging population, my friends, we have a economy which is then going to require
2802000	2806720	much more taxation on the working age population to support people who are aging. So a way to talk
2806720	2814000	about that and talk about the, I mean, to put it really crudely, the sort of needs of the labor
2814000	2819280	market and how it relates to social reproduction without falling into something which is inherently,
2820800	2826000	yeah, like a patriarch or forcing people into these categories which might not fit with
2826000	2831760	them, some humanity. I think opening the door to further migration would be a great idea,
2831760	2836480	emptying your indefinite detention camps. Yeah, I think that would be good. You'd have labor,
2837360	2848080	more people. Seems like a great idea. I'm with you. You in the book, you connect this war on
2848080	2854720	so-called gender ideology to fascism, to climate catastrophe and saying these are not things that
2854720	2859920	you can separate off from one another. These are all working to support one another. And then when
2859920	2864880	it comes to what is to be done about it, you talk about developing a counter-imaginary. And I suppose
2864880	2870800	I'm wondering, what is a counter-imaginary? Yeah, what's what we're doing right now? We're
2870800	2877040	developing one together. I don't think it can defeat Victor Orban though. We're just getting started.
2879040	2884320	But I mean, to talk about, you know, what we're doing now and to be harsh on it, like,
2884320	2889680	are we not sort of, this is a self-selecting group of people? Yes, but we are interested in this.
2889680	2897920	We all go out in the world. Is the sort of the ambition of political activity to sort of get
2897920	2903360	self-selecting groups of people to change how they talk and think and the hope that it will change
2903360	2907680	how other people talk and think? Because the other side, they've got newspapers. I know, I know.
2907680	2911760	Fuck ton of money. Think tanks. I know. Are we bringing vibes to a gunfight?
2911920	2920800	I hear what you're saying. Well, let me take a couple of steps back and
2922720	2929680	quit my vocation as a comedian, although it was always an alternative path for me.
2930400	2934800	I do regret not having taken it sometimes, especially last week when the media was so
2934800	2947040	rough on me. Okay. This is what I think. First of all, I just think it needs to be known that the
2947040	2953040	anti-gender ideology movement, as it works throughout Eastern Europe, Latin America,
2953040	2966080	parts of Africa, East Asia, certainly Russia as well, as we know, that it is not just focused
2966080	2972640	on trans. It's focused on gay and lesbian rights, gay and lesbian parenting and families.
2972640	2979040	It's focused on women, women's reproductive rights. It's focused on gender-based violence,
2979040	2989680	wanting to undermine international protections against gender-based violence, as, for instance,
2989680	2997120	encoded in the Istanbul Convention. Many countries have now, under the influence of the
2997120	3004560	anti-gender ideology movement, withdrawn from that convention, including Turkey.
3005520	3015600	Okay. So this movement is not just focused on trans. It certainly is. But it's actually
3015600	3025200	sex education, books, books for children, activism, lesbian, gay, trans feminist activism in Russia
3025200	3031920	elsewhere, in Hungary, very rough going, Poland's opening a little bit more now. We should ask about
3031920	3036480	their mobilizations and why that's happening in the way that it is. It's really exciting.
3037840	3047920	But I think we have to remember that this right-wing movement, it's a movement, but it's also a trend
3047920	3054080	within several right-wing movements, which is a distinction, that this is targeting all these
3054080	3060400	people who are arguing with each other here. Okay. We think we're on different sides of the debate,
3060400	3066160	but we're being targeted by the exact same people. And we would be very foolish to let them
3066960	3076160	target us and unify us as a target better than we unify ourselves as a movement of
3076160	3083600	resistance and social transformation. So this book is trying to produce a more global framework
3083600	3087840	for some of these local debates so that we might remind ourselves what the stakes are.
3088800	3094240	And if you look in Latin America, for instance, in Chile or Argentina, the feminist movements
3094240	3101840	are saying we're against violence and genocide, we're also against the killing of trans people,
3101840	3111840	we're against the abandonment and injury of Indigenous people and the killing of Indigenous
3111840	3120480	people. We actually are seeing that the same powers or an interlocking set of powers are
3121120	3127440	hurting a wide range of people in very similar ways, and we need to bond together. And that's
3127440	3132960	what an expansive coalition is. So if you ask me about a counter-imaginary, I want to say,
3132960	3138800	let's look at the expansive coalitions and see how they're operating, how they represent themselves,
3138800	3146880	how they persuade broader publics. And they went into churches, they went into factories,
3146880	3158080	they helped unionize the women janitors. They went into a wide number of communities where it
3158080	3163840	was not clear that they would be welcomed, both to listen and to also revise their analysis on
3163840	3171360	the basis of what they heard. Oh, great idea. And to make broader alliances, which is why they
3171360	3178560	could have a million people on the street just, I think, 10 days ago. So I think the counter-imaginary
3178560	3184080	is with us, but it has to do with being willing to be part of alliances where we don't love each
3184080	3190560	other. We don't want to have dinner together. We're not going to be reading the same books,
3190560	3195840	maybe some of the same books. That would be good if we could have a reading list for a potential
3195840	3202000	future alliance. You know, alliance is not love. Alliance can be really rough. But right now,
3202000	3209680	it seems to me, given how I do think that there are fascist passions being stoked, like
3210480	3215120	migrants are going to come take your job, the Great Replacement Theory, trans people are going
3215840	3220880	to come take your status as a woman away. Trans people are going to de-sex you. You're not going
3220880	3227280	to be able to be a male or a female anymore. They're going to destroy your family. They're going to
3229040	3235760	insert the devil into your children's curriculum rather than God's word.
3237600	3242800	You know, we actually need to get smarter about how this is working, because all those people
3242800	3252800	who are now afraid, oh, race, gender, ethnic studies, migrants, trans people, those fears
3254160	3260960	help support increasingly authoritarian regimes that promise order, authority, a return to a
3261840	3267520	time past when everything was ordered and you knew who you were and what your life was and your
3267520	3272800	livelihood was secured. Now, when I say your livelihood was secured, we see
3275360	3280400	a lot of people are afraid that their livelihood is no longer secured. Most young people I know
3280400	3289040	don't believe their livelihood is secured. Neoliberalism has devastated so many people's
3289040	3294800	ways of living and ways of working, forced them from their homes and their jobs or made life
3294800	3300800	increasingly precarious. So people are made nervous. They're made nervous by climate change,
3300800	3309920	by war escalating as we speak. As a right-wing political operator, if you reach into that fear
3309920	3315440	and say, guess what? The reason you're so afraid, the reason you're so anxious, the reason that the
3315440	3328880	future is unclear, is gender or race or migration, you're able to reorganize and stoke those fears
3328880	3337200	and anxieties in a direction that moves against those minorities or against those populations
3337200	3344320	in favor of a really strong state and that promises you a reactionary and impossible dream of return.
3344960	3350400	So I think we have to get wise that this is happening. And for my friends on the left,
3350400	3358320	I would also say I would not dismiss gender as some distraction or problem or mere identity
3358320	3363920	politics that's getting in the way of a broader left coalition. No, no, there is no broader left
3363920	3367920	coalition without having this at its center because the attack on gender isn't an attack on
3367920	3376080	democracy. It's also an attack on education. So we should not be letting them assign us a
3376080	3380160	tertiary place in the hierarchy of oppression. I'm just not going to do that.
3380800	3385760	That's all we have time for. And I want to say thank you all for coming this morning and thank
3385760	3400800	you so much, Judith, for joining us. It's been a delight.
