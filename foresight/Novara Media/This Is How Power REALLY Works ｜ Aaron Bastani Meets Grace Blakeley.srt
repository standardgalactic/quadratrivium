1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
The conservative view is just that like the winners of the winners and the losers of the losers

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,920
and that's fair because that's based on competition and competition is its own

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,920
process of fairness. For those on the left it's like well we should make sure that if people do

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,760
lose they're protected in some way and that actually they have more opportunities to become

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,680
winners and that the winners pay a little bit more to make sure that society works a little bit

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,480
better. Whereas the Marxist or the socialist view should be there shouldn't be winners and losers

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,680
and people that make the rules. It should be we all make the rules together. It's a completely

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:39,200
different way of organising society. The game is rigged. That's something that people on the

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,520
left have been saying for a decade obviously a lot longer but that particular phrase really goes back

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,680
to the mid-2010s and for a long time it felt like if you said it you were shouting in to avoid nobody

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,480
was listening. Fast forward to 2023 and virtually everyone in politics on the left or the right

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,800
accepts that the game is rigged. That a tiny elite benefits while the rest of us lose from the status

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,440
quo. The establishment does so well at the cost of everyone else if you will. But even though

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,720
there's agreement about the game being rigged that doesn't mean there's agreement on what to do next.

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,400
Clearly people on the left and on the right have very different proposals going forward.

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,960
And I think the reason why there is a gap between those two sides is basically because

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,760
there's a different reading on what power is, who has it and how things change. Now for people on

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,320
the left financial and economic power is directly translated into political, social and cultural

19
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,720
power. It might be comforting to think we live in a meritocracy or that political representatives

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,200
are there on merit and they represent the will of the people but fundamentally they're there to

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,240
reflect vested powerful economic interests. And that is exactly why we got Grace Blakely on for

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,760
today's show. Grace is an economist, she's a writer, she also does loads of media stuff from

23
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,160
talk TV to the BBC and Jeremy Vine. She's a fantastic young economist and her interests have

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,600
always focused on finance and the kinds of power which emerges from it. Grace, welcome to downstream.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,120
Thank you so much for having me. I have been waiting for this conversation for so long.

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,280
I have missed you very, very much too. It's been a while.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,600
It's been a really long time. It's been a really long time.

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,280
I feel like I haven't really seen that much since Covid.

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,920
Yeah, well I mean I went away. You went away, you've been writing a book?

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,240
Yeah, I wrote a book. I went away to write a book partly although I didn't spend that much time

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,080
writing my book. I spent a lot of time just wandering around Central America, surfing,

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,080
making trouble. And yeah, I got back like two months ago and now here I am, back in the Malay.

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
And you were obviously my first priority. Yeah, number one call.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,480
Of course.

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,320
Navarro Media first. Exactly.

36
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,120
The Today program, second. You're obviously very left-wing.

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
Obviously. So I've been told.

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,360
Yeah, you're obviously very left-wing in terms of your economic commitments.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,200
But you're a well-spoken Oxford graduate from Basingstoke, from the home counties.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,200
What happened between you being a fresh-faced Oxford graduate who went on to work at KPMG

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,040
and then having the kinds of political economic commitments you have now?

42
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
Was it something you had as a young person?

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,920
Yeah.

44
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,560
Did they intensify when you entered the labour market?

45
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,000
Was there a moment of intellectual revelation?

46
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,320
How does this trajectory look?

47
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,520
I think it's a combination of a lot of different things.

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,720
So it does kind of go back to when, it definitely goes back to when I was growing up

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,480
because I'm obviously from a posh, well-off background.

50
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,960
But my mum grew up on the council estate in Basingstoke and her dad was a hardcore communist

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,280
trade union organiser for the TGWU.

52
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,840
He was going over to Russia.

53
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
We had little busts of Lenin in the house.

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,160
My uncles are called Karl and Keir, both with a K,

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
properly into the whole interleftism from a very young age.

56
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,920
And my mum kind of took those values definitely along with her.

57
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,120
She had also like, she was the first in her family to go to university,

58
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,040
went to Cambridge, had a terrible experience of Cambridge because everyone was like,

59
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,440
you know, treated her terribly because they were all, she was like,

60
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,520
I arrived and everyone was like, oh, what school did you go to?

61
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,440
And she was like, I went to a comprehensive in Winklebury and they were like, what?

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,160
So kind of that, I think consolidated her left wing values and my dad ended up just kind of

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
falling into that sort of sort of field as well.

64
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,080
They ended up doing things like, you know, they traveled around the world

65
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,080
and did the Nicaragua solidarity campaign and eventually ended up doing very boring

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,120
kind of professional things.

67
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
No offense mum dad, I love you, doing kind of boring professional executive coaching

68
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,680
and that sort of stuff, but retained those like left wing values

69
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,760
and always raised me along those lines.

70
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,720
I mean, if they hadn't, my granddad was still there all the time and he would have been like,

71
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,280
what are you doing?

72
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,240
Like, what are you talking about?

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
So I was always like really into politics.

74
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,080
We had a very political household.

75
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,280
I did things like, you know, I wrote for the new statesman, right?

76
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,880
That was something that I did like three or four years ago, maybe a bit more than that

77
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,440
five years ago.

78
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,480
And when I was like 14, I had a letter published in the new statesman talking about like,

79
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,760
I can't remember something to do with, you know, the transition from brown to Blair

80
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,800
and like what needed to be done.

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,920
And that was like, my granddad had that framed and put on the wall.

82
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,360
So there are all these like political values that there were in our household.

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,800
But I think the second thing was that I was always in trouble.

84
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,040
So like, I was like, you know, I went to all these fancy schools, but I was expelled from

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,480
two of them, suspended like constantly, just was constantly in trouble, like with everyone.

86
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,200
And I mean, it was relatively easy to get into trouble if you go to private school.

87
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,520
I'm not saying that I was like, you know, there's tear away, but like,

88
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,920
I did some pretty crazy stuff.

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,440
And like, I never really, never really kind of understood the boundaries of what I

90
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,600
should and shouldn't do always kind of felt like, you know, rules are stupid.

91
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,440
And that gave me that kind of rebellious spirit, I think that went with like the

92
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,480
left wing values.

93
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,160
But I was never like, I was always like, oh, I'm going to, I don't know,

94
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,600
go and like work for the UN or like, I don't know, maybe like be a politician

95
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,640
or something that was fairly like middle of the road.

96
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,720
It was only after I think, you know, so I did this PPE degree at Oxford and it was very like,

97
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,960
you know, I think I learned more in my African studies masters

98
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,640
about like the way the world actually works.

99
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,760
And I did my PPE degree.

100
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,160
So PPE degree was very liberal, very down the line.

101
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,040
Just for people watching, PPE is the, is the degree that all the sort of opinion makers

102
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,280
and politicians in the UK do, from David Cameron to pretty much every major BBC

103
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
broadcast journalist, Nick Robinson and whatnot.

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,720
Politics, philosophy and economics.

105
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,880
It was created to educate the kind of the people who would be going on to govern the

106
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,760
British Empire, basically, it's supposed to have everything that you need to be inculcated

107
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,360
into the values of like the elite, basically, and all of the kind of reference points that

108
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,160
you would need to be able to kind of converse with, with those people.

109
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,120
So it's, you know, not particularly, it's obviously not radical at all.

110
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
It's like very mainstream and other education.

111
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,720
And as I said, I wanted to kind of go work for the UN or doing something in the kind of

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,960
international sphere, liberal do goodery stuff.

113
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
So I went to do an African studies degree.

114
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,280
So you were a Lib?

115
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,160
Yeah, basically.

116
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,240
Yeah, I would have said I was like a left Lib.

117
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,920
I was like, you know, like, I want to like do things to change the system and make things

118
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,800
work slightly better for, you know, those who don't come out.

119
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
Like make poverty history.

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,040
Oh, 100%.

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,800
I was totally into that sort of stuff.

122
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,160
Yeah, that was like totally my identity.

123
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,080
Yeah, did my African studies masters realized how utterly screwed up that entire world is.

124
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,080
So like I did a bunch of research and like, you know, traveled quite a lot and met lots of

125
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,160
people in the UN and in NGOs and whatever and realized how dark things really are there and

126
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,000
quite how, you know, how when you are in a job that is working to kind of pick up the pieces

127
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,160
from a system that is fundamentally messed up at like the very highest levels, it can only

128
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,360
create kind of disillusionment.

129
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
So then I was like, right, okay, well, we need to change the system.

130
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,720
I started thinking about politics.

131
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
I initially was like, I'm going to go organize for the greens.

132
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,560
And I did a little bit of that when I was in my masters.

133
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,280
Then the 2015 election came around.

134
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,160
And I think that was when a lot of stuff started changing for me.

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,840
I remember like sitting in an Oxford college when Ed Miliband lost.

136
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,120
I hadn't even voted for Ed Miliband.

137
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,160
I had voted green and just being like, what is going on?

138
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,720
Like how can we be, how can this happen?

139
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,840
Like how can we be going down this road of just like more and more austerity when it's

140
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,040
just so obviously wrong?

141
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,440
And, you know, the whole ideology that it's built on is so obviously kind of corrupt.

142
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,080
And then Corbinism happened.

143
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,680
It was actually my boyfriend at the time who was like, oh, have you heard about this Corbin guy?

144
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,360
He'd be, he seems quite cool.

145
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,160
Wow. So this guy is actually a pivotal figure in your career, personal, political trajectory.

146
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,320
Who knows, maybe it would have happened anyway, but he was like, you should look into this.

147
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,400
I looked into it and then I was like, this is amazing.

148
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,280
Started going on to all the events and like getting much more involved in the Labour Party.

149
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,200
And then that was kind of when I was like, right, okay, this is what I want to do.

150
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,960
Like I want to get involved in this world, see, you know, how I can be useful.

151
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,600
And that started by doing policy.

152
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,680
So after I'd left university, I had this stint at KPMG.

153
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,320
And yeah, that was working in their like management consulting,

154
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
arm doing kind of public sector work.

155
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,600
And what was that?

156
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,400
What was that like?

157
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,600
It was interesting, right?

158
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,720
Because like the projects I was working on at the time, it was in Greater Manchester

159
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,440
and they were kind of doing like loss leading work.

160
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,040
So the idea was that you would, you know, not make huge amount of profit.

161
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,600
You would work with these new combined authorities and try and like develop to product,

162
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,520
develop product that you would sell elsewhere.

163
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,760
So at the time it felt quite interesting.

164
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
I was like learning a lot about it was all to do with service delivery.

165
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,480
So it was, you know, like everything, you know, there was a lot of work on like people with

166
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,800
complex needs and combined dependency and how people who interact with lots of different services,

167
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,280
like, you know, children's services, social care, the criminal justice system,

168
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,720
all these different sorts of things, like how you needed early intervention to kind of deal

169
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,480
with those those sorts of issues.

170
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,960
And obviously it was all couched in the language of like how you could save money.

171
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
But me coming into this is like completely green.

172
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,320
I was like, wow, this is fascinating.

173
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,080
Like this is how things actually work.

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,000
Eventually I kind of realized, oh no, we are literally developing a product that we are

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
going to be selling to, to other combined authorities as a way of making money.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,120
And it just kind of started feeling more and more alienating.

177
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,640
Also, I wasn't very good at it.

178
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,800
I was good at the research, like all the kind of looking into like what works and how we

179
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,840
should be designing these things.

180
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,280
But I wasn't very good at selling.

181
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,280
And I wasn't very good at client interactions or any of that sort of stuff.

182
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,280
I don't really know why probably for the same reasons I kept getting expelled.

183
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,480
But anyway, I then left, decided I wanted to go do think tanky work so I could go into policy,

184
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,000
maybe from their politics.

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Started, I had a great time.

186
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,600
That was when, you know, I met you guys and started, yeah, like doing more media,

187
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
doing more writing, like getting much more involved in like actual organizing.

188
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,400
And it was just kind of like, you know, all uphill with a lot of downs as well from there.

189
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,560
Did you ever subscribe to Tatler?

190
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,400
I never subscribed to Tatler.

191
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,840
No, never.

192
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,000
You've never, have you ever read an issue of Tatler?

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
I don't think so.

194
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
I'm not saying that I've never read like a fancy magazine.

195
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,480
I'm pretty sure I've read like Vogue or whatever, but I was never really that, that into it.

196
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,080
Calls and hounds.

197
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,920
No, I'm not that posh.

198
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,040
But are there any people in your sort of, you know, your ambit, like your, your parents' friends?

199
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,080
Oh, I mean, at Oxford.

200
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,880
Yeah, I met some of the like poshest people that you could imagine at Oxford.

201
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,120
Like just unimaginable amounts of not just like wealth, but also privilege.

202
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,160
And, you know, when I went to Oxford, I was like, because, you know, I went to these private schools,

203
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,440
but ended up going to City Farm College, like, you know, obviously had friends who

204
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,960
went to state school, that sort of stuff.

205
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,800
I was like, oh yeah, I'm really posh.

206
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,160
And then I went to Oxford and I was like, oh my God, I am like a commoner to these people.

207
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
They're all being like, where did you, like, where did you go to school?

208
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,320
Eaton, Cheltenham Ladies, Dullich, like all, they all knew each other.

209
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,400
That was like this massive group of people that all knew each other.

210
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
He was some of the people that go to those schools.

211
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

212
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
Family was the first in their family or whatever.

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,720
It is amazing.

214
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,120
It's crazy.

215
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,000
I remember once I was reading something in the FT, this was,

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,160
it was just, no, it was the Telegraph in fact.

217
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,800
And it was like a, it was like an etiquette guide for Christmas.

218
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,160
And you shouldn't cheers and tap glasses.

219
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,520
And the author of the article said that was

220
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,000
LBC, little bit common.

221
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,120
So you said it like, especially with champagne glass, you shouldn't tap, right?

222
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,920
What you should do is when you say cheers, you just lift the glass, cheers.

223
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,480
Yeah.

224
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,200
And then, but the idea of like touching is just like very vulgar.

225
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,840
That's hilarious.

226
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,880
And I'm like, these people live in a dearful world.

227
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,360
So true.

228
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,680
I once heard someone say at Oxford, I think they were discussing like,

229
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,400
someone got a new boyfriend and they were asking lots of questions.

230
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
And one of the responses was, oh, don't worry, darling.

231
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,360
He's PLU, which was people like us.

232
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,960
Very, very concerning.

233
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,400
Yeah.

234
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,680
I mean, it's, it's weird.

235
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,280
Like it was funny because I spoke to my mom about this, about the same experience that

236
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:17,680
she'd had.

237
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,880
She actually came overtly from like a really working class background going to Cambridge

238
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,520
and just found the whole experience so utterly alienating that it was like

239
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,600
outside of her comprehension.

240
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,840
Whereas for me, I was kind of like, oh no, I see where I fit in, in this hierarchy.

241
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,800
And I'm like here.

242
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,840
And then there's all these people who know each other who are like here.

243
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,000
And there's this like, I mean, I remember at the time reading all of these like novels,

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,720
like, you know, like Fitzgerald and Evelyn Moore and stuff about like class systems in

245
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,600
the US and the UK.

246
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,080
And being like, oh my God, I suddenly understand this, this like from the outside looking in

247
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:58,480
at this world of like glitz and glamour and everyone seems so like put together and very

248
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,280
aware about how to play with power, like in friendship groups and like, you know, in

249
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,320
the world more generally.

250
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,600
And it's really like, it really hooks you.

251
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,200
It's really interesting to notice that happen.

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,240
So yeah, I definitely kind of, you know, experienced that when I was Oxford, but never

253
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,360
kind of never really fully inside, never really fully outside, I guess.

254
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,760
Do you think the left struggles to explain that?

255
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Like, I feel for much of the public, you know, I say I'm middle class because I like

256
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,240
John Lewis and drink M&S gold brand tea.

257
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,160
And I think most of the public was, you know, I joke with my wife and I say, you know,

258
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
if the waitrose near us closes, we're moving.

259
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,120
Right.

260
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,840
And I say it mockingly and I, but I view those as like benchmarks of middle class,

261
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,040
like the nice things.

262
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,000
But I think for most of the public, that's the case.

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,840
They, they, they can't comprehend there is this quite big layer of people who

264
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,240
culturally, economically, socially, just in every single aspect of their lives,

265
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,840
they inhabit a different thought world.

266
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,080
Yeah.

267
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,000
Do you think the leftist fails to communicate that a bit?

268
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,840
The way I think about this, and this is actually potentially going to be something

269
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,360
I'm going to be writing about in the future, is that, you know, we,

270
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,480
we think of ourselves as living in this society, right?

271
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,760
That is characterized by, you know, winners and losers.

272
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,840
And we debate the boundaries of that game and how, you know,

273
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,880
the winners should be taxed and how the losers should be supported.

274
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,000
And everyone has a sense of where they sit in that game, you know, whether or not

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,200
they're like doing well, whether or not successful, attractive, whatever.

276
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,560
And we're all kind of competing on with one another to, to succeed.

277
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,800
And we have a view as to who's above us and who's below us.

278
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,120
But there's actually a set of people who are outside of the game altogether,

279
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
because they're basically the ones that make the rules.

280
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,880
And they are neither winners nor losers.

281
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,440
They are in a very real sense, kind of much more in control of actually the game itself

282
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,720
and how it works.

283
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,680
And a lot of our educational and cultural systems, a lot of the educational and cultural

284
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,920
systems that these people come through are designed to make them comfortable

285
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,880
with the idea that they are the ones that are in control and that set the rules.

286
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,960
So you'll often hear, and I have heard this from, from these people,

287
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:16,320
this idea that they are the kind of, you know, by default, the benevolent rulers of society,

288
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,280
whether that is just because they are genetically better or it's just because they happen to have

289
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,680
been, you know, inculturated into this, this particular way of being that allows them to

290
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,600
be the kind of guardians of society.

291
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
They do see society as divided into between people who kind of make the rules

292
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,040
and those who just play the game.

293
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,360
And I think that's probably something that maybe most people have an,

294
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,920
like some sort of intuitive sense of, you know, the idea that we can, you know,

295
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,320
vote different people into power, but nothing's ever going to change.

296
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,800
But I don't really think it's something that we talk about overtly.

297
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,920
And I don't want it to sound kind of conspiratorial because I'm not saying that,

298
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,440
like, you know, we live in a world that's kind of governed by a few people sitting in a room

299
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,720
deciding who gets what.

300
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,480
But obviously, the institutions in which we, that kind of govern most of the interactions

301
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,040
that structure our lives, whether that's kind of corporations or political institutions,

302
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,440
public services, educational institutions, there are people in positions of power and

303
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,920
authority. And as our societies become more concentrated, as larger institutions have come

304
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,080
to govern much greater areas of social life, the people in positions of authority within

305
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,120
those powerful institutions have gained more control over what happens for everyone else.

306
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,920
So it's all about power.

307
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,200
Let's get into the nuts and bolts.

308
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,760
Sure.

309
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,120
And this is a talking point which the left hasn't really focused on.

310
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,760
I feel like we've left a lot of it to the right.

311
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,720
And often, you know, there's this thing which is, oh, if something's right-coded and the left

312
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,560
has to think and say and do the opposite.

313
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,400
I love that because it's always really fun, like, going on TV and people will be like,

314
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,120
right, we've brought you on to have this perspective on this subject.

315
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,640
And you come in and you're like, well, actually, the entire way that you've structured this

316
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,560
dichotomy is completely wrong.

317
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,840
The short circuit, don't they?

318
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,080
Yeah.

319
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,440
So I want to talk about ESG.

320
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,840
ESG, for those who don't know, stands for environmental, social and governance.

321
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,160
It's meant to represent the standard for investors to monitor how socially conscious

322
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,880
a business is.

323
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,320
For some, that has made it a kind of awoken a scorecard for investors.

324
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,560
You know, ESG is like woke top Trumps for various companies.

325
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,680
What's your read on ESG?

326
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,520
Maybe we should actually, maybe it would be helpful to kind of go back to that kind of

327
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,920
trichotomy I set up a second ago, which was like winners and losers and people who make the rules.

328
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,240
I think left and right often divide themselves based on different ideas about how we should

329
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,200
treat winners and losers.

330
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,600
Right.

331
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,680
So, you know, the right wing view would be like, we live in a free market society and

332
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,560
the only thing that should matter is which company makes the most profits.

333
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,400
So we shouldn't be forcing them to consider things like environmental, social,

334
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,440
governance, objectives, whatever the market decides who wins.

335
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,600
Or as the left would say, well, that's fine.

336
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,360
But actually the market kind of doesn't account for all the different factors that we do want

337
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,240
to account for.

338
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,680
We need to change the rules a bit to make sure that, you know, if you win, you don't do it at

339
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,160
the expense of other people or if you lose, then you're not kind of just left to starve or die or

340
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,960
whatever.

341
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,160
So we need to make the game, you know, played a slightly different way.

342
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,080
And, you know, that's basically the difference, I suppose, between kind of neoliberalism and

343
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,360
more progressive liberalism.

344
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,360
The thing I think that socialists should come in and say, or maybe we don't often, we always do

345
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,840
this, is actually to point out that the entire game is being played based on rules that have been,

346
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,240
you know, developed by someone else and in which, you know, working people are always going to be

347
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,360
designed to lose.

348
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,040
So ESG, the right will say, no, you want competitive markets.

349
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,400
This makes markets as competitive.

350
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,080
The left would say it helps us to deal with, you know, negative externalities that actually

351
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,520
make society more progressive.

352
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,160
And Marxists would come in and look at this and say, well, this is a way of shoring up the

353
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
legitimacy of a capitalist system that is fundamentally not based on free markets, is

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,760
actually based on the governance of society and control over society by huge corporations that

355
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,000
are able to exploit their workers and wreck the planet without any, really, any kind of pushback

356
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,760
from the state whatsoever, because the state itself is also largely influenced by those

357
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,880
corporate interests.

358
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,800
So ESG comes in as this kind of auto critique by the people who govern the system as a way of

359
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,040
saying, look, we know what we're doing and we're responsible and you can trust us to be able to

360
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,600
look after this system in your interests.

361
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,240
But there is absolutely no way that we will cede any of that control to you.

362
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,400
We will look after the system maybe in a more enlightened way.

363
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,680
We will consider some of the things you're talking about, but you're not ever going to

364
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,720
be able to actually be in the rooms where we make the rules.

365
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,760
And I think that's like what should differentiate a Marxist and a socialist from a progressive,

366
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,040
liberal or whatever, is actually saying, we don't just want to make the system a bit fairer,

367
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,400
we want to give people power.

368
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,440
Just on ESG as well, it's a huge money making opportunity.

369
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,360
So BlackRock's ESG Aware Fund charges fees five times higher than its core S&P 500 fund.

370
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,440
And ESG investment funds have 43% higher fees than conventional investment funds.

371
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,600
So they make more money, we'll talk about the kinds of companies involved in this,

372
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
they make more money around these products.

373
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,120
And like you say, it also fulfills a really important political role.

374
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,840
But it also means there's tremendous power that's now being

375
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,840
concentrated amongst the financial elite.

376
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,560
And like you say, before that was a concentration of economic and political power

377
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,160
based upon the idea that greed is good.

378
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,760
Gordon Gekko is the kind of main character archetype of the 1980s.

379
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,600
That was what our society was.

380
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,480
It does feel like in the last, well, citizens of the global financial crisis,

381
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,960
as Anglophone elites are trying to resurrect political legitimacy, consent,

382
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,280
they're having to change that archetype a bit more to caring enlightened characters.

383
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,560
Now, do you think they've been compelled to do that?

384
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,720
Is it just them trying to exploit an opportunity from, you know,

385
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,520
do good in liberals who would like them to be like that?

386
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,800
Where's it coming from?

387
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,960
Because it does get that criticism from the right as well.

388
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,600
And they would say, I don't agree with it.

389
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,360
I don't agree with the point behind it.

390
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,440
But it's coherent, which is, well, look,

391
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,040
private enterprise is designed to first look after customers,

392
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,080
secondly, look after shareholders, thirdly, look after workers,

393
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,200
forget the rest of this crap.

394
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,160
So where has it come from?

395
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,360
And why has it become so prominent in the last, say, 10 years?

396
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,360
So to understand where it comes from, you know, I think we need to look,

397
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
we've been talking kind of, well, I've been talking kind of

398
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,640
quite abstractly in terms of structures and like, you know, and classes and that sort of thing.

399
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,200
We need to think about how the people in positions of power, you know,

400
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,320
who have the capacity to kind of make decisions that will affect everyone else,

401
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,160
what they're thinking about when, you know,

402
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,480
developing and implementing things like ESG.

403
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,320
Now, it is obviously very clear to anyone with eyes that capitalism has,

404
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,040
at least since the global financial crisis, if not really since 1980s,

405
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:15,040
been suffering from both a crisis of kind of legitimacy and really kind of a crisis

406
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,680
which is pitting capitalism against democracy on the one hand,

407
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:23,040
and also a crisis of kind of reproduction of accumulation, basically,

408
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:30,400
in which it is becoming harder and harder to produce the stuff that we rely on to survive.

409
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,000
And that, you know, capitalism relies on for constant growth,

410
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,960
either because of, you know, climate imperatives, or because of collapse in productivity,

411
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,360
or because of, you know, escalating inequality,

412
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,080
all these sorts of reasons that play into the kind of long-term

413
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,720
productivity crisis that we've had and the associated financial

414
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,120
breakdowns that have come alongside that.

415
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,000
So there's this kind of legitimacy crisis and a kind of, you know,

416
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,640
a crisis of the reproduction of capitalist productive relations and social relations.

417
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,080
And if you are a member of, you know, the ruling class, let's say you are, I don't know,

418
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,160
Larry Fink, and you're the head of BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers,

419
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,560
and you, as, you know, the head of one of the world's largest asset managers,

420
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,840
have a portfolio, well, you don't have a portfolio, you will have a portfolio yourself,

421
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,480
but you govern a company that has lots of portfolios that invests in asset classes across the whole

422
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,880
economy that has a stake in pretty much every, you know, large firm in, say, the S&P 500,

423
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,840
just by virtue of the fact that you're so big, you have to be that diversified.

424
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,960
And it is almost all of them, right?

425
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,640
Yeah, yeah, totally, yeah. You're thinking, right, well, if my business is going to continue to grow,

426
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,760
I need not just, not the kind of, you know, the dynamics that you might want if you're a hedge fund,

427
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,200
which is lots of, you know, massive up and down, ups and downs, lots of crises that can be exploited

428
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,640
to, you know, make use of arbitrage strategies and make clever quick trades that are going to

429
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,280
make you money in the short term. You want really kind of long-term stable growth, you want

430
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,680
corporations to grow, you want corporate profits to grow, and you want people to be able to accumulate

431
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:07,040
savings that they can invest in your assets. And more generally speaking, you know, you want

432
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,200
a society that is characterized by relative stability. And that is true across a whole range

433
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,680
of industries, it's true across, you know, the political class in general, who if you were to

434
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,320
look at it from a kind of Marxist perspective would see their role as not just like maintaining

435
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,280
individual capitalist enterprises, but actually maintaining the broad conditions that allow

436
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,960
capitalist social relations, capitalist reproductive relations to reproduce themselves.

437
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,640
Then, yeah, you know, you are going to be worried about things like climate breakdown,

438
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,360
because that threatens, you want all of those levels, it threatens the legitimacy of the system

439
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,840
because people are going to get scared, people are going to die, it threatens the,

440
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,880
the relations of production, it threatens, you know, the relationships between

441
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,640
different social classes. I mean, if you look at the global economy and the way in which

442
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,200
climate breakdown is like to affect different parts of it, we're going to see breakdowns in

443
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,800
global supply chains of the kind that we saw during the pandemic much more frequently.

444
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,800
And it threatens the kind of very foundations of accumulation, just because like it's going to

445
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,760
be harder to get things out of the ground and like create the crops that people need to survive and

446
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,440
all those different sorts of things. So that's one argument, which is that ESG is about like a

447
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,400
long-term rational self-interest on the behalf of the capitalist class. But the companies with

448
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,320
the best ESG scores in America, and I find this fascinating, and right now it's a right-wing

449
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,800
talking point, but on this, they're correct. The companies with the best ESG scores in America

450
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:37,200
are Google, Microsoft and the Bank of America. Meanwhile, Tesla, which produces literally,

451
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,440
you know, electric vehicles, and you might agree, I disagree obviously with their labor standards,

452
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,520
and we need to have a conversation about using recycled lithium for EVs, but whatever.

453
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,040
EVs are clearly better. We want more public transport. EVs are clearly better than the cars

454
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,080
that people were producing, you know, 20 years ago and for the century preceding that. And the idea

455
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,080
that the Bank of America has a much better ESG score than Tesla. And that's a right-wing talking

456
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,160
point. And I'm just like, yeah, but they're kind of right. Even if you don't like Tesla,

457
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,600
Tesla has accelerated the adoption of electric vehicles by 10, 15, maybe 20 years. And it's

458
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,800
really accelerated the process for Detroit, car manufacturers all around the world, China.

459
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,400
So the idea that that somehow gets like middling ESG scores, I think it's quite fair to say

460
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,480
something's not quite right here. It's not just about the rational self-interest thing, you know?

461
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,280
Well, I think there's two things, again, going on, which is the rationale behind it. And the rationale

462
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,080
behind any climate policy that a government will implement will come from this, we need to protect

463
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,080
capitalism. Basically, you know, it's kind of the Keynesian idea. Jeff Mann wrote that book that was

464
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,240
like, you know, the Keynesian philosophy is basically like protecting capitalism means

465
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,640
protecting civilization. And there is an argument, you know, that these people will view themselves

466
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,520
as these enlightened, you know, platonic rulers whose job it is to basically make sure that

467
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,280
they have this view over society as a whole and can put in place the, like, the conditions that

468
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,640
give rise to the continuation of capitalism itself. But, and this is the interesting thing,

469
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,520
this is where things actually get interesting. If you're looking at, say, the state as a set of

470
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:19,680
institutions or, you know, a mechanism of organizing power, it is not staffed by enlightened technocrats

471
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:25,680
or platonic rulers who can just make policy based on what they consider to be the interests of

472
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,280
society as a whole. They say it is, you know, you ask a politician why they're doing what they're

473
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,120
doing, they say they govern in the general interest. This was Ralph Miliband's famous critique of the

474
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,400
capitalist state and the way that the Labour Party got sucked into it. It was because there's

475
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,360
this idea of state elites as governing the general interest, which is very hypnotic. It's like,

476
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,240
yes, of course, we'll give these people power because they're doing what's good for the rest of us.

477
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,120
But actually, the state isn't that. It's, you know, broadly speaking, as we think of capital,

478
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,000
it's a social relation in the sense that what goes on within the state and the way that state power

479
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,240
is exercised reflects social struggles that take place within society as a whole. That's kind of

480
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,440
abstract. But, you know, you can broadly think of it as like battles that are taking place within

481
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,560
state institutions, whether that's within, you know, the Treasury or any government department.

482
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,960
The players in that battle will be linked to wider groups that will have support from

483
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,080
different, you know, corporate institutions, historically unions, think tanks, basically

484
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,840
different groups that make up constellations of class interests that structure all capitalist

485
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:38,640
societies. And they will influence state policy, not just in a way that is meant to kind of

486
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,720
protect the interests of their class as a whole, but in a way that is meant to protect and promote

487
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,440
specific interests. So like look at like Biden's climate policies, for example, he comes in and

488
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,440
says, we need to save the planet for all these very good reasons. He's backed by capitalists

489
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,920
like Larry Fink who say, yes, actually, we do need to save the planet for the sake of capital.

490
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:01,440
And yet, because of the power of these different groups, these different specific interests,

491
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,920
as opposed to the general interests of capital as a whole, you end up getting this hodgepodge of

492
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,240
climate policies, which actively undermine each other in some senses, even though the narrative

493
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,560
is we're doing something about climate change, everyone can see that ExxonMobil still has a

494
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,920
huge amount of power, can still see that, you know, all these like these banks that are funding

495
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,600
climate change still have a huge amount of power. And so you have this weird like, not only like

496
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,280
the weird fact of policies that go against each other, but the weird show of politicians saying

497
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,280
we're doing something in your interest when it's very clear that they're actually acting on

498
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,080
behalf of a very specific interest. Yeah, I think it and it leads to really messy policy. Yeah,

499
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,920
which neither the left nor the right can really understand. So a really good recent example

500
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,600
is this recent house building announcement by Michael Gove. What does it look like? Well,

501
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,080
they're saying that legislative changes, which result really from an EU dictate, of course,

502
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,520
in 2017 have led to fewer housing starts and completions. First of all, that's not true. We

503
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,200
completed more houses in 2018 and 2016, but park that for a moment. The solution, therefore, is to

504
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:09,440
basically allow people building homes to to have those homes put more crap into local waterways.

505
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,240
That's fine. You know, it's called sediment, but they basically mean effluent and garbage and rubbish

506
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,240
that we flush down our toilets. Now, okay, you would think that's bad if you care about clean

507
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,480
waterways. You might think it's good if you think we're actually building houses are more important.

508
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,960
But here's where it gets really interesting, because it isn't just a regulatory change. They

509
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,640
like to say, we're not going to step back and we're cutting red tape. No, 700 million pounds of

510
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,200
taxpayer money is being spent. How hundreds of millions of pounds are being given to house builders

511
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,280
by the taxpayer, by the state. Hundreds of millions of pounds are being given to private

512
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,320
water companies. Apparently they're private. They pay dividends to their shareholders. And

513
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,560
yet the taxpayers having to pay for stuff here. So what we're doing is we're paying 700 million

514
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:56,000
pounds to allow some people to stop polluting, some people to start polluting, and apparently

515
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,600
it's so we can build more homes. And you think, hold on, couldn't we just use the 700 million

516
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,000
pounds to build to build the homes? Do you know what I mean? Yeah. But it's just this like, and

517
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,800
it's really messy, chaotic and like screwed up. Yeah. And I think that's a big part of the political

518
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,040
debate right now is why the left and the right struggle to get a handle on anything. And it's

519
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,880
why everybody says, look, nobody could minister anything. And I think like you say, it's because

520
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,400
you have these competing interests and also competing ideas, which because they're not governed

521
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,800
in a coherent, structured way, which they were, let's say until 2008, or if you're being really,

522
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:34,000
you know, skeptical, you know, maybe the 1990s, it's just a mess. Well, I mean, I think this is

523
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,880
the point, right? Because we've been stuck in politics for such a long time in this

524
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,200
sterile debate between left progressives or liberal progressives and neoliberals or right

525
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,880
wingers. And the debate is basically like, the state needs to do stuff on the left, you know,

526
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,880
the state needs to do stuff, we need to protect people from the markets, the free market is fine,

527
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,880
but it needs to have some regulation over it. And the right saying the free market is good,

528
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,160
state intervention leads to corruption, you know, we need to get rid of like, you know,

529
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,320
nanny state and bureaucrats and all these different sorts of things. And we have the same

530
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,120
debate we've been having for 100 years, and no one's any the wiser. And of course, that's because

531
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,760
we've lost what should be the socialist or Marxist critique of all this, which is that we don't live

532
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,280
in free markets. Not only are the markets that, you know, do exist under capitalism, not free,

533
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,840
but most of our lives are structured by decisions that are made by big corporations, financial

534
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,320
institutions, states, politicians, who are insulated from democratic accountability precisely

535
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,960
because they're in the pockets of big businesses. And what is really missing there is just an

536
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,000
understanding of the way that power actually works. We have these big ideological debates and

537
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,560
that people who do PPP like to have about freedom versus competition versus, you know,

538
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,760
protection. And actually, none of that matters when it's just the brute fact of power that is

539
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,600
being exercised by people who are in positions of authority over everyone else, who basically

540
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,440
like live in a game that has been designed so that they lose. No wonder you get people, you know,

541
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,840
going for these kind of conspiracy theories, which are like, you know, the world is being run

542
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,560
in this one room by like the World Economic Forum. It's like, that isn't true. You can

543
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:20,720
understand why they think that because there is this like fairly coherent network of institutions

544
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,240
and actors that govern those institutions that whenever a crisis happens, do seem to get together

545
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,640
in a room and say, right, this bank gets bailed out, that one gets to collapse in the pandemic,

546
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,480
this company gets a bailout, that one gets to gets to collapse. And at the same time,

547
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,520
you're being told, oh, we live in a free market. And if you go out and work really hard and

548
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,280
compete in that market and do really well, then you'll come out on top. But also, if the company

549
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,640
that has been exploiting you for 10 years gets, you know, extremely over indebted and needs a

550
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,760
bailout, we'll give them one. But if you get extremely over indebted and need a bailout,

551
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,640
then you're out on the street. Like, of course, it sounds like the system is rigged. You're told

552
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,600
you're living in a free market system. And actually, you live in this, you know, it's like

553
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,280
the iron fist of the powerful versus like the invisible hand of Adam Smith.

554
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,120
Yeah, this was really brought home to me though that I was watching GB News with Darren Grimes.

555
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,080
My regular Saturday viewing. And I was watching because I was about to go on, actually. And I

556
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,680
was preceded by a guy called John Rental, who's this sort of new labor, you know, the Russian

557
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,200
Soviets had a great word for this, ideologist. Yeah, not an ideologue, an ideologist. And PPE,

558
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,920
PPE, the job of PPE, by the way, is to train ideologists of market capital. And he was on

559
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,960
there. And Darren Grimes, and this is what worries me, because Darren Grimes is talking

560
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,400
more sense than John Rental. Darren Grimes says, well, look, there's this massive difference

561
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,360
right now between savings rates and, and things like mortgage rates or credit card debt. So

562
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,760
the base rate of interest 5.25% of the moment, we all know it's been going up for 18 months.

563
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,520
What's the base rate of interest? It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the rate of interest at which

564
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,120
the bank of in and gives money to private banks. Obviously they have to make profits because they're

565
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,560
private enterprises. So they have rates slightly higher right now, their savings rates, I think

566
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:07,040
the average is about 2.6, 2.7%. The average mortgage is almost 6%, 5.75, 5.8%. So there's

567
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,600
this huge difference, right? So they're basically skimming profits. They're charging far more than

568
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,600
they should be with regards to, you know, if you want to take out debt from them, but if you're

569
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,440
depositing savings, they're not really giving you enough. So it's clearly unfair. Darren Grimes

570
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,280
said that in his own way. And John Rental goes, no, no. And he said, should politicians be doing

571
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,080
anything about this? And by the way, Jeremy Hunt called this a problem. Jeremy Hunt and John Rental,

572
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,480
this Blair ideologist says, oh, there's no problem with this. It's the free market. We

573
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,720
shouldn't be getting involved. Oh, bless him. It's the free market. That's so stupid. It's so

574
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,280
stupid. Like the UK financial system is so far from a free market. It's been like accused of

575
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,360
oligopolistic behavior in like loads of reports going back like years. It's the free market. So

576
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,680
first of all, first of all, first of all, we're talking about monetary policy. So that's set by

577
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,520
the Bank of England is set by like a bunch of people in a room. There's no invisible hand.

578
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,040
They arbitrarily determine what it is. They would say, this is the interesting because

579
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,200
historically they would say, oh, they are just setting the current interest rate to align with

580
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,320
the long-term natural rate of interest, which is set by the market. And actually QE and the

581
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,440
policies surrounding that have kind of done away even with that idea. So it's now become obvious

582
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,560
that actually central banks just set interest rates. There's no natural rate of interest.

583
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,120
But then Darren Grimes says something really interesting. He says, but hold on, you're saying

584
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,720
it's the free market. We bailed out the banks in 2009. That wasn't the free market. And I'm thinking,

585
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,360
oh, God, he's gone in. And John Rental was, no, no, no, no, that wasn't, we made money from that.

586
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,960
It wasn't a bailout. Of course it was a bailout. And it wouldn't fucking exist anymore if we hadn't

587
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,760
used taxpayer money to guarantee their liabilities. They were insolvent. And you know, that's where

588
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,400
I get, and we're talking, and it's really important to disaggregate. Let's say progressive liberalism

589
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,120
from the left, what John Rental is presenting there is progressive liberalism. And it makes no

590
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,480
fucking sense. And the right take from Darren Grimes makes him measureably more sense.

591
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,200
And that's where, as you say, people like yourself come in with something a little bit different.

592
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,720
Well, I mean, this is the point, right? Because there's two ways of responding to that. Once you

593
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,880
kind of, once you peek past the veil of capitalist ideology, once you take, what is it, the red pill,

594
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,240
the blue pill? Are you supposed to take? I can't remember. What is it? They say they've been red

595
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,520
pills. I just know black pill is the really bad one. Okay, whatever. Once you take the pill,

596
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,840
that lets you see how everything works. There's two ways of dealing with that, right? The way that I

597
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:27,040
think most people learn to deal with that is by just being forced to deal with this deep sense

598
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,400
of powerlessness, right? You peek past the curtain, you see that there are basically structures in

599
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,240
place that mean that even though you're told from when you are very, very young, if you just work

600
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,400
hard and do well, your life will be good, actually, you are playing in a game that has been designed

601
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:48,640
so that you lose. And you come out of that with disillusionment, with anger, with a sense of,

602
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,320
you know, righteous indignation, basically, which lends itself to the right and it lends

603
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,480
itself to that kind of fascist ideology, that kind of, you know, this is a bit nerdy, but like the

604
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,560
Nietzschean raison-t-amant that feeds fascist movement. Google that. Pause, Google that.

605
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:11,440
Which basically says like, okay, well, I'm in this system, the powerful control it, I can't touch

606
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,720
the powerful, I'm just an individual. So all I can do is elbow all these people around me out the way

607
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,440
with this knowledge that I have about how the system works in order to get myself on top.

608
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,480
And a step further than that, actually, which you're seeing in some really right-wing movements in

609
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,360
Europe particularly, is just burn the whole thing down. It's like climate change is coming,

610
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,920
immigrants are coming, the end of the world is coming, basically, like let the whole thing burn,

611
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,240
let the elites burn, let the system come crashing down, and let's just build this little island

612
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,440
for the worthy, for, you know, the way we consider our group to be able to stay alive on.

613
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,680
And that is where we're going, because that's the way that individualism responds to that

614
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,680
realization of powerlessness, basically. The other way is the way that we would have historically

615
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,120
is that you would organize as part of a movement of other people who share your interests to change

616
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,440
the system, and actually not even just to change the system, but to bring down the system as it is,

617
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,600
and in the process of bringing down that system, not just allowing everything to crash to the ground,

618
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:19,440
but constructing new institutions in the process of revolution, really, that are based on different

619
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,400
values, that are based on community, that are based on, you know, collective struggle, that are

620
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,560
based on social solidarity and support, and that allow you to survive whilst challenging

621
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,280
the interests of the powerful. Now, because we live in such a brainwashed, individualistic society,

622
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,480
it's basically impossible for people to imagine what that would look like. Like if you ask someone,

623
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,200
how are you going to, you know, like react against injustice, they'll say, oh, I'll buy a tote bag,

624
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,160
or like, I'll tweet something. Like there's no sense of how you might get involved in a collective

625
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,640
project to actually challenge the structures of the system as a whole. And that's the legacy of

626
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,320
neoliberalism and individualism, that was the very aim of, like, thatcherism, was to destroy our

627
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,040
sense of social solidarity. So I think for the left, the biggest challenge is, yes, firstly,

628
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,040
exposing the fact that the system is rigged, but I think most people know that the system is rigged,

629
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,200
right? Like, this is basically what my forthcoming book is about, it's about all the ways in which

630
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,320
the system is rigged. It's called Vulture Capitalism. Vulture Capitalism, corporate crimes,

631
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,960
backdoor bailouts, and the death of freedom. The death of freedom? Yes, I know. Well, that's

632
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,880
going to really go down one in the universe. I know, I know. I can see Tucker Carlson saying,

633
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:35,440
the death of freedom? By a Marxist. And yeah, so that's kind of what that book is about. It's

634
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,280
basically about all the ways the system is rigged and the beginnings of kind of how we could think

635
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,040
about building something new. But I think the real challenge is actually speaking to this nihilistic,

636
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:53,360
individualistic, conspiratorial, like, resentful response to that realization with a politics

637
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:58,080
of hope rather than basically like a politics of death. So true. Like, I think one of the,

638
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,880
I thought in the second half of the 2010s, it was a huge win for the left that, you know, we would,

639
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,240
you know, we'd go on the radio waves and on TV, 2017 election. And we'd said, the system is rigged.

640
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,800
And, you know, we were like, wow, so powerful, Bernie kind of vibes. It was working, you know,

641
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,040
Labour increased their vote by 10%. You think there is momentum here towards a different kind

642
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,000
of politics. And I remember talking to Jake Berry, who's a Tory MP, and he talked about, you know,

643
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,800
what was the line they had for Theresa May? Strong and steady. Strong and stable. And then I said,

644
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,080
she's not a strong woman. I said, she's strong against the weak and she's weak against the

645
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,520
strong. You exploit, you exploit the weak and you get on your knees in front of the powerful.

646
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,880
So that ain't strength, my friend. And he was like, you know, inverting that little thing.

647
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,840
Anyway, so we thought that was like a moment where we were really cutting through with it.

648
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,400
And like you say, that's now the common sense of everyone. Everyone says the system is rigged.

649
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,360
It's only like these 5% of like, Libs, but like, who are all in the media. And like,

650
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:02,480
they're the only ones who don't say the system's rigged. Everybody, everybody says the system is

651
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,600
absolute. They might not be, you know, angry, but they might be saying like, look, for now,

652
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,360
I'm doing okay. You know, I'm managing, which is many people, right? I'm not saying they're all

653
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,600
ready for revolution. This is for like, everything was fine before Brexit or everything was fine

654
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,600
before whatever. Like if we could just go back to normal, sensible politics, I don't want to

655
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,160
have to think about politics anymore. I'm politically homeless, that sort of thing.

656
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,800
Yeah, the sort of, you know, your new balance, the rest is politics, listen to the kind of person.

657
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,040
But what I mean, what I want to say is here that you're right, we thought in the latter half of

658
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,240
the 2010s that like, wow, there's this huge political progress for the left to say the system

659
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,960
rigged, people are buying it. There's an elite, an avaricious elite who are screwing the rest of

660
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,360
society. That is now the music coming from everywhere. That was also what Trump said,

661
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,000
right? Frankly, in many ways. And you're seeing it a lot, a lot with the right who have obviously

662
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,120
a very different political message. And like you say, for me, you've got like two archetypes here,

663
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:58,960
which is like mid 20th century, Nibevan. Okay, you, your, your, your loved one or your sibling,

664
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,280
they have tuberculosis, or they have some, you know, horrendous disease. That's why we need

665
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,200
a national health service, right? Okay, well, something similar in the, in the 2020s in the

666
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,000
United States. Oh, you know, a family member can't afford insulin in the US. Who are they

667
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,560
watching? Andrew Tate. And he's saying it's the matrix out to get you the establishments out to

668
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,720
get you. But what's he saying is the answer. He's saying, get rich, you know, screw lots of women,

669
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,320
work out, you know, get good at fighting. And that's in the absence of alternatives.

670
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,160
That's really alluring for lots of young men. Yeah. No, I totally see that because you're

671
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,400
basically, you know, again, and this is the massive ideological success of neoliberalism,

672
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,160
also, than anything to do with convincing us that, you know, we live in free markets,

673
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,280
is to convince us that we are individual competitors in this big old game. And that

674
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,120
everyone has, broadly speaking, the same chances to win the game, or if they don't,

675
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,480
then they at least have the chance to better their lot in life if they just, you know,

676
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,800
work hard and get to know the rules of the game and exploit their competitive advantage against

677
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,040
the people around them. And that is the natural result of putting market ideology onto every

678
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,960
area of social life, because you come to look at yourself as like a commodity. So you're like,

679
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,640
why, how can I win the game better? I need to, you know, understand the rules and the rules are

680
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,560
hidden. So someone like Andrew, take and show me what the rules are. And then I need to get strong

681
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,200
and powerful so I can beat everyone around me. And then I'll be at the top. And maybe, you know,

682
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,040
half the people are thinking, well, when I'm at the top, then I can do nice things for my family

683
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,800
or like make the system better. Maybe they're thinking, then I can take control. Maybe they're

684
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,400
thinking that I can burn the whole thing down. But everything is structured around the idea that

685
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,760
you need to get to the top, you need to win, you need to beat everyone around you. And only then

686
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,520
can you start to think about social change, which is actually the absolute opposite of how any

687
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,680
social change will happen. It is how you make yourself easy to control basically is by buying

688
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,080
this ideology that you can be a winner in this system, where there are other people who will

689
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:01,120
set the rules and always shift the goalposts. And where there will always be losers. And where

690
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:05,680
those losers will largely speaking always be the same people. And probably you are part of that

691
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,760
group that will always be trapped in this constant struggle and that will never really escape. The

692
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,440
only way out of that is to recognize that you are part of a group and that your interests are not

693
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,280
in beating everyone else around you, which is ultimately impossible and you're never going

694
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,280
to be able to do anyway. Your interests lie in kind of creating communities that can work together

695
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,720
to firstly protect each other and support each other, and then actually start to rebel against

696
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,920
the people who are actually in charge. We're going to clip that, put it on TikTok, like

697
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:43,360
Sigma male music, the real Grace Blakely on the real matrix. It does sound like the matrix.

698
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,880
On the real matrix. Are liberals our people? Are they part of our movement? And I mentioned,

699
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,760
you know, John Rental earlier on saying that, you know, the remark alone, and of course the banks

700
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,840
are doing nothing wrong. We bailed them out. It wasn't a bailout, blah, blah, blah. And the sort

701
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,200
of the formulae political strategy that you hear time after time after time is that the left needs

702
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,960
him to do anything. Right? He's one of our people, you know, the left and people, I don't even think

703
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,120
he's a liberal or whatever, you know, the center, which is very few people numerically, but obviously

704
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,920
has tremendous agenda setting power, inserting more generally. Are they part of our movement?

705
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,360
Are they part of our coalition? Or does the inclusion of establishment liberals within our

706
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:32,480
coalition actually foreclose the possibility of broader class based politics? You know,

707
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,520
I've got this question here. Do you know, do you think it's weird that the Ford Foundation and

708
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:43,120
the Rockefeller Foundation have used as somehow advancing progressive courses? You know, I saw

709
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,840
that think tank recently, what's it called? More in common. More in common. We've got more in common.

710
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,480
And they wrote this piece, they had this poll rather, and it showed that if Jeremy Corbyn was

711
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,480
leader of the Labour Party, he would only be, Labour would be one point ahead of the Tories.

712
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,000
And obviously this was being raised showing people, I was like, but hold on, this is a poll

713
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,960
brought to you by like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. Why do you think people

714
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,880
funded by people like that would ask that question? Ask yourself. And, and it's precisely those kinds

715
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,680
of groups, the sort of liberal NGOs that we have been told, I believed it for a long time. I mean,

716
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,640
you said earlier, you wanted to work in that kind of world. They were part of our coalition. Do you

717
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:31,120
think that's true or not? I think that there are two questions, one of which relates to do we need

718
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,440
to build a coalition in which the average person who is maybe not that politically engaged, but

719
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,800
probably falls somewhere around the inadvertent commerce centre of the political like spectrum

720
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:48,560
needs to be involved? Yes. And then what we do with the hangover of Blairism and neoliberalism and,

721
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:53,920
you know, years of this kind of warped style of public debate that we have had, which is all

722
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,800
of these people who think they're very important, and in some ways are very important and don't

723
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,880
like us. And there are a number of different answers to that. And I think it varies from

724
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,160
person to person. Broadly speaking, I think these people are rudderless. And that's why they are

725
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,840
coming out and saying all of these wild things. You know, they were thrust to power on the back

726
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:21,040
of a movement that didn't threaten the status quo, which still was kind of covered in this

727
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:26,160
image of progressiveness and change and hope. And they still see themselves in that sense,

728
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,240
they see themselves as kind of, you know, vanguards of sensible, compassionate politics

729
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,680
who are protecting the centre ground against extremes on all sides, of course, without

730
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,080
realising that the very reason that the extremes have grown more powerful is precisely because

731
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:47,280
they are in control. But that's, you know, besides the point. The question then is, I suppose,

732
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:54,320
you know, how can they either be engaged or neutralised? And that rudderlessness is in some

733
00:49:54,320 --> 00:50:04,080
ways an asset, because if we are able to kind of basically build our own movement, which we're

734
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:12,080
still very much in the process of doing, that can provide the fulcrum around which political debate

735
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,560
is organised, then they have to pick a side. We don't have that power at the moment. We don't

736
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,000
have that agenda setting power at the moment. We are, as the left, as socialists, still in this

737
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,840
kind of confused position with regards to like mainstream political debates, like sometimes

738
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,000
people like me are on TV, but most of the time the issues that we're talking about aren't the

739
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,440
issues that we'd like to be talking about. We have a limited amount of power to actually shape

740
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,120
the way that that process continues. And it is actually those centrists who are in these positions

741
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:45,040
of authority who are able to kind of set the terms of the debate. If we're going to be thinking about

742
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,800
neutralising or engaging those people in a positive way, basically we would need to have more power

743
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:58,400
ourselves. And that is the challenge. I think if we're able to kind of build this project back

744
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,800
out, fight back against the narratives that are being pushed by the far right, build institutions

745
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,760
like Navarra that gain some level of agenda setting power, those people then have to start

746
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,120
talking about the things that we want them to talk about. And as soon as they're starting to

747
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:14,480
talk about the things that we want them to talk about, they then have to pick a side and the

748
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,640
sides are defined by us. Whereas at the moment we're going into their institutions and we are

749
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,800
put into one of these two sides which are defined by them. This is what I was saying at the beginning

750
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,040
about how they'll bring me in and say, you're taking this side of the debate and then be shocked

751
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:34,080
when I don't argue the line that they want me to argue. So yeah, I think, as I say, co-opt or

752
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:40,880
neutralise them. There has to be a position from which we can exert authority. And at the moment

753
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,240
we don't massively have that, although it is changing slightly. I think actually the slow

754
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:53,920
implosion of mainstream media and the growth of online platforms and problems like Navarra,

755
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,320
they are paying attention to that. Whenever I go into mainstream media studios, there's all

756
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:04,560
panic about how are they going to adapt to the digital age and the BBC, I don't know if you saw

757
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,280
that BBC feedback thing where it's like Radio 4 is losing listeners, what do we do?

758
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:07,920
That's crazy.

759
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,160
Yeah. So I think there is a sense of they know that they're kind of rudeless,

760
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,440
they know that the questions they're asking don't really attach to conversations that are

761
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:21,040
taking place in society more generally. But they're still in control of the way that those debates

762
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:27,040
happen and that's not going to change until they aren't. So I don't really know if that answers

763
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,240
the question. Grace just mentioned organisations like Navarra Media. Yes.

764
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,080
And I want to take this opportunity to say that you can help us grow and you can help us

765
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,880
change the political debate in this country and change politics by supporting our work.

766
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,560
So if you go to navarramedia.com forward slash support, you can make a one-off payment,

767
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,920
you can become a supporter. I think we have 12, 13,000 supporters these days.

768
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,960
You know, I'm from Bournemouth. You could fill the vitality stadium and more with the people

769
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,760
that support Navarra Media. That's great. Why don't you join them and go to navarramedia.com

770
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,720
forward slash support and make a ideally a monthly payment or whatever you can.

771
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,720
You know, our catchphrase back in the day used to be new media for different politics.

772
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,040
And I was thinking about this recently, I didn't come up with it so I can say this,

773
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,080
it's brilliant, right? Okay. Because it's showing a problem and it's showing a solution

774
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:20,560
and it's showing how to get there in one simple sentence. What's the problem? Politics.

775
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:26,640
What's the instrument to improving it? Media. How do we get better media to inflect politics?

776
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,280
Us. Yes. And obviously not just Navarra Media, Tribune, Jacobin, innumerable outlets out there,

777
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:39,520
but I think you're right to say it's probably the lowest hanging fruit in terms of pushing politics

778
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:46,080
this country left is taking on MSM. And like it's, it's happening whether we like it or not,

779
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,280
that crumbling, it's about, you know, how's it going to fall? How the piece is going to land?

780
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,000
So like I said, if you want it to land in a good way, go to navarramedia.com forward slash support.

781
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,600
I endorse this message. I'm very, I'm very glad you do. You know,

782
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:05,840
you said earlier on your IPPR. Yeah. I was doing some work with them.

783
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,040
I remember. Good times. I remember. And I remember, we did, I made a video with you.

784
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,360
Some people might not know this, but I don't, I don't just write stuff. I'm also a very bad

785
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:21,920
videographer. No. I used to sort of dabble in it. And I made a video with you. And I remember

786
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,240
that somebody had like 5,000 followers on Twitter and I was like, what is going on, Grace?

787
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,280
And now how many do you have? Like 180,000 or something.

788
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,880
Still not good enough, but still. I just, I hate, I hate it.

789
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,960
No, but you're such an eloquent voice and you're so informative on, on finance stuff,

790
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,200
which obviously is, you know, is quite hard to penetrate for most people. I think it's obscured

791
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,880
intentionally. Of course. You know, they don't want it to be easy to understand for most people.

792
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,240
And I think, you know, it's great you're finding an audience. Why quickly? Why do you hate Twitter?

793
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,880
You said, don't you hate it? Really, like, you know, all of what I've been talking about so far

794
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:02,240
has been to do with these ideologies that keep us subjected to control

795
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,880
and that we reproduce inside our heads all the time, right? And so being

796
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,920
on social media and having lots of followers and being on TV and being like successful in

797
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:24,080
publishing books, it like, we are supposed to be, we are talking often to people who are losing out

798
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,120
as a result of the systems that, which they have no control. And you are speaking from the

799
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,600
perspective of someone who's winning as part of all of those systems. And I see this now.

800
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,880
Do you see yourself as winning?

801
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,480
Yeah, I think so. And I see this now, you know, like the, the, the most kind of

802
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:44,400
aggressively neoliberal, marketized way that you can look at this, you're gonna get like the

803
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,560
value you have as a human being is to do online dating, right? Because that is a market in a sense.

804
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,880
You know, historically, you wouldn't have a market for partners, you'd have a community,

805
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,080
you'd meet X amount of people over the course of your life, you pick one, you, you know,

806
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,120
you go with them. Now we have this hugely liquid market, which has got loads and loads of people

807
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,280
in it. And the more liquid a market, the better the price mechanism works. So the better you're

808
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,600
able to see, you know, based on the force of supply and demand, what your price, what your value

809
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:16,640
is in the market. And even though they don't tell you where exactly you sit in that hierarchy,

810
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,960
you can tell by the number of matches you get, or like, you know, the way people respond to you

811
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,560
in that game. And if you are attractive, if you have lots of social media followers, people

812
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:29,040
are obsessed with social media followers and fame and influence. And if you like have a good job

813
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:34,320
and you're successful, then you have a high price in that market for human beings for partners.

814
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:43,120
And I find myself in that position, whilst also, and you know, benefiting from that position,

815
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:51,200
whilst also really disliking the idea that it is possible to assign a price value to a person

816
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,440
based on these metrics of success over which we have no control. And also having to accept that,

817
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,080
like, according to all of those metrics of success over which we have no control, I'm winning.

818
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,240
Because like, I was born into a relatively well off family in a rich country in a rich part of

819
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:11,040
the world and went to Oxford and like, played this game well. And it just is, I think,

820
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:16,800
basically, it poisons you if you identify with it. It poisons you because you start thinking,

821
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,480
I'm a winner. I've come out on top. I'm better in one way or another. And it's not even conscious

822
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,600
half the time. It's kind of unavoidable. It's like the adoption of an attitude that you take

823
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:32,000
towards what you're doing and the people who are around you. And if you can't take off that identity

824
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,960
and like leave it at the door and be like, that's something that has happened because of the screwed

825
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,840
up way that our society exists and I have it and that's great. And I'm going to try and use it the

826
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:47,040
best way I can. But then say, I am just a person. I don't have a value that you can correlate with

827
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,800
the number of social media followers I have or the number of matches I get on Ninja. I have,

828
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,920
you know, friends that see me who I am. I have like hobbies and things that I do that have

829
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,240
absolutely nothing to do with that stuff. I am not playing this game most of the time. I'm just

830
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:07,280
being myself. Unless you can do that, you become your brain melts quickly. What hobbies do you have?

831
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,520
I really like surfing. Okay, so I wanted something more like warhammer or something.

832
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,680
No, I think weightlifting. I think there's,

833
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,040
you know, you were saying about how producers expect you to have formulae,

834
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,560
sort of, because you're on the left, liberal values. I actually have a major critique of

835
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:31,120
dating apps. Like I genuinely think there's a huge downside to how we're socializing young people

836
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:36,000
who've never known anything else. So maybe people are a bit younger than you. And I think we need a

837
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,600
proper conversation about it. Yeah. And I'm considering doing an article about this.

838
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,120
You should. Yeah. I mean, I, and I've had this conversation many, many times I've gone on TV

839
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,640
and they expect you as the lefty, you know, oh, should we have our phones be banned in schools?

840
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,040
And I go, of course I should. We should have limits on social media for young people. What are

841
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:57,040
you talking about? We're literally incentivizing addiction to fund, to fund the world's largest,

842
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,800
wealthiest companies. Of course we should. But like they don't view that as a left-wing position

843
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,160
because they think the left-wing position on everything is, let everybody do everything

844
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,160
that they want. Well, some government too. So like maybe, yeah, we should have, you know,

845
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,320
the government should oversee like, there should be like an inquirer. No, like, no,

846
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,560
I think that there shouldn't really be, I fundamentally think kids below 11,

847
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,760
12 shouldn't have a smartphone. And they certainly shouldn't be allowed in schools. You know,

848
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,000
it's interesting that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs didn't let their children have smartphones

849
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,160
precisely these reasons. But I think dating apps is a really similar thing where, you know, maybe

850
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,720
there's an authoritarian impulse there. I am actually, I am really, and look,

851
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,680
we'll find out in 2030 years time, right? It's like smoking. It's like smoking in the 1950s.

852
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,760
What are the long-term impacts of this stuff? And I think there might be some really big ones

853
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,960
actually. Oh yeah, totally. I think, yeah, unless you can actually, you know, learn to

854
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:56,880
disaggregate yourself from these, all of these systems that surround our lives. And it's so

855
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,040
prevalent now with the way that we use social media, and with the way that the labor market

856
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,840
is constructed based on, you know, the gig economy and like mini entrepreneurs and stuff.

857
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:13,200
If you cannot like, learn to take your identity out of these settings where you are being told

858
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,920
that you as a person have a value based on the things that you do, then you will make yourself

859
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:23,040
miserable and mentally ill. And even if you win, even if you're at the top, you're going to make

860
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,840
yourself miserable. And especially if you lose. This is why I love having an Iranian dad.

861
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,800
Why? Because he, well, maybe it's the same with your parents. He has no idea what I do.

862
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,080
No, my parents know what I do. So he goes, why do you go on TV? Like what you have on YouTube?

863
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:42,240
How the hell does that work? Don't you have to like, don't you have to work in TV to go on TV?

864
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:47,440
And I'm like, no, it's like, Christ, he has no idea. He has no, he's not, bless him. He has no idea

865
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,600
what Navarra is. He's like, you're employed. I was like, yeah, there's about 25 of us. We have

866
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:57,920
like a place in Leeds. No way, no, but it's really grounding. It's great. Because sometimes my wife

867
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,040
goes, oh, it's so impressive. We don't write myself. You know what? My dad literally hasn't got the

868
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,440
first fucking book. It's really useful, like you say, like, so you don't go like, you don't believe

869
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:11,840
the smoke that, you know, might be blown up around us on the, on the liberal thing. Are they part of

870
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:18,000
our coalition? So this was a, this was an issue which I thought was really key within that,

871
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,560
which was the Farage debanking saga. Oh, yeah. So this was really fun, actually, because I got to

872
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:32,000
have the, the only kind of different line, which was, so obviously it was like, he should have

873
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,040
access to a bank account, or, you know, he shouldn't because he's a bad person, liberals versus

874
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:42,640
progressives, whatever. I was like, Farage says that we live in a free market capitalist economy,

875
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,800
and in a free market capitalist economy, a private bank has every right to make decisions based on

876
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,160
what it considers to be its interests and its profits, and therefore he should have no problem

877
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,880
with a bank deciding whether or not to give a bank account. I personally believe that firstly,

878
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,000
we do not largely live in a free market economy. We live in an economy in which the heads of

879
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,200
private institutions have an immense amount of power to make decisions without any democratic

880
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,520
accountability whatsoever. That isn't very good. And that we should be moving towards an economy

881
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,920
in which we have collective democratic public control over all of our institutions, including

882
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,760
banks, so that everyone gets a bank account, and we all collectively get to make the rules as to how

883
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,800
those bank accounts are administered. And everyone was just like, that doesn't make any sense.

884
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,600
Oh, they just ignored me and kind of carried on talking around the issue.

885
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,760
Well, he, I mean, it was interesting with him was he was saying, because for people watching this

886
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:33,360
archfake news, he didn't get, he didn't have, he wasn't given a business account where he was,

887
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,480
which was Coots, which is a subsidiary of NatWest, and he wasn't offered a business

888
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,880
account, a bunch of other banks. He was offered a regular, you know, current account, but presumably

889
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,320
Nigel, for our big shot, Nigel, you know, he probably wants to use it in the US when he goes

890
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,280
to support Trump later this year and whatnot. And that wouldn't have been, wouldn't have been

891
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:54,160
sufficient. And he himself said, you know, until quite recently, we had post office,

892
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,480
and everybody had a right to get a post office bank account. I'm thinking, what, you support,

893
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,720
you support a nationally owned bank, which is going to be the banker of last resort for people

894
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,960
in this country who can't get bank accounts anywhere else. But what I mean, what I suppose

895
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:14,720
what they would say is, it's an issue of, it's a matter of law. So whether or not somebody should

896
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:20,720
be able to access banking, should be, should be a matter of civil rights and law, rather than policy.

897
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,720
And it's, this is a big difference now, I think, between like some parts of the left and others.

898
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:30,160
I think as a civil right, that should be in tried and law. Lots of people liberals think, no, well,

899
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,640
it's, you know, these should be very flexible and one policy can apply here and another policy

900
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,680
can apply there. So what Farage would say is, well, it should be illegal to debank people

901
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,840
below a certain threshold, right? That's what he would say. But like you say, once you get into

902
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:47,680
that terrain, well, okay, if we're going to talk about the law as a constraint on the free market,

903
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,960
okay, let's have capital control, you could argue for anything, frankly. Do you think that,

904
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,200
do you think they've always lived with those inconsistencies? I mean, the right, the sort of

905
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,200
thatch right, right, or is it sort of becoming more pronounced because now they've got more

906
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:06,720
exposure, you know, their inconsistencies are perhaps in the spotlight more or was it always there?

907
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,840
There are two sets of inconsistencies that I think are important here, one of which is inherent to

908
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:17,280
the neoliberal movement and the other of which stems from the necessary alliance between neoliberals

909
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:24,160
and kind of far right extremists, basically. And the first inconsistency is the inconsistency

910
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:30,720
with a neoliberal thought, which says that this is an ideology based on kind of the need to promote

911
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:37,600
human freedom, that accepts that we are all kind of equal individuals playing this free market game.

912
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:45,920
And the job of a kind of good politician is to set up the rules of that game so that they are

913
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:52,000
fair, so that, you know, as a society, we think basically that they're fair and such that they

914
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:58,400
prop up the kind of norms and rules of economics. So we have to have a legal system, basically,

915
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,200
that kind of supports the functioning of the economy and make sure that everyone knows how to

916
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,800
play the free market game fairly, right? So that's the kind of neoliberal idea about what the state

917
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:14,080
should do. Their critique of the way that the state is, is that it's taken over by vested

918
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:20,480
interests by bureaucrats who just make policy in the interests of, you know, their little kingdom

919
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:25,280
building or fiefdom building. And the problem with the neoliberal theory is that they never say,

920
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,680
how do we get from here to there? How do we get from a state that's governed by vested interests to

921
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:35,120
one that's governed by neutral technocratic enlightened bureaucrats? And of course, we don't.

922
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:42,960
We just end up with the neoliberal agenda basically being used to push into power people who

923
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:50,960
veil their naked desire for power with a spiel about the need for free markets and competition,

924
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:55,680
whereas actually the free market game that they are going to construct and set up will be rigged

925
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:04,320
in their favor. It's just that the only impetus, the only kind of, the only power that they end up

926
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:09,840
having is the power to crush people who interfere with the game from a particular perspective. So

927
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,120
you see anti-competition law, for example, in the US being used to break up unions,

928
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:19,200
but not being used to break up kind of big firms and big banks and stuff. So there's this like,

929
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:25,680
this inherent problem at the heart of neoliberal ideology, which is its orientation towards the

930
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:31,120
state basically. It's like the state should be used, state policy and the legal system and law

931
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:37,680
should all be used to construct this fair good free market economic game. And the fact of life

932
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,800
under capitalism, which has never been a pure free market system, it's always been a system of kind

933
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,600
of private government by capital. And that private government is exercised both within the firm and

934
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:53,920
over the state as a whole. And there's this kind of what, you know, some theorists have called

935
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,200
this like double truth, what Hayek called actually a double truth at the heart of neoliberal philosophy,

936
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,960
which is tell everyone that we want less state intervention and kind of, you know, a cutting

937
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,920
of red tape and a removal of the state to make space for the free market. And the actual neoliberal

938
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:16,640
goal, which is creating this apparatus from within the state that supports the functioning of the

939
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:22,960
free market under the influence of capitalists who are actually rigging that game in their favour.

940
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,840
So this whole like big state, small state thing again, is that that's the

941
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,840
massive biggest lie at the heart of neoliberalism. And then there's the other thing

942
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,920
that even if you didn't have all of that, even if you just accepted the fact that neoliberals

943
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,880
do think there should be this big state, small state, free markets versus state intervention

944
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:45,200
dichotomy, there's this problem that's come with their from their alliance with the far right,

945
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,160
which is, as I've said, basically composed of people who considered themselves to be

946
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:57,040
losers or on the verge of losing from the free market economic game and want protections put

947
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:03,040
in place against people who they consider to be outsiders to preserve what remains of the

948
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:08,000
spoils of that game for their group. So you have basically the answer between neoliberals who set

949
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,120
up an economy in which people were permanently divided into winners and losers with people

950
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:20,880
who have ended up losing and now think that we basically need to kind of shit on immigrants

951
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:26,000
and like, you know, put women in their place in order to preserve their special status within

952
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,680
a game where they feel like losers. And that creates obvious sources of conflict, which we

953
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:37,920
saw most clearly with, you know, the divide between Johnson's Brexiteers and the kind of extreme

954
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:44,720
neoliberal libertarian wing of the conservative party that descends from kind of Thatcher.

955
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:50,400
I think David Graber called it the iron law of liberalism, which is like when government tries

956
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:55,840
to reduce need for government in this hamfisted way of just like salami slicing public budgets and

957
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,240
so on, they increase the need for government. That's not to say that you come, you know, some

958
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,400
things maybe couldn't be done by the government. Of course, of course, you can have that conversation

959
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,520
and you focus on the things that are really important. So for instance, a pacifist would say

960
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,960
we could spend less on arm spending, for instance. But I think his insight is really interesting.

961
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,080
And it's fascinating what you say about that being a fundamental inconsistency

962
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,880
and contradiction within neoliberalism about here, what you think, the area of values,

963
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,760
here's where you want to get an A can never lead to B. It's like that meme, there's a video of like

964
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:30,000
Sean Dyson, Pep Guardiola, have you seen this? No. And you've got Sean Dyson, she's going,

965
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,920
keep the ball out of there and that end, put it in the goal and that end. And then you've got

966
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,680
Pep Guardiola saying, we have the inverted right back, we play the false nine, we bring him.

967
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,360
It's like, so you've got two reeds on football, right? One is like very basic Brexit football,

968
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,280
and then there's like, you know, sexy total football, Pep style. And like,

969
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:53,120
neoliberals love to say, cut the steak, free markets, free people, free government, blah,

970
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:58,160
and it's like, no, like you end up in the most arcane, we'll do this subsidy here and we'll

971
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:02,080
cut this here and we'll create this new quanguns, agency, we'll have this and we'll lose money here,

972
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,560
but we'll tax those guys. Like going back to what I said earlier on with this housing policy from

973
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,320
Michael Gove, they'll be allowed to pollute more, but we'll have this change here and we'll give

974
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,320
more money here and taxpayer money can go to this private company here. And even though it's

975
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,800
probably only they still have shareholder dividends, if they don't pay the dividends,

976
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:22,080
we'll give them money to pay the dividends. Yeah, just just bring water into public ownership

977
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:28,240
and bring and build some social housing. Like this whole system and the most ingenious thing

978
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:32,800
about this, right, is that every new piece of regulation creates opportunities for profit

979
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:39,360
making. Because there's regulatory arbitrage, you can like, you know, use the gaps in existing

980
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,840
regulation to make sure that you're winning against your competitors, because I don't know,

981
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:50,240
you're like using profit shifting or like other forms of regulatory arbitrage, which basically

982
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:54,640
just means exploiting differences between laws or gaps in regulation to like create opportunities

983
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,840
for profit. You saw this with the financial crisis, right? Like there was this explosion in

984
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,080
regulation of the finance sector in some ways, especially at the international level going up

985
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:08,160
to the crisis of 2008. And we're talking about how assets were classified and categorized and how

986
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,960
banks were supposed to value those assets and the way that they were supposed to kind of assess

987
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:19,200
risk. And actually, that ended up creating opportunities for profit making. It, for example,

988
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:23,760
incentivize the the parceling up of all these different mortgages into these mortgage backed

989
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,400
securities that looked really safe, because they were supposedly diversified. But which actually

990
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,560
obviously had, you know, within that process, there was this constant risk of kind of massive

991
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,720
catastrophic meltdown. And so that process of setting regulation ended up creating opportunities

992
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:43,600
for profit making, that also caused the financial crisis. And this is always the case, like whenever

993
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:49,280
you get a new law, there are ways of exploiting the existence of that law to make money. And

994
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:53,280
private interest will always do that. It's the same with as well with like, you know,

995
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,840
carbon, carbon credits, the ways that those were set actually ends up making money at the European

996
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,760
level for for some companies when they were able to sell those. So regulation creates opportunities

997
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,840
for profit making. So Labour keeps saying that they'll smash the class ceiling when they're

998
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:13,040
in government, they'll smash the class ceiling. What does that mean? Well, it depends on whether

999
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:19,440
or not you are a Marxist or a Liberal. To me, smashing the class ceiling means dissolving

1000
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,120
the distinction between the people who own the means of production and those who are forced

1001
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:28,720
to work for a living on pain of destitution by socializing the ownership of and control and

1002
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,800
governance of all of the assets that we need to produce the things that we need to survive.

1003
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:40,560
It means dissolving the very existence of class as mediated by ownership, basically.

1004
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:48,880
To a Liberal, it means making sure that the people who start life as losers maybe get to be winners

1005
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,720
for a few minutes at some point in their lives. So, you know, the whole Liberal imaginary is about

1006
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:58,480
making sure that rather than actually dissolving the divide between, you know, workers and the

1007
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,480
owners of the means of production between capital and Labour, it means making sure that there's

1008
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:08,240
more sortition amongst Labour and maybe the capacity every now and again for some people

1009
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:15,200
within Labour to get into the position of being capitalists. But again, very rarely. So it's about,

1010
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,920
yeah, you know, social mobility or whatever. It's not about changing the structure of the system.

1011
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,400
There's always going to be winners. There's always going to be losers. And largely speaking,

1012
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:30,000
those winners and losers will be the same people generally pretty consistently throughout

1013
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:36,400
our history, although there will be periods of change and of shift. And the Liberal viewers just

1014
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,640
say that change should happen a little bit more frequently. People like us should be in charge.

1015
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,960
Exactly. Let's have social mobility. So comprehensive kids like me and on the first

1016
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:49,040
of my family to go to university and I'll not stop tweeting about it. Let's have more people

1017
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,480
like me in charge. You know, we did a great interview with Dan Evans and he has a brilliant

1018
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:59,120
critique of social mobility as really a sort of justifying veneer for a dysfunctional economic

1019
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,960
social and political system, which also, by the way, increasingly can't even produce any growth

1020
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:08,480
or improved living standards. And like the veneer on that is, sure, we've had zero growth 15 years,

1021
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,880
living standards are falling, but I'm the first person in my family to go to university. What the

1022
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,840
hell are you talking about? I think this actually comes back to the point that I made at the very

1023
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,280
start of this interview, right, about the difference between winners and losers and people who make

1024
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:24,560
the rules, right? Like the conservative view is just that like the winners are the winners and

1025
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,440
the losers are the losers. And that's fair because that's based on competition and competition is

1026
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:33,680
its own process of fairness. For those on the left, it's like, well, we should make sure that if

1027
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,680
people do lose, they're protected in some way. And actually, they have more opportunities to

1028
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,760
become winners and that the winners pay a little bit more to make sure that society works a little

1029
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:46,400
bit better. Whereas the Marxist or the socialist view should be there shouldn't be winners and

1030
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:50,480
losers and people that make the rules. It should be we all make the rules together.

1031
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,280
It's a completely different way of organising society.

Grace, on that note, we'll leave it there. When's your book out for people who perhaps come into

1033
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,200
you for the first time though? I find it very hard to believe. No, I mean, I'm sure I've been away

1034
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,960
for quite a while. I hope that there'll be people who come in for the first time. That's the point

1035
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:12,800
of coming on, I guess. When is it coming out? The 7th of March, I think, next year. Yeah,

1036
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,080
so early March next year. And if people want to follow your work, where can they find you?

1037
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:23,600
They can find me at Grace Blakely. Blakely has two E's, EL, EY, on Twitter, on Instagram,

1038
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,120
even on TikTok. Oh, wow, TikTok. And you're right for Tribune. You've got a phone there.

1039
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:36,800
And I'm right for Tribune, yes. Great. Well, thank you so much. Thank you.

1040
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,920
Thank you.
