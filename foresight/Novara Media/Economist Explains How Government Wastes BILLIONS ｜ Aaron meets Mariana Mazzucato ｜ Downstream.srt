1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Why do we only take things seriously when it's about war?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,520
And this is an important question today given that we have a terrible tragic war happening.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,520
But look what happened even in Germany.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,720
After months saying there was no money and there was a lot of pressure in government

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,240
having to cut its budget, 100 billion was found overnight for the war effort.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,800
That happens all the time with war because we take it seriously.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,640
What do management consultants do?

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,520
I think it's an important question because this is a global industry worth as much as a trillion

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,520
dollars. And yet if you ask somebody like my dad, he drives a taxi for a living,

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,520
or as a management consultant, he wouldn't have the faintest idea.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,400
Yet they play an increasingly prominent role in the public sector with extraordinarily large

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,360
public contracts, whether it's test and trace or delivering healthcare websites to the United States.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,280
And of course, they're in business too.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,160
A new book by Mariana Matzikato, The Big Con, makes some pretty provocative statements.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,000
It says that actually, consultants don't just undermine democracy,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,160
they lead to less effective government. Mariana Matzikato, welcome to Downstream.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,920
Thank you. I'm very happy to be here.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
How are you doing more generally at the moment?

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,120
Oh god, you really want to know?

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,200
Oh my god, actually fine. I'm thrilled because this week I got to speak a lot with the Prime

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,120
Minister of Barbados, Mia Motley, who I think is the hero of the 21st century.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,800
That's true. She's in the UK at the moment, right?

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,960
Well, actually, so I was just in Barbados. I was in Barbados two weeks ago working with her,

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,680
but she was supposed to be in London this week, but we ended up having her virtually.

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,840
She was at the first event we had for this book, the launch event at the RSA.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,000
She was in dialogue with me about why we need not only financial space,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,560
which is what her big global mission is about, but also the kind of fiscal space and state

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,680
capacity, which our new book kind of looks at why we don't have that. It was a great conversation.

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,520
So your new book, you have many books. They're all very good. I have to say,

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,040
actually, this is one of my favourites, the big con.

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,560
But you're only halfway through, I can tell.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,920
No, no, no. I've made notes. No, no, no. I finished this last night.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,240
And it's going to sound strange how a book about the consulting industry is quite riveting.

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,960
I think pretty people watching this probably won't believe me.

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,720
They think I might be trying to flatter you, but it is because there are so many amazing stories.

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,960
But let's start from the top. So what are consultants and what do they do?

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,680
So first of all, there's different types of consultants. Some are more on the counting side,

38
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,680
some are more on the strategy side. So Deloitte versus McKinsey.

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,480
But there's also other types of consultants, which we talk about in the book,

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,120
even though we don't focus on them, which have been organizations like Circo and G4S,

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,440
where the government has actually decided to outsource a lot of its activities to those

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,320
companies. We kind of treat them differently, but they're all part of the same phenomena of

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,360
basically the decapacitation, if that's a word. I don't know if that sounds more Italian than

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,520
English of government. So what do they do? They consult, they advise.

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,680
But we look at it as an industry. This is a very important point. So there's many different types

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,720
of consultants. You might have a head teacher of a school who might consult. A nurse could

47
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,600
consult. A doctor could consult. Academics, myself, we could consult. But that's based on

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:25,200
our expertise. It's not actually core to our lives. I might consult based on 20 years of research

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,760
in an area. Again, a head teacher might have great knowledge about the schooling system.

50
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,880
We look at a business model of the consulting industry as a sector, which is making lots of

51
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,600
money consulting and where that business model has lots of different problems. It has conflicts of

52
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,720
interest. It has lack of transparency and kind of a veil of secrecy. And especially we look at

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,400
its role in, even though it's not its fault, because we look also at governments and we ask,

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,560
why do you allow yourself to get captured in some ways by consultants? So easily we look at

55
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,360
the co-evolution between consulting and some of modern problems in capitalism today from

56
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,520
financialization to outsourcing. So you said there's a big sector. Some people watching this

57
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,600
will be familiar with the names, McKinsey, Deloitte, et cetera. How big is it? What kind of numbers

58
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:18,320
are we talking about? Close to a trillion per year. Wow. Yeah. And also it's rising. So the

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,040
subtitle here, turn it around so I can remember what our subtitle is. The big con, how the consulting

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,680
industry weakens our businesses and infantilizes our governments and warps our economies. The

61
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,360
infantilizes our governments, but came from a quote by a Tory, so conservative Lord, Lord Agnew,

62
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,720
who during COVID on the back of all the contracts that he was witnessing that the government was

63
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,760
using to bring in consultants, you might remember that Deloitte was charged with the test and trace

64
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:52,880
system, but also with Brexit, lots of money went to consultants. He said, oh my God, we are infantilizing

65
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,280
Whitehall. In other words, if we keep outsourcing the role of government, we will stop learning.

66
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,760
We will actually become like babies who haven't learned yet. We won't be doing,

67
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,680
so we're not learning by doing. And this is actually something I've been talking about for

68
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,880
decades. So it was very, not surprised, but it was very interesting that it was actually coming

69
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,760
from the conservative side of government because it's not necessarily intuitive that that's where

70
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,000
it would have come from. The numbers here are really impressive in terms of the growth. And

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,080
it's something I'm pulling out of the book. This isn't my own personal research. This is so memorable.

72
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,560
It's a fact. When Margaret Thatcher becomes Prime Minister in 1979, the British state is spending

73
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,720
£6 million a year on consultants. When she leaves in 1990, so we're talking 30 years plus,

74
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,880
£246 million. So it's gone up more than 40 times. And it's obviously gone up considerably more than

75
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,680
then. This is hardly shrinking the state, is it? Well, that's what's so interesting. First of all,

76
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,760
you mentioned Thatcher. So that's the bit that might be intuitive. You might think, okay,

77
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,560
a government, a Reaganite government, a Thatcherite government, which is, I don't want to say

78
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,440
anti-state because actually both of them spent a lot on things like war, right? I mean, actually

79
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,920
what Reagan shrunk was the welfare state. My first book, The Entrepreneurial State, I actually looked

80
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:16,000
at state investment in the US also during the Reagan years actually rising around whether it's

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,160
the military industrial complex, but even the National Institutes of Health, which in the

82
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,160
United States spent billions just last year, £42 billion on drug innovation, that happened also

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,960
under Ronald Reagan. So we should also just remember that that's sort of been a propaganda

84
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,240
that they put out, but didn't necessarily believe themselves. There was lots of state

85
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,480
investment in both of those governments. It was actually more a war on the welfare state

86
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,120
and really taking away a lot of the social fabric of society, which we've also seen recently in

87
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,280
the UK with austerity for the last 10 years, all the cuts to very, very concrete areas,

88
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,920
whether it's after school clubs, youth centers, mental health, I'm talking about what I just

89
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:02,560
noticed in my community, let alone the kind of more macroeconomic figures, that's very different

90
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,480
from just saying anti-state, right? Because there was actually lots of investment that

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,320
went elsewhere. Anyway, so what's interesting is if you look at kind of a more conservative,

92
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,800
in quotes, neoliberal government, you might intuitively think they want to reduce state

93
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,760
investment and bring in the private sector, both through privatization, but also consultification

94
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,440
of government. So that figure you just mentioned from £6 to £246 million is part of that. But then

95
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,480
there's two questions. One, the one you just said that cost a lot of money. So in terms of actual

96
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,360
expenditure by the state, it didn't necessarily reduce it, but was that really the point of

97
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,640
Thatcher's government? I would argue no. It was actually to dismantle in some ways the ambition

98
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,040
of the state or the structures of the state. And by bringing in consultants, regardless of how

99
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:54,320
much it costs, and it costs a lot, you are helping to render the state actually in some ways weaker,

100
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,720
at least the structures you might not necessarily care about, you know, health, education, public

101
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,960
transport, again, very different on the military. And yet, one of the things we talk about in the

102
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,560
book is how the real door opened to the consultants actually under new labor. So if you don't really

103
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,760
have a strong idea of what the state is for, you want the state, so it's not the neoliberal idea

104
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,440
of no state, you want the state, but you want it to look efficient and responsible and business

105
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,520
friendly, then ultimately, you bring in business sector metrics into the state apparatus. So

106
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,120
cost-benefit analysis, net present value in the whole idea in economics, which is that at best

107
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,560
the state should fix market failures. So all my work has been saying that that's actually not very

108
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,520
smart. What we actually need for all the problems we have, whether it's climate, health, digital,

109
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,520
is co-creating and co-shaping not just the market, but the economy. Economic growth has not just a

110
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,040
rate, but a direction. The sustainable development goals are 17 of them. That's about directionality,

111
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,240
whether it's about hunger, poverty, climate, the digital divide, health.

112
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,840
Is the UN sustainable development goals?

113
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,440
Yeah, sorry, I always forget that not everyone knows about the SDGs. My kids actually went to

114
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,480
state schools here in London where they sung about the SDGs. Oh, wow, that's progress.

115
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,160
So I think, actually, interestingly, young kids probably know more about the sustainable

116
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,920
development goals than you and me. But yeah, anyway, so the 17 sustainable development goals,

117
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,760
very important, we've had them since 2015, not that long. They require huge ambition,

118
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,520
they require mission, they require collaboration, collective intelligence,

119
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,200
co-investment, so on and so forth. And what my work has been looking at since the entrepreneurial

120
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,480
state is how if we don't have a proper understanding of the state as anything more than fixing

121
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,440
market failures, we will always be too little, too late. We will always be just reacting.

122
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,960
We will at best be filling the gap so that literally even public space will be just the

123
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,920
space that you're allowed to fill up when private space is not there. Think of it even

124
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,040
architecturally in some ways, but really in terms of even public goods and economics,

125
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,360
the word public good sounds good. There's two words, one is good. If you actually look at the

126
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,480
framing of it in economics, it's fixing a market failure problem that occurs when we have positive

127
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,680
externalities. The new labor thing is really interesting for me because obviously they spent

128
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,720
a great deal of money on things like the NHS compared to the Tories, historic amounts of money,

129
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,280
they reduced child poverty, pensioner poverty, so people say, how could you say this? But actually,

130
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,280
when you go into the nuts and bolts of how they did government, so for instance, I find this

131
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,880
fascinating, you talk about this new delivery unit which is created under Tony Blair, which basically

132
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,920
seems to me to be saying tacitly that government should just be done by management consultancy,

133
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,760
or it should be a major part of the state's capacity, and it's not something which is just

134
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,560
bolted on or an afterthought, it's central to how new labor wants to run things.

135
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,840
Yeah, so one of the things I was just talking to Rosie about, she's my co-author, she's actually

136
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,240
one of my PhD students at the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, is that in some

137
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,040
ways you could sum up what you've just said as the fact that new labor had an idea of

138
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,160
private public partnerships, not public private partnerships, right? So a public private partnerships,

139
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,480
I would argue, is what we had with the moon landing. It was a public idea, there was strong

140
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,480
public directionality, but ultimately there was 400,000 people involved, so many different

141
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,920
private sector industries from nutrition, materials, electronics, software, it wasn't just aerospace,

142
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,320
and what government had to do was to redesign all its different tools at the time, especially not

143
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,760
only procurement, so government as purchaser, to catalyze as much bottom-up experimentation

144
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,240
towards that goal, and the goal was getting to the moon and back in a short amount of time.

145
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,240
I would argue that what new labor did was kind of forget, you know, what's the actual mission,

146
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,480
the moonshot around health, around public education, around public transport. If you're

147
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,840
going to bring in the private sector, you better make sure you're very clear what the public goal

148
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,800
is, so you're working together to actually deliver on the moonshot, as opposed to just what we end

149
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,640
up having, which is a lot of private activity in areas that used to be publicly run, and it's not

150
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,040
about saying that's wrong, I think it's actually wrong to say it's about private or nationalization,

151
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,600
kind of in a Corbynite kind of way, I think that's where Corbyn went wrong, it's about

152
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,600
how do you actually organize that partnership, so it's truly about actually doing something

153
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,160
good, purpose-oriented for people. Let's fast forward to Keir Starmer, because this morning

154
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:33,200
he's talked about missions rather than pledges, now a cynic would say well he's exhausted the

155
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,640
rhetoric of pledges, because of course he's broken so many from his leadership election,

156
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,680
but for somebody like yourself, actually no this is substantially different, this means

157
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,560
something quite different, but reading his missions, crime, decarbonization, they seem quite

158
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,520
sort of ambiguous, is the point of a mission that's actually quite specific and measurable?

159
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,720
So I mean I've had the honor to, I don't want to say be responsible, but for having written

160
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,440
about missions and having actually seen it put into policy, so I first wrote about it,

161
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,440
actually for a long time, but when I first wrote about it where it became policy was 2017

162
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,080
for the European Commission, I said look guys, you're just talking all this talk about climate,

163
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,480
about inclusion, it's not getting us any more inclusive or sustainable, they said what would

164
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,240
a mission-oriented approach look like, and I wrote two reports on the back of which the

165
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,400
European Union now has five missions and a large chunk of the horizon program, which was 90 billion

166
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,040
euros, is now targeted through these missions instrument, so what's a mission at least in

167
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,800
my approach, as you begin with the challenge, we talked about the sustainable development goals,

168
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,560
but they're very broad, right, turning them into moonshots, so SDG Sustainable Development Goal

169
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,440
13, you can turn it into something much more clear that you can actually answer yes or no,

170
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,520
did you achieve it, similar to going to the moon and back in a short amount of time, very clear,

171
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,440
you can answer yes or no, so whether it's net zero in a particular region, whether it's getting all

172
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,920
the plastic out of the ocean if we're looking at SDG 14, but the main thing is to frame it,

173
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,360
so it actually requires investment and innovation across multiple sectors of the economy, because

174
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,560
the old industrial strategy in the UK was very similar to what we've seen globally, which is it

175
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,600
was just a list of sectors, so in the UK under Vince Cable, it was aerospace, automobiles,

176
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,760
the financial sector, the creative industry and finance, don't ask me how I remember that because

177
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,920
I don't remember what I did yesterday, anyway, so the idea of a mission-oriented approach

178
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,560
for industrial strategy would be to say why did you just make up those random five sectors,

179
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,520
did they just lobby their way up, why not think of actually challenges like clean growth,

180
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,360
healthy aging, sustainable mobility and so on, and they get all your different sectors to work

181
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,160
together towards particular missions underneath that, and then again change those tools on the

182
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,640
ground to foster that investment towards that, but that requires knowledge, capacity, implementation

183
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,240
ability to actually then change the current status of like procurement, which is just money

184
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,080
being given from the public sector, the private sector, to be outcomes-oriented,

185
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,040
something by the way that many countries rediscovered with COVID, outcomes-oriented procurement,

186
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,680
it's often a wartime tool, which is interesting, right, wars, people want to win wars, so they

187
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,520
take them seriously, if you look at the public-private partnership in a war, when I've learned this in

188
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,840
the US, when the Ministry of Defense, the Department of Defense funds health, sometimes they do,

189
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,400
because soldiers get sick in the war, they don't get messed about by the pharmaceutical industry

190
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,600
because they want to win the war, they want the soldiers to have access

191
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,160
to medicines that the Ministry of Defense funded. When it's the Ministry of Health,

192
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,200
in normal times, somehow we forget that the prices of the drugs should reflect that public

193
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,600
contribution, that the intellectual property rights should not be abused to just become

194
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,800
extraction tools by the sector and so on, so a missions approach has to lead to change,

195
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,120
it should be a source of discomfort, I often tell ministers and policy makers, if you're

196
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,120
getting really cozy with this idea, and it's just kind of a blah, blah, blah, you obviously don't

197
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,840
understand it, because it should actually create change in how you work with the private sector,

198
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,840
you need conditions attached, for example. In France under COVID, the Finance Minister Bruno

199
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,440
Lemaire put strong conditions on Renault and Air France to get access to the COVID-19

200
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,880
bailout program. Why? Because they had a very clear mission around, or challenge, actually around

201
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,000
clean growth, they had to commit to lowering their carbon emissions to get any public money.

202
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,560
In this country, where we're not used to having that conditionality, EZJet got $600 million,

203
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,520
no conditions attached. So Keir Starmer, if he's interested in missions, has to then immediately

204
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,640
talk about a new social contract with business. Let me stick a pin in this, I actually got a

205
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,000
question if you're about China now you've said all that, but these are the missions from Keir Starmer.

206
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,560
Secure the highest sustained growth in the G7, I mean at least that's measurable, right?

207
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,000
But then build an NHS fit for the future, make Britain's streets safe, break down the barriers

208
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,480
to opportunity at every stage, make Britain a clean energy superpower. Those last four just seem

209
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,440
so ambiguous and the line, you can only manage what you measure. How do you measure progress in

210
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,920
any of those things? Or am I being unfair? Are those the kinds of things that you would call

211
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,920
missions? I would call those mission areas. So I think it's actually, well, first of all,

212
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,680
we should congratulate him for actually even having a strategy for basically looking at those

213
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:23,680
areas as ways that we would redirect an economy. Because now we have a problem with growth, but

214
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,480
in general, the problem in the UK was not lack of growth, it was a problematic form of growth.

215
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,880
It's a form of growth that is led by consumption, not investment. That consumption is led by private

216
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,120
debt, not real incomes have not been rising very much in this country. So there's a lot of

217
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,160
credit and private debt in the system to the point that private debt to disposable income

218
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,480
in the UK is close to what it was just before the financial crisis. And that's what caused the

219
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,280
financial crisis. So you'd think people would be like, oh, problems. Very few people are talking

220
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,960
about this. Labor is not talking about it. Neither are the Tories. So the unsustainable level of

221
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,480
private debt, which is interesting if you think about it, because we always talk about public debt.

222
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,880
So it's very important, I think, to have those mission areas as a way to talk about

223
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,680
the need to have investment-led growth, because all those areas are going to require investment.

224
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,880
We've also had financialized growth in this country, where a lot of companies are making

225
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,040
profits, but not necessarily reinvesting those profits into the economy. So anyway,

226
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,640
so as soon as you talk about those bold areas, the question is, what does that then mean for

227
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,240
the design of policy? What does it mean for an industrial strategy? What does it mean for

228
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,200
procurement strategy? And I think the challenge is, so the first one I would say is not even a

229
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,080
mission area. That's just economic growth. And that's going to happen as a result if you get the

230
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,720
other stuff right. If you have an innovation policy and industrial strategy that catalyze and

231
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,440
excite a lot of different actors, that then invest, collaborate, do those moonshots across

232
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,880
different spaces, growth will hopefully result from that, because they all require investment

233
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,160
and innovation, which can lead to productivity increases, for example. But the other ones could

234
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,520
be mission areas. But the question is, what are they? So keeping streets safe. I mean,

235
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,440
this is something that I think is incredibly important, because I've seen how in London,

236
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,120
and I just happen to live in London, on the back of all the austerity that we had in this country,

237
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,200
the social fabric at the community level was really broken. And so the rise in knife crime,

238
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,160
for example. So you could have a mission at the city level, because a lot of these missions might be

239
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,960
talked about nationally, but then they have to resonate with communities, where you might have

240
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,840
citizen assemblies, you might have different types of democratic for also where

241
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,880
people think about those missions. I only say that because I've worked on missions also in Camden,

242
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,720
where I live, and we have the Camden Renewal Commission that I co-chair with Georgia Gould,

243
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,440
and one of our missions that we thought about for Camden actually did have to do with use safety.

244
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,680
And the idea there would be, how do we look at, for example, knife crime, not just from policing,

245
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,640
right? So that's the kind of result. But if knife crime is actually the symptom

246
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,280
of lots of other problems, think of all the social and economic determinants of crime,

247
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,000
where a lot of the both victims, but also the perpetrators often come from broken homes,

248
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,320
homes where there's a lot of problems, how can you really think of that problem in a way that

249
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,600
bring lots of different branches of government together to think holistically with an all-of-

250
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,560
government approach? That's a key factor in a mission-oriented approach. As I just mentioned

251
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,080
before, going to the moon was not just aerospace. Solving climate is surely not just for the department

252
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,040
of energy. Solving issues around well-being is definitely not just for the Department of Health.

253
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,880
So it's not just about intersectoral that I talked about before. It's really that

254
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,960
all-of-government approach. And that really then helps government become more dynamic,

255
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,480
and that comes back to the book, because what we say in the book is that we don't have dynamic

256
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,880
governments. We often have rigid, siloed governments, governments that have stopped

257
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,080
in sourcing the capacity and capability they need to govern modern-day complex challenges with

258
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,200
other actors. And if you have consulted that capacity, if you're asking Deloitte to do your

259
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,800
test and trace, where Deloitte had no expertise whatsoever on test and trace, so it's not surprising

260
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,280
it went belly up, then you have a problem, because you stop learning by doing. You've stopped the

261
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,760
doing. How do they get these jobs? Because like you say, Deloitte had no, I mean nobody had any

262
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,320
expertise in test and trace. Maybe a few countries in East Asia after the SARS epidemic.

263
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:30,080
But so they've got no technical expertise in whole swathes of what they make money from.

264
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,160
So what's their pitch? We've got no experience. Give us a multi-billion-pound contract.

265
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,200
Well, I mean it just, I'm going to answer that question, but just to almost play,

266
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,280
not devil's advocate, but just to put another thing on the table. At the same time that Deloitte

267
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:51,280
did test and trace, which went very badly in the UK, the NHS did the vaccine roll out through a

268
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,480
decentralized network of GP practices, and not only went well, it also became something

269
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,200
we talked about. The politicians talked about it successful. So then the real question is,

270
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,960
why didn't they invest more in this decentralized network of GP practices? Why did we not actually

271
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,400
wake up and say, wow, what a great success story, and let's actually increase the investments

272
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,040
within the NHS instead of doing what we're seeing today, which is that the real investments

273
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,800
are not only not increasing, but there's a lot of stress within the system. We have junior doctors

274
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,480
on strike, nurses on strike all over the UK. So this is also a very interesting question,

275
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,360
because it's the parallel of the question you've asked. Now, what we look at is, why are we hiring?

276
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,240
It's your question. Consultants in areas that they have no expertise in. We saw this also in

277
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,160
Australia, where they spent over six million on McKinsey to do their climate strategy, and it was

278
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,800
then reported to be a very faulty, problematic climate strategy. And the question there that we

279
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,480
posed in the book is, well, there was also expertise within the government. It wasn't

280
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,000
perfect expertise, but they have this organization called CSIRO, which actually has a lot of climate

281
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,840
capabilities. So what is this kind of almost allergy to using not only your internal expertise,

282
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,480
but not to actually invest in that expertise and just need that rubber stamp? Because that's what

283
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,960
ultimately it is, a rubber stamp of McKinsey or Deloitte that makes both governments and businesses,

284
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,680
one of the subtitles is weakens our businesses. Why is that? And we look at two different issues.

285
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:31,120
One is that this dismantling of state capacity has also led to gaps where sometimes literally

286
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,840
even just numbers of people don't exist. I experienced this with the COVID-19 recovery in

287
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,000
Italy, where the Treasury basically outsourced the recovery to, I keep talking about McKinsey,

288
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,920
but there's lots of these consulting companies. It's BCG, Bain, Pricewaterhouse, Cooper's and

289
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,440
so on. BCG's Boston Consulting Group. Yeah, Boston Consulting Group. And so one thing is that as a

290
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,000
consequence of not just the austerity, but the dismantling of state capacity, there often is

291
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,800
the need to bring in others to help you out. But when those others don't have the expertise,

292
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,080
that's the real kind of interesting challenge. Because of course, there's lots of expertise

293
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,760
in universities, for example. And I'm not just saying this because I'm an academic, but I know

294
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,320
some top climate experts around the world, like at the Potsdam Institute in Germany,

295
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,360
they have amazing climate science. That would be a more natural place to go to for climate

296
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,280
expertise. But the rubber stamp of the consulting companies is something that is looked upon as

297
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:30,640
justifying as making good a government that is fearful, especially on the back of so much

298
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,040
kind of government bashing, that somehow there isn't that expertise inside government.

299
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,400
And also sometimes to make uncomfortable decisions. So this is also something that we don't blame

300
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,120
consultants. We say that both with businesses and government, sometimes letting someone else,

301
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,000
not so much take the blame, but have their kind of brand on it, allows you to maybe do some

302
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,880
controversial activities in the private sector. We look, for example, at the downsizing trend,

303
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,920
the financialization trend, by saying, oh, it was recommended by or rubber stamped by a consulting

304
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:10,640
company, it might go down the throat easier. And so in that case, we say government, sorry,

305
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,480
businesses should actually own up to the decisions they're made, as opposed to just

306
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,120
requiring that rubber stamp of the consulting company. But also there's a risk averseness,

307
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,360
there's a fear of making mistakes. And what's interesting, I've talked about this in other

308
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,320
books, that whereas we celebrate risk taking and making mistakes in the private sector,

309
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,960
as soon as a civil servant makes a mistake, bang front page of the Daily Mail, in this country,

310
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,640
there's other, actually, there's not that many tabloids around the world, this country has a

311
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,600
tabloid industry. That's about it, right? Sorry? Built in Germany. Exactly. New York Posts.

312
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,800
Yeah, I mean, there are, but it's just incredible here, just the power they have. We've learned it

313
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:56,320
in the recent Harry and Meghan discussions. But it's not just the tabloids, it's public

314
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,080
servants, civil servants are not allowed to make mistakes, which is a problem. This is something

315
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,440
we talk about. Trial and error and error, you would not learn how to ride a bike if you did not

316
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,480
fall off. So the fact that governments, part of the consequence of outsourcing, privatizing,

317
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,880
of consultifying is, in fact, what Lord Agnew, the conservative Lord who made this accusation,

318
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,080
you know, that Whitehall was getting infantilized. Infantilized means you're kind of becoming a

319
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,160
baby, you're not learning, you're not growing up, you're still an infant. And this was a Tory Lord

320
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:38,160
saying Whitehall was being infantilized. And so, you know, this is one of the biggest problems that

321
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,880
even though you might be doing it out of fear, because you'd prefer someone else to be taking

322
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,360
the risk so you don't get blamed when things go wrong, you ultimately will get addicted.

323
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,960
You will require that help constantly, right? Because you're not growing up,

324
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,520
you're not building that capacity. And this is one of the things we talk about. We say that,

325
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,520
you know, the reason, the sector, because it's the consulting industry that we

326
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,720
kind of focus on, not just consultants, it's problematic is that the business model itself

327
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,880
kind of relies on that next contract following. Whereas if you're a really good therapist,

328
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,000
for example, you don't want your client to be in therapy their whole life, that probably means

329
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,080
you're a bad therapist. The principal agent problem. Exactly. Exactly. Could you explain

330
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,160
this quickly, the principal agent problem? Well, it's just about incentives. I mean,

331
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,600
if, you know, I mean, the principal agent problem can be applied to different types of

332
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,080
problems. But in this case, it's that if there is, we would call it asymmetric information in

333
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,160
terms of a market failure, then the agent that you are, if you want, you know, consulting for

334
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,040
doesn't necessarily have knowledge about, you know, the contract in this case. And in fact,

335
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,720
this is one of the things we talk about, which is that there is a veil of secrecy and lack of

336
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,240
transparency in the contract. So in South Africa, for example, you might have, what we have had,

337
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,600
consultants who the same consultant is advising SCOM, which is a state-owned energy company.

338
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,360
And it's also advising the Ministry of Finance, which in theory is regulating

339
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,640
SCOM, right? So you can't be on both sides of the street. And if you are, that better be very

340
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,600
transparent and known to the government. And so one of the, you know, this kind of conflict of

341
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:19,440
interest. Was that legal? Well, that's what's really striking, actually, that it's legal.

342
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,720
And we talk about all the different consultants who are both advising the fossil fuel industry,

343
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,920
while at the same time advising on ESG metrics, right? As though it's all fine and the same.

344
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,800
Of course, it's not. You can't be helping and actually in some ways fostering a fossil fuel

345
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,560
industry to be increasingly successful in making record-level profits today, while, you know,

346
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,040
on the other side of the street pretending that you're an expert around environmental and social

347
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,320
governance metrics, which is all about companies actually becoming greener or societal, you know,

348
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,120
more good for society. There's lots of amazing stories in the book. And like I said at the

349
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,680
top, that's why it's really riveting these case studies of failure. But one of the more dazzling

350
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:07,120
ones is the story of healthcare.gov, of course tied up with ObamaCare. Can you tell us a little

351
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,640
bit about healthcare.gov, why it failed, and what that has to do with consultants?

352
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,880
Sure. I mean, it's actually part of a much bigger problem because one of the capabilities we say

353
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,360
that has been decimated within governments is actually their ability to govern digital platforms.

354
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,400
And one of the areas by consequence that is increasingly consultified, so consultants are

355
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,600
being brought into, has to do with precisely that area, the kind of, let's just call it,

356
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:41,840
the digital area of government. Now, this is not a small problem in 21st century, 22nd century

357
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,200
soon. Capitalism, if you don't know how to govern digital platforms, you won't be able to have a

358
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,240
climate strategy, a health strategy. Think of the infodemic side of COVID-19. In fact, I did a

359
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,800
report on which countries globally did better in COVID-19. It actually was countries that actually

360
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,920
had invested in areas including digital platforms because of that very important information,

361
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,320
processing side of things, including by the way, Test and Trace, which we touched on before.

362
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,400
So healthcare.gov, of course, is famous because the U.S. government, as we know, doesn't really

363
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,520
have a public health program. A lot of people in the U.S. die actually not because they're sick,

364
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,080
but because they can't afford healthcare. This is one of the reasons I'm very proud to live in

365
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:29,200
Europe. The NHS in the U.K. is very important in terms of giving everyone access to healthcare.

366
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:37,360
Now, the problem is that what was also called Obamacare, so Obama finally gets through a program

367
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,520
which, by the way, Hillary Clinton had tried to get through when her husband was president,

368
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:53,760
it had a web site where people could access in order to sign up for healthcare in the U.S. from

369
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,440
the Obamacare program, and as soon as it opened up, it basically crashed and government was blamed,

370
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,920
but actually it wasn't government that had governed it, it had been outsourced, it had been

371
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,720
outsourced to private actors, and this is a huge problem, first of all, because it's central,

372
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,680
like how you actually govern the digital side of a program, whether it's health or climate,

373
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,760
so if you are outsourcing your core, that's a problem. If you're outsourcing something that's

374
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:34,640
peripheral, perhaps it doesn't matter, catering or something. This is actually not just around

375
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,560
health, as I just mentioned. If you look at the weakening of government, it's precisely around

376
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,320
those kind of areas, and so unless they're investing in their own digital capacity,

377
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,280
they won't be stronger and they will become increasingly needing to have others to come

378
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,520
in, but in that particular case, also, those that had been brought in to do the digital side

379
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:59,680
weren't very capable. It costs $1.7 billion. $1.7 billion for a website is just extraordinary,

380
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,960
and on the first day of opening, six people could use it. People, like you say, blamed the state,

381
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,520
but they should have been blaming management consultancies.

382
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,200
Yeah, I mean, that's again the irony, because I just mentioned before that part of the answer to why

383
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,360
governments are allowing consultants to have so much power is the risk, the kind of worry

384
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,720
of getting things wrong and thinking that somehow management consultant will not only bring in maybe

385
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,200
some expertise, which as I just mentioned often, we don't have, but also get the blame if things

386
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,200
go wrong, and yet things continue to go wrong and they're not actually held accountable.

387
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,360
So even how those contracts are designed, they've actually kind of become almost risk-free for the

388
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,400
consultants, and so it's not only costing government a lot of money. In theory, they're

389
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:52,480
sometimes pitching it as though it's going to help them cost less, so reduce deficits by letting

390
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,000
others undertake public programs. So we have kind of three different problems. It's costing a lot

391
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
of money. It's actually not delivering, and when things go belly up, the blame comes back to

392
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,960
government. So it's actually a toxic cocktail, and you'd think that it would be better known how

393
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,280
problematic this is. And I think one of the things we were kind of pleasantly surprised,

394
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,120
but not so surprised, is just how much the book has spoken to people both in the business community

395
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,520
and government communities at different level, city, local, regional, national, global, precisely

396
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:31,520
because it's almost scandalous at every level. I must say though that we're not there to blame

397
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,320
consultants. In fact, we spoke to many different consultants, especially young kind of 30-year-old

398
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,000
consultants who go into the industry also wanting to do good. This isn't a book about the bad guys

399
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,720
trying to do terrible things around the world, and they are disillusioned when you see that kind

400
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,720
of operating on both sides of the street or the not hypocrisy, but that kind of treating any of

401
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,160
the latest trends, whether it's ESG and climate or shareholder value maximization on kind of the

402
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,200
other extreme in terms of problematic tendencies and modern-day corporate governance is almost

403
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,800
equally available places to kind of leech onto to provide your consulting services,

404
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,040
you start to lose faith that this is actually really about making the world a better place.

405
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:24,400
We do make some specific recommendations at the end because it's not enough just to complain and

406
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,000
to kind of denounce, and we talk about the need to make contracts much more transparent, precisely

407
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,160
on all the different types of areas that you're consulting in so you can see those conflicts of

408
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,280
interest, making contracts so they actually embed learning precisely so you don't have those kind

409
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,080
of repeat contracts so that you actually show that you're cumulatively adding value so the

410
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,760
organization in question ultimately shouldn't need you. That example I gave from therapy before,

411
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,120
if you have someone in therapy their entire life, you're probably not doing your job very well,

412
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,920
and I think if you look at all the different problems we have globally, they do require

413
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,240
lots of different actors where the consultants might have a role, but first of all we need to

414
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,480
make sure they actually have expertise in that area so we should definitely become much more aware

415
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:14,080
where those areas of expertise lie, but also how do we make sure the ecosystem between these

416
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,000
different actors is truly kind of a symbiotic mutualistic one and not a parasitic one?

417
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,960
Consultancy is one of those things where I mean I I'd obviously heard of it before I graduated,

418
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,520
I'll start that again. Consultancy is a strange one because I'd heard of the term before I

419
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,040
graduated, I graduated in 2007, bad luck, so it was a really interesting year because at the

420
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,960
start of the year as an undergraduate everybody you know all you could hear at University College

421
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,840
London where you teach, McKinsey, Deloitte, Macquarie, HSBC, Banco Santander, everybody had an internship

422
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,320
with a bank or a consultancy and then within a year it dropped like a lead balloon so it was

423
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,560
really fascinating to see that, but if I said to my dad as a graduate, oh I've got a job as a

424
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,760
consultant, he would say what the hell is that? What do you do? I mean he thinks that anyway

425
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,120
actually with Navarra Media, but it's one of those things where I had a pet theory which is

426
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,520
particularly in Anglo-America since the late 1990s we have a massive overproduction of very clever

427
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,320
generalist graduate students, humanities in particular but also you know in the sciences

428
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,600
and they don't really know what they're going to do, they're sort of aimless, very ambitious,

429
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,520
very conscientious people and it seems to me lots of those people gravitated towards

430
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,560
consultancy as a job and it almost seems to me and obviously I don't think you've written that

431
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,080
in the book, it almost strikes me as a shame because having this concentration of people that

432
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,440
want to do problem solving, highly competent, it seems like a massive misallocation of human

433
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,760
resources basically. But we do talk about that in the book, we say wouldn't it be great if all this

434
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,720
desire to do good in the world actually also resulted in more of these young

435
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,880
people going into government and we also talk about this self-fulfilling prophecy that the

436
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,840
more we've had this kind of backlash against government, what Tony Jutt in his book, Ill

437
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:07,040
Ferris the Land, calls a discursive battle like literally just talking about administration instead

438
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,520
of kind of like a ministry out there trying to do really difficult things or what I've talked about

439
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,480
market fixing, not market shaping, de-risking, not taking risks, simply enabling, redistributing

440
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,560
and regulating instead of being a true value creator. It's not actually a coincidence that it

441
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,360
becomes much more sexy to go into the McKinsey's, the Macquarie's even though I have a whole

442
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,240
theory about Macquarie anyway, but the Goldman Sachs isn't the Googles, right? So there is that

443
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,080
self-fulfilling prophecy and it's not a surprise I've actually taken the time to set up a whole

444
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,720
institute for innovation and public purpose at UCL which is all about rethinking the state,

445
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:47,200
bringing purpose to the center of policy making, but also really having a theory of value creation

446
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,280
with the state at the center, not to say the state is more important than any other actor,

447
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,680
but it's very, it's important in terms of leading at least in democratically elected

448
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,160
societies and then using all the tools that has to bring together that kind of stakeholder value,

449
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,360
lots of different actors to solve really complex problems, drive collective intelligence,

450
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,200
the sexy word, but that needs to be embedded in the contracts. You can't have collective

451
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,360
intelligence if again intellectual property rights are abused. They're currently too wide,

452
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:19,440
too strong, too upstream and yet an intellectual property right is a contract that for 17 years,

453
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,240
the state has given to the private sector. So you need to govern that in the public interest

454
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,600
and the capacity to do so I think has withered away to govern those particular contracts,

455
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,160
but any contract whether it's a procurement contract or an intellectual property right

456
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,400
should have the public interest at the center because that's the point of government. It's not

457
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,480
just to help companies make profits. Do you think there's been a cultural shift as well,

458
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,960
which is the fault here? So I'm a materialist, you have a materialist explanation for all this

459
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,360
happening, but as an ancillary point, if you're an ambitious young person in the 50s, 60s and you

460
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,960
want to change the world, you'd go work for a big government ministry and you would say,

461
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:04,240
I want to go work for the department of X or I want to go work for NASA. And after the 60s,

462
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,040
there's this idea that actually particularly progressives thought, oh, if you want to change

463
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,760
the world, you need to be like Jane Jacobs or you need to be like Ralph Nader. You need to be on the

464
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,560
outside, right? You need to be lobbying. You need to be lobbying and you need to be this active

465
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,960
interest representation, but not institutional power. Do you think there was a kind of

466
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,920
a big social error? Actually, all of a sudden, tons of talented people stopped going into

467
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,520
precisely institutions when we need them to be? I don't know. I mean, first of all,

468
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,280
I don't want to exaggerate the point about the people who are working in government. I mean,

469
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,360
I work with governments globally, including in the UK, and it's full of incredibly,

470
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,440
not only smart, but people really with ethics at the center, they go into government because

471
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,600
they're interested in, you know, to put it simply, making the world a better place.

472
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:55,520
I think what's happened though is that there's so much backlash on government. There's such a

473
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,440
cartoon image, you know, I talk about this in the entrepreneurial state, like the kind of

474
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,280
Kafkaian bureaucrat and then the cool, you know, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk today, that actually,

475
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,360
what we've seen is also a hemorrhaging of that talent. I mean, so in other words, it's been a

476
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:16,960
much more explicit, intentional problem than sort of what you just described. Also, in the 1960s,

477
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,040
I learned this when I was running Mission Economy, the average age in the mission control room for

478
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:28,160
Apollo was 26. So crazy. Very, very young, average age. There was younger people. And yet,

479
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,400
at that time already, a lot of this outsourcing was happening to the consultants, literally,

480
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,360
actually to McKinsey. In that particular case, McKinsey began in the mid-20s. And the head of

481
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,800
procurement for NASA, this guy, Ernest Brackett, said, if we continue this, we won't even, you know,

482
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,400
not only won't we know how to get to the moon, but we won't even know how to write

483
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,920
the contracts with the private sector because they were working with lots of private sector

484
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,560
companies. And his quote was, we will get captured by brochuremanship. It's endearing because they

485
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,480
didn't really have PowerPoints at the time that these consultants have today. They had

486
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,400
sexy brochures. So the idea that you would get captured by the brochure was not to say, oh,

487
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,440
we don't want to work at the private sector. It was more like, we won't know which private

488
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,400
sector companies to work with. And I would actually argue that's what we have today.

489
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:20,000
We have, definitely, if you look at the contracts, we have a very unbalanced power in terms of even

490
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,040
the legal expertise. But the problem is not that there's not enough public or private investment,

491
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,000
is that partnership is not, it's not a dynamic one. It's not purpose-oriented. It's not fair.

492
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,200
It's not just. There's often, again, socialization of risk, privatization of rewards. And you can

493
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,880
fix that in the contracts. NASA actually had a clause in its contracts, no excess profits.

494
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,200
It's great. Not no profits. You don't get to the moon with philanthropy, charity. Of course,

495
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,400
you can make profits, but not excess. In excess of what? Of what you've done. So as soon as you

496
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,280
have a whole kind of narrative and discourse that all the value is getting created in the private

497
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,640
sector and the state is just there to facilitate, enable, work on the sides, then it's much easier

498
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,440
to get these very problematic contracts that socialize risks and privatize rewards and allow

499
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,920
excess profits to be earned by some who are doing good stuff, but not everything.

500
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,680
So somebody watching this from the left might think, oh, this is just social democracy, very

501
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,480
vanilla. I actually think you understate your radicalism. I think it's very radical.

502
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,440
Well, no, because that's why people don't like this, by the way. I got a lot of hate.

503
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,840
The whole thing about not private-public partnership, but public-private partnership,

504
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,880
and you might not agree with this, I think in some ways is reminiscent of the better

505
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,680
features of the Chinese system, because there was a great talk by Eric X. Lee, who talks about

506
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,240
the Chinese Communist Party. And he made a point on a separate interview, and he said,

507
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,760
China has a market economy. We have private firms that try and make profit. He says the

508
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,560
point is the interest of those firms, the interest of capital more generally to make profits,

509
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,120
does not supersede political authority. Political authority always supersede, and obviously that

510
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,760
has bad expressions of manifestations. But the point is political authority always supersedes

511
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,200
the private interests of businesses or capital. And that's basically what you're saying, isn't

512
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,400
it? This idea that political authority, democratically accountable.

513
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,200
Yeah, because it's a democratically accountable thing in terms of not being a China fan.

514
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,320
But the same theme is there, right? That political authority, with that accountability

515
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,280
from people and the mandate from people, sets the agenda around, like you say, particular missions.

516
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,520
And that supersedes the interest of capital. That's hugely radical, isn't it?

517
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,120
So I once gave an interview, actually. I can't remember. I think it was to the Financial Times

518
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,880
where I said that China is learning from the United States at the same time that the United

519
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,480
States is unlearning from itself. So again, everything that's smart in our smartphones

520
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,080
and not stupid was actually invested in by government, mission-oriented government,

521
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,880
the internet, GPS, touchscreen, and Siri, all fruits of government investments.

522
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,800
In some cases with private sector collaboration, but it was actually through a public sector

523
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,520
problem that was required. So the internet came about because we needed the satellites to communicate,

524
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,560
GPS, the Navy invested in it to know where all the ships were in the seas. So it's not actually,

525
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,600
I mean, today it feels more like maybe a Chinese or kind of a top-down planning system. But that's

526
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:21,280
actually how the United States developed. They talk Jefferson, but act Hamilton. People should

527
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,080
only understand that because now the Hamilton musical. But basically, Hamilton was a very

528
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,800
important US politician who at the time advocated for an industrial strategy whereas Jefferson was

529
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,320
more free marketeer. The US has always talked the talk of the free market, but acted actually on a

530
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:43,440
much more visible hand, not the invisible hand. Where I think, so the work on missions coming back

531
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,360
to here is a speech this morning is all about that. In other words, or it should be about that.

532
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,840
I mean, he's using the word. I'm very curious to know and perhaps work with them on actually

533
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:00,720
making this real, the how. The how is harder than just the word. It's all about actually having a

534
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,040
plan that's really difficult. Remember Kennedy said, we're going to the moon because it's hard,

535
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,920
not because it's easy. So this isn't about one side facilitating. I'm Italian, facilitating

536
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,320
means making something easier for someone else, like the word de-risking. So it's not about making

537
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,960
it easier de-risking someone else. It's about tackling those really difficult challenges

538
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,960
together. Now that requires a goal. That's going to be the end goal, but the how along the way

539
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,600
really matters. How you design the financial institution with conditionality. You're not just

540
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,080
giving out money. It's conditional on change happening within different sectors. You don't do

541
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,000
it top down and tell them what to do because that could hurt innovation, but you do it with a strong

542
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,800
direction. That's that public-private versus private-public bit that we talked about before.

543
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,040
It means learning how to do, again, outcomes-oriented budgeting. So you're not just giving a bit of

544
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,280
money here and there, but you actually have a goal where the budget itself, even at the city

545
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,440
level, zero knife crime requires its own budget. You can't just give a bit of money here, a bit of

546
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:02,320
money there, and then stir the soup and hope for the best. So I think what's interesting in China,

547
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,120
though, is that they obviously have very clear targets. They had such high poverty that they

548
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:12,000
really alleviated a lot of people out of poverty. They also are spending a huge amount on greening

549
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,720
their entire manufacturing base because they have a huge pollution problem. So they don't

550
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,040
have that myth of, oh, this is just going to happen through the free market. One of their

551
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,640
problems, though, is they don't really have what I talk about in the entrepreneurial state,

552
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,200
a decentralized network of different types of public actors. They have very large, for example,

553
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,400
the Chinese Development Bank, which gave huge amounts of money to Huawei. Huawei would not exist

554
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,680
without a guaranteed loan that was over $5 billion from the Chinese Development Bank.

555
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:44,880
By the way, Elon Musk got over $5 billion from the US government for his different companies,

556
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,120
including in the early stage of Tesla. It was a guaranteed loan from government.

557
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,640
But in China, you have just these big chunks of money from institutions like the Chinese

558
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,440
Development Bank. In the US, they had DARPA, the National Science Foundation, the Small

559
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,080
Business Innovation Research Program, the Venture Capital Arm of the CIA, Incutel. But it has,

560
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,760
at least in the US, been more around their military industrial complex. And what I've been arguing

561
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,240
for is, why do we only take things seriously when it's about war? And this is an important

562
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,320
question today, given that we have a terrible tragic war happening. But look what happened

563
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,720
even in Germany. After months saying there was no money and there was a lot of pressure in government

564
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,800
having to cut its budget, $100 billion was found overnight for the war effort. That happens all

565
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,960
the time with war, because we take it seriously. And I'm very anti-war, at any war, but isn't it

566
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,720
interesting that for war money comes out of the woodwork? Why doesn't it come out of the woodwork

567
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,280
when we have war on poverty, when we want to strengthen our health systems, when we want net

568
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,880
zero targets, when we have these social problems in our streets? So really, what I've been talking

569
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,760
about for a long time is the need to create a mission-oriented economy around our social

570
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,480
challenges, starting with the SDGs that we talked about. And with this book, the big con

571
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,160
talks about is that that requires capacity. And if we continue to consultify that capacity,

572
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,040
you won't know how to implement. You won't know how to work with others. And that's important,

573
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,760
because I sometimes get accused as being just kind of folklorically loving the state. I'm like,

574
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,840
no, I'm the state's kind of, I don't want to say biggest enemy, but biggest provocateur saying,

575
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:26,800
what are you doing? You can't become agile, flexible, capable, and creative unless you

576
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,640
actually invest internally in becoming a learning organization.

577
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,240
You said you have haters.

578
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,000
Well, who are they?

579
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,560
Oh, God. I find them very hard to believe.

580
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:43,360
If you're a woman, if you are progressive, if you're lucky enough to actually get media attention,

581
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:50,240
but especially, this is the big bit, have impact. So different governments or even businesses

582
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,840
start to implement some of your ideas. Are you dangerous? If you're just ranting and no one's

583
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,360
listening, you're less dangerous. So I think when your ideas start to have impact, and I feel very

584
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,680
honored because I'm not the only one who has some good ideas, I feel honored that I've had the

585
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,000
opportunity to work with governments carefully, because it's not just about going to lecture,

586
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,640
doing a TED Talk, and then leaving. Again, that's why I set up a whole institute to take care,

587
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,760
have teams that help governments implement new policies, but also train, because that's the

588
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,120
main thing we do. We have an educational program. You are much more dangerous to those who

589
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,040
would love to see the state less able, less, not so much large, because I've never been about large

590
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:38,480
versus small state, but a more capable state, a state that is truly purpose-oriented,

591
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,800
a state that knows how to get a good deal in a contract is not great news for those who are

592
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,400
making either a lot of money or having a lot of power by having a weak state.

593
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,320
So do you think that some of the people you take target on this book, and I know you've said

594
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,680
already, many good consultants, and you can see the role for certain services not being

595
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,880
within a firm or inside a public agency, Navarra Media has an accountant. We don't have an accountant

596
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,600
inside the organization. That's something that somebody else does, for instance.

597
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,480
Is accounting your core business?

598
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,400
Precisely, right. That's exactly why I would.

599
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,360
Yeah, exactly.

600
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,400
Is governing a digital platform, a core business of a government in order to make sure that the

601
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,400
next pandemic, it can actually deal with the infodemic side of the crisis, of course.

602
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:24,880
This is a trillion-dollar industry, though. So, like you say, you putting this in the

603
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,760
crosshairs, and you are an influential person, that must put a mark on your back a little bit

604
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,600
with some of these people. I mean, I've read the write-up in the Financial Times, for instance,

605
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,440
perfectly civilized and polite, but there was clearly an undercurrent, which is,

606
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,280
don't make too much noise about this industry.

607
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,360
Oh, really? I haven't read that. Have you not read it?

608
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,760
Have they made threats? They're going to come and knock on the door?

609
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,760
Not threats. Not threats, but there's huge vested interest, basically.

610
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,400
Of course.

611
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:48,960
Oh, no, of course.

612
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,760
Not having this conversation.

613
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,000
Yeah, I thought that was actually quite funny, to be honest. I mean,

614
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,880
the comments that were so defensive, and then all you had to read was the comments that came

615
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,480
afterwards by others. I mean, I almost didn't have to reply. I think the fact that we purposefully,

616
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,560
we say this several times in the book, that this is just as much a challenge to those that are

617
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:14,720
hiring and that have stopped investing within their own capacity as it is to those that are

618
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,040
making a lot of money by profiting from those that don't have that capacity.

619
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,320
It's really a wake-up call to everyone, because I truly believe that in the long run,

620
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,520
we all will benefit. The planet will benefit, the sustainability of the planet,

621
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,680
but also all these problems we have around inequality will benefit if we actually have

622
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,440
more capable actors all around.

623
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,200
Mariana, thank you so much for joining us this evening.

624
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:37,600
Thank you.

625
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,520
It's a great book.

626
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,000
Thanks so much.

627
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,640
Congratulations.

628
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,640
Thank you.
