00:00.000 --> 00:10.360
Αν δεν έχεις ένα καμπέτειο στο Google, ένα καμπέτειο στο Uber, ένα καμπέτειο στο Facebook, ένα καμπέτειο στο Apple, ένα καμπέτειο στο Amazon.com,

00:10.360 --> 00:19.180
αν κάθε γερμανό ή οικογένειο ή οικογένειο ή οικογένειο πρότειο πρότειο πρέπει να πρέπει να πω σε αυτά τα κλαδελίσια για να βγω τα πράγματα,

00:19.260 --> 00:20.580
όχι στην Ευρώπη.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.860
Και, you know, Amazon,

00:23.380 --> 00:26.840
κάνει 42 μιλίες κάθε χρόνια, μόνο στην Ευρώπη,

00:26.840 --> 00:30.120
και παίρνει 0, 0 τάξι, 0.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.280
Μετά, είσαι έλεγε, είσαι τελειών.

00:37.720 --> 00:44.520
Με όλο το χρόνο, οι κοινότητες πιστεύουν ότι ο καπτλισμός θα τελειώσει και θα θα εξεχθεί από κάτι άλλο, κάτι καλύτερο.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.760
Αλλά τι αν έγινε και ήταν εξεχθεί από κάτι πιστήχο, πιστήχο, πιστήχο.

00:50.520 --> 00:55.780
Τι αν είμαστε πρότειο για το καπτλισμό, αλλά αυτό δεν δημιουργεί την εξογένειο,

00:55.780 --> 00:59.560
την οικονομία, αλλά, πραγματικά, είναι πολύ μεγάλη ενακόλυση.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.760
Αυτό είναι το υποθοσίο της σχέσης στις εξογένειες.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.340
Ήθελε ότι είμαστε πρότειο για έναν κόσμο του φιουδολισμού,

01:06.840 --> 01:10.460
όπου η επόμενη, σαν πιο, σαν την παράδειγμα,

01:10.460 --> 01:12.960
αλλά με δίσκολα χρόνια.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.660
Γιάννας Φαράφακκας, καθώς ήρθατε στο καπτλισμό.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.920
Είναι πολύ καλό να είμαι πρότειο, ευχαριστούμε για την εξογένειο, είναι καλό να μιλήσω με εγώ.

01:19.920 --> 01:22.520
Βέβαια, είπες ότι είναι καλό να είμαι πρότειο.

01:22.520 --> 01:25.800
Είμαστε πρότειο για το 2015, πιστήχο.

01:26.300 --> 01:30.060
Είσαι νιώθος τώρα, Γιάννας, όταν έγινε, έγινε 8 χρόνια, πώς έγινε.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.780
Βέβαια, δεν είναι τifen, princess visiting,

01:33.780 --> 01:36.820
για μια σύγχρομη και χορία λιγοφουνία χρόνια σου.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.780
Αν είναι ότι είναι φίλοςuvo, είναι π από του φυγουλίου.

01:40.080 --> 01:40.800
Από του φυγουλίου.

01:41.180 --> 01:42.800
Maybe there's some advanced technology, you're not...

01:44.800 --> 01:46.680
Very worn around the edges.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.780
Became a very difficult year, very difficult year.

01:49.780 --> 01:52.340
Will get on to that, particularly in regards to the politics of Greece,

01:52.340 --> 01:53.980
but I think you mean more widely.

01:54.140 --> 01:58.340
We're talking about your new book, which of course, is relevant,

01:58.340 --> 02:00.140
Τεχνοφιουλισμό, το καπτολισμό.

02:02.140 --> 02:03.540
Νομίζω, για εμένα,

02:03.940 --> 02:06.540
στους τελευταίους που αντιμετωπίσεις το υποθοσύθο,

02:06.540 --> 02:07.540
σε έναν μόνο,

02:08.140 --> 02:09.940
τι αν έχουμε φτύξει το υποθοσύθο,

02:10.340 --> 02:11.540
αλλά δεν είναι σωστολοσύθο.

02:12.740 --> 02:14.540
Έτσι, μπορείτε να μεταξύσουμε αυτό λίγο,

02:14.540 --> 02:16.540
επειδή, νομίζω, πιστεύουμε πιστεύουμε πιστεύουμε,

02:16.540 --> 02:19.340
ότι είμαστε σε ένας υποθοσύθος,

02:19.740 --> 02:22.140
δικαίου, δυγένουρος τρόπος του υποθοσύθο,

02:22.140 --> 02:24.540
but your hypothesis is something a little bit different.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.940
Oh, it's very different, it's profoundly different.

02:27.540 --> 02:30.540
But let me remind you that

02:31.340 --> 02:34.740
I'm not the first to hypothesize

02:35.140 --> 02:38.540
that if socialism as a project fails,

02:38.940 --> 02:40.540
we will end up with barbarism.

02:40.540 --> 02:41.940
Remember Rosa Luxemburg,

02:42.140 --> 02:44.740
the famous question from her prison cell?

02:45.140 --> 02:46.540
Socialism or barbarism?

02:46.540 --> 02:48.340
It turns out that it is barbarism.

02:48.540 --> 02:51.340
And of course, it's very technologically advanced.

02:51.940 --> 02:55.140
It is based on huge quantities of capital.

02:55.140 --> 02:56.740
So capital has triumphed

02:57.740 --> 03:00.740
and that answers the second part of your question.

03:00.740 --> 03:02.340
Of course, wherever you look,

03:02.940 --> 03:06.740
you come face to face with the triumph of capital,

03:07.340 --> 03:11.340
with the triumph of those who own capital, capitalists.

03:11.940 --> 03:13.540
But what I'm saying here is that

03:14.940 --> 03:17.140
in the end, it wasn't the left,

03:17.740 --> 03:21.940
the organized labor movement

03:22.340 --> 03:25.140
that appended capitalism.

03:25.340 --> 03:28.340
We used to think and hope that it would be labor

03:28.540 --> 03:31.540
that is the comeuppance of capitalism.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.940
With capitalism, remember what Marx said in Engels,

03:34.140 --> 03:37.340
capitalism creates its grave diggers, the proletariat.

03:37.740 --> 03:40.340
The organized laborers who will rise up

03:40.540 --> 03:43.740
and take possession of the means of production of capital

03:43.940 --> 03:47.340
and put it to good use for society as a whole.

03:47.340 --> 03:50.940
It didn't happen, as you know, as we all know, unfortunately.

03:51.340 --> 03:54.740
But what happened was another construct,

03:54.740 --> 03:58.740
another product of capitalism did that job

03:58.740 --> 04:02.940
and that other product was capital itself.

04:02.940 --> 04:04.540
So my hypothesis is that this

04:06.940 --> 04:11.940
is that capital was so successful, like a very toxic virus,

04:12.540 --> 04:16.540
which kills off its host and therefore it cannot propagate itself,

04:16.540 --> 04:19.540
like Ebola, which is a stupid virus unlike COVID-19.

04:19.540 --> 04:21.540
COVID-19 killed very few people

04:22.340 --> 04:24.340
as a percentage of those who were infected

04:24.340 --> 04:26.540
and therefore it spread and became a pandemic.

04:26.540 --> 04:29.540
Ebola never left particular villages in Africa

04:29.540 --> 04:31.740
because it killed all of them before it could spread.

04:32.540 --> 04:36.340
Capital developed a mutation of itself,

04:36.540 --> 04:39.340
which are called cloud capital, a particular form of capital,

04:39.740 --> 04:41.540
which has killed off capitalism its host.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.740
That's my hypothesis.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.140
I know it's extremely controversial.

04:45.140 --> 04:47.140
Most of the people on the left do not like it at all

04:47.140 --> 04:47.940
for two reasons.

04:47.940 --> 04:50.340
Firstly, because they think, hang on,

04:51.340 --> 04:53.140
it's all capitalism, it's not socialism.

04:53.140 --> 04:54.140
How can that be?

04:54.940 --> 04:57.340
And the answer is also Luxembourg, it's barbarism.

04:57.740 --> 05:01.940
And the second reason is because our task as socialists

05:01.940 --> 05:05.140
is now, if I'm right, it's immensely harder.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.940
Because my point now is that you don't just have exploitation

05:08.940 --> 05:14.540
in the enterprise, at the level of the firm,

05:14.540 --> 05:16.940
on the factory or the shop floor.

05:17.340 --> 05:19.540
That continues, of course.

05:19.540 --> 05:22.740
It's the main spring of surplus value.

05:22.740 --> 05:25.140
It's the only spring of surplus value to this day.

05:25.140 --> 05:27.140
That has not changed from capitalism.

05:27.140 --> 05:29.540
But what has happened is, if you're Jeff Bezos,

05:30.140 --> 05:33.340
if you are the owner of Google, of Apple,

05:33.340 --> 05:35.340
if you're Elon Musk,

05:35.540 --> 05:39.340
then you own this new form of cloud capital,

05:39.540 --> 05:44.540
which allows you to extract from the rest of society

05:44.740 --> 05:48.140
from proletarians, but from everyone else as well,

05:49.940 --> 05:52.340
huge quantities of rents and surpluses,

05:52.940 --> 05:57.340
in a manner that reconstitutes a form of feudalism.

05:57.540 --> 06:01.540
The difference is that instead of the original feudalism,

06:01.540 --> 06:05.740
which is a system based on private ownership of land,

06:05.740 --> 06:09.740
which produces rent, now it's private ownership of the cloud,

06:09.740 --> 06:11.740
of cloud capital, because the cloud is capital, right?

06:11.740 --> 06:13.740
It's not some cloud up in the sky,

06:14.140 --> 06:16.340
which yields again a form of rent.

06:16.340 --> 06:18.340
Every time you buy something from amazon.com,

06:18.740 --> 06:20.340
40% of what you pay

06:20.740 --> 06:23.740
doesn't go to the capitalist who is selling you that stuff.

06:23.740 --> 06:24.740
It goes to Jeff Bezos.

06:24.740 --> 06:28.340
That's a cloud rent and he is a new form of feudal lord.

06:29.340 --> 06:33.740
I think most people would accept this is a big new part of the global economy in the last 20 years,

06:34.540 --> 06:36.540
where somebody might disagree with you as they would say,

06:36.540 --> 06:38.540
well, Janice, this is ideological.

06:38.740 --> 06:41.140
You're presuming that this is quite important, you know,

06:41.140 --> 06:43.740
and highly discussed part of the economy, you know,

06:43.740 --> 06:45.540
the richest person in the world, Elon Musk,

06:45.740 --> 06:48.140
the world's largest companies or big tech companies.

06:48.140 --> 06:50.140
I didn't ever think I'd see a $3 trillion company.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.140
That's what Apple now is.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.140
They would say, fine,

06:54.940 --> 06:57.540
but look, wars still happen because of petrol,

06:57.740 --> 07:00.540
because of food, because of access to clean drinking water.

07:00.740 --> 07:04.340
The United States is worried about Taiwan because of its semiconductor manufacture.

07:04.740 --> 07:09.740
So the world still revolves around resources, minerals,

07:09.740 --> 07:12.540
rare earths and manufactured commodities.

07:13.140 --> 07:14.340
Is that a criticism?

07:14.340 --> 07:16.140
Does that disagree with what you're saying?

07:16.140 --> 07:19.340
Or you presumably have a rebuttal to it?

07:19.340 --> 07:22.140
Well, of course. I mean, it always did feudalism.

07:22.140 --> 07:28.540
I mean, think of the great clashes between the medieval forces, medieval powers.

07:29.940 --> 07:34.940
They were clashing over resources, over surplus distribution,

07:34.940 --> 07:38.540
over ideologies, over a reach of empire.

07:39.140 --> 07:41.540
That was happening well before capitalism was established.

07:41.740 --> 07:44.940
So nothing has changed, feudalism, capitalism,

07:44.940 --> 07:47.540
and now techno feudalism in that regard.

07:48.540 --> 07:51.340
But if you're going to understand, for instance, you mentioned Taiwan,

07:51.340 --> 07:52.540
why is Taiwan an issue now?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.140
If you ask the United States government, they'll tell you,

07:56.140 --> 08:00.140
because Beijing wants to gobble it up.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.540
It always wanted to gobble it up.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.740
I mean, the United States has never recognized Taiwan,

08:03.740 --> 08:07.340
because it recognized as part of the deal between Nixon and Mao

08:07.740 --> 08:10.140
that China has a claim to Taiwan.

08:10.340 --> 08:11.940
So what is new exactly?

08:12.340 --> 08:14.340
In my book, I try to explain what I think is new.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.340
And it's the rise of cloud capital,

08:16.540 --> 08:18.540
the shift from capitalism to techno feudalism.

08:18.940 --> 08:23.540
Because if you think about it, after 1971,

08:23.940 --> 08:28.540
when the gold standard died and the dollar was no longer exchangeable with gold,

08:29.740 --> 08:36.540
the United States has built its power on a remarkable model of a world system,

08:36.540 --> 08:41.340
whereby the United States has a huge trade surplus,

08:41.340 --> 08:44.140
which acts as a vacuum cleaner, sucking into its territory

08:44.540 --> 08:46.340
the products of Chinese capitalists,

08:46.740 --> 08:48.340
or Chinese labor, to be precise,

08:48.940 --> 08:52.740
of German, of Dutch, of Italian, Japanese, of course.

08:53.340 --> 08:56.940
And how does it pay for that with IOUs called dollars?

08:57.540 --> 08:58.340
Because it prints them.

08:59.140 --> 09:01.940
And why do the Chinese, the Japanese, the German capitalists

09:01.940 --> 09:04.140
accept those IOUs, the dollars,

09:04.140 --> 09:07.740
because they use it to take it back to Wall Street

09:07.940 --> 09:11.540
and to invest in real estate, in bonds,

09:11.540 --> 09:13.740
effectively financing the American government.

09:13.740 --> 09:17.140
So that's the model since the mid-1970s.

09:17.540 --> 09:20.340
And that whole model is predicated upon what?

09:20.940 --> 09:25.940
On the monopoly of the payment system of the dollar

09:26.340 --> 09:27.540
and the dollar payment system.

09:28.940 --> 09:31.540
What has happened in the last 10-15 years,

09:31.540 --> 09:34.540
which I tried to map out in techno feudalism,

09:34.940 --> 09:40.540
is that the Chinese are the only alternative locus

09:41.140 --> 09:44.140
in which cloud capital emerged.

09:44.140 --> 09:45.740
Europe has no cloud capital of its own.

09:45.740 --> 09:47.540
We don't have a Google, we don't have a Facebook,

09:47.540 --> 09:49.740
we don't have a Tesla, we don't have anything.

09:50.140 --> 09:52.540
Zero. Europe, in that includes Britain.

09:52.940 --> 09:53.740
The Chinese have.

09:53.740 --> 09:54.940
We have only fans.

09:55.940 --> 09:56.540
That's it.

09:57.540 --> 10:01.140
So if you take an app like WeChat,

10:01.540 --> 10:05.340
or if you take the digital currency that is being tested,

10:05.340 --> 10:09.940
massively tested, 135 million accounts by the Central Bank of China,

10:10.140 --> 10:12.540
they are developing the technology to have a payment system

10:12.540 --> 10:14.940
which is denominated not in dollars, but in one.

10:15.340 --> 10:19.740
This rise of Chinese techno feudalism,

10:19.740 --> 10:22.940
if you want a Chinese cloud thief,

10:23.940 --> 10:26.740
in contradiction with the American cloud thief,

10:26.740 --> 10:29.140
explains why Taiwan is an issue.

10:29.140 --> 10:30.940
Yeah, I think it's a really original explanation

10:30.940 --> 10:32.740
for rising geopolitical tensions,

10:33.140 --> 10:34.340
which I've not seen elsewhere.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.540
I'm sure some people have sort of hinted at it.

10:36.740 --> 10:39.540
But the idea that what's really upsetting the United States

10:39.540 --> 10:41.740
is the emergence of big tech conglomerates

10:42.140 --> 10:43.740
that can compete with their own ones.

10:43.740 --> 10:45.740
And obviously, the most visible example of that

10:45.740 --> 10:47.940
is the geopolitical fuel array around TikTok,

10:48.940 --> 10:50.740
which you touched upon in the book.

10:51.140 --> 10:52.940
And I think it is true to an extent

10:52.940 --> 10:54.940
that clearly the world is diverging,

10:54.940 --> 10:56.940
particularly as we move into a world of AI,

10:57.340 --> 11:00.140
diverging into these two spheres of influence.

11:00.140 --> 11:03.140
There was a great paper a few years ago by PricewaterhouseCooper

11:03.540 --> 11:05.940
saying that AI was going to add around 17 trillion dollars

11:05.940 --> 11:08.740
to the global economy by 2030-2035.

11:09.140 --> 11:11.340
And almost all of this is going to China and the United States.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.940
You know, none of it is going to South America or Africa.

11:13.940 --> 11:14.540
Or Europe.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.940
Or Europe, exactly.

11:16.340 --> 11:19.740
So I find that a really original argument.

11:20.540 --> 11:21.940
But to step back a bit,

11:21.940 --> 11:24.740
because I think you just mentioned what you referred to

11:24.740 --> 11:26.340
as the global minotaur in the book

11:26.340 --> 11:28.340
and what happens after 1971,

11:28.540 --> 11:31.540
which explains where we are now

11:32.740 --> 11:35.140
and even things like US-China relations.

11:35.340 --> 11:37.340
So let's go back to 1971.

11:37.540 --> 11:41.340
We have the Disadoption of the Gold Standard by Nixon.

11:42.740 --> 11:44.140
Why did that happen?

11:44.540 --> 11:49.540
And what has it meant in the ensuing sort of period of 50 plus years now?

11:50.740 --> 11:51.940
Thank you for the question,

11:51.940 --> 11:54.140
which is very dear to my heart, as you probably know.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.740
But before answering this,

11:55.740 --> 11:57.740
allow me to preface it with a comment

11:57.740 --> 11:59.740
about the thing you saw at the beginning.

12:00.140 --> 12:03.940
It's not just the Americans that trumped initially in Biden later.

12:04.740 --> 12:07.140
Why did that big tech in China is rising?

12:07.340 --> 12:08.340
It's not just that.

12:08.340 --> 12:11.140
That would not worry them so much on its own.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.940
It is that Chinese big tech.

12:15.540 --> 12:18.340
A company like Alibaba or Tencent

12:19.340 --> 12:22.340
or Huawei is rising in a country

12:22.940 --> 12:27.740
where the banking sector does not have autonomous power.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.340
Unlike Britain.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.940
Britain with the city of London and America with Wall Street.

12:33.340 --> 12:34.540
In China,

12:34.940 --> 12:38.340
because of the power of the Chinese Communist Party, the political power,

12:39.140 --> 12:43.540
the big tech companies and the banks have fused to become one.

12:44.140 --> 12:46.540
So you have an app like WeChat,

12:46.940 --> 12:48.940
which is Elon Musk's wet dream.

12:49.540 --> 12:52.740
What Elon Musk wants to do with Twitter is to replicate WeChat.

12:52.740 --> 12:55.340
WeChat, imagine an app that does everything.

12:55.740 --> 12:59.140
It shows you photographs, it plays music,

12:59.140 --> 13:01.740
it shows movies, it allows you to communicate.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.940
It's got something like Facebook on it

13:04.340 --> 13:08.340
and allows you free payments, free payments.

13:08.940 --> 13:12.540
You make payments and the bank does not retain anything either from you

13:12.540 --> 13:13.940
or from the vendor.

13:14.740 --> 13:15.940
The Americans do not have that.

13:15.940 --> 13:18.540
And they do not have that because they don't have the technology to have that.

13:18.540 --> 13:21.940
But because, you know, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America

13:21.940 --> 13:25.540
will never allow Google and Apple to get away with it,

13:25.740 --> 13:26.940
to take over their business.

13:27.540 --> 13:30.340
But if you fuse together big tech with big finance,

13:30.340 --> 13:31.940
you have something much more powerful,

13:31.940 --> 13:33.140
which is what the Chinese have done,

13:33.140 --> 13:37.140
than what the Americans have done, have created.

13:37.140 --> 13:38.740
Another point about the Scoopta.

13:39.540 --> 13:42.940
Look, I'm not into projections about what will happen in 20, 30 years time.

13:42.940 --> 13:47.740
This is a book not of what is going to hit us in the next 5, 10 years.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.740
This is a book about what has already happened.

13:49.740 --> 13:51.140
And now to your question.

13:51.140 --> 13:53.340
What happened in 1971,

13:53.340 --> 13:55.740
which I explained in the Global Minuto, thank you for mentioning it,

13:55.740 --> 13:58.140
and I can actually see a copy of it back there.

13:59.140 --> 14:00.540
We're well read here at Navarro Media.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.540
I can see that.

14:01.540 --> 14:02.740
Well, thank you.

14:02.740 --> 14:07.740
The story I tell in that book is that after the Second World War,

14:07.740 --> 14:14.740
the United States created a centrally planned capitalist global economy.

14:14.740 --> 14:15.940
Centrally planned.

14:15.940 --> 14:16.940
Because if you think about it,

14:16.940 --> 14:20.340
it's very difficult for young people today to wrap their minds around that.

14:20.340 --> 14:27.140
Between 1944 and 1971, 72, 73, we had fixed exchange rates.

14:27.140 --> 14:29.540
That is, you would never open the newspaper and try to find out

14:29.540 --> 14:32.940
what the exchange rate between the pound and the French franc,

14:32.940 --> 14:34.540
the pound that the US dollar was.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.140
It was fixed for years.

14:36.140 --> 14:41.140
I mean, I grew up in a world where there were 30 drachmas to a dollar, forever.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.540
Interest rates were fixed.

14:42.540 --> 14:46.340
Can you imagine a world where interest rates were not exactly fixed,

14:46.340 --> 14:48.340
but more or less around 4%.

14:48.340 --> 14:53.740
You knew that, you know, if you borrowed money, you would be paying 4% forever.

14:54.740 --> 14:56.940
But that's like a centrally planned,

14:56.940 --> 14:59.140
gospel and Soviet economy, more or less,

14:59.140 --> 15:02.740
without common ownership of the means of production.

15:02.740 --> 15:03.940
But it was planned.

15:03.940 --> 15:11.740
The only way that could work was if all these currencies were effectively based on the US dollar.

15:11.740 --> 15:15.140
So we had a dollar in different guises.

15:15.140 --> 15:18.140
But the only way we could have the dollar in different guises

15:18.140 --> 15:23.940
was that if the United States was a surplus country,

15:23.940 --> 15:25.340
because if it was a surplus,

15:25.340 --> 15:27.940
while it was a surplus country after the Second World War,

15:27.940 --> 15:30.940
it was the only country that had a trade surplus.

15:30.940 --> 15:37.340
Every time they sold a jet or a car or a washing machine to a Brit,

15:37.340 --> 15:40.540
to a French person, to a German person,

15:40.540 --> 15:43.140
a quantity of dollars would go to the United States.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.740
So the United States would give us dollars,

15:45.740 --> 15:48.140
dollarize us, martial aid, for instance,

15:48.140 --> 15:50.740
other ways as well, same to Japan.

15:50.740 --> 15:53.340
And then by selling us their wares,

15:53.340 --> 15:57.740
we would return the dollars and that would complete the recycling loop.

15:57.740 --> 16:01.140
But for that to happen, they had to have a trade surplus.

16:01.140 --> 16:04.540
After 1968-69, they had a trade deficit,

16:04.540 --> 16:08.340
which means that they were leaking dollars.

16:08.340 --> 16:14.140
Dollars were a net stream or torrent of dollars

16:14.140 --> 16:16.140
was coming to Europe and to Japan.

16:16.140 --> 16:20.240
At some point, those who held the dollars,

16:20.240 --> 16:23.640
Germans, Brits, Saudi Arabians, Japanese,

16:23.640 --> 16:27.240
started worrying that they wouldn't be able to buy as much gold with the dollars

16:27.240 --> 16:30.340
because there was this increasing quantity of dollars.

16:30.340 --> 16:35.040
And that meant that the fixed exchange rate regime had to break down.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.440
And it broke down.

16:36.440 --> 16:40.840
And the Americans, instead of being yet another empire

16:40.840 --> 16:46.240
that lost its power, its political power, its military power, its hegemonic power,

16:46.240 --> 16:48.340
as a result of going into the red,

16:48.340 --> 16:52.040
managed, and it's the only empire that has ever managed that,

16:52.040 --> 16:55.640
to become more hegemonic by using their trade deficit

16:55.640 --> 16:57.940
in the way that I described before,

16:57.940 --> 17:02.740
to ensure that the Japanese, British, Dutch, German, French, Italian

17:02.740 --> 17:04.540
and later Chinese capitalists,

17:04.540 --> 17:08.640
needed the American trade deficit

17:08.640 --> 17:12.640
as a source of demand for their net exports to the United States.

17:12.640 --> 17:16.640
And this is the world that precipitated neoliberalism,

17:16.640 --> 17:20.840
precipitated financialization,

17:20.840 --> 17:24.640
the crazy bets that were placed in Wall Street

17:24.640 --> 17:26.840
and, therefore, gave rise to the,

17:26.840 --> 17:30.140
they gave rise, led to the crash of 2008.

17:30.140 --> 17:34.340
And then, after that, the central banks of the West,

17:34.340 --> 17:36.440
with the federal reserve, the American central bank,

17:36.440 --> 17:38.640
leading the way, started printing all the money

17:38.640 --> 17:41.940
that replaced capitalist profits.

17:41.940 --> 17:43.640
This is another part of techno-feudalism.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.040
So, this is more recently.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.140
This is after 2009.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.840
But the QE, there's an amazing,

17:47.840 --> 17:50.240
before we get to 2008, 2009 and quantitative easing,

17:50.240 --> 17:54.040
I think that's really important to say that any Marxist knows

17:54.040 --> 17:57.240
that really, you know, the history of the last, you know,

17:57.540 --> 17:59.540
75 years since World War II,

17:59.540 --> 18:03.440
is a succession of trying to modify and address crises,

18:03.440 --> 18:07.340
71, late 1980s, early 1990s,

18:07.340 --> 18:09.740
early 2000s, 2008.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.840
But what happens between 2002 and 2007,

18:12.840 --> 18:14.940
with regards to financialization, is extraordinary.

18:14.940 --> 18:17.540
And the numbers are just mind-blowing for me.

18:17.540 --> 18:18.440
And you talk about this in the books.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.040
So, in 2002, total global GDP,

18:21.040 --> 18:22.940
that's all the economic transactions,

18:22.940 --> 18:24.440
planetary economic transactions,

18:24.440 --> 18:27.640
which are monetized, 50 trillion US dollars.

18:27.640 --> 18:33.840
The worth of total global transactions by 2007 rises to 75 trillion.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.940
So, it increases by 50%, which is obviously quite a lot.

18:36.940 --> 18:38.940
But when you look at the sum of bets of what you call

18:38.940 --> 18:40.840
in the global money market,

18:40.840 --> 18:46.740
that rises from 70 trillion in 2002 to 750 trillion.

18:46.740 --> 18:48.640
So, it's more than 10 times increased.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.840
So, what happens between 2002 and 2007,

18:51.840 --> 18:53.440
in terms of financialization

18:53.440 --> 18:57.940
and this huge explosion in financialized debts?

18:57.940 --> 18:59.840
The regulation.

18:59.840 --> 19:03.440
Thatcherism and Reaganism reached its crescendo

19:03.440 --> 19:06.240
with Blair, here in this country,

19:06.240 --> 19:09.540
and with Clinton in the United States.

19:09.540 --> 19:14.040
Effectively, the bankers were unshackled

19:14.040 --> 19:17.340
from all the constraints of the New Deal,

19:17.340 --> 19:18.540
the American New Deal,

19:18.540 --> 19:21.540
and later the Clement Attlee

19:21.540 --> 19:26.840
and 1950s government's constraints on bankers.

19:26.840 --> 19:31.040
You see, governments had been burned once in 1929

19:31.040 --> 19:33.040
because they're already in 20s,

19:33.040 --> 19:37.640
where a period of unfettered financialization.

19:37.640 --> 19:43.940
The bankers, let's not forget, create money out of thin air.

19:43.940 --> 19:46.840
You know, people talk about the money tree

19:46.940 --> 19:49.140
in order to lambast socialists,

19:49.140 --> 19:52.740
but it is the bankers who have access to the money tree

19:52.740 --> 19:56.440
and they can pluck as much money from thin air as they want.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.340
And of course, when they overdo it,

19:58.340 --> 20:01.340
under the weight of all those mountains of money

20:01.340 --> 20:04.140
that they've created, they bugle under

20:04.140 --> 20:07.440
and something like 1929 or 2008 happens.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.240
After 1929...

20:08.240 --> 20:10.240
Because a certain amount of people can't pay back liabilities

20:10.240 --> 20:12.140
and all of a sudden the whole thing's screwed.

20:12.140 --> 20:15.440
When all these leveraged bets,

20:15.440 --> 20:20.740
that is, bets based on borrowing from the future.

20:20.740 --> 20:22.840
Not from other people, but from the future.

20:22.840 --> 20:23.840
Thin air.

20:23.840 --> 20:24.940
You know, when...

20:24.940 --> 20:27.940
Let's make this once again clear

20:27.940 --> 20:31.140
that when Lloydsbank or Barclaysbank give you a loan,

20:31.140 --> 20:34.040
they are not giving you money that somebody has saved.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.640
They are conjuring it up like magicians.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.440
So effectively, they type into your bank account,

20:39.440 --> 20:42.640
10,000 pounds or 50,000 or 100,000 pounds.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.340
That money doesn't exist.

20:44.340 --> 20:45.440
It's out of thin air.

20:45.440 --> 20:49.940
Bankers have this right that is given to them by society,

20:49.940 --> 20:53.640
by you and me, by our listeners and audience.

20:53.640 --> 20:58.540
And then of course, while these bets work out,

20:58.540 --> 21:02.340
you know, if the borrowers manage to make this money

21:02.340 --> 21:05.440
and also make the money to pay interest,

21:05.440 --> 21:07.740
bankers are laughing all their way to their own banks.

21:07.740 --> 21:09.840
Surprisingly, they're very profitable when it works like that.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.240
Exactly. And then they think that they deserve the money.

21:12.240 --> 21:18.540
But then at some point, all that is needed is a small pinprick

21:18.540 --> 21:22.340
to deflate this or to burst that bubble.

21:22.340 --> 21:24.540
And then what happens is you and I,

21:24.540 --> 21:27.340
and especially the working class of our countries,

21:27.340 --> 21:32.340
build them out and more money printing by central banks.

21:32.340 --> 21:36.340
So after 2008-2009,

21:36.340 --> 21:40.240
we had 35 trillion printed on behalf of bankers,

21:40.240 --> 21:44.040
35 trillion dollars to put it in context.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.540
Back then, back in 2009, when that started,

21:47.540 --> 21:51.840
the total GDP income of the United States of America was 17-18.

21:51.840 --> 21:55.840
So they printed 35 and they gave it to bankers.

21:55.840 --> 21:59.540
Now bankers wanted to lend it to business people.

21:59.540 --> 22:02.640
Business people, however, looked around at the little people out there

22:02.640 --> 22:04.640
who were suffering under austerity,

22:04.640 --> 22:07.140
who were in Pekinos, who couldn't buy anything,

22:07.140 --> 22:08.640
as if they were going to invest it.

22:08.640 --> 22:16.440
So all this money that is being printed ends up inflating asset prices,

22:16.440 --> 22:21.540
artwork, house prices, and it never feeds into investment.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.440
That's why in Britain now,

22:23.440 --> 22:26.440
you have this ridiculously low level of productivity

22:26.440 --> 22:27.540
because there's been no investment.

22:27.540 --> 22:29.840
And the same thing in the European Union.

22:29.840 --> 22:36.840
And the only entrepreneurs that care to take some of this liquidity

22:36.840 --> 22:39.140
and not just put it back to the stock exchange

22:39.140 --> 22:44.340
and instead use it to build up a new capital are the tech lords.

22:44.340 --> 22:47.540
They took the money and society, in other words,

22:47.540 --> 22:52.240
as a result of the inane handling by the establishment

22:52.240 --> 22:54.740
and the central banks of the 2008 crisis,

22:54.740 --> 22:59.540
effectively we have funded the build-up masses of cloud capital.

22:59.540 --> 23:03.240
Cloud capital would always have been built, but not at that rate.

23:03.240 --> 23:09.140
Let me put it in terms of somebody who should know,

23:09.140 --> 23:12.440
McNamee, who wrote Zucht,

23:12.440 --> 23:15.640
a tech investor who was part of Facebook,

23:15.640 --> 23:17.840
one of the early investors in Facebook.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.240
He agrees with my assessment,

23:20.240 --> 23:23.340
he sent me an email recently saying so,

23:23.340 --> 23:29.340
that nine out of the ten dollars that have been invested

23:29.340 --> 23:33.940
in what I call cloud capital came from central bank money.

23:33.940 --> 23:37.340
It's feudalism, remember?

23:37.340 --> 23:42.240
The sovereign printed the money and the feudal lords used it

23:42.240 --> 23:44.640
together with their property rights over land

23:44.640 --> 23:47.640
to exploit the peasants and the vassals

23:47.640 --> 23:51.240
which are today's capitalists who produce

23:51.240 --> 23:54.840
in the old-fashioned way using machinery, industrial robots

23:54.840 --> 23:57.340
without cloud capital.

23:57.340 --> 23:58.540
And one last thing.

23:58.540 --> 24:00.640
If you want to understand the difference between Volkswagen

24:00.640 --> 24:03.540
and Tesla or Chinese cars,

24:03.540 --> 24:06.240
understand this, Tesla is connected to the cloud.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.640
That's why Elon Musk wanted Twitter.

24:08.640 --> 24:11.240
Every time a Tesla goes around,

24:11.240 --> 24:13.840
Tesla acquires enormous information about what music

24:13.840 --> 24:15.840
you are listening to while you are driving, where you are going.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.740
This is connected with the tweets that you send.

24:18.740 --> 24:22.840
Therefore, the value added to Tesla comes increasingly from the cloud

24:22.840 --> 24:25.440
and far less from the money you pay to buy the car.

24:25.440 --> 24:29.240
Volkswagen, because it's German and Germany, Europe, Britain, France,

24:29.240 --> 24:32.240
Italy, Greece, we have not invested in cloud capital.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.740
We cannot compete because we will never be able to compete.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.340
Well, we, you and I, of course not.

24:37.340 --> 24:41.040
But even our capitalists are vassals

24:41.040 --> 24:44.240
to the American and Chinese cloudists,

24:44.240 --> 24:46.040
the owners of cloud capital.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.140
Navarro Media has been around for more than a decade.

24:48.140 --> 24:50.340
It has grown to an extraordinary extent,

24:50.340 --> 24:55.140
thanks to the generosity and kindness of our brilliant supporters.

24:55.140 --> 24:57.740
The downstream in that context is a bit more recent.

24:57.740 --> 25:00.240
It's only really appeared in the last couple of years.

25:00.240 --> 25:04.340
It's now become our standout into your show here on YouTube.

25:04.340 --> 25:08.240
It gives us an opportunity to talk about big ideas with brilliant minds,

25:08.240 --> 25:11.440
the kinds of people wrestling with the challenges

25:11.440 --> 25:13.940
we all have to confront in the 21st century.

25:13.940 --> 25:15.540
If you enjoy downstream,

25:15.540 --> 25:18.340
if you enjoy the rest of our content here at Navarro Media,

25:18.340 --> 25:21.340
obviously click the YouTube subscribe button.

25:21.340 --> 25:25.540
If you want to go further than that, support our work financially.

25:25.540 --> 25:27.740
Make a one-off payment or a monthly one.

25:27.740 --> 25:30.540
We obviously prefer the latter if you can.

25:30.540 --> 25:34.640
And to do that, go to navarromedia.com forward slash support

25:34.640 --> 25:37.540
to help build a people-powered media

25:37.540 --> 25:41.140
because we can all have political commitments to change the world,

25:41.140 --> 25:44.840
to get us out of the mess we find ourselves in.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.940
But as long as the billionaires, the media oligarchs,

25:47.940 --> 25:51.440
own media in Britain and elsewhere,

25:51.440 --> 25:53.440
we're going to make very little progress.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.840
So, like I say, help us build people-powered media.

25:55.840 --> 26:00.440
Go to navarromedia.com forward slash support.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.740
I mean, it's an elegant hypothesis,

26:02.740 --> 26:05.440
but particularly this example you've just given of cars.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.540
You talk about how basically the German car manufacturing industry is over

26:08.540 --> 26:11.740
because their global comparative advantage

26:11.740 --> 26:15.240
is in high-quality engineering, the combustion engine,

26:15.240 --> 26:17.740
which is accumulated over 100-150 years.

26:17.740 --> 26:19.240
Of engineering expertise.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.840
But the cars of the 21st century require a very different skill set,

26:22.840 --> 26:25.340
very different resources, and they're going to be made by,

26:25.340 --> 26:29.840
if anyone, Alphabet, Apple eventually, Tesla, various Chinese companies.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.840
So, I think it's very elegant in that regard.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.940
And there's a really interesting point here as well.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.240
You talk about it at the end of the book.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.840
I don't want to talk about the end of the book just yet

26:36.840 --> 26:37.740
because we're only getting started.

26:37.740 --> 26:41.440
But about the kinds of coalitions you have to build.

26:41.440 --> 26:44.540
There was a really fascinating side I heard recently,

26:44.540 --> 26:48.040
which was the triumph of Donald Trump

26:48.040 --> 26:52.840
can only be understood as a clash between national and family capital,

26:52.840 --> 26:57.840
which is to say that family capital, petty bourgeois capitalists,

26:57.840 --> 27:00.640
were onside with Trump against what they perceived

27:00.640 --> 27:03.840
as a national variant of often cloud capital,

27:03.840 --> 27:05.240
but also finance.

27:05.240 --> 27:08.240
We'll talk about some big finance firms like BlackRock and whatnot.

27:08.240 --> 27:10.340
And I thought that makes so much sense

27:10.340 --> 27:16.040
because that is precisely the fragment of the capitalist class.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.640
The petty bourgeois, we can talk about that.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.140
It's quite a difficult one to really explain.

27:20.140 --> 27:23.940
But that is the fragment which has been hammered by 15 years of QE,

27:23.940 --> 27:29.840
which has been hammered by de-globalization, de-industrialization.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.840
And so, for me, it's hugely interesting

27:32.840 --> 27:35.940
that people who historically the left has been very ambivalent

27:35.940 --> 27:38.940
about the petty bourgeois, the small business owner,

27:38.940 --> 27:42.840
even the national capitalist making non-cloud commodities,

27:42.840 --> 27:46.640
there's the space there for interesting forms of alignment and alliance.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.040
This is absolutely correct.

27:48.040 --> 27:52.440
But may I say that it is not entirely new.

27:52.440 --> 27:57.340
Which social class was behind Mussolini and Hitler?

27:57.340 --> 27:59.140
The petty bourgeois.

27:59.140 --> 28:04.740
The petty bourgeois who was squashed by the crisis the 1920s in Italy

28:04.740 --> 28:09.440
and then late 1920s and early 1930s in Germany.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.540
Fascism is a petty bourgeois phenomenon.

28:12.540 --> 28:14.040
It begins not from the working class,

28:14.040 --> 28:16.040
it starts from the petty bourgeoisie

28:16.040 --> 28:18.040
and then spreads to the working class

28:18.040 --> 28:24.640
once the crisis of capitalism begins to deplete industrial workers' jobs.

28:24.640 --> 28:28.240
Exactly the same happened after our generations, 1929,

28:28.240 --> 28:31.640
which I keep saying happened in 2008.

28:31.640 --> 28:38.340
Από 2008, the process of immiseration of the petty bourgeoisie

28:38.340 --> 28:42.340
and the working class was worse than it was in the 1920s and 30s.

28:42.340 --> 28:46.540
Because if you think about it, in the United States,

28:46.540 --> 28:49.340
all the factories shifted to China and to Vietnam.

28:49.340 --> 28:52.540
All of them, all of them, they just shifted.

28:52.540 --> 28:56.740
And it was a part of what I call in the book a dark deal.

28:56.740 --> 28:59.340
So the dark deal between Washington DC

28:59.340 --> 29:01.540
and the Chinese Communist Party was,

29:01.540 --> 29:10.640
okay, we will send you over our machinery, our industry.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.840
You will produce the stuff.

29:12.840 --> 29:16.040
We will keep the IP, the intellectual property rights,

29:16.040 --> 29:17.740
in the case of Από.

29:17.740 --> 29:23.440
So we will get a large share of the monopoly profits from selling iPhones,

29:23.440 --> 29:25.840
but you will keep the share,

29:25.840 --> 29:29.240
you'll keep the surplus value that you extract from your Chinese

29:29.240 --> 29:31.840
proletariat.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.540
You will be paid in dollars,

29:33.540 --> 29:36.840
which of course we mint as a deficit country.

29:36.840 --> 29:40.840
So they are worthless unless you send them back to Washington

29:40.840 --> 29:45.040
and you will finance our government

29:45.040 --> 29:47.040
and you will get an interest rate from the bonds,

29:47.040 --> 29:48.840
the treasury bills that you will buy.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.040
At the same time, you buy a real estate.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.940
We will not let you buy companies unless they are useless

29:53.940 --> 29:54.640
and not particular.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.040
So you can't buy Google.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.840
You can't buy Bank of America.

29:58.840 --> 30:04.240
That's the same deal as they were given to the Japanese in the 1960s.

30:04.240 --> 30:10.040
That is the deal that enriched Chinese capitalists

30:10.040 --> 30:12.040
and American Reteers

30:12.040 --> 30:14.740
at the expense of the American working class.

30:14.740 --> 30:17.440
You know, people talk about the dominance of the dollar

30:17.440 --> 30:20.640
and they assume that it's a good thing for the United States.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.840
It isn't.

30:21.840 --> 30:25.040
The dominance of the dollar is fantastic for Americans and Reeteers

30:25.040 --> 30:26.240
and for Chinese capitalists

30:26.240 --> 30:29.240
and Japanese capitalists and German capitalists.

30:29.240 --> 30:33.040
And the people who actually suffer the most

30:33.040 --> 30:36.040
as a result of the exorbitant privilege of the dollar

30:36.040 --> 30:38.040
is the American working class,

30:38.040 --> 30:42.240
which was serially abandoned by the Democratic Party

30:42.240 --> 30:45.040
and politics hates a vacuum.

30:45.040 --> 30:49.040
Donald Trump waltzed in and took it.

30:49.040 --> 30:51.040
And I suppose people just quickly on that, people might say,

30:51.040 --> 30:54.040
oh well, we know that low income earners vote Democrat, etc.

30:54.040 --> 30:56.240
Obviously, that's highly stratified on racial lines,

30:56.240 --> 31:01.440
but in those states where Trump gets over the line in 2016,

31:01.440 --> 31:05.240
former heavily industrialized states, Pennsylvania, Michigan,

31:05.240 --> 31:06.640
that is precisely the story.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.640
And I think even now, seven years later,

31:08.640 --> 31:11.240
it's very hard for the left to understand that it was

31:11.240 --> 31:13.440
former blue collar workers, many in trade unions

31:13.440 --> 31:15.240
who took Donald Trump to the White House.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.240
They may do again.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.240
I mean, who knows, it's a different world now,

31:19.240 --> 31:21.640
but you know, I think they might do again.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.840
You say something as well, building on this,

31:23.840 --> 31:27.440
which is the worst thing you want as a Chinese capitalist

31:27.440 --> 31:31.240
is for Juan to be the global currency,

31:31.240 --> 31:33.040
the global currency replacing the dollar,

31:33.040 --> 31:34.640
which is quite funny because when people say

31:34.640 --> 31:38.240
at the end of the dollar, you know, China is, you know,

31:38.240 --> 31:41.040
heading towards hegemony status, blah, blah, blah.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.640
Well, no, actually, if you're a Chinese exporter,

31:42.640 --> 31:44.840
that's a terrible thing to be looking at.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.240
Or a German exporter.

31:46.240 --> 31:51.440
Why do you think the euro never competed with the dollar for supremacy?

31:51.440 --> 31:54.640
Because the general capitalist would hate that.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.840
Why do you think we have no euro bond?

31:56.840 --> 32:00.240
Because the lack of the euro bond guarantees

32:00.240 --> 32:02.640
that the euro will never compete with the dollar.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.240
So German industrial capital does not want the euro bond,

32:05.240 --> 32:09.440
doesn't care so much about, you know, fiscal union and so on.

32:09.440 --> 32:13.840
It just doesn't want to lose access to the American trade deficit,

32:13.840 --> 32:17.440
which is the reason why they're, you know,

32:17.440 --> 32:20.440
amassing all this surplus value.

32:20.440 --> 32:26.440
So, yeah, we must stop thinking in football terms, you know,

32:26.440 --> 32:28.440
my nation against the other nation, you know,

32:28.440 --> 32:31.440
England versus Argentina.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.240
It's not that.

32:34.240 --> 32:36.040
The division is within our countries.

32:36.040 --> 32:40.240
It's between the capitalist class in China

32:40.240 --> 32:42.040
and the proletariat in China.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.840
The capitalist class or the rentier class,

32:43.840 --> 32:45.440
not even the capitalist class, the rentiers

32:45.440 --> 32:48.240
and the techno feudal lords in the United States

32:48.240 --> 32:52.440
that have diametrically opposed interests

32:52.440 --> 32:54.840
to those of 60% of the American population,

32:54.840 --> 32:57.240
diametrically opposed interests.

32:57.240 --> 33:00.840
So, yeah, let's go back to thinking as left wingers.

33:00.840 --> 33:02.040
Can I ask a question?

33:02.040 --> 33:03.640
This isn't in my notes,

33:03.640 --> 33:05.840
but can I ask a question about the euro?

33:05.840 --> 33:08.440
Because the argument you're making about euro bonds

33:08.440 --> 33:10.440
is really interesting.

33:10.440 --> 33:14.440
I have always been a critic of the euro

33:14.440 --> 33:17.440
and I cannot understand why an Italian

33:17.440 --> 33:20.440
or a French leftist supports the euro

33:20.440 --> 33:23.440
because the whole euro project, as I understand it,

33:23.440 --> 33:25.440
the whole basically that sort of political economy

33:25.440 --> 33:28.640
of the euro zone seems to be premised upon the idea of,

33:28.640 --> 33:31.240
well, basically it's for German exporters.

33:31.240 --> 33:35.640
It's destroyed to historically powerful, you know,

33:35.640 --> 33:39.240
manufacturer exporter oriented countries, particularly Italy.

33:39.240 --> 33:41.640
You know, Italy is a share, the size of the economy.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.640
It's a share of proportionate rather to the size of its economy.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.040
Its manufacturing base wasn't about the same as Germany's,

33:47.040 --> 33:50.840
even as recently as sort of 10, 15 years ago, before 2008.

33:50.840 --> 33:54.040
And it seems obvious to me that membership of the euro zone

33:54.040 --> 33:57.040
means permanent decline for Italians,

33:57.040 --> 33:59.040
permanent decline for Italy's productive base.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.040
Permanent austerity.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.040
Yeah, permanent austerity, permanent.

34:02.040 --> 34:06.840
And this is a G7 economy or G8 economy.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.240
The same for France to a slightly lesser extent.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.440
And yet there aren't major movements in either country

34:11.440 --> 34:12.640
to leave the euro.

34:12.640 --> 34:15.040
I find that... I find it extraordinary.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.840
Now, I know there's huge downsides to leaving the euro.

34:16.840 --> 34:18.040
It'd be very painful.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.440
But the fact that's not even in the conversation

34:20.440 --> 34:22.640
in both nations is perplexing for me.

34:22.640 --> 34:26.440
It was in the conversation, but it was killed off.

34:26.440 --> 34:32.640
Let me explain what the lure of the euro was for progressive people.

34:32.640 --> 34:36.040
People who were not sellouts, turncoats.

34:36.040 --> 34:39.040
Because the turncoats, we know why they wanted the euro.

34:41.440 --> 34:46.840
I have this memory of the 1970s,

34:46.840 --> 34:55.040
when Greek trade unions would go on strike to gain some pay rise.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.240
Strikes are always extremely painful.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.240
There's a lot of sacrifice.

34:59.240 --> 35:02.640
Usually the strikers are never compensated.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.640
It's the strike breakers who get compensated

35:04.640 --> 35:06.240
because they get the pay rise,

35:06.240 --> 35:10.240
even though they have not suffered any of the costs of the strike.

35:10.240 --> 35:16.040
The next day, or five days after securing a 5% wage in Greece,

35:16.040 --> 35:20.440
the Bank of Greece would devalue their drachma and they would lose it all.

35:20.440 --> 35:25.440
The notion of a currency that cannot be devalued

35:25.440 --> 35:28.440
was very attractive even to trade unions.

35:28.440 --> 35:32.640
What they did not factor in was that there was a price to pay for that.

35:32.640 --> 35:35.440
The price was that there would be internal devaluation.

35:35.440 --> 35:44.640
They would not find one morning that their currency,

35:44.640 --> 35:46.640
the money they had in their wallet,

35:46.640 --> 35:50.840
was devalued as a result of an action of the Bank of Greece.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.640
But they would never get the pay rise.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.040
Indeed, they would get pay cuts.

35:55.040 --> 36:00.240
Don't forget that average wages today in Greece are 35% lower.

36:00.240 --> 36:04.440
35% lower in nominal terms, not in absolute terms.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.640
They were in 2007.

36:06.640 --> 36:07.640
That's crazy.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.040
Similarly with pensions.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.840
So that they didn't factor in.

36:10.840 --> 36:15.240
Once you get trapped into the Eurozone,

36:15.240 --> 36:19.840
it's like being in a house which is on fire but has no fire exits.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.840
You need to demolish the walls to get out.

36:22.840 --> 36:26.040
You put it very nicely when you said that the costs are very large

36:26.040 --> 36:29.640
because this exactly has been designed to make the costs very large.

36:29.640 --> 36:32.240
You know that when we entered the Eurozone,

36:32.240 --> 36:34.640
our printing presses were destroyed.

36:34.640 --> 36:35.440
Did you know that?

36:35.440 --> 36:36.040
No.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.240
It was part of the deal.

36:37.240 --> 36:38.040
No.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.040
It was part of the deal.

36:39.040 --> 36:42.840
You have to dismantle and destroy.

36:42.840 --> 36:43.640
Your national myth.

36:43.640 --> 36:47.640
Like the IRA had to destroy its weapons as part of the good fighter agreement,

36:47.640 --> 36:51.840
we had to destroy our printing presses as we entered the Eurozone.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.840
Now somehow I don't believe that the Buddhist Bank,

36:54.840 --> 36:57.640
the Germans destroyed their printing presses.

36:57.640 --> 36:58.840
But we certainly did.

36:58.840 --> 36:59.840
And so did the Italians.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.040
That's extraordinary.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.440
And what you just said there about nominal,

37:02.440 --> 37:04.440
I mean, just for people to handle nominal means.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.440
Look, we're not talking about inflation or what you can buy.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.040
We're literally talking about the currency.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.440
And I saw a statistic recently

37:11.440 --> 37:15.440
about the purchasing power of 18 to 35 year old Italians.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.440
I can't remember the exact numbers but it's something like 50.

37:17.440 --> 37:20.040
It's declined precipitously since the 1990s.

37:20.040 --> 37:23.240
Yeah, I think it's basically 50% what it was 20 years ago.

37:23.240 --> 37:26.040
And you think you only get to live once.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.640
But that's why we have a new fascist in government.

37:27.640 --> 37:28.840
Well, quite, exactly.

37:28.840 --> 37:29.840
Of course, people are going to be angry.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.640
That's why the Socialist Party died.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.240
That's why the Communist Party doesn't exist

37:33.240 --> 37:36.040
because it accepted this process.

37:36.040 --> 37:43.440
And the only voices that are supported by the public in Italy

37:43.440 --> 37:47.040
are the ones who remain under establishment,

37:47.040 --> 37:50.840
unfortunately, as descendants of Mussolini.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.240
I mean, I understand why people are angry.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.840
I do understand why they turn to the far right

37:54.840 --> 37:56.440
because you only get one shot at life.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.240
You're around for 70, 80 years

37:58.240 --> 37:59.840
and there is a political settlement

37:59.840 --> 38:03.040
which is screwing you over so badly.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.040
It's depriving you of the life you expected,

38:05.040 --> 38:07.040
which you deserve

38:07.040 --> 38:09.840
and nobody in the political class is doing anything about it.

38:09.840 --> 38:13.640
Don't forget the other great danger

38:13.640 --> 38:15.840
for countries like Italy and Greece.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.040
Immigration.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.440
Not immigration.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.440
Immigration.

38:19.440 --> 38:23.840
The problem is not that the Africans are coming.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.640
The problem is that the Greeks and the Italians are leaving.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.640
Or particularly for Greece.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.440
I mean, in recent years, it's extraordinary.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.440
Italy.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.040
Young Italians are all over the place.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.040
They're leaving.

38:33.040 --> 38:34.240
Today, as we speak, they're leaving.

38:34.240 --> 38:35.440
So do you think then, I mean,

38:35.440 --> 38:37.840
so let's build on this for a moment.

38:37.840 --> 38:39.240
We agree that the Eurozone

38:39.240 --> 38:41.240
probably locks in permanent austerity industrial decline

38:41.240 --> 38:42.840
for some really big countries,

38:42.840 --> 38:46.040
historically France, Italy, Greece as well, of course.

38:46.040 --> 38:47.640
Germany as well.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.840
Because remember the class analysis?

38:49.840 --> 38:53.840
The lower bottom of the German population

38:53.840 --> 38:55.240
or income distribution

38:55.240 --> 38:58.640
are now 15% worse off than they were 20 years ago.

38:58.640 --> 39:01.240
Although, yeah, their capitalist class is doing very well.

39:01.240 --> 39:02.240
Yeah.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.240
So the Greek capitalist class are doing extremely well.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.240
Yeah.

39:05.240 --> 39:06.840
The shipping magnets, yeah.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.240
Not just the shipping magnets.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.240
No.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.040
I can give you names.

39:10.040 --> 39:10.640
Please.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.840
You know, Giannis Peristeris,

39:11.840 --> 39:13.640
Metis Linnaeus, Melisandides.

39:13.640 --> 39:15.240
They are not,

39:15.240 --> 39:17.840
they don't make money so much out of shipping,

39:17.840 --> 39:21.840
but they own the power generation

39:21.840 --> 39:23.840
and power distribution network

39:23.840 --> 39:25.840
as a result of the privatization

39:25.840 --> 39:30.040
of our formerly nationalized power grid.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.240
They charge an arm and leg for that.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.040
The cost of living crisis, the energy crisis,

39:35.040 --> 39:40.040
has allowed them to multiply by a factor of four

39:40.040 --> 39:42.440
their surpluses.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.840
They own every single television station

39:45.840 --> 39:50.040
and anyone who dares speak their name in parliament

39:50.040 --> 39:53.640
gets absolutely vilified and demonized.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.040
So, you know, you have a dictatorship of those oligarchs

39:56.040 --> 39:58.840
who are,

39:58.840 --> 40:00.840
come to Athens and I'll take you to the northern suburbs.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.640
You see the Lamborghinis and the Porsches and the Ferraris.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.840
Well, I'll hold you to that, Giannis.

40:04.840 --> 40:05.840
Yeah.

40:05.840 --> 40:06.840
You can show me.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.840
It's a very ugly, very ugly scene.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.040
Well, okay, so what I would say,

40:10.040 --> 40:11.240
I'm not suggesting for a moment

40:11.240 --> 40:12.240
that the German working class

40:12.240 --> 40:13.040
could have better deal out of it,

40:13.040 --> 40:15.240
but what I would say is

40:15.240 --> 40:18.040
there is a fragment of Italian or French capital

40:18.040 --> 40:19.840
who gets a really bummed deal out of this,

40:19.840 --> 40:21.040
industrial capital,

40:21.040 --> 40:22.240
which comparatively speaking,

40:22.240 --> 40:24.040
was getting a better deal 25 years ago.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.440
That's where they were giving a lot of money

40:25.440 --> 40:31.440
from the coronavirus recovery fund

40:31.440 --> 40:33.040
to keep them sweet.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.440
And they kept them sweet.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.040
They gave them something like, you know,

40:36.040 --> 40:40.440
130 billion to keep them happy.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.840
Let's talk about COVID,

40:41.840 --> 40:42.840
because this is interesting, right?

40:42.840 --> 40:46.040
Well, the pandemic was a major, major boon

40:46.040 --> 40:49.240
because, you know, a manna from heaven

40:49.240 --> 40:50.640
for the establishment.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.640
Manna from heaven.

40:51.640 --> 40:54.640
I'm not talking about vaccines and all that, right?

40:54.640 --> 40:57.840
I'm talking about an opportunity

40:57.840 --> 41:01.040
to take on a lot more debt,

41:01.040 --> 41:06.240
pile it up on the shoulders of the weaker of the working classes,

41:06.240 --> 41:08.040
and distribute it amongst themselves.

41:08.040 --> 41:12.640
Only in Greece, in 18 months, during the pandemic,

41:12.640 --> 41:15.640
the right-wing government was allowed to borrow another 60 billion

41:15.640 --> 41:18.440
in a country where GDP is 190.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.440
That's a huge amount.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.840
Given that we were already hugely indebted,

41:23.840 --> 41:26.840
they gave them another 60 billion to spread the money around.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.840
That's why they won the election.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.840
So there are these moments that were chronicling

41:30.840 --> 41:32.640
in the rise of first the global minotaur

41:32.640 --> 41:35.040
and then what you call techno feudalism.

41:35.040 --> 41:39.840
71, 2008, and then more recently, 2020.

41:39.840 --> 41:43.640
A new claim, really, that after 2008,

41:43.640 --> 41:47.640
Western capitalism has a 1929 moment.

41:47.640 --> 41:52.040
But then through the years of QE and through the pandemic,

41:52.040 --> 41:55.040
we basically see the end of capitalism as we know it.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.040
Can you explain why all this money printing

41:57.040 --> 42:00.840
that's primarily going to the top 0.01% or whatever we want to say,

42:00.840 --> 42:02.840
why does that mean the end of capitalism

42:02.840 --> 42:04.040
and the transition to something else?

42:04.040 --> 42:07.040
You see, it depends on how you define capitalism.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.440
Different people, I have a Marxist definition of capitalism,

42:10.440 --> 42:11.840
but not everybody does.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.840
Some people think, oh, the marketplace, buying and selling,

42:14.840 --> 42:16.840
not having the state telling you what to buy

42:16.840 --> 42:18.040
and how much to pay for it.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.840
That's capitalism. No, it's not.

42:19.840 --> 42:23.840
Capitalism is a system based on the private ownership

42:23.840 --> 42:29.240
of the essential means of production

42:29.240 --> 42:32.440
and a system which is predicated on profit

42:32.440 --> 42:34.640
that comes out of surplus value,

42:34.640 --> 42:38.440
exploitation of labor, of wage labor, and markets.

42:38.440 --> 42:42.240
The whole point about the transition from feudalism to capitalism

42:42.240 --> 42:46.840
was that you had had the process of commodification of land

42:46.840 --> 42:49.840
as a result of the enclosures, getting rid of the peasants,

42:49.840 --> 42:51.440
and commodification of labor.

42:51.440 --> 42:55.440
During feudalism, land and labor didn't have markets.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.440
Work has worked, but they couldn't quit.

42:57.440 --> 42:59.440
They didn't receive a wage just at the feudal lords

42:59.440 --> 43:03.040
and the sheriff over to collect rents from them.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.440
So markets and profits.

43:04.440 --> 43:07.840
There are two pylons on which capitalism sits.

43:07.840 --> 43:14.840
Both of them are now optional and actually a sideshow.

43:14.840 --> 43:17.440
Instead of profits, you have central bank money

43:17.440 --> 43:20.040
combined with cloud rents.

43:20.040 --> 43:23.240
The 40% of the price you pay on Amazon

43:23.240 --> 43:25.840
but retained by Jeff Bezos.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.640
All the surpluses that private equity firms get.

43:29.640 --> 43:33.640
Remember, three companies, BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard,

43:33.640 --> 43:37.840
own 90% of all companies in the New York Stock Exchange.

43:37.840 --> 43:40.240
They don't make profits. They make rents.

43:40.240 --> 43:44.040
So you have rent replacing profit

43:44.040 --> 43:48.840
and Amazon.com-like companies, platforms, replacing markets.

43:48.840 --> 43:53.040
Amazon.com, Alibaba, Uber, they are not markets.

43:53.040 --> 43:57.240
They are platforms where trading takes place, buying and selling

43:57.240 --> 43:59.240
outside the marketplace.

43:59.440 --> 44:01.640
They are like digital fiefdoms

44:01.640 --> 44:06.040
owned by a techno feudal lord who collects rents.

44:06.040 --> 44:08.440
Remember, Uber doesn't have cars.

44:08.440 --> 44:11.640
In the same way that the landlord didn't participate in production,

44:11.640 --> 44:13.040
he simply collected.

44:13.040 --> 44:16.440
That's what Uber does. That's what Airbnb does.

44:16.440 --> 44:18.640
That's what Amazon.com does.

44:18.640 --> 44:21.840
So if you replace the two pylons of capitalism

44:21.840 --> 44:25.840
with rent, cloud rent primarily, and digital platforms,

44:25.840 --> 44:31.240
and all that is founded on a foundation of cloud capital,

44:31.240 --> 44:33.640
what you end up is something which is not my capitalism.

44:33.640 --> 44:35.240
No, no, we could have called it capitalism.

44:35.240 --> 44:40.040
I could have called the book digital capitalism.

44:40.040 --> 44:42.240
I could have called it cloud capitalism.

44:42.240 --> 44:45.640
I could have called it rentier capitalism.

44:45.640 --> 44:48.040
Some people, some of my colleagues like Guy Standing,

44:48.040 --> 44:50.440
called it rentier capitalism.

44:50.440 --> 44:53.240
But you see, I think it's important to ditch the word capitalism.

44:53.240 --> 44:57.640
Why? Because if this was the 1770s,

44:57.640 --> 45:00.240
and we were talking about the state of the world,

45:00.240 --> 45:01.840
what was going on then?

45:01.840 --> 45:06.640
Capitalism was already upending and undermining feudalism,

45:06.640 --> 45:08.240
taking over from feudalism.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.840
We could have called the new system,

45:10.840 --> 45:12.040
instead of calling it capitalism,

45:12.040 --> 45:14.640
we could have called it industrial feudalism.

45:14.640 --> 45:16.840
But that would have robbed us of the opportunity

45:16.840 --> 45:19.440
to concentrate our mind that this is a great transformation.

45:19.440 --> 45:21.040
This is not feudalism anymore.

45:21.040 --> 45:22.640
Even though it would have been technically correct

45:22.640 --> 45:26.840
to call it industrial feudalism or capital feudalism.

45:26.840 --> 45:28.640
For the same reason,

45:28.640 --> 45:32.040
I'm making the controversial claim that this is not capitalism anymore,

45:32.040 --> 45:34.640
even though it is a result of the triumph of capital.

45:34.640 --> 45:37.640
Before we go to the next question, the thing about Amazon,

45:37.640 --> 45:39.040
I think can often be understated.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.040
People think, oh, it's like you say,

45:41.040 --> 45:43.040
these aren't necessarily market transactions.

45:43.040 --> 45:44.440
It even goes beyond that to an extent.

45:44.440 --> 45:47.440
So for instance, I'm sure people watching and listening

45:47.440 --> 45:49.840
is just familiar with the Amazon basics range.

45:49.840 --> 45:52.440
You get a product which looks almost exactly the same

45:52.440 --> 45:55.240
as another one, but it's 30% cheaper or whatever.

45:55.240 --> 45:57.240
Those products are created precisely

45:57.240 --> 46:00.440
because they have the analytics to look at the most profitable products

46:00.440 --> 46:04.440
with the best margins, with the highest volumes sold,

46:04.440 --> 46:07.040
lowest customer returns, and they say,

46:07.040 --> 46:08.440
let's make exactly the same thing.

46:08.440 --> 46:12.840
So they don't just own the keys in terms of can I enter

46:12.840 --> 46:15.840
the town square to sell my goods and services.

46:15.840 --> 46:19.240
They also have data that the sellers don't have themselves.

46:19.240 --> 46:19.840
Of course.

46:19.840 --> 46:20.840
That is the whole point.

46:20.840 --> 46:22.040
It's incredible.

46:22.040 --> 46:22.840
Same with Uber.

46:22.840 --> 46:23.640
Yeah, incredible.

46:23.640 --> 46:29.040
Now, why can't Uber drivers get together and create their own app?

46:29.040 --> 46:32.440
Well, they could, but that app would not have all the data

46:32.440 --> 46:36.640
that Uber has on you and me, including their drivers.

46:36.640 --> 46:41.240
So it is this cloud capital, the algorithm,

46:41.240 --> 46:46.840
to put it this way, the algorithm which creates the land,

46:46.840 --> 46:51.240
the digital land, where you must be in order to survive

46:51.240 --> 46:57.240
as a capitalist and therefore a vassal or as a cloud surf.

46:57.240 --> 46:59.840
Do you think we're going to have a war with China?

46:59.840 --> 47:01.240
Very much so.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.240
Very much so.

47:02.240 --> 47:11.840
Every move that Biden is taking is one more step closer to some kind of confrontation.

47:11.840 --> 47:15.040
Of course, I hope I'm wrong.

47:15.040 --> 47:16.240
Maybe it won't happen.

47:16.240 --> 47:21.240
Maybe it will happen, but it is a clear and present danger.

47:21.240 --> 47:23.640
Because it seems to be something that people just underpriced,

47:23.640 --> 47:27.240
that the idea of a conflict between two powers

47:27.240 --> 47:30.840
as geopolitical influence shifts from the west to the east,

47:30.840 --> 47:32.240
so that can't happen.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.840
To me, it sounds like a recipe for disaster.

47:34.840 --> 47:36.440
It is.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.440
If you look at the nuclear war clock,

47:38.440 --> 47:41.240
it's much closer to midnight now than it ever was.

47:41.240 --> 47:48.040
So at least the nuclear scientists and the peace movement

47:48.040 --> 47:52.440
that are running that particular measure of the risk

47:52.440 --> 47:56.840
that we're facing as a species are not underselling it.

47:56.840 --> 48:01.240
And given techno feudalism's concentration in the western hemisphere

48:01.240 --> 48:04.840
and East Asia, does that mean Europe's over?

48:04.840 --> 48:06.440
Does that mean just Europe is finished?

48:06.440 --> 48:09.040
Yes, Europe is over.

48:09.040 --> 48:16.240
I was chatting with Andrews Manuel, the president of Mexico a few months ago,

48:16.240 --> 48:19.440
and we had this conversation.

48:19.440 --> 48:22.240
And he said, Yanis, look, as a Mexican,

48:22.240 --> 48:24.440
I'm closer to Europe than I am to the United States.

48:24.440 --> 48:27.640
Culturally, spiritually, politically, ideologically.

48:27.640 --> 48:30.240
But Europe is irrelevant to us.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.440
It's a BRICS.

48:31.440 --> 48:33.240
China, in other words, not a BRICS.

48:33.240 --> 48:36.640
The only thing that matters from the BRICS is the sea.

48:36.640 --> 48:42.040
China and our huge neighbor north of our border.

48:42.040 --> 48:45.640
And I see this wherever I go, and it makes perfect sense.

48:45.640 --> 48:51.840
Look, Aaron, let's just for a moment imagine with great hope

48:51.840 --> 48:55.640
that there is a peace process that starts for Ukraine tomorrow.

48:55.640 --> 49:00.040
It's a big table somewhere in the UN, Geneva, wherever.

49:00.040 --> 49:05.640
We know who will represent Ukraine, Zelensky, Russia, Putin, America,

49:05.640 --> 49:09.040
Biden, China, Xi, India, Modi.

49:09.040 --> 49:11.840
Who's going to represent Europe?

49:11.840 --> 49:13.440
You just ask yourself that question

49:13.440 --> 49:15.840
and then suddenly you realize how irrelevant Europe is.

49:15.840 --> 49:19.040
Because it used to be Merkel.

49:19.040 --> 49:22.040
Merkel had the political power and clout to do it.

49:22.040 --> 49:23.840
Schultz doesn't.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.240
Macron doesn't.

49:25.240 --> 49:26.640
Why?

49:26.640 --> 49:30.040
Not only because they are peepsqueaks compared to Merkel.

49:30.040 --> 49:31.240
They are.

49:31.240 --> 49:34.640
But because anything they say will be vetoed

49:34.640 --> 49:38.640
by the government of Poland, the government of Lithuania, Estonia,

49:38.640 --> 49:43.440
Finland, Sweden, who consider to them to be Putin's handmaidens,

49:43.440 --> 49:46.240
both Schultz and Macron.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.640
I'm not passing by your judgment.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.240
I'm simply describing.

49:49.240 --> 49:52.040
So the two countries that we have to pay for the reconstruction

49:52.040 --> 49:55.640
of Ukraine will not be allowed to represent the European Union

49:55.640 --> 49:56.640
in these negotiations.

49:56.640 --> 49:59.040
And so who will from the lion?

49:59.040 --> 50:02.840
I mean, she is only there because she failed as a minister

50:02.840 --> 50:05.640
in Merkel's cabinet and Merkel wanted to get rid of her

50:05.640 --> 50:08.040
and sent her to Brussels because in Brussels

50:08.040 --> 50:10.040
you can't hear them scream.

50:10.040 --> 50:13.040
Remember the line from Morgan.

50:13.040 --> 50:15.240
So Europe is politically.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.840
This political paralysis reflects the fact

50:17.840 --> 50:19.640
that we don't have any cloud capital.

50:19.640 --> 50:22.040
Yeah. Well, I would add as well.

50:22.040 --> 50:24.840
Europe's demographic pyramid is a nightmare.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.040
I mean, China's isn't great.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.240
Europe's is a nightmare.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.640
If you include obviously the Eastern Central Europe.

50:29.640 --> 50:31.040
Energy resources.

50:31.040 --> 50:32.840
You know that. That's what I insist.

50:32.840 --> 50:34.440
Cloud capital. Geography.

50:34.440 --> 50:35.640
It is cloud capital.

50:35.640 --> 50:36.640
Nothing else.

50:36.640 --> 50:40.240
Everything else we could have gotten out of.

50:40.240 --> 50:45.040
If you don't have a competitor to Google, a competitor to Uber,

50:45.040 --> 50:48.440
a competitor to Facebook, a competitor to Apple,

50:48.440 --> 50:52.840
a competitor to Amazon.com, if every German

50:52.840 --> 50:57.040
or Italian or French or British producer has to go through

50:57.040 --> 50:59.640
those cloud lists in order to sell their stuff.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.640
Even in Europe.

51:01.640 --> 51:06.040
And you know, Amazon makes 42 billion every year

51:06.040 --> 51:11.640
only in Europe and pays zero, zero tax, zero.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.640
Well, you're gone. You're finished.

51:13.640 --> 51:15.040
It's interesting as well with Europe

51:15.040 --> 51:16.840
because recently the sort of spokespeople

51:16.840 --> 51:19.640
and this isn't this might sound sort of like little England

51:19.640 --> 51:20.640
or something. It's not meant to be.

51:20.640 --> 51:22.240
It's just an observation.

51:22.240 --> 51:25.240
The sort of spokespersons of the last two years of Europe

51:25.240 --> 51:28.840
in the whole Ukraine, Russia conflict

51:28.840 --> 51:31.440
have really been statespeople from smaller countries.

51:31.440 --> 51:34.640
So this lady, Kaia Callas, I think, from Estonia,

51:34.640 --> 51:37.440
she's speaking on behalf of Europe

51:37.440 --> 51:41.240
and you think, well, then Europe must be buggered

51:41.240 --> 51:45.840
because if you've got, you can't have Sanamarin or Callas

51:45.840 --> 51:49.040
speaking on the behalf of the German, the French, the Italian,

51:49.040 --> 51:50.640
the British, the Spanish people

51:50.640 --> 51:52.440
with regards to big foreign policy choices

51:52.440 --> 51:54.040
because when push comes to shove,

51:54.040 --> 51:55.640
they're going to say, sod off.

51:55.640 --> 51:57.840
I don't know who you are. I've never seen you before.

51:57.840 --> 52:00.640
But within the media discourse, they've got, she's so brave.

52:00.640 --> 52:02.040
She might go work for NATO.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.840
She'll be the general secretary or whatever.

52:03.840 --> 52:05.240
We are deferring to NATO.

52:05.240 --> 52:06.440
The EU has gone.

52:06.440 --> 52:07.640
It's been replaced by NATO.

52:07.640 --> 52:08.840
Exactly.

52:08.840 --> 52:11.840
Whom we didn't know his name until the war in Ukraine.

52:11.840 --> 52:14.240
Suddenly he's running Europe and Callas.

52:14.240 --> 52:18.040
Look, I wouldn't mind if a woman, young woman from a small country

52:18.040 --> 52:19.440
represented me as European.

52:19.440 --> 52:22.240
I'd love that. Do you know what I mind?

52:22.240 --> 52:25.440
If you ask her, so what's the end game?

52:25.440 --> 52:29.440
Define victory in the war in Ukraine.

52:29.440 --> 52:33.440
The only logical answer consistent with what she wants and says

52:33.440 --> 52:36.040
is to take Moscow.

52:36.040 --> 52:41.040
Because she's talking about dragging Putin to the International Court.

52:41.040 --> 52:43.240
I would like all these bastards to be dragged to the International Court,

52:43.240 --> 52:46.040
including Tony Blair, right?

52:46.040 --> 52:48.040
Of course. Of course, I'd love that.

52:48.040 --> 52:50.240
But how are you going to drag Putin to the International Court?

52:50.240 --> 52:52.040
You have to take Moscow.

52:52.040 --> 52:53.440
There's no other way.

52:53.440 --> 52:57.640
Or you're going to have to incite a coup in Moscow

52:57.640 --> 52:59.440
that will bring about regime change.

52:59.440 --> 53:02.840
If that happens, because Putin has killed off all the progressives,

53:02.840 --> 53:05.640
whoever takes over from Putin will be worse than Putin.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.640
So Callas, Miss Callas,

53:07.640 --> 53:10.640
can you please tell me what your end game is?

53:10.640 --> 53:14.240
Her answer terrifies me.

53:14.240 --> 53:16.040
That's the problem I have with Miss Callas.

53:16.040 --> 53:20.040
There's this huge disconnect between foreign policy and defense preferences

53:20.040 --> 53:22.040
and the electorates, like the electorate don't matter.

53:22.040 --> 53:25.040
450, 400 million Europeans do not matter.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.640
Here's the final question.

53:26.640 --> 53:31.640
You say that we've seen the eclipse of capitalism really since 2008.

53:31.640 --> 53:34.240
You also think we've seen the death of liberalism

53:34.240 --> 53:36.640
and the idea of the liberal individual.

53:36.640 --> 53:38.840
What does that have to do with card capital?

53:38.840 --> 53:43.240
The whole point about liberalism is the celebration of the individual

53:43.240 --> 53:46.240
as a source of legitimacy.

53:46.240 --> 53:51.240
A country, a political system is legitimate in the liberal mind

53:51.240 --> 53:58.640
to the extent that it represents the autonomous will of individuals.

53:58.640 --> 53:59.640
Remember Thatcher?

53:59.640 --> 54:00.840
There is no such thing as a society.

54:00.840 --> 54:04.040
It's only individuals, families and individuals.

54:04.040 --> 54:08.040
But if the individual has a relationship with cloud capital,

54:08.040 --> 54:09.840
with Amazon's Alexa,

54:09.840 --> 54:12.640
whereby the individual trains Alexa to train the individual

54:12.640 --> 54:15.240
to train Alexa to train the individual to train Alexa,

54:15.240 --> 54:17.440
to put into the individual's mind what he wants,

54:17.440 --> 54:19.440
or she wants, or it wants,

54:19.440 --> 54:21.840
where is this autonomy?

54:21.840 --> 54:26.040
Hagek, the greatest guru of Thatcher,

54:26.040 --> 54:28.440
used to celebrate the market as a mechanism

54:28.440 --> 54:32.040
that not only finds the right prices to equilibrate demand and supply,

54:32.040 --> 54:36.640
but the mechanism that actually is allowing us to develop our own character.

54:36.640 --> 54:38.840
He used to say, you know, I go into a shop,

54:38.840 --> 54:41.640
come out with something I didn't even know I wanted.

54:41.640 --> 54:45.440
So the marketplace shapes me as a person,

54:45.440 --> 54:50.040
as an autonomous liberal individual on whom

54:50.040 --> 54:52.840
the whole liberal project is based.

54:52.840 --> 54:56.640
But if it's not the market, but a centrally planned system

54:56.640 --> 54:58.640
that the Soviet Union would love to have had,

54:58.640 --> 55:00.840
because that's what Amazon.com is,

55:00.840 --> 55:04.440
it's a centrally planned machine that belongs to one man,

55:04.440 --> 55:08.640
who could be Jeff Bezos or could be Joseph Stalin,

55:08.640 --> 55:13.440
then where is the liberal individual in this gone, in a buff of smoke?

55:13.440 --> 55:17.040
So basically this idea that there's a tyranny really of big tech,

55:17.040 --> 55:19.240
and it doesn't just inflect economies,

55:19.240 --> 55:21.840
but are sort of very psychic in psychology.

55:21.840 --> 55:24.040
I mean, that's a big claim.

55:24.040 --> 55:27.840
But it is Aaron, look, I was talking to some students of mine,

55:27.840 --> 55:31.240
a couple of years ago, and young people,

55:31.240 --> 55:33.840
who wanted a reference for me to find a job,

55:33.840 --> 55:38.240
to go and study post-graduate level,

55:38.240 --> 55:41.440
and I saw this, I saw this in full technical color.

55:41.440 --> 55:43.640
You know, they were angst-ridden, because they know,

55:43.640 --> 55:46.040
that when they go to get interviewed, for whatever,

55:46.040 --> 55:49.240
to go to university, but primarily to get a job, a good job,

55:49.240 --> 55:52.840
the interviewer will have checked their social media presence, footprint.

55:52.840 --> 55:58.640
Every photo that they upload, every video on TikTok, at midnight,

55:58.640 --> 56:02.040
they know, or they assume, will be seen.

56:02.040 --> 56:05.640
So there's no demarcation between work and play.

56:05.640 --> 56:10.240
And they are constantly trying to imagine what kind of self

56:10.240 --> 56:14.240
they should create in their own bosom, in their own soul,

56:14.240 --> 56:18.640
that will appeal to Google, or to Facebook, or to a good employer.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.840
That's the end of the liberal individual.

56:20.840 --> 56:23.640
To conclude, it sounds like we've returned to feudal Europe,

56:23.640 --> 56:27.040
but with a touch of the Stasi, doesn't sound good.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.040
I mean, that's a good explanation.

56:28.040 --> 56:30.040
But the Stasi would have loved Cloud Capital.

56:30.040 --> 56:32.040
They would be kicking themselves,

56:32.040 --> 56:35.840
because they created all these amazing mechanisms for surveillance.

56:35.840 --> 56:39.040
And this, we volunteered our information to this.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.840
Wiki Stasi.

56:40.840 --> 56:43.040
On that note, Yannis, it's a great book.

56:43.040 --> 56:44.240
Thanks so much for joining us today.

56:44.240 --> 56:46.040
Thank you so much.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.640
Hello, I'm Yannis Varoufakis.

56:47.640 --> 56:52.440
I'm at Novara Media, and I have a message for you.

56:52.440 --> 56:59.440
The best way of underpinning any kind of potential resistance

56:59.440 --> 57:03.040
to a very toxic establishment,

57:03.040 --> 57:07.040
without being populist anti-establishment,

57:07.040 --> 57:12.440
and by supporting good, irrational, humanist causes,

57:12.440 --> 57:16.640
is to support left-wing media like Novara Media.

57:16.640 --> 57:20.840
Novara Media and all such media need your support,

57:20.840 --> 57:24.840
because they certainly do not have the support of the establishment.

57:24.840 --> 57:26.440
Κάπη δήμ.
