0	3440	The conservative view is just that like the winners of the winners and the losers of the losers
3440	7920	and that's fair because that's based on competition and competition is its own
7920	11920	process of fairness. For those on the left it's like well we should make sure that if people do
11920	15760	lose they're protected in some way and that actually they have more opportunities to become
15760	19680	winners and that the winners pay a little bit more to make sure that society works a little bit
19680	24480	better. Whereas the Marxist or the socialist view should be there shouldn't be winners and losers
24480	29680	and people that make the rules. It should be we all make the rules together. It's a completely
29680	39200	different way of organising society. The game is rigged. That's something that people on the
39200	45520	left have been saying for a decade obviously a lot longer but that particular phrase really goes back
45520	51680	to the mid-2010s and for a long time it felt like if you said it you were shouting in to avoid nobody
51680	58480	was listening. Fast forward to 2023 and virtually everyone in politics on the left or the right
58560	64800	accepts that the game is rigged. That a tiny elite benefits while the rest of us lose from the status
64800	71440	quo. The establishment does so well at the cost of everyone else if you will. But even though
71440	76720	there's agreement about the game being rigged that doesn't mean there's agreement on what to do next.
76720	82400	Clearly people on the left and on the right have very different proposals going forward.
83360	88960	And I think the reason why there is a gap between those two sides is basically because
88960	95760	there's a different reading on what power is, who has it and how things change. Now for people on
95760	102320	the left financial and economic power is directly translated into political, social and cultural
102320	106720	power. It might be comforting to think we live in a meritocracy or that political representatives
106720	111200	are there on merit and they represent the will of the people but fundamentally they're there to
111200	118240	reflect vested powerful economic interests. And that is exactly why we got Grace Blakely on for
118240	123760	today's show. Grace is an economist, she's a writer, she also does loads of media stuff from
123760	130160	talk TV to the BBC and Jeremy Vine. She's a fantastic young economist and her interests have
130160	137600	always focused on finance and the kinds of power which emerges from it. Grace, welcome to downstream.
137600	141120	Thank you so much for having me. I have been waiting for this conversation for so long.
142080	145280	I have missed you very, very much too. It's been a while.
145280	147600	It's been a really long time. It's been a really long time.
147600	151280	I feel like I haven't really seen that much since Covid.
151280	153920	Yeah, well I mean I went away. You went away, you've been writing a book?
153920	158240	Yeah, I wrote a book. I went away to write a book partly although I didn't spend that much time
158240	162080	writing my book. I spent a lot of time just wandering around Central America, surfing,
162880	168080	making trouble. And yeah, I got back like two months ago and now here I am, back in the Malay.
168080	171840	And you were obviously my first priority. Yeah, number one call.
171840	172480	Of course.
172480	174320	Navarro Media first. Exactly.
174320	179120	The Today program, second. You're obviously very left-wing.
179120	180640	Obviously. So I've been told.
180640	183360	Yeah, you're obviously very left-wing in terms of your economic commitments.
184800	189200	But you're a well-spoken Oxford graduate from Basingstoke, from the home counties.
189600	197200	What happened between you being a fresh-faced Oxford graduate who went on to work at KPMG
198000	201040	and then having the kinds of political economic commitments you have now?
201040	203280	Was it something you had as a young person?
203280	203920	Yeah.
203920	206560	Did they intensify when you entered the labour market?
206560	210000	Was there a moment of intellectual revelation?
210960	212320	How does this trajectory look?
213040	215520	I think it's a combination of a lot of different things.
215520	218720	So it does kind of go back to when, it definitely goes back to when I was growing up
218720	222480	because I'm obviously from a posh, well-off background.
223360	228960	But my mum grew up on the council estate in Basingstoke and her dad was a hardcore communist
228960	231280	trade union organiser for the TGWU.
232240	233840	He was going over to Russia.
233840	235840	We had little busts of Lenin in the house.
235840	238160	My uncles are called Karl and Keir, both with a K,
239360	244000	properly into the whole interleftism from a very young age.
244960	249920	And my mum kind of took those values definitely along with her.
249920	253120	She had also like, she was the first in her family to go to university,
253120	257040	went to Cambridge, had a terrible experience of Cambridge because everyone was like,
257040	259440	you know, treated her terribly because they were all, she was like,
259440	261520	I arrived and everyone was like, oh, what school did you go to?
261520	265440	And she was like, I went to a comprehensive in Winklebury and they were like, what?
265440	272160	So kind of that, I think consolidated her left wing values and my dad ended up just kind of
272160	275280	falling into that sort of sort of field as well.
275280	278080	They ended up doing things like, you know, they traveled around the world
278080	282080	and did the Nicaragua solidarity campaign and eventually ended up doing very boring
282080	283120	kind of professional things.
283120	286560	No offense mum dad, I love you, doing kind of boring professional executive coaching
286560	289680	and that sort of stuff, but retained those like left wing values
289680	291760	and always raised me along those lines.
291760	294720	I mean, if they hadn't, my granddad was still there all the time and he would have been like,
294720	295280	what are you doing?
295280	296240	Like, what are you talking about?
296960	298400	So I was always like really into politics.
298400	300080	We had a very political household.
300160	303280	I did things like, you know, I wrote for the new statesman, right?
303280	306880	That was something that I did like three or four years ago, maybe a bit more than that
306880	307440	five years ago.
308320	312480	And when I was like 14, I had a letter published in the new statesman talking about like,
312480	315760	I can't remember something to do with, you know, the transition from brown to Blair
315760	316800	and like what needed to be done.
316800	319920	And that was like, my granddad had that framed and put on the wall.
319920	323360	So there are all these like political values that there were in our household.
324160	328800	But I think the second thing was that I was always in trouble.
329360	333040	So like, I was like, you know, I went to all these fancy schools, but I was expelled from
333040	338480	two of them, suspended like constantly, just was constantly in trouble, like with everyone.
338480	341200	And I mean, it was relatively easy to get into trouble if you go to private school.
341200	343520	I'm not saying that I was like, you know, there's tear away, but like,
344160	345920	I did some pretty crazy stuff.
345920	349440	And like, I never really, never really kind of understood the boundaries of what I
349440	353600	should and shouldn't do always kind of felt like, you know, rules are stupid.
353600	357440	And that gave me that kind of rebellious spirit, I think that went with like the
357520	358480	left wing values.
359440	362160	But I was never like, I was always like, oh, I'm going to, I don't know,
362160	367600	go and like work for the UN or like, I don't know, maybe like be a politician
367600	370640	or something that was fairly like middle of the road.
370640	376720	It was only after I think, you know, so I did this PPE degree at Oxford and it was very like,
377280	380960	you know, I think I learned more in my African studies masters
380960	382640	about like the way the world actually works.
382640	383760	And I did my PPE degree.
383760	386160	So PPE degree was very liberal, very down the line.
386240	391040	Just for people watching, PPE is the, is the degree that all the sort of opinion makers
391040	397280	and politicians in the UK do, from David Cameron to pretty much every major BBC
397280	399440	broadcast journalist, Nick Robinson and whatnot.
399440	400720	Politics, philosophy and economics.
400720	406880	It was created to educate the kind of the people who would be going on to govern the
406880	411760	British Empire, basically, it's supposed to have everything that you need to be inculcated
411760	415360	into the values of like the elite, basically, and all of the kind of reference points that
415360	418160	you would need to be able to kind of converse with, with those people.
418160	421120	So it's, you know, not particularly, it's obviously not radical at all.
421120	423360	It's like very mainstream and other education.
424240	426720	And as I said, I wanted to kind of go work for the UN or doing something in the kind of
426720	428960	international sphere, liberal do goodery stuff.
428960	430400	So I went to do an African studies degree.
430400	431280	So you were a Lib?
431280	432160	Yeah, basically.
432160	434240	Yeah, I would have said I was like a left Lib.
434240	439920	I was like, you know, like, I want to like do things to change the system and make things
439920	442800	work slightly better for, you know, those who don't come out.
442880	444160	Like make poverty history.
444160	445040	Oh, 100%.
445040	446800	I was totally into that sort of stuff.
446800	448160	Yeah, that was like totally my identity.
449120	454080	Yeah, did my African studies masters realized how utterly screwed up that entire world is.
454080	460080	So like I did a bunch of research and like, you know, traveled quite a lot and met lots of
460080	466160	people in the UN and in NGOs and whatever and realized how dark things really are there and
466160	472000	quite how, you know, how when you are in a job that is working to kind of pick up the pieces
472720	478160	from a system that is fundamentally messed up at like the very highest levels, it can only
478160	479360	create kind of disillusionment.
480240	482400	So then I was like, right, okay, well, we need to change the system.
483120	484720	I started thinking about politics.
484720	487280	I initially was like, I'm going to go organize for the greens.
487280	490560	And I did a little bit of that when I was in my masters.
490560	493280	Then the 2015 election came around.
493280	496160	And I think that was when a lot of stuff started changing for me.
496160	499840	I remember like sitting in an Oxford college when Ed Miliband lost.
499840	501120	I hadn't even voted for Ed Miliband.
501120	504160	I had voted green and just being like, what is going on?
504160	506720	Like how can we be, how can this happen?
506720	509840	Like how can we be going down this road of just like more and more austerity when it's
509840	511040	just so obviously wrong?
511040	515440	And, you know, the whole ideology that it's built on is so obviously kind of corrupt.
516320	518080	And then Corbinism happened.
518080	521680	It was actually my boyfriend at the time who was like, oh, have you heard about this Corbin guy?
521680	523360	He'd be, he seems quite cool.
523360	530160	Wow. So this guy is actually a pivotal figure in your career, personal, political trajectory.
530800	534320	Who knows, maybe it would have happened anyway, but he was like, you should look into this.
534320	536400	I looked into it and then I was like, this is amazing.
536400	541280	Started going on to all the events and like getting much more involved in the Labour Party.
541920	545200	And then that was kind of when I was like, right, okay, this is what I want to do.
545200	550960	Like I want to get involved in this world, see, you know, how I can be useful.
550960	553600	And that started by doing policy.
554480	557680	So after I'd left university, I had this stint at KPMG.
557920	562320	And yeah, that was working in their like management consulting,
562320	564160	arm doing kind of public sector work.
565040	565600	And what was that?
565600	566400	What was that like?
566400	567600	It was interesting, right?
567600	572720	Because like the projects I was working on at the time, it was in Greater Manchester
572720	575440	and they were kind of doing like loss leading work.
575440	579040	So the idea was that you would, you know, not make huge amount of profit.
579040	583600	You would work with these new combined authorities and try and like develop to product,
583600	585520	develop product that you would sell elsewhere.
585520	587760	So at the time it felt quite interesting.
587760	590160	I was like learning a lot about it was all to do with service delivery.
590160	594480	So it was, you know, like everything, you know, there was a lot of work on like people with
594480	598800	complex needs and combined dependency and how people who interact with lots of different services,
598800	603280	like, you know, children's services, social care, the criminal justice system,
603280	606720	all these different sorts of things, like how you needed early intervention to kind of deal
606720	608480	with those those sorts of issues.
608480	610960	And obviously it was all couched in the language of like how you could save money.
610960	612960	But me coming into this is like completely green.
612960	614320	I was like, wow, this is fascinating.
614320	616080	Like this is how things actually work.
616080	620000	Eventually I kind of realized, oh no, we are literally developing a product that we are
620000	624000	going to be selling to, to other combined authorities as a way of making money.
624000	627120	And it just kind of started feeling more and more alienating.
627120	628640	Also, I wasn't very good at it.
628640	632800	I was good at the research, like all the kind of looking into like what works and how we
632800	633840	should be designing these things.
633840	635280	But I wasn't very good at selling.
635280	639280	And I wasn't very good at client interactions or any of that sort of stuff.
640400	643280	I don't really know why probably for the same reasons I kept getting expelled.
643280	648480	But anyway, I then left, decided I wanted to go do think tanky work so I could go into policy,
648480	650000	maybe from their politics.
650000	652400	Started, I had a great time.
652400	657600	That was when, you know, I met you guys and started, yeah, like doing more media,
657600	661920	doing more writing, like getting much more involved in like actual organizing.
662480	668400	And it was just kind of like, you know, all uphill with a lot of downs as well from there.
669280	670560	Did you ever subscribe to Tatler?
671120	672400	I never subscribed to Tatler.
672400	673840	No, never.
673840	676000	You've never, have you ever read an issue of Tatler?
676000	677600	I don't think so.
677600	679920	I'm not saying that I've never read like a fancy magazine.
679920	684480	I'm pretty sure I've read like Vogue or whatever, but I was never really that, that into it.
684480	686080	Calls and hounds.
686080	687920	No, I'm not that posh.
687920	695040	But are there any people in your sort of, you know, your ambit, like your, your parents' friends?
695040	696080	Oh, I mean, at Oxford.
696080	700880	Yeah, I met some of the like poshest people that you could imagine at Oxford.
700880	707120	Like just unimaginable amounts of not just like wealth, but also privilege.
707120	712160	And, you know, when I went to Oxford, I was like, because, you know, I went to these private schools,
712160	715440	but ended up going to City Farm College, like, you know, obviously had friends who
715440	716960	went to state school, that sort of stuff.
716960	718800	I was like, oh yeah, I'm really posh.
718800	724160	And then I went to Oxford and I was like, oh my God, I am like a commoner to these people.
725520	727520	They're all being like, where did you, like, where did you go to school?
728480	732320	Eaton, Cheltenham Ladies, Dullich, like all, they all knew each other.
732320	734400	That was like this massive group of people that all knew each other.
734400	736400	He was some of the people that go to those schools.
736400	738240	Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
738240	740000	Family was the first in their family or whatever.
740000	740720	It is amazing.
740720	741120	It's crazy.
741120	744000	I remember once I was reading something in the FT, this was,
744000	746160	it was just, no, it was the Telegraph in fact.
746800	750800	And it was like a, it was like an etiquette guide for Christmas.
751440	754160	And you shouldn't cheers and tap glasses.
755040	757520	And the author of the article said that was
758320	760000	LBC, little bit common.
761920	765120	So you said it like, especially with champagne glass, you shouldn't tap, right?
765120	767920	What you should do is when you say cheers, you just lift the glass, cheers.
767920	768480	Yeah.
768480	771200	And then, but the idea of like touching is just like very vulgar.
771200	771840	That's hilarious.
771840	774880	And I'm like, these people live in a dearful world.
774880	775360	So true.
775360	779680	I once heard someone say at Oxford, I think they were discussing like,
779680	782400	someone got a new boyfriend and they were asking lots of questions.
782400	784400	And one of the responses was, oh, don't worry, darling.
784400	787360	He's PLU, which was people like us.
789760	790960	Very, very concerning.
791680	792400	Yeah.
792400	793680	I mean, it's, it's weird.
793680	797280	Like it was funny because I spoke to my mom about this, about the same experience that
797280	797680	she'd had.
797680	800880	She actually came overtly from like a really working class background going to Cambridge
800880	805520	and just found the whole experience so utterly alienating that it was like
805520	807600	outside of her comprehension.
807600	811840	Whereas for me, I was kind of like, oh no, I see where I fit in, in this hierarchy.
811840	812800	And I'm like here.
813520	815840	And then there's all these people who know each other who are like here.
816480	822000	And there's this like, I mean, I remember at the time reading all of these like novels,
822000	826720	like, you know, like Fitzgerald and Evelyn Moore and stuff about like class systems in
826720	827600	the US and the UK.
828240	832080	And being like, oh my God, I suddenly understand this, this like from the outside looking in
832080	838480	at this world of like glitz and glamour and everyone seems so like put together and very
838560	843280	aware about how to play with power, like in friendship groups and like, you know, in
843280	844320	the world more generally.
844880	847600	And it's really like, it really hooks you.
847600	849200	It's really interesting to notice that happen.
850000	854240	So yeah, I definitely kind of, you know, experienced that when I was Oxford, but never
854240	857360	kind of never really fully inside, never really fully outside, I guess.
857360	859760	Do you think the left struggles to explain that?
859760	865760	Like, I feel for much of the public, you know, I say I'm middle class because I like
865760	868240	John Lewis and drink M&S gold brand tea.
868240	872160	And I think most of the public was, you know, I joke with my wife and I say, you know,
872160	874160	if the waitrose near us closes, we're moving.
874880	875120	Right.
875120	879840	And I say it mockingly and I, but I view those as like benchmarks of middle class,
879840	881040	like the nice things.
882080	884000	But I think for most of the public, that's the case.
884000	889840	They, they, they can't comprehend there is this quite big layer of people who
889840	894240	culturally, economically, socially, just in every single aspect of their lives,
894240	895840	they inhabit a different thought world.
895840	896080	Yeah.
898400	900000	Do you think the leftist fails to communicate that a bit?
901280	905840	The way I think about this, and this is actually potentially going to be something
905840	909360	I'm going to be writing about in the future, is that, you know, we,
910320	912480	we think of ourselves as living in this society, right?
912480	915760	That is characterized by, you know, winners and losers.
915760	919840	And we debate the boundaries of that game and how, you know,
919840	922880	the winners should be taxed and how the losers should be supported.
922960	926000	And everyone has a sense of where they sit in that game, you know, whether or not
926000	929200	they're like doing well, whether or not successful, attractive, whatever.
929200	932560	And we're all kind of competing on with one another to, to succeed.
932560	934800	And we have a view as to who's above us and who's below us.
935360	939120	But there's actually a set of people who are outside of the game altogether,
939120	940880	because they're basically the ones that make the rules.
942240	944880	And they are neither winners nor losers.
944880	949440	They are in a very real sense, kind of much more in control of actually the game itself
949440	950720	and how it works.
950720	957680	And a lot of our educational and cultural systems, a lot of the educational and cultural
957680	961920	systems that these people come through are designed to make them comfortable
961920	964880	with the idea that they are the ones that are in control and that set the rules.
965600	968960	So you'll often hear, and I have heard this from, from these people,
969520	976320	this idea that they are the kind of, you know, by default, the benevolent rulers of society,
976320	981280	whether that is just because they are genetically better or it's just because they happen to have
981280	985680	been, you know, inculturated into this, this particular way of being that allows them to
985680	987600	be the kind of guardians of society.
987600	991600	They do see society as divided into between people who kind of make the rules
991600	993040	and those who just play the game.
994240	997360	And I think that's probably something that maybe most people have an,
997360	1001920	like some sort of intuitive sense of, you know, the idea that we can, you know,
1001920	1004320	vote different people into power, but nothing's ever going to change.
1005200	1008800	But I don't really think it's something that we talk about overtly.
1008800	1011920	And I don't want it to sound kind of conspiratorial because I'm not saying that,
1011920	1015440	like, you know, we live in a world that's kind of governed by a few people sitting in a room
1015440	1016720	deciding who gets what.
1016720	1022480	But obviously, the institutions in which we, that kind of govern most of the interactions
1022480	1027040	that structure our lives, whether that's kind of corporations or political institutions,
1027040	1031440	public services, educational institutions, there are people in positions of power and
1031440	1037920	authority. And as our societies become more concentrated, as larger institutions have come
1037920	1042080	to govern much greater areas of social life, the people in positions of authority within
1042080	1047120	those powerful institutions have gained more control over what happens for everyone else.
1047120	1047920	So it's all about power.
1047920	1049200	Let's get into the nuts and bolts.
1049200	1049760	Sure.
1049760	1053120	And this is a talking point which the left hasn't really focused on.
1053120	1055760	I feel like we've left a lot of it to the right.
1057120	1060720	And often, you know, there's this thing which is, oh, if something's right-coded and the left
1060720	1062560	has to think and say and do the opposite.
1062560	1066400	I love that because it's always really fun, like, going on TV and people will be like,
1066400	1069120	right, we've brought you on to have this perspective on this subject.
1069120	1072640	And you come in and you're like, well, actually, the entire way that you've structured this
1072640	1074560	dichotomy is completely wrong.
1074560	1075840	The short circuit, don't they?
1075840	1076080	Yeah.
1076080	1077440	So I want to talk about ESG.
1078400	1081840	ESG, for those who don't know, stands for environmental, social and governance.
1082640	1086160	It's meant to represent the standard for investors to monitor how socially conscious
1086240	1086880	a business is.
1087920	1094320	For some, that has made it a kind of awoken a scorecard for investors.
1094320	1100560	You know, ESG is like woke top Trumps for various companies.
1100560	1101680	What's your read on ESG?
1102560	1107520	Maybe we should actually, maybe it would be helpful to kind of go back to that kind of
1107520	1111920	trichotomy I set up a second ago, which was like winners and losers and people who make the rules.
1111920	1118240	I think left and right often divide themselves based on different ideas about how we should
1118240	1119200	treat winners and losers.
1119200	1119600	Right.
1119600	1125680	So, you know, the right wing view would be like, we live in a free market society and
1125680	1128560	the only thing that should matter is which company makes the most profits.
1128560	1132400	So we shouldn't be forcing them to consider things like environmental, social,
1132400	1135440	governance, objectives, whatever the market decides who wins.
1135440	1137600	Or as the left would say, well, that's fine.
1137600	1141360	But actually the market kind of doesn't account for all the different factors that we do want
1141360	1142240	to account for.
1142240	1147680	We need to change the rules a bit to make sure that, you know, if you win, you don't do it at
1147680	1152160	the expense of other people or if you lose, then you're not kind of just left to starve or die or
1152160	1152960	whatever.
1152960	1156160	So we need to make the game, you know, played a slightly different way.
1157200	1162080	And, you know, that's basically the difference, I suppose, between kind of neoliberalism and
1162080	1163360	more progressive liberalism.
1164320	1169360	The thing I think that socialists should come in and say, or maybe we don't often, we always do
1169360	1175840	this, is actually to point out that the entire game is being played based on rules that have been,
1176480	1180240	you know, developed by someone else and in which, you know, working people are always going to be
1180240	1181360	designed to lose.
1181360	1185040	So ESG, the right will say, no, you want competitive markets.
1185040	1186400	This makes markets as competitive.
1186400	1192080	The left would say it helps us to deal with, you know, negative externalities that actually
1192080	1193520	make society more progressive.
1193520	1198160	And Marxists would come in and look at this and say, well, this is a way of shoring up the
1198160	1202000	legitimacy of a capitalist system that is fundamentally not based on free markets, is
1202000	1207760	actually based on the governance of society and control over society by huge corporations that
1207760	1214000	are able to exploit their workers and wreck the planet without any, really, any kind of pushback
1214000	1217760	from the state whatsoever, because the state itself is also largely influenced by those
1217760	1218880	corporate interests.
1218880	1224800	So ESG comes in as this kind of auto critique by the people who govern the system as a way of
1224800	1229040	saying, look, we know what we're doing and we're responsible and you can trust us to be able to
1229040	1231600	look after this system in your interests.
1231600	1236240	But there is absolutely no way that we will cede any of that control to you.
1236800	1240400	We will look after the system maybe in a more enlightened way.
1240400	1243680	We will consider some of the things you're talking about, but you're not ever going to
1243680	1246720	be able to actually be in the rooms where we make the rules.
1246720	1251760	And I think that's like what should differentiate a Marxist and a socialist from a progressive,
1251840	1257040	liberal or whatever, is actually saying, we don't just want to make the system a bit fairer,
1257040	1258400	we want to give people power.
1259760	1263440	Just on ESG as well, it's a huge money making opportunity.
1263440	1269360	So BlackRock's ESG Aware Fund charges fees five times higher than its core S&P 500 fund.
1269920	1273440	And ESG investment funds have 43% higher fees than conventional investment funds.
1273440	1277600	So they make more money, we'll talk about the kinds of companies involved in this,
1277600	1279520	they make more money around these products.
1279520	1283120	And like you say, it also fulfills a really important political role.
1284560	1287840	But it also means there's tremendous power that's now being
1288960	1291840	concentrated amongst the financial elite.
1291840	1296560	And like you say, before that was a concentration of economic and political power
1296560	1298160	based upon the idea that greed is good.
1298160	1301760	Gordon Gekko is the kind of main character archetype of the 1980s.
1301760	1303600	That was what our society was.
1303600	1306480	It does feel like in the last, well, citizens of the global financial crisis,
1307040	1310960	as Anglophone elites are trying to resurrect political legitimacy, consent,
1311680	1317280	they're having to change that archetype a bit more to caring enlightened characters.
1317280	1320560	Now, do you think they've been compelled to do that?
1321520	1326720	Is it just them trying to exploit an opportunity from, you know,
1326720	1329520	do good in liberals who would like them to be like that?
1331520	1332800	Where's it coming from?
1332800	1334960	Because it does get that criticism from the right as well.
1334960	1337600	And they would say, I don't agree with it.
1337600	1339360	I don't agree with the point behind it.
1339360	1341440	But it's coherent, which is, well, look,
1341440	1345040	private enterprise is designed to first look after customers,
1345040	1348080	secondly, look after shareholders, thirdly, look after workers,
1348080	1349200	forget the rest of this crap.
1350080	1352160	So where has it come from?
1352160	1355360	And why has it become so prominent in the last, say, 10 years?
1355360	1359360	So to understand where it comes from, you know, I think we need to look,
1359360	1361440	we've been talking kind of, well, I've been talking kind of
1361520	1366640	quite abstractly in terms of structures and like, you know, and classes and that sort of thing.
1366640	1371200	We need to think about how the people in positions of power, you know,
1371200	1374320	who have the capacity to kind of make decisions that will affect everyone else,
1374320	1376160	what they're thinking about when, you know,
1376160	1378480	developing and implementing things like ESG.
1378480	1384320	Now, it is obviously very clear to anyone with eyes that capitalism has,
1384320	1389040	at least since the global financial crisis, if not really since 1980s,
1389040	1395040	been suffering from both a crisis of kind of legitimacy and really kind of a crisis
1395040	1397680	which is pitting capitalism against democracy on the one hand,
1397680	1403040	and also a crisis of kind of reproduction of accumulation, basically,
1403040	1410400	in which it is becoming harder and harder to produce the stuff that we rely on to survive.
1410400	1414000	And that, you know, capitalism relies on for constant growth,
1414000	1418960	either because of, you know, climate imperatives, or because of collapse in productivity,
1418960	1421360	or because of, you know, escalating inequality,
1421360	1424080	all these sorts of reasons that play into the kind of long-term
1424880	1428720	productivity crisis that we've had and the associated financial
1428720	1431120	breakdowns that have come alongside that.
1431120	1434000	So there's this kind of legitimacy crisis and a kind of, you know,
1434000	1438640	a crisis of the reproduction of capitalist productive relations and social relations.
1439200	1444080	And if you are a member of, you know, the ruling class, let's say you are, I don't know,
1444720	1448160	Larry Fink, and you're the head of BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers,
1448880	1452560	and you, as, you know, the head of one of the world's largest asset managers,
1452560	1455840	have a portfolio, well, you don't have a portfolio, you will have a portfolio yourself,
1455840	1460480	but you govern a company that has lots of portfolios that invests in asset classes across the whole
1460480	1466880	economy that has a stake in pretty much every, you know, large firm in, say, the S&P 500,
1466880	1469840	just by virtue of the fact that you're so big, you have to be that diversified.
1469840	1470960	And it is almost all of them, right?
1470960	1476640	Yeah, yeah, totally, yeah. You're thinking, right, well, if my business is going to continue to grow,
1476640	1481760	I need not just, not the kind of, you know, the dynamics that you might want if you're a hedge fund,
1481760	1487200	which is lots of, you know, massive up and down, ups and downs, lots of crises that can be exploited
1487200	1492640	to, you know, make use of arbitrage strategies and make clever quick trades that are going to
1492640	1497280	make you money in the short term. You want really kind of long-term stable growth, you want
1497280	1501680	corporations to grow, you want corporate profits to grow, and you want people to be able to accumulate
1501680	1507040	savings that they can invest in your assets. And more generally speaking, you know, you want
1507040	1513200	a society that is characterized by relative stability. And that is true across a whole range
1513200	1517680	of industries, it's true across, you know, the political class in general, who if you were to
1517680	1522320	look at it from a kind of Marxist perspective would see their role as not just like maintaining
1522400	1527280	individual capitalist enterprises, but actually maintaining the broad conditions that allow
1527280	1530960	capitalist social relations, capitalist reproductive relations to reproduce themselves.
1532320	1536640	Then, yeah, you know, you are going to be worried about things like climate breakdown,
1536640	1541360	because that threatens, you want all of those levels, it threatens the legitimacy of the system
1541360	1545840	because people are going to get scared, people are going to die, it threatens the,
1546800	1550880	the relations of production, it threatens, you know, the relationships between
1550880	1554640	different social classes. I mean, if you look at the global economy and the way in which
1555440	1559200	climate breakdown is like to affect different parts of it, we're going to see breakdowns in
1559200	1562800	global supply chains of the kind that we saw during the pandemic much more frequently.
1564000	1568800	And it threatens the kind of very foundations of accumulation, just because like it's going to
1568800	1573760	be harder to get things out of the ground and like create the crops that people need to survive and
1573760	1577440	all those different sorts of things. So that's one argument, which is that ESG is about like a
1577440	1582400	long-term rational self-interest on the behalf of the capitalist class. But the companies with
1582400	1586320	the best ESG scores in America, and I find this fascinating, and right now it's a right-wing
1586320	1590800	talking point, but on this, they're correct. The companies with the best ESG scores in America
1590800	1597200	are Google, Microsoft and the Bank of America. Meanwhile, Tesla, which produces literally,
1597200	1601440	you know, electric vehicles, and you might agree, I disagree obviously with their labor standards,
1601440	1605520	and we need to have a conversation about using recycled lithium for EVs, but whatever.
1605520	1611040	EVs are clearly better. We want more public transport. EVs are clearly better than the cars
1611040	1616080	that people were producing, you know, 20 years ago and for the century preceding that. And the idea
1616080	1622080	that the Bank of America has a much better ESG score than Tesla. And that's a right-wing talking
1622080	1626160	point. And I'm just like, yeah, but they're kind of right. Even if you don't like Tesla,
1626160	1631600	Tesla has accelerated the adoption of electric vehicles by 10, 15, maybe 20 years. And it's
1632160	1636800	really accelerated the process for Detroit, car manufacturers all around the world, China.
1637360	1642400	So the idea that that somehow gets like middling ESG scores, I think it's quite fair to say
1642400	1646480	something's not quite right here. It's not just about the rational self-interest thing, you know?
1646480	1651280	Well, I think there's two things, again, going on, which is the rationale behind it. And the rationale
1651280	1656080	behind any climate policy that a government will implement will come from this, we need to protect
1656080	1660080	capitalism. Basically, you know, it's kind of the Keynesian idea. Jeff Mann wrote that book that was
1660080	1664240	like, you know, the Keynesian philosophy is basically like protecting capitalism means
1664240	1668640	protecting civilization. And there is an argument, you know, that these people will view themselves
1668640	1675520	as these enlightened, you know, platonic rulers whose job it is to basically make sure that
1675520	1681280	they have this view over society as a whole and can put in place the, like, the conditions that
1681280	1686640	give rise to the continuation of capitalism itself. But, and this is the interesting thing,
1686640	1691520	this is where things actually get interesting. If you're looking at, say, the state as a set of
1691520	1699680	institutions or, you know, a mechanism of organizing power, it is not staffed by enlightened technocrats
1699680	1705680	or platonic rulers who can just make policy based on what they consider to be the interests of
1705680	1709280	society as a whole. They say it is, you know, you ask a politician why they're doing what they're
1709280	1713120	doing, they say they govern in the general interest. This was Ralph Miliband's famous critique of the
1713120	1716400	capitalist state and the way that the Labour Party got sucked into it. It was because there's
1716480	1721360	this idea of state elites as governing the general interest, which is very hypnotic. It's like,
1721360	1724240	yes, of course, we'll give these people power because they're doing what's good for the rest of us.
1724240	1729120	But actually, the state isn't that. It's, you know, broadly speaking, as we think of capital,
1729120	1734000	it's a social relation in the sense that what goes on within the state and the way that state power
1734000	1740240	is exercised reflects social struggles that take place within society as a whole. That's kind of
1740240	1745440	abstract. But, you know, you can broadly think of it as like battles that are taking place within
1745440	1750560	state institutions, whether that's within, you know, the Treasury or any government department.
1751760	1758960	The players in that battle will be linked to wider groups that will have support from
1760240	1766080	different, you know, corporate institutions, historically unions, think tanks, basically
1766080	1771840	different groups that make up constellations of class interests that structure all capitalist
1771920	1778640	societies. And they will influence state policy, not just in a way that is meant to kind of
1778640	1782720	protect the interests of their class as a whole, but in a way that is meant to protect and promote
1782720	1787440	specific interests. So like look at like Biden's climate policies, for example, he comes in and
1787440	1791440	says, we need to save the planet for all these very good reasons. He's backed by capitalists
1791440	1795920	like Larry Fink who say, yes, actually, we do need to save the planet for the sake of capital.
1795920	1801440	And yet, because of the power of these different groups, these different specific interests,
1801440	1805920	as opposed to the general interests of capital as a whole, you end up getting this hodgepodge of
1805920	1810240	climate policies, which actively undermine each other in some senses, even though the narrative
1810240	1814560	is we're doing something about climate change, everyone can see that ExxonMobil still has a
1814560	1817920	huge amount of power, can still see that, you know, all these like these banks that are funding
1817920	1823600	climate change still have a huge amount of power. And so you have this weird like, not only like
1823600	1829280	the weird fact of policies that go against each other, but the weird show of politicians saying
1829280	1833280	we're doing something in your interest when it's very clear that they're actually acting on
1833280	1838080	behalf of a very specific interest. Yeah, I think it and it leads to really messy policy. Yeah,
1838080	1841920	which neither the left nor the right can really understand. So a really good recent example
1841920	1845600	is this recent house building announcement by Michael Gove. What does it look like? Well,
1845600	1850080	they're saying that legislative changes, which result really from an EU dictate, of course,
1850640	1855520	in 2017 have led to fewer housing starts and completions. First of all, that's not true. We
1855520	1861200	completed more houses in 2018 and 2016, but park that for a moment. The solution, therefore, is to
1861200	1869440	basically allow people building homes to to have those homes put more crap into local waterways.
1869440	1874240	That's fine. You know, it's called sediment, but they basically mean effluent and garbage and rubbish
1874240	1880240	that we flush down our toilets. Now, okay, you would think that's bad if you care about clean
1880240	1884480	waterways. You might think it's good if you think we're actually building houses are more important.
1884480	1888960	But here's where it gets really interesting, because it isn't just a regulatory change. They
1888960	1894640	like to say, we're not going to step back and we're cutting red tape. No, 700 million pounds of
1894640	1899200	taxpayer money is being spent. How hundreds of millions of pounds are being given to house builders
1899200	1903280	by the taxpayer, by the state. Hundreds of millions of pounds are being given to private
1903280	1906320	water companies. Apparently they're private. They pay dividends to their shareholders. And
1906320	1910560	yet the taxpayers having to pay for stuff here. So what we're doing is we're paying 700 million
1910560	1916000	pounds to allow some people to stop polluting, some people to start polluting, and apparently
1916000	1919600	it's so we can build more homes. And you think, hold on, couldn't we just use the 700 million
1919600	1924000	pounds to build to build the homes? Do you know what I mean? Yeah. But it's just this like, and
1924000	1928800	it's really messy, chaotic and like screwed up. Yeah. And I think that's a big part of the political
1928800	1933040	debate right now is why the left and the right struggle to get a handle on anything. And it's
1933040	1936880	why everybody says, look, nobody could minister anything. And I think like you say, it's because
1936880	1942400	you have these competing interests and also competing ideas, which because they're not governed
1942400	1946800	in a coherent, structured way, which they were, let's say until 2008, or if you're being really,
1946800	1954000	you know, skeptical, you know, maybe the 1990s, it's just a mess. Well, I mean, I think this is
1954000	1958880	the point, right? Because we've been stuck in politics for such a long time in this
1959440	1965200	sterile debate between left progressives or liberal progressives and neoliberals or right
1965200	1970880	wingers. And the debate is basically like, the state needs to do stuff on the left, you know,
1970880	1974880	the state needs to do stuff, we need to protect people from the markets, the free market is fine,
1974880	1978880	but it needs to have some regulation over it. And the right saying the free market is good,
1978880	1984160	state intervention leads to corruption, you know, we need to get rid of like, you know,
1984160	1988320	nanny state and bureaucrats and all these different sorts of things. And we have the same
1988320	1993120	debate we've been having for 100 years, and no one's any the wiser. And of course, that's because
1993120	1997760	we've lost what should be the socialist or Marxist critique of all this, which is that we don't live
1997760	2003280	in free markets. Not only are the markets that, you know, do exist under capitalism, not free,
2003280	2007840	but most of our lives are structured by decisions that are made by big corporations, financial
2007840	2012320	institutions, states, politicians, who are insulated from democratic accountability precisely
2012320	2016960	because they're in the pockets of big businesses. And what is really missing there is just an
2016960	2022000	understanding of the way that power actually works. We have these big ideological debates and
2022000	2026560	that people who do PPP like to have about freedom versus competition versus, you know,
2026560	2031760	protection. And actually, none of that matters when it's just the brute fact of power that is
2031760	2037600	being exercised by people who are in positions of authority over everyone else, who basically
2037600	2043440	like live in a game that has been designed so that they lose. No wonder you get people, you know,
2043440	2047840	going for these kind of conspiracy theories, which are like, you know, the world is being run
2047840	2052560	in this one room by like the World Economic Forum. It's like, that isn't true. You can
2052560	2060720	understand why they think that because there is this like fairly coherent network of institutions
2060720	2066240	and actors that govern those institutions that whenever a crisis happens, do seem to get together
2066240	2070640	in a room and say, right, this bank gets bailed out, that one gets to collapse in the pandemic,
2070640	2074480	this company gets a bailout, that one gets to gets to collapse. And at the same time,
2074480	2077520	you're being told, oh, we live in a free market. And if you go out and work really hard and
2077600	2081280	compete in that market and do really well, then you'll come out on top. But also, if the company
2081280	2086640	that has been exploiting you for 10 years gets, you know, extremely over indebted and needs a
2086640	2089760	bailout, we'll give them one. But if you get extremely over indebted and need a bailout,
2089760	2092640	then you're out on the street. Like, of course, it sounds like the system is rigged. You're told
2092640	2097600	you're living in a free market system. And actually, you live in this, you know, it's like
2097600	2103280	the iron fist of the powerful versus like the invisible hand of Adam Smith.
2103280	2107120	Yeah, this was really brought home to me though that I was watching GB News with Darren Grimes.
2107680	2112080	My regular Saturday viewing. And I was watching because I was about to go on, actually. And I
2112080	2117680	was preceded by a guy called John Rental, who's this sort of new labor, you know, the Russian
2117680	2123200	Soviets had a great word for this, ideologist. Yeah, not an ideologue, an ideologist. And PPE,
2123200	2129920	PPE, the job of PPE, by the way, is to train ideologists of market capital. And he was on
2129920	2132960	there. And Darren Grimes, and this is what worries me, because Darren Grimes is talking
2132960	2136400	more sense than John Rental. Darren Grimes says, well, look, there's this massive difference
2136480	2143360	right now between savings rates and, and things like mortgage rates or credit card debt. So
2144080	2147760	the base rate of interest 5.25% of the moment, we all know it's been going up for 18 months.
2147760	2151520	What's the base rate of interest? It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the rate of interest at which
2151520	2155120	the bank of in and gives money to private banks. Obviously they have to make profits because they're
2155120	2160560	private enterprises. So they have rates slightly higher right now, their savings rates, I think
2160560	2167040	the average is about 2.6, 2.7%. The average mortgage is almost 6%, 5.75, 5.8%. So there's
2167040	2171600	this huge difference, right? So they're basically skimming profits. They're charging far more than
2171600	2175600	they should be with regards to, you know, if you want to take out debt from them, but if you're
2175600	2179440	depositing savings, they're not really giving you enough. So it's clearly unfair. Darren Grimes
2179440	2183280	said that in his own way. And John Rental goes, no, no. And he said, should politicians be doing
2183280	2188080	anything about this? And by the way, Jeremy Hunt called this a problem. Jeremy Hunt and John Rental,
2188080	2192480	this Blair ideologist says, oh, there's no problem with this. It's the free market. We
2192480	2196720	shouldn't be getting involved. Oh, bless him. It's the free market. That's so stupid. It's so
2196720	2201280	stupid. Like the UK financial system is so far from a free market. It's been like accused of
2201280	2207360	oligopolistic behavior in like loads of reports going back like years. It's the free market. So
2207360	2211680	first of all, first of all, first of all, we're talking about monetary policy. So that's set by
2211680	2215520	the Bank of England is set by like a bunch of people in a room. There's no invisible hand.
2215520	2219040	They arbitrarily determine what it is. They would say, this is the interesting because
2219040	2223200	historically they would say, oh, they are just setting the current interest rate to align with
2223200	2228320	the long-term natural rate of interest, which is set by the market. And actually QE and the
2228320	2231440	policies surrounding that have kind of done away even with that idea. So it's now become obvious
2231440	2234560	that actually central banks just set interest rates. There's no natural rate of interest.
2234560	2237120	But then Darren Grimes says something really interesting. He says, but hold on, you're saying
2237120	2240720	it's the free market. We bailed out the banks in 2009. That wasn't the free market. And I'm thinking,
2240720	2245360	oh, God, he's gone in. And John Rental was, no, no, no, no, that wasn't, we made money from that.
2245360	2248960	It wasn't a bailout. Of course it was a bailout. And it wouldn't fucking exist anymore if we hadn't
2248960	2255760	used taxpayer money to guarantee their liabilities. They were insolvent. And you know, that's where
2255760	2260400	I get, and we're talking, and it's really important to disaggregate. Let's say progressive liberalism
2260400	2265120	from the left, what John Rental is presenting there is progressive liberalism. And it makes no
2265120	2270480	fucking sense. And the right take from Darren Grimes makes him measureably more sense.
2270480	2275200	And that's where, as you say, people like yourself come in with something a little bit different.
2275200	2278720	Well, I mean, this is the point, right? Because there's two ways of responding to that. Once you
2278720	2284880	kind of, once you peek past the veil of capitalist ideology, once you take, what is it, the red pill,
2284880	2288240	the blue pill? Are you supposed to take? I can't remember. What is it? They say they've been red
2288240	2291520	pills. I just know black pill is the really bad one. Okay, whatever. Once you take the pill,
2291520	2297840	that lets you see how everything works. There's two ways of dealing with that, right? The way that I
2297840	2307040	think most people learn to deal with that is by just being forced to deal with this deep sense
2307040	2312400	of powerlessness, right? You peek past the curtain, you see that there are basically structures in
2312400	2316240	place that mean that even though you're told from when you are very, very young, if you just work
2316240	2320400	hard and do well, your life will be good, actually, you are playing in a game that has been designed
2320400	2328640	so that you lose. And you come out of that with disillusionment, with anger, with a sense of,
2328640	2332320	you know, righteous indignation, basically, which lends itself to the right and it lends
2332320	2336480	itself to that kind of fascist ideology, that kind of, you know, this is a bit nerdy, but like the
2336480	2342560	Nietzschean raison-t-amant that feeds fascist movement. Google that. Pause, Google that.
2343360	2351440	Which basically says like, okay, well, I'm in this system, the powerful control it, I can't touch
2351440	2356720	the powerful, I'm just an individual. So all I can do is elbow all these people around me out the way
2356720	2361440	with this knowledge that I have about how the system works in order to get myself on top.
2362320	2366480	And a step further than that, actually, which you're seeing in some really right-wing movements in
2366480	2371360	Europe particularly, is just burn the whole thing down. It's like climate change is coming,
2372320	2377920	immigrants are coming, the end of the world is coming, basically, like let the whole thing burn,
2377920	2382240	let the elites burn, let the system come crashing down, and let's just build this little island
2382240	2387440	for the worthy, for, you know, the way we consider our group to be able to stay alive on.
2388160	2391680	And that is where we're going, because that's the way that individualism responds to that
2391680	2397680	realization of powerlessness, basically. The other way is the way that we would have historically
2397680	2403120	is that you would organize as part of a movement of other people who share your interests to change
2403120	2407440	the system, and actually not even just to change the system, but to bring down the system as it is,
2407440	2411600	and in the process of bringing down that system, not just allowing everything to crash to the ground,
2411600	2419440	but constructing new institutions in the process of revolution, really, that are based on different
2419440	2424400	values, that are based on community, that are based on, you know, collective struggle, that are
2424400	2430560	based on social solidarity and support, and that allow you to survive whilst challenging
2430560	2435280	the interests of the powerful. Now, because we live in such a brainwashed, individualistic society,
2435280	2440480	it's basically impossible for people to imagine what that would look like. Like if you ask someone,
2440480	2445200	how are you going to, you know, like react against injustice, they'll say, oh, I'll buy a tote bag,
2445200	2450160	or like, I'll tweet something. Like there's no sense of how you might get involved in a collective
2450160	2454640	project to actually challenge the structures of the system as a whole. And that's the legacy of
2454640	2460320	neoliberalism and individualism, that was the very aim of, like, thatcherism, was to destroy our
2460320	2465040	sense of social solidarity. So I think for the left, the biggest challenge is, yes, firstly,
2465040	2469040	exposing the fact that the system is rigged, but I think most people know that the system is rigged,
2469040	2473200	right? Like, this is basically what my forthcoming book is about, it's about all the ways in which
2473200	2478320	the system is rigged. It's called Vulture Capitalism. Vulture Capitalism, corporate crimes,
2478320	2482960	backdoor bailouts, and the death of freedom. The death of freedom? Yes, I know. Well, that's
2482960	2486880	going to really go down one in the universe. I know, I know. I can see Tucker Carlson saying,
2487840	2495440	the death of freedom? By a Marxist. And yeah, so that's kind of what that book is about. It's
2495440	2499280	basically about all the ways the system is rigged and the beginnings of kind of how we could think
2499280	2505040	about building something new. But I think the real challenge is actually speaking to this nihilistic,
2505040	2513360	individualistic, conspiratorial, like, resentful response to that realization with a politics
2513360	2518080	of hope rather than basically like a politics of death. So true. Like, I think one of the,
2518080	2522880	I thought in the second half of the 2010s, it was a huge win for the left that, you know, we would,
2522880	2528240	you know, we'd go on the radio waves and on TV, 2017 election. And we'd said, the system is rigged.
2528960	2532800	And, you know, we were like, wow, so powerful, Bernie kind of vibes. It was working, you know,
2532800	2537040	Labour increased their vote by 10%. You think there is momentum here towards a different kind
2537040	2542000	of politics. And I remember talking to Jake Berry, who's a Tory MP, and he talked about, you know,
2542000	2548800	what was the line they had for Theresa May? Strong and steady. Strong and stable. And then I said,
2548800	2552080	she's not a strong woman. I said, she's strong against the weak and she's weak against the
2552080	2557520	strong. You exploit, you exploit the weak and you get on your knees in front of the powerful.
2557520	2562880	So that ain't strength, my friend. And he was like, you know, inverting that little thing.
2562880	2565840	Anyway, so we thought that was like a moment where we were really cutting through with it.
2565840	2570400	And like you say, that's now the common sense of everyone. Everyone says the system is rigged.
2570400	2577360	It's only like these 5% of like, Libs, but like, who are all in the media. And like,
2577360	2582480	they're the only ones who don't say the system's rigged. Everybody, everybody says the system is
2582480	2585600	absolute. They might not be, you know, angry, but they might be saying like, look, for now,
2585600	2589360	I'm doing okay. You know, I'm managing, which is many people, right? I'm not saying they're all
2589360	2593600	ready for revolution. This is for like, everything was fine before Brexit or everything was fine
2593600	2597600	before whatever. Like if we could just go back to normal, sensible politics, I don't want to
2597600	2600160	have to think about politics anymore. I'm politically homeless, that sort of thing.
2600160	2604800	Yeah, the sort of, you know, your new balance, the rest is politics, listen to the kind of person.
2604800	2609040	But what I mean, what I want to say is here that you're right, we thought in the latter half of
2609040	2612240	the 2010s that like, wow, there's this huge political progress for the left to say the system
2612480	2616960	rigged, people are buying it. There's an elite, an avaricious elite who are screwing the rest of
2616960	2621360	society. That is now the music coming from everywhere. That was also what Trump said,
2621360	2626000	right? Frankly, in many ways. And you're seeing it a lot, a lot with the right who have obviously
2626000	2631120	a very different political message. And like you say, for me, you've got like two archetypes here,
2631120	2638960	which is like mid 20th century, Nibevan. Okay, you, your, your, your loved one or your sibling,
2638960	2643280	they have tuberculosis, or they have some, you know, horrendous disease. That's why we need
2643280	2647200	a national health service, right? Okay, well, something similar in the, in the 2020s in the
2647200	2652000	United States. Oh, you know, a family member can't afford insulin in the US. Who are they
2652000	2656560	watching? Andrew Tate. And he's saying it's the matrix out to get you the establishments out to
2656560	2662720	get you. But what's he saying is the answer. He's saying, get rich, you know, screw lots of women,
2663600	2668320	work out, you know, get good at fighting. And that's in the absence of alternatives.
2668320	2672160	That's really alluring for lots of young men. Yeah. No, I totally see that because you're
2672160	2678400	basically, you know, again, and this is the massive ideological success of neoliberalism,
2678400	2682160	also, than anything to do with convincing us that, you know, we live in free markets,
2682160	2689280	is to convince us that we are individual competitors in this big old game. And that
2689360	2693120	everyone has, broadly speaking, the same chances to win the game, or if they don't,
2693120	2696480	then they at least have the chance to better their lot in life if they just, you know,
2696480	2700800	work hard and get to know the rules of the game and exploit their competitive advantage against
2700800	2707040	the people around them. And that is the natural result of putting market ideology onto every
2707040	2710960	area of social life, because you come to look at yourself as like a commodity. So you're like,
2710960	2716640	why, how can I win the game better? I need to, you know, understand the rules and the rules are
2716640	2720560	hidden. So someone like Andrew, take and show me what the rules are. And then I need to get strong
2720560	2725200	and powerful so I can beat everyone around me. And then I'll be at the top. And maybe, you know,
2725200	2729040	half the people are thinking, well, when I'm at the top, then I can do nice things for my family
2729040	2732800	or like make the system better. Maybe they're thinking, then I can take control. Maybe they're
2732800	2736400	thinking that I can burn the whole thing down. But everything is structured around the idea that
2736400	2739760	you need to get to the top, you need to win, you need to beat everyone around you. And only then
2739760	2745520	can you start to think about social change, which is actually the absolute opposite of how any
2745520	2751680	social change will happen. It is how you make yourself easy to control basically is by buying
2751680	2756080	this ideology that you can be a winner in this system, where there are other people who will
2756080	2761120	set the rules and always shift the goalposts. And where there will always be losers. And where
2761120	2765680	those losers will largely speaking always be the same people. And probably you are part of that
2765680	2769760	group that will always be trapped in this constant struggle and that will never really escape. The
2769760	2775440	only way out of that is to recognize that you are part of a group and that your interests are not
2775440	2779280	in beating everyone else around you, which is ultimately impossible and you're never going
2779280	2785280	to be able to do anyway. Your interests lie in kind of creating communities that can work together
2785280	2790720	to firstly protect each other and support each other, and then actually start to rebel against
2790720	2795920	the people who are actually in charge. We're going to clip that, put it on TikTok, like
2797600	2803360	Sigma male music, the real Grace Blakely on the real matrix. It does sound like the matrix.
2803920	2810880	On the real matrix. Are liberals our people? Are they part of our movement? And I mentioned,
2810880	2815760	you know, John Rental earlier on saying that, you know, the remark alone, and of course the banks
2815760	2819840	are doing nothing wrong. We bailed them out. It wasn't a bailout, blah, blah, blah. And the sort
2819840	2825200	of the formulae political strategy that you hear time after time after time is that the left needs
2825200	2830960	him to do anything. Right? He's one of our people, you know, the left and people, I don't even think
2830960	2835120	he's a liberal or whatever, you know, the center, which is very few people numerically, but obviously
2835120	2839920	has tremendous agenda setting power, inserting more generally. Are they part of our movement?
2839920	2845360	Are they part of our coalition? Or does the inclusion of establishment liberals within our
2845360	2852480	coalition actually foreclose the possibility of broader class based politics? You know,
2853040	2857520	I've got this question here. Do you know, do you think it's weird that the Ford Foundation and
2857520	2863120	the Rockefeller Foundation have used as somehow advancing progressive courses? You know, I saw
2863120	2867840	that think tank recently, what's it called? More in common. More in common. We've got more in common.
2867840	2872480	And they wrote this piece, they had this poll rather, and it showed that if Jeremy Corbyn was
2872480	2876480	leader of the Labour Party, he would only be, Labour would be one point ahead of the Tories.
2876480	2880000	And obviously this was being raised showing people, I was like, but hold on, this is a poll
2880000	2884960	brought to you by like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. Why do you think people
2884960	2890880	funded by people like that would ask that question? Ask yourself. And, and it's precisely those kinds
2890880	2895680	of groups, the sort of liberal NGOs that we have been told, I believed it for a long time. I mean,
2895680	2900640	you said earlier, you wanted to work in that kind of world. They were part of our coalition. Do you
2900640	2911120	think that's true or not? I think that there are two questions, one of which relates to do we need
2911120	2915440	to build a coalition in which the average person who is maybe not that politically engaged, but
2915440	2920800	probably falls somewhere around the inadvertent commerce centre of the political like spectrum
2920800	2928560	needs to be involved? Yes. And then what we do with the hangover of Blairism and neoliberalism and,
2928560	2933920	you know, years of this kind of warped style of public debate that we have had, which is all
2933920	2938800	of these people who think they're very important, and in some ways are very important and don't
2938800	2944880	like us. And there are a number of different answers to that. And I think it varies from
2944880	2950160	person to person. Broadly speaking, I think these people are rudderless. And that's why they are
2950160	2955840	coming out and saying all of these wild things. You know, they were thrust to power on the back
2955840	2961040	of a movement that didn't threaten the status quo, which still was kind of covered in this
2961040	2966160	image of progressiveness and change and hope. And they still see themselves in that sense,
2966160	2972240	they see themselves as kind of, you know, vanguards of sensible, compassionate politics
2973040	2977680	who are protecting the centre ground against extremes on all sides, of course, without
2977680	2982080	realising that the very reason that the extremes have grown more powerful is precisely because
2982080	2987280	they are in control. But that's, you know, besides the point. The question then is, I suppose,
2988080	2994320	you know, how can they either be engaged or neutralised? And that rudderlessness is in some
2994320	3004080	ways an asset, because if we are able to kind of basically build our own movement, which we're
3004080	3012080	still very much in the process of doing, that can provide the fulcrum around which political debate
3013120	3016560	is organised, then they have to pick a side. We don't have that power at the moment. We don't
3016560	3022000	have that agenda setting power at the moment. We are, as the left, as socialists, still in this
3022000	3025840	kind of confused position with regards to like mainstream political debates, like sometimes
3025840	3030000	people like me are on TV, but most of the time the issues that we're talking about aren't the
3030000	3033440	issues that we'd like to be talking about. We have a limited amount of power to actually shape
3033440	3039120	the way that that process continues. And it is actually those centrists who are in these positions
3039120	3045040	of authority who are able to kind of set the terms of the debate. If we're going to be thinking about
3045040	3050800	neutralising or engaging those people in a positive way, basically we would need to have more power
3050800	3058400	ourselves. And that is the challenge. I think if we're able to kind of build this project back
3058400	3062800	out, fight back against the narratives that are being pushed by the far right, build institutions
3062800	3067760	like Navarra that gain some level of agenda setting power, those people then have to start
3067760	3071120	talking about the things that we want them to talk about. And as soon as they're starting to
3071120	3074480	talk about the things that we want them to talk about, they then have to pick a side and the
3074480	3078640	sides are defined by us. Whereas at the moment we're going into their institutions and we are
3078640	3082800	put into one of these two sides which are defined by them. This is what I was saying at the beginning
3082800	3087040	about how they'll bring me in and say, you're taking this side of the debate and then be shocked
3087040	3094080	when I don't argue the line that they want me to argue. So yeah, I think, as I say, co-opt or
3094080	3100880	neutralise them. There has to be a position from which we can exert authority. And at the moment
3100880	3106240	we don't massively have that, although it is changing slightly. I think actually the slow
3106240	3113920	implosion of mainstream media and the growth of online platforms and problems like Navarra,
3113920	3118320	they are paying attention to that. Whenever I go into mainstream media studios, there's all
3118320	3124560	panic about how are they going to adapt to the digital age and the BBC, I don't know if you saw
3124560	3127280	that BBC feedback thing where it's like Radio 4 is losing listeners, what do we do?
3127280	3127920	That's crazy.
3127920	3132160	Yeah. So I think there is a sense of they know that they're kind of rudeless,
3132160	3135440	they know that the questions they're asking don't really attach to conversations that are
3135440	3141040	taking place in society more generally. But they're still in control of the way that those debates
3141040	3147040	happen and that's not going to change until they aren't. So I don't really know if that answers
3147040	3152240	the question. Grace just mentioned organisations like Navarra Media. Yes.
3152240	3156080	And I want to take this opportunity to say that you can help us grow and you can help us
3156080	3160880	change the political debate in this country and change politics by supporting our work.
3160880	3164560	So if you go to navarramedia.com forward slash support, you can make a one-off payment,
3164560	3167920	you can become a supporter. I think we have 12, 13,000 supporters these days.
3167920	3172960	You know, I'm from Bournemouth. You could fill the vitality stadium and more with the people
3172960	3177760	that support Navarra Media. That's great. Why don't you join them and go to navarramedia.com
3177760	3182720	forward slash support and make a ideally a monthly payment or whatever you can.
3182720	3186720	You know, our catchphrase back in the day used to be new media for different politics.
3187280	3191040	And I was thinking about this recently, I didn't come up with it so I can say this,
3191040	3196080	it's brilliant, right? Okay. Because it's showing a problem and it's showing a solution
3196080	3200560	and it's showing how to get there in one simple sentence. What's the problem? Politics.
3201360	3206640	What's the instrument to improving it? Media. How do we get better media to inflect politics?
3207280	3213280	Us. Yes. And obviously not just Navarra Media, Tribune, Jacobin, innumerable outlets out there,
3213280	3219520	but I think you're right to say it's probably the lowest hanging fruit in terms of pushing politics
3219520	3226080	this country left is taking on MSM. And like it's, it's happening whether we like it or not,
3226640	3231280	that crumbling, it's about, you know, how's it going to fall? How the piece is going to land?
3231840	3236000	So like I said, if you want it to land in a good way, go to navarramedia.com forward slash support.
3236800	3241600	I endorse this message. I'm very, I'm very glad you do. You know,
3241600	3245840	you said earlier on your IPPR. Yeah. I was doing some work with them.
3246480	3251040	I remember. Good times. I remember. And I remember, we did, I made a video with you.
3251920	3255360	Some people might not know this, but I don't, I don't just write stuff. I'm also a very bad
3255360	3261920	videographer. No. I used to sort of dabble in it. And I made a video with you. And I remember
3261920	3266240	that somebody had like 5,000 followers on Twitter and I was like, what is going on, Grace?
3267280	3271280	And now how many do you have? Like 180,000 or something.
3271600	3274880	Still not good enough, but still. I just, I hate, I hate it.
3274880	3278960	No, but you're such an eloquent voice and you're so informative on, on finance stuff,
3278960	3283200	which obviously is, you know, is quite hard to penetrate for most people. I think it's obscured
3283200	3286880	intentionally. Of course. You know, they don't want it to be easy to understand for most people.
3286880	3290240	And I think, you know, it's great you're finding an audience. Why quickly? Why do you hate Twitter?
3290240	3294880	You said, don't you hate it? Really, like, you know, all of what I've been talking about so far
3295440	3302240	has been to do with these ideologies that keep us subjected to control
3305040	3308880	and that we reproduce inside our heads all the time, right? And so being
3309920	3313920	on social media and having lots of followers and being on TV and being like successful in
3313920	3324080	publishing books, it like, we are supposed to be, we are talking often to people who are losing out
3324160	3329120	as a result of the systems that, which they have no control. And you are speaking from the
3329120	3333600	perspective of someone who's winning as part of all of those systems. And I see this now.
3333600	3334880	Do you see yourself as winning?
3334880	3338480	Yeah, I think so. And I see this now, you know, like the, the, the most kind of
3339120	3344400	aggressively neoliberal, marketized way that you can look at this, you're gonna get like the
3344400	3350560	value you have as a human being is to do online dating, right? Because that is a market in a sense.
3350560	3354880	You know, historically, you wouldn't have a market for partners, you'd have a community,
3354880	3358080	you'd meet X amount of people over the course of your life, you pick one, you, you know,
3358080	3363120	you go with them. Now we have this hugely liquid market, which has got loads and loads of people
3363120	3367280	in it. And the more liquid a market, the better the price mechanism works. So the better you're
3367280	3371600	able to see, you know, based on the force of supply and demand, what your price, what your value
3371600	3376640	is in the market. And even though they don't tell you where exactly you sit in that hierarchy,
3376640	3380960	you can tell by the number of matches you get, or like, you know, the way people respond to you
3380960	3384560	in that game. And if you are attractive, if you have lots of social media followers, people
3384560	3389040	are obsessed with social media followers and fame and influence. And if you like have a good job
3389040	3394320	and you're successful, then you have a high price in that market for human beings for partners.
3395520	3403120	And I find myself in that position, whilst also, and you know, benefiting from that position,
3403120	3411200	whilst also really disliking the idea that it is possible to assign a price value to a person
3411200	3415440	based on these metrics of success over which we have no control. And also having to accept that,
3415440	3420080	like, according to all of those metrics of success over which we have no control, I'm winning.
3420080	3424240	Because like, I was born into a relatively well off family in a rich country in a rich part of
3424240	3431040	the world and went to Oxford and like, played this game well. And it just is, I think,
3431040	3436800	basically, it poisons you if you identify with it. It poisons you because you start thinking,
3436800	3442480	I'm a winner. I've come out on top. I'm better in one way or another. And it's not even conscious
3442480	3445600	half the time. It's kind of unavoidable. It's like the adoption of an attitude that you take
3445600	3452000	towards what you're doing and the people who are around you. And if you can't take off that identity
3452000	3458960	and like leave it at the door and be like, that's something that has happened because of the screwed
3458960	3461840	up way that our society exists and I have it and that's great. And I'm going to try and use it the
3461840	3467040	best way I can. But then say, I am just a person. I don't have a value that you can correlate with
3467040	3470800	the number of social media followers I have or the number of matches I get on Ninja. I have,
3471440	3475920	you know, friends that see me who I am. I have like hobbies and things that I do that have
3475920	3482240	absolutely nothing to do with that stuff. I am not playing this game most of the time. I'm just
3482240	3487280	being myself. Unless you can do that, you become your brain melts quickly. What hobbies do you have?
3487360	3491520	I really like surfing. Okay, so I wanted something more like warhammer or something.
3494240	3497680	No, I think weightlifting. I think there's,
3499520	3503040	you know, you were saying about how producers expect you to have formulae,
3503040	3506560	sort of, because you're on the left, liberal values. I actually have a major critique of
3506560	3511120	dating apps. Like I genuinely think there's a huge downside to how we're socializing young people
3511120	3516000	who've never known anything else. So maybe people are a bit younger than you. And I think we need a
3516000	3519600	proper conversation about it. Yeah. And I'm considering doing an article about this.
3519600	3523120	You should. Yeah. I mean, I, and I've had this conversation many, many times I've gone on TV
3523120	3526640	and they expect you as the lefty, you know, oh, should we have our phones be banned in schools?
3526640	3531040	And I go, of course I should. We should have limits on social media for young people. What are
3531040	3537040	you talking about? We're literally incentivizing addiction to fund, to fund the world's largest,
3537040	3540800	wealthiest companies. Of course we should. But like they don't view that as a left-wing position
3540800	3544160	because they think the left-wing position on everything is, let everybody do everything
3544240	3548160	that they want. Well, some government too. So like maybe, yeah, we should have, you know,
3548160	3552320	the government should oversee like, there should be like an inquirer. No, like, no,
3552320	3556560	I think that there shouldn't really be, I fundamentally think kids below 11,
3556560	3559760	12 shouldn't have a smartphone. And they certainly shouldn't be allowed in schools. You know,
3559760	3564000	it's interesting that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs didn't let their children have smartphones
3564000	3570160	precisely these reasons. But I think dating apps is a really similar thing where, you know, maybe
3570720	3574720	there's an authoritarian impulse there. I am actually, I am really, and look,
3574720	3579680	we'll find out in 2030 years time, right? It's like smoking. It's like smoking in the 1950s.
3580480	3583760	What are the long-term impacts of this stuff? And I think there might be some really big ones
3583760	3588960	actually. Oh yeah, totally. I think, yeah, unless you can actually, you know, learn to
3590320	3596880	disaggregate yourself from these, all of these systems that surround our lives. And it's so
3596880	3601040	prevalent now with the way that we use social media, and with the way that the labor market
3601040	3605840	is constructed based on, you know, the gig economy and like mini entrepreneurs and stuff.
3605840	3613200	If you cannot like, learn to take your identity out of these settings where you are being told
3613200	3617920	that you as a person have a value based on the things that you do, then you will make yourself
3617920	3623040	miserable and mentally ill. And even if you win, even if you're at the top, you're going to make
3623040	3627840	yourself miserable. And especially if you lose. This is why I love having an Iranian dad.
3629040	3632800	Why? Because he, well, maybe it's the same with your parents. He has no idea what I do.
3633680	3638080	No, my parents know what I do. So he goes, why do you go on TV? Like what you have on YouTube?
3638080	3642240	How the hell does that work? Don't you have to like, don't you have to work in TV to go on TV?
3642240	3647440	And I'm like, no, it's like, Christ, he has no idea. He has no, he's not, bless him. He has no idea
3647440	3651600	what Navarra is. He's like, you're employed. I was like, yeah, there's about 25 of us. We have
3651600	3657920	like a place in Leeds. No way, no, but it's really grounding. It's great. Because sometimes my wife
3657920	3661040	goes, oh, it's so impressive. We don't write myself. You know what? My dad literally hasn't got the
3661040	3665440	first fucking book. It's really useful, like you say, like, so you don't go like, you don't believe
3665440	3671840	the smoke that, you know, might be blown up around us on the, on the liberal thing. Are they part of
3671840	3678000	our coalition? So this was a, this was an issue which I thought was really key within that,
3678000	3684560	which was the Farage debanking saga. Oh, yeah. So this was really fun, actually, because I got to
3684560	3692000	have the, the only kind of different line, which was, so obviously it was like, he should have
3692000	3697040	access to a bank account, or, you know, he shouldn't because he's a bad person, liberals versus
3697040	3702640	progressives, whatever. I was like, Farage says that we live in a free market capitalist economy,
3702640	3706800	and in a free market capitalist economy, a private bank has every right to make decisions based on
3706800	3710160	what it considers to be its interests and its profits, and therefore he should have no problem
3710160	3714880	with a bank deciding whether or not to give a bank account. I personally believe that firstly,
3714880	3720000	we do not largely live in a free market economy. We live in an economy in which the heads of
3720000	3723200	private institutions have an immense amount of power to make decisions without any democratic
3723200	3727520	accountability whatsoever. That isn't very good. And that we should be moving towards an economy
3727520	3731920	in which we have collective democratic public control over all of our institutions, including
3731920	3735760	banks, so that everyone gets a bank account, and we all collectively get to make the rules as to how
3735760	3740800	those bank accounts are administered. And everyone was just like, that doesn't make any sense.
3740800	3743600	Oh, they just ignored me and kind of carried on talking around the issue.
3743600	3747760	Well, he, I mean, it was interesting with him was he was saying, because for people watching this
3747760	3753360	archfake news, he didn't get, he didn't have, he wasn't given a business account where he was,
3753360	3756480	which was Coots, which is a subsidiary of NatWest, and he wasn't offered a business
3756480	3760880	account, a bunch of other banks. He was offered a regular, you know, current account, but presumably
3760880	3764320	Nigel, for our big shot, Nigel, you know, he probably wants to use it in the US when he goes
3764400	3767280	to support Trump later this year and whatnot. And that wouldn't have been, wouldn't have been
3767280	3774160	sufficient. And he himself said, you know, until quite recently, we had post office,
3774160	3778480	and everybody had a right to get a post office bank account. I'm thinking, what, you support,
3778480	3782720	you support a nationally owned bank, which is going to be the banker of last resort for people
3782720	3786960	in this country who can't get bank accounts anywhere else. But what I mean, what I suppose
3786960	3794720	what they would say is, it's an issue of, it's a matter of law. So whether or not somebody should
3794720	3800720	be able to access banking, should be, should be a matter of civil rights and law, rather than policy.
3801280	3804720	And it's, this is a big difference now, I think, between like some parts of the left and others.
3805280	3810160	I think as a civil right, that should be in tried and law. Lots of people liberals think, no, well,
3810160	3814640	it's, you know, these should be very flexible and one policy can apply here and another policy
3814720	3819680	can apply there. So what Farage would say is, well, it should be illegal to debank people
3819680	3823840	below a certain threshold, right? That's what he would say. But like you say, once you get into
3823840	3827680	that terrain, well, okay, if we're going to talk about the law as a constraint on the free market,
3828480	3832960	okay, let's have capital control, you could argue for anything, frankly. Do you think that,
3833520	3837200	do you think they've always lived with those inconsistencies? I mean, the right, the sort of
3837200	3841200	thatch right, right, or is it sort of becoming more pronounced because now they've got more
3841200	3846720	exposure, you know, their inconsistencies are perhaps in the spotlight more or was it always there?
3847280	3851840	There are two sets of inconsistencies that I think are important here, one of which is inherent to
3851840	3857280	the neoliberal movement and the other of which stems from the necessary alliance between neoliberals
3857280	3864160	and kind of far right extremists, basically. And the first inconsistency is the inconsistency
3864160	3870720	with a neoliberal thought, which says that this is an ideology based on kind of the need to promote
3870720	3877600	human freedom, that accepts that we are all kind of equal individuals playing this free market game.
3879280	3885920	And the job of a kind of good politician is to set up the rules of that game so that they are
3885920	3892000	fair, so that, you know, as a society, we think basically that they're fair and such that they
3892720	3898400	prop up the kind of norms and rules of economics. So we have to have a legal system, basically,
3898400	3903200	that kind of supports the functioning of the economy and make sure that everyone knows how to
3903200	3908800	play the free market game fairly, right? So that's the kind of neoliberal idea about what the state
3908800	3914080	should do. Their critique of the way that the state is, is that it's taken over by vested
3914080	3920480	interests by bureaucrats who just make policy in the interests of, you know, their little kingdom
3920480	3925280	building or fiefdom building. And the problem with the neoliberal theory is that they never say,
3925280	3929680	how do we get from here to there? How do we get from a state that's governed by vested interests to
3929680	3935120	one that's governed by neutral technocratic enlightened bureaucrats? And of course, we don't.
3935120	3942960	We just end up with the neoliberal agenda basically being used to push into power people who
3944000	3950960	veil their naked desire for power with a spiel about the need for free markets and competition,
3950960	3955680	whereas actually the free market game that they are going to construct and set up will be rigged
3955680	3964320	in their favor. It's just that the only impetus, the only kind of, the only power that they end up
3964320	3969840	having is the power to crush people who interfere with the game from a particular perspective. So
3969840	3973120	you see anti-competition law, for example, in the US being used to break up unions,
3973120	3979200	but not being used to break up kind of big firms and big banks and stuff. So there's this like,
3979840	3985680	this inherent problem at the heart of neoliberal ideology, which is its orientation towards the
3985680	3991120	state basically. It's like the state should be used, state policy and the legal system and law
3991120	3997680	should all be used to construct this fair good free market economic game. And the fact of life
3997680	4002800	under capitalism, which has never been a pure free market system, it's always been a system of kind
4002800	4007600	of private government by capital. And that private government is exercised both within the firm and
4007600	4013920	over the state as a whole. And there's this kind of what, you know, some theorists have called
4013920	4019200	this like double truth, what Hayek called actually a double truth at the heart of neoliberal philosophy,
4019200	4024960	which is tell everyone that we want less state intervention and kind of, you know, a cutting
4024960	4029920	of red tape and a removal of the state to make space for the free market. And the actual neoliberal
4029920	4036640	goal, which is creating this apparatus from within the state that supports the functioning of the
4036640	4042960	free market under the influence of capitalists who are actually rigging that game in their favour.
4042960	4045840	So this whole like big state, small state thing again, is that that's the
4046560	4049840	massive biggest lie at the heart of neoliberalism. And then there's the other thing
4050400	4053920	that even if you didn't have all of that, even if you just accepted the fact that neoliberals
4053920	4058880	do think there should be this big state, small state, free markets versus state intervention
4058880	4065200	dichotomy, there's this problem that's come with their from their alliance with the far right,
4065200	4070160	which is, as I've said, basically composed of people who considered themselves to be
4070960	4077040	losers or on the verge of losing from the free market economic game and want protections put
4077040	4083040	in place against people who they consider to be outsiders to preserve what remains of the
4083040	4088000	spoils of that game for their group. So you have basically the answer between neoliberals who set
4088000	4095120	up an economy in which people were permanently divided into winners and losers with people
4095200	4100880	who have ended up losing and now think that we basically need to kind of shit on immigrants
4100880	4106000	and like, you know, put women in their place in order to preserve their special status within
4106000	4111680	a game where they feel like losers. And that creates obvious sources of conflict, which we
4111680	4117920	saw most clearly with, you know, the divide between Johnson's Brexiteers and the kind of extreme
4120240	4124720	neoliberal libertarian wing of the conservative party that descends from kind of Thatcher.
4124720	4130400	I think David Graber called it the iron law of liberalism, which is like when government tries
4130400	4135840	to reduce need for government in this hamfisted way of just like salami slicing public budgets and
4135840	4140240	so on, they increase the need for government. That's not to say that you come, you know, some
4140240	4144400	things maybe couldn't be done by the government. Of course, of course, you can have that conversation
4144400	4147520	and you focus on the things that are really important. So for instance, a pacifist would say
4147520	4152960	we could spend less on arm spending, for instance. But I think his insight is really interesting.
4153040	4156080	And it's fascinating what you say about that being a fundamental inconsistency
4156080	4160880	and contradiction within neoliberalism about here, what you think, the area of values,
4160880	4165760	here's where you want to get an A can never lead to B. It's like that meme, there's a video of like
4165760	4170000	Sean Dyson, Pep Guardiola, have you seen this? No. And you've got Sean Dyson, she's going,
4170000	4173920	keep the ball out of there and that end, put it in the goal and that end. And then you've got
4173920	4177680	Pep Guardiola saying, we have the inverted right back, we play the false nine, we bring him.
4178640	4183360	It's like, so you've got two reeds on football, right? One is like very basic Brexit football,
4183360	4187280	and then there's like, you know, sexy total football, Pep style. And like,
4188400	4193120	neoliberals love to say, cut the steak, free markets, free people, free government, blah,
4193760	4198160	and it's like, no, like you end up in the most arcane, we'll do this subsidy here and we'll
4198160	4202080	cut this here and we'll create this new quanguns, agency, we'll have this and we'll lose money here,
4202080	4206560	but we'll tax those guys. Like going back to what I said earlier on with this housing policy from
4206560	4210320	Michael Gove, they'll be allowed to pollute more, but we'll have this change here and we'll give
4210320	4214320	more money here and taxpayer money can go to this private company here. And even though it's
4214320	4216800	probably only they still have shareholder dividends, if they don't pay the dividends,
4216800	4222080	we'll give them money to pay the dividends. Yeah, just just bring water into public ownership
4222080	4228240	and bring and build some social housing. Like this whole system and the most ingenious thing
4228240	4232800	about this, right, is that every new piece of regulation creates opportunities for profit
4232800	4239360	making. Because there's regulatory arbitrage, you can like, you know, use the gaps in existing
4239360	4243840	regulation to make sure that you're winning against your competitors, because I don't know,
4243840	4250240	you're like using profit shifting or like other forms of regulatory arbitrage, which basically
4250240	4254640	just means exploiting differences between laws or gaps in regulation to like create opportunities
4254640	4257840	for profit. You saw this with the financial crisis, right? Like there was this explosion in
4257840	4262080	regulation of the finance sector in some ways, especially at the international level going up
4262080	4268160	to the crisis of 2008. And we're talking about how assets were classified and categorized and how
4268160	4272960	banks were supposed to value those assets and the way that they were supposed to kind of assess
4272960	4279200	risk. And actually, that ended up creating opportunities for profit making. It, for example,
4279200	4283760	incentivize the the parceling up of all these different mortgages into these mortgage backed
4283760	4288400	securities that looked really safe, because they were supposedly diversified. But which actually
4288400	4292560	obviously had, you know, within that process, there was this constant risk of kind of massive
4292560	4298720	catastrophic meltdown. And so that process of setting regulation ended up creating opportunities
4298720	4303600	for profit making, that also caused the financial crisis. And this is always the case, like whenever
4303600	4309280	you get a new law, there are ways of exploiting the existence of that law to make money. And
4309280	4313280	private interest will always do that. It's the same with as well with like, you know,
4313280	4317840	carbon, carbon credits, the ways that those were set actually ends up making money at the European
4317840	4321760	level for for some companies when they were able to sell those. So regulation creates opportunities
4322880	4327840	for profit making. So Labour keeps saying that they'll smash the class ceiling when they're
4327840	4333040	in government, they'll smash the class ceiling. What does that mean? Well, it depends on whether
4333040	4339440	or not you are a Marxist or a Liberal. To me, smashing the class ceiling means dissolving
4339440	4343120	the distinction between the people who own the means of production and those who are forced
4343120	4348720	to work for a living on pain of destitution by socializing the ownership of and control and
4348720	4352800	governance of all of the assets that we need to produce the things that we need to survive.
4352800	4360560	It means dissolving the very existence of class as mediated by ownership, basically.
4360560	4368880	To a Liberal, it means making sure that the people who start life as losers maybe get to be winners
4368880	4372720	for a few minutes at some point in their lives. So, you know, the whole Liberal imaginary is about
4372720	4378480	making sure that rather than actually dissolving the divide between, you know, workers and the
4378480	4382480	owners of the means of production between capital and Labour, it means making sure that there's
4382480	4388240	more sortition amongst Labour and maybe the capacity every now and again for some people
4388240	4395200	within Labour to get into the position of being capitalists. But again, very rarely. So it's about,
4395200	4399920	yeah, you know, social mobility or whatever. It's not about changing the structure of the system.
4399920	4404400	There's always going to be winners. There's always going to be losers. And largely speaking,
4404400	4410000	those winners and losers will be the same people generally pretty consistently throughout
4410000	4416400	our history, although there will be periods of change and of shift. And the Liberal viewers just
4416400	4420640	say that change should happen a little bit more frequently. People like us should be in charge.
4420640	4424960	Exactly. Let's have social mobility. So comprehensive kids like me and on the first
4424960	4429040	of my family to go to university and I'll not stop tweeting about it. Let's have more people
4429040	4432480	like me in charge. You know, we did a great interview with Dan Evans and he has a brilliant
4432480	4439120	critique of social mobility as really a sort of justifying veneer for a dysfunctional economic
4439120	4442960	social and political system, which also, by the way, increasingly can't even produce any growth
4442960	4448480	or improved living standards. And like the veneer on that is, sure, we've had zero growth 15 years,
4448480	4452880	living standards are falling, but I'm the first person in my family to go to university. What the
4452880	4455840	hell are you talking about? I think this actually comes back to the point that I made at the very
4455840	4459280	start of this interview, right, about the difference between winners and losers and people who make
4459280	4464560	the rules, right? Like the conservative view is just that like the winners are the winners and
4464560	4469440	the losers are the losers. And that's fair because that's based on competition and competition is
4469440	4473680	its own process of fairness. For those on the left, it's like, well, we should make sure that if
4473680	4477680	people do lose, they're protected in some way. And actually, they have more opportunities to
4477680	4481760	become winners and that the winners pay a little bit more to make sure that society works a little
4481840	4486400	bit better. Whereas the Marxist or the socialist view should be there shouldn't be winners and
4486400	4490480	losers and people that make the rules. It should be we all make the rules together.
4491520	4493280	It's a completely different way of organising society.
4494480	4500080	Grace, on that note, we'll leave it there. When's your book out for people who perhaps come into
4500080	4503200	you for the first time though? I find it very hard to believe. No, I mean, I'm sure I've been away
4503200	4506960	for quite a while. I hope that there'll be people who come in for the first time. That's the point
4506960	4512800	of coming on, I guess. When is it coming out? The 7th of March, I think, next year. Yeah,
4512800	4516080	so early March next year. And if people want to follow your work, where can they find you?
4516080	4523600	They can find me at Grace Blakely. Blakely has two E's, EL, EY, on Twitter, on Instagram,
4523600	4527120	even on TikTok. Oh, wow, TikTok. And you're right for Tribune. You've got a phone there.
4527120	4536800	And I'm right for Tribune, yes. Great. Well, thank you so much. Thank you.
4536960	4541920	Thank you.
