00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
I look at economic analysis in the media, that is not analysis, that is an entertainment product.

00:05.120 --> 00:08.960
If you are not taking these guys and rewarding them for being right,

00:08.960 --> 00:12.800
and punishing them for being wrong, then they are not analysing their f***ing dancing.

00:18.160 --> 00:23.760
Everybody knows that inequality is getting worse. Well, almost everybody. Anybody serious? Anyway.

00:24.720 --> 00:30.560
For Gary Stevenson, that is the essential trend, not just the last 15 years, but the next 15 years too.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Not that long ago, Gary was one of the most successful traders on the planet.

00:36.880 --> 00:42.400
Now, he's a campaigner around inequality, though he still does the occasional trade as well.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.120
Gary, it's great to have you joining us on downstream.

00:45.120 --> 00:45.520
Thank you.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.360
We've got a lot to talk about. We'll start right from the beginning.

00:49.440 --> 00:55.360
Age 22 in 2008, you got a job as a trader at Citigroup in Canary Wharf.

00:55.920 --> 00:57.920
Within two years, you made your first million pounds.

00:58.640 --> 01:00.800
And that's a position that a lot of young people aspire to,

01:00.800 --> 01:05.120
but you started from a very humble beginning. So, can you walk us through your story,

01:05.120 --> 01:10.480
where you come from, the Gary Stevenson kind of narrative arc?

01:10.480 --> 01:14.720
Yeah, okay. So, I'm from Ilford, which is a small suburb of East London.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.160
Yeah, I come from a pretty poor background.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.720
A little terrorist house next to the railway. Got one brother, one sister.

01:21.920 --> 01:25.840
I was always very good at maths growing up. So, I think if you grew up in East London,

01:25.840 --> 01:30.560
you know, when I was a kid, we could literally see that the skyscrapers in Canary Wharf going up

01:30.560 --> 01:34.480
when we were kids. You can't ever assume you're just going to go into banking, right?

01:35.120 --> 01:37.920
So, that was sort of the path I thought I'd go on.

01:38.880 --> 01:43.280
I got expelled from school when I was 16 for a, I normally call it a drug-related incident.

01:44.240 --> 01:45.840
What was it?

01:46.560 --> 01:48.320
It was a cannabis, you know.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.040
You were expelled?

01:49.600 --> 01:50.640
Yeah, yeah, 16.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.600
Just for smoking cannabis?

01:52.320 --> 01:55.760
I think I sold about Â£2 worth of cannabis, which I wouldn't call it a sale.

01:57.040 --> 02:00.720
Yeah, I was young and I don't condone such things, but it happened back then.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.920
So, I was sort of stuck at home, gave me a bit of a kick up the arse,

02:03.920 --> 02:07.680
and I was sort of studying for my exams, but I did well in my exams and, you know,

02:07.680 --> 02:09.440
managed to get good A-levels and went to go to LSE.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.480
So, LSE, I don't know if you know people from LSE.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.920
It's a bit of a London School of Economics.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.760
It's a bit of an investment bank in Bootcamp.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.840
And I kind of figured I'd just go there, kill the exams.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.880
I would study maths and economics and get a job as a trader.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.080
That is super hard.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.480
Well, exactly, to get the job.

02:28.480 --> 02:32.240
No, maths for a degree is, because I know people that did maths at LSE,

02:32.240 --> 02:35.200
and they were really good maths students at A-level or whatever,

02:35.200 --> 02:37.360
but university level maths is incredibly demanding.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.120
I mean, you must be really good at maths.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.520
It was my thing as a kid.

02:41.520 --> 02:41.840
Yeah.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.440
Yeah, I won a few competitions.

02:43.440 --> 02:44.640
Math was my thing as a kid.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.640
It's just sort of the way my mind works.

02:48.640 --> 02:51.360
But I thought I could just go and just kill the maths exams and get a job.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.760
But I remember sort of coming back second year, and suddenly,

02:55.760 --> 02:58.960
everyone at LSE is just, they start talking in acronyms,

02:58.960 --> 03:04.160
CDSEs, M&As, MBOs, you know, CDOs, IBD, and I was thinking,

03:04.160 --> 03:04.880
what is going on?

03:04.880 --> 03:06.240
I didn't know anything.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.920
I spoke to a friend and he was like,

03:08.320 --> 03:10.320
you have to apply for 35 internships.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.480
And you hope you get one, and then that's how you get a job.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.760
And all of these guys, LSE,

03:16.560 --> 03:20.160
LSE is literally full of kids of Russian oligarchs

03:20.160 --> 03:23.600
and the Chinese Politburo, this international billionaire

03:23.600 --> 03:24.320
sending the kids to LSE.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.000
And they'd all been prepping from when they were kids.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.520
They'd all started a charity and checked through the Sahara Desert.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.760
How long did it take you to work this out at the LSE?

03:33.760 --> 03:35.040
How long did it take you to work out,

03:35.040 --> 03:37.440
okay, the people I'm now studying with at university,

03:37.440 --> 03:39.920
it's not like the creme de la creme of the kids at school,

03:39.920 --> 03:42.320
which was what you think it is before you go to university,

03:42.320 --> 03:44.080
but it's actually people I've never met before.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.760
I remember I was in the math department,

03:45.760 --> 03:47.680
which is a bit of sort of, you know what math guys are like.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.560
And we went on like this sort of away day, like very early on.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.920
And I brought like a two liter bottle of like white lightning cider

03:54.800 --> 03:55.760
on the coach.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.360
And I was like, I put some cider, everyone was looking at me

03:57.360 --> 03:58.160
like I was insane.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.800
And I remember thinking, this is not like what I saw in the movies.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.480
But I was, to be honest, when I was a kid,

04:04.480 --> 04:06.480
I was like, man on the mission, I'm going to get this job.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.520
Nothing's going to stop me.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.720
And that's why it was quite dispiriting to realize that basically,

04:10.720 --> 04:12.640
you have to send all these CVs and cover letters,

04:12.640 --> 04:14.800
and everyone, you've got to fluff it with all this stuff, right?

04:14.800 --> 04:17.040
Like I played clarinet at the Royal Albert Hall,

04:17.040 --> 04:18.240
you know what I mean, this kind of stuff.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.640
And literally, I was fluffing pillows at DFS.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.960
That's all I had, you know, I tried to be a grime rapper,

04:22.960 --> 04:24.240
you know, you can't put that on your CV.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.920
You know, I had the little jacket with cadaverous crew in on the back of it.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.720
But like, so I was thinking, how am I going to get this job basically?

04:30.720 --> 04:32.240
And I didn't know what to do.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.800
So I just figured like, I didn't make a single application

04:35.440 --> 04:39.360
because I knew I would never beat these guys on CV and cover letter.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.960
Like there's nothing, literally, I'm fluffing pillows at DFS in Bekton.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.400
You know, I'm not going to get a job with that.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.680
So I figured I would just like try and kill these exams

04:47.680 --> 04:52.480
and like be very sort of like loud about it and hope somebody notices.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.280
And basically, somebody did notice because a guy from near above said,

04:57.280 --> 04:59.920
just I never even met the guy, came up to me in the library one day and he said,

05:00.560 --> 05:02.560
Citibank has one trailer you to a card game.

05:02.560 --> 05:03.840
It's a maths game.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.280
You win that game, you can get a job.

05:05.280 --> 05:09.120
And I was sort of my ears pricked up because it's like maths.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.000
I'm good at maths.

05:10.000 --> 05:10.720
I'm good at games.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.160
So let's just do this.

05:12.160 --> 05:12.320
Right.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.840
And he explained like the rules of the game to me.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.160
And then I went to the competition.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.040
I won the LSE round.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.560
And then I basically just stopped going lectures.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.960
And I just, all I did was study this one game,

05:20.960 --> 05:22.800
which was like a stupid little math game.

05:22.800 --> 05:23.680
What was the game?

05:23.680 --> 05:24.480
It's like a card game.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.680
It's like a poker style game.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.000
They make it basically like everyone has a card

05:28.000 --> 05:29.680
and there's another three cards in the middle.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.200
And you just essentially you make bets using a trading style mechanism

05:33.200 --> 05:34.880
of what the sum total of everyone's cards will be.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.240
So it's probabilities basically.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.880
Citibank, well, this is actually interesting.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.320
You say that because the way I won the game was,

05:42.320 --> 05:45.280
I knew that all the mathsy guys would just calculate

05:45.280 --> 05:48.240
the statistical expected value, which meant that

05:50.560 --> 05:52.720
if someone had a high card, they'd quote high prices.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.720
And if someone had a low card, they'd quote low prices.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.800
And you could just buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, sell.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.920
And it's kind of, it's amazing it was that easy.

05:59.920 --> 06:03.840
And other people probably should have realised what I was doing.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.240
But I think this is, I think, another thing

06:06.240 --> 06:08.000
which has sort of benefited me throughout my career.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.240
Because of the way that I look and the way that I sound,

06:10.240 --> 06:13.840
I think people just thought I was fucking an idiot basically doing mad stuff.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.000
Like, but it was easy.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.480
They were playing the numbers and I was playing the game basically.

06:18.480 --> 06:23.600
So I won that competition and the madness of it is what that meant was,

06:23.600 --> 06:25.840
you know, all these other guys who'd be like learning all these acronyms,

06:26.800 --> 06:29.040
you know, and sort of talking to like, you know,

06:29.120 --> 06:31.360
they were in the investment side, in the finance side,

06:31.360 --> 06:32.800
going to all these events.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.200
And here's me turning up on my internship.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.240
I didn't know anything.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.440
I didn't know a single acronym.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.560
I didn't know anything like that.

06:39.920 --> 06:42.640
And the madness thing of it all is, the traders fucking loved it.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.360
They loved me turning up like some kid from down the road.

06:45.360 --> 06:48.960
Like, just like, I don't know anything, but teach me and I'll do it.

06:48.960 --> 06:49.600
You know what I mean?

06:49.600 --> 06:54.400
And I think it kind of, you know, there's this myth of like the Cockney Wideboy Trader.

06:55.120 --> 06:55.840
But I don't exist.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.640
The Barrow Boy.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.440
Exactly, yeah.

06:57.520 --> 07:01.600
You go there nowadays and it's all just, you know,

07:01.600 --> 07:03.200
it's rich guys from rich families.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.320
It's the same sort of international money delete that goes to LSE.

07:06.320 --> 07:06.880
You know what I mean?

07:06.880 --> 07:10.480
It's, you know, there's some sort of blue bloods in Oxford and Cambridge,

07:10.480 --> 07:13.120
but it's, you know, Baconi and MIT.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.600
And it's all these just rich guys from rich families.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.520
So I think they saw me turn up just like a kid.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.560
Baconi just for viewers.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.160
It's a university Milan and...

07:20.160 --> 07:21.440
A finance university, man.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.360
It's like the Italian LSE, essentially, yeah.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.040
Yeah, so they loved it and I turned up and

07:28.720 --> 07:30.720
then the financial crisis happened just after I started.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.000
And then within a few years, I was the most profitable trader in the bank,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.640
which I guess we'll talk about how that happened.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.360
The Citibank.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.720
Yeah, Citibank, yeah.

07:38.720 --> 07:42.560
So you start this great job off the back of winning a card game.

07:42.560 --> 07:43.360
Yeah.

07:43.360 --> 07:47.120
An amazing story and it's like, I'm expecting a Netflix film about this.

07:47.120 --> 07:47.920
Yeah, it will come.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.680
Yeah, I suspect so.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.480
You go to work at Citibank.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.320
You walk in first day.

07:54.320 --> 07:54.880
What's that like?

07:56.560 --> 07:57.680
Trading floor is a big place.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.560
I remember getting the train to Canary Wharf

08:02.560 --> 08:05.600
and the Jubilee line makes this sort of like whooping sound.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.760
It's not like the trains that go past my window.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.120
Yeah, I remember they walked me in.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.520
I remember just seeing like massive, massive floor.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.480
I think the big thing that hits you about the trading floor is all these screens.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.440
It's like every trader has like a wall of like nine screens.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.960
Massive wall of screens like that.

08:20.960 --> 08:24.320
And they walk me around and they sort of sat me down,

08:25.600 --> 08:29.040
introduced me to the boss of the desk.

08:29.040 --> 08:32.080
And the boss is high and then he just ignores you, right?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.520
And you're sort of, you're sitting there.

08:33.520 --> 08:34.400
Nobody says anything to you.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.080
This is a thing that have very common experience

08:36.080 --> 08:37.760
when you start on trading floors is everyone says hi

08:37.760 --> 08:39.040
and then they just totally ignore you.

08:39.040 --> 08:43.120
And it's kind of your job to like get seen basically.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.560
And then you sort of start to poke around.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.520
Like, can I get you a coffee?

08:45.520 --> 08:46.320
Can I get you a tea?

08:47.760 --> 08:48.960
Can I go get your lunch?

08:48.960 --> 08:52.960
And that sort of, that's like, weirdly, like, I think

08:54.160 --> 08:56.880
I sort of just started just getting everyone's lunch for them.

08:56.880 --> 08:57.120
Yeah.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.320
And I remember this one incident.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.840
But you're an interest rate trader.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.600
Well, I mean, at first I was just an intern, right?

09:01.600 --> 09:02.480
So you're just an intern.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.680
So you've got no specific...

09:04.880 --> 09:05.680
You're just an intern.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.680
You need to get them to hire you to the desk basically.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.000
Right.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.760
And I remember I just used to try and get everybody lunch.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.800
I remember sort of one of my first, one of my first days,

09:12.800 --> 09:14.800
I got a load of people lunch and I took a little note

09:14.800 --> 09:16.720
of like how much everybody's lunch cost.

09:16.800 --> 09:21.200
And then I put the change on the table, exact, exact change

09:21.200 --> 09:22.880
next to the trader who paid for the lunches.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.360
And the trader just, he just looked at it.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.880
You know, like when somebody dropped some coins

09:26.880 --> 09:28.160
and people just looked, he looked at the money

09:28.160 --> 09:29.040
and he was like, what's that?

09:29.040 --> 09:30.320
And I was like, it's your change.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.440
And he was like, it just didn't say anything.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.160
And I was like, it's like Â£4.31.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.200
And he just slid it across the desk into his little drawer.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.120
And he looked at me right in the face and he said,

09:41.120 --> 09:42.720
on this desk, we keep the change.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.360
And I was thinking, these guys are fucking mad basically.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.240
But that's how it works basically.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.160
And then, you know, I started getting, you know,

09:50.560 --> 09:51.600
I got a lot of lunches.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.640
Eventually they sent me to get like lunch river on the floor.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.280
I think it was this kind of game dynamic

09:57.280 --> 09:59.520
because they knew that I wasn't from that space

09:59.520 --> 10:00.400
and they kind of loved it.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.760
And they were like, played little games with me.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.200
So like, on end of my internship,

10:03.200 --> 10:04.720
they sent me to buy burgers for everyone

10:04.720 --> 10:06.080
on the whole trading floor,

10:06.080 --> 10:07.920
which is like fucking 500 people or something.

10:07.920 --> 10:08.400
Right?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.360
Just called me over, Gary.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.360
Today I'm buying lunch river on the floor.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.360
And I knew they wanted me to be like,

10:13.360 --> 10:13.840
shitting myself.

10:13.840 --> 10:14.880
I was like, yeah, fine.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.680
So I did it.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.280
You know, I had to like get everyone involved.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.960
And then when I came back, I sat down

10:18.960 --> 10:20.400
after delivering burgers to everyone on the floor

10:20.400 --> 10:22.720
and they called me, Gary, Gary, you got a passport.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.680
And I was like, yeah, go home and get it.

10:25.680 --> 10:26.880
You're getting skiing.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.400
And that was like, honestly,

10:28.400 --> 10:29.920
the funniest thing about that was,

10:29.920 --> 10:31.440
I didn't even realize when you went skiing

10:31.440 --> 10:32.800
that you were in the mountains.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.840
You went to the top of the mountains.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.920
And it was like, fuck, you know, it was mad.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.480
I remember texting my dad, where's my passport on the train?

10:38.480 --> 10:39.760
So what did you think you were going like cross country

10:39.760 --> 10:40.800
skiing or something?

10:40.800 --> 10:43.040
I just, I only knew like Milton Key and Snowcenters

10:43.040 --> 10:43.920
is the only thing I could think of.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.680
I just thought it was like on a field or something.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.880
You know where I'm from.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.080
You don't, people don't go skiing.

10:48.080 --> 10:48.480
You know what I mean?

10:48.480 --> 10:49.280
I didn't know about that.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.840
But then that was how I got the job.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.440
And then 2008, I'll start full time.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.120
That was when I became like a full time trader.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.360
And then as soon as I hit that desk, the crisis happened.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.160
And that was sort of.

10:58.160 --> 10:58.960
So when do you start?

10:58.960 --> 11:01.120
Because obviously it's to the best of my recollection

11:01.120 --> 11:02.560
that it's basically August, September,

11:02.560 --> 11:04.080
things really hot up in 2008.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.680
That's like June 30, 2008.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.960
So it's just a couple of months before things go bang.

11:09.760 --> 11:10.160
Yeah.

11:10.160 --> 11:10.960
Yeah, basically.

11:10.960 --> 11:14.000
And I had no idea what was going on.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.880
But the crazy thing was the desk I worked on,

11:16.880 --> 11:18.240
which was short-term interest rates,

11:18.240 --> 11:20.240
which is basically short-term loans,

11:20.240 --> 11:22.480
was a very unfashionable desk previous.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.400
They literally make loans of like one day,

11:24.400 --> 11:26.480
which is like not a massively profitable business, right?

11:27.920 --> 11:30.640
And in the credit crisis, 2008, it blew up.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.720
It became unbelievably profitable.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.280
So like they had to really attracted all these sort of

11:36.000 --> 11:38.080
new school, like Yale, Harvard types,

11:38.080 --> 11:40.640
you know, with all of these like immaculate,

11:40.640 --> 11:42.960
like shirts with the little monogram on it.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.320
It was all sort of old school traders.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.080
And then suddenly they're making a ton of money.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.480
And I was just thinking,

11:48.480 --> 11:50.320
how do I get me some of this money, basically?

11:50.320 --> 11:51.520
How do I follow these guys?

11:53.440 --> 11:55.040
And just desperately trying to get them to tell me,

11:55.040 --> 11:55.840
like, what are you doing?

11:55.840 --> 11:56.720
How are you making this money?

11:56.720 --> 11:58.400
You're like, what's happening?

11:58.400 --> 11:59.440
And I was trying to figure it out.

12:00.880 --> 12:04.080
And it turned out, so a lot of what they were doing

12:04.080 --> 12:06.400
was basically, it was an American bank

12:06.400 --> 12:08.000
and they were lending out loads and loads of dollars.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.520
And it was super profitable

12:09.520 --> 12:10.640
because everybody needed dollars.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.680
And Citibank at this point is the biggest bank in the world.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.480
Yeah, at that point.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.120
Yeah, yeah.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.400
So they were lending a ton of dollars.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.280
And I remember sort of,

12:18.000 --> 12:18.800
I figured out what they were doing.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.160
I lent a ton of dollars too.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.920
And then I was, there was one guy who I worked with.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.760
He was like, he was a scouser.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.400
He was from Liverpool.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.840
He didn't go to university.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.840
And after I put my first big trade on,

12:27.840 --> 12:28.800
I went home and I thought,

12:28.800 --> 12:30.480
oh fuck, what if this trade goes wrong?

12:30.480 --> 12:32.560
So I went in the next morning, I spoke to this guy,

12:32.560 --> 12:33.360
this scous guy.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.160
And he said, I said, what's the risk on this trade?

12:36.160 --> 12:39.040
And he said to me, this trade will lose money.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.360
If the global banking system blows up,

12:42.160 --> 12:45.360
in which case you'll lose your job and I'll lose my job.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.640
And it'll be the end of fucking everything.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.080
But that's not going to happen.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.200
So we're going to make a ton of money.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.040
So you just cross your fingers and hope it works out.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.040
So the first couple of years, all I did was that basically,

12:55.040 --> 12:56.000
just lend these dollars.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.680
And that was super profitable in 2008, 2009.

13:00.320 --> 13:04.480
Then in 2010, that stopped being profitable.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.680
I remember this weird thing happened.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.440
The Swiss National Bank did something that fucked me.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.040
And I lost like eight million dollars in a week.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.120
And that's when I realized like,

13:11.120 --> 13:12.560
it's not really free money like that.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.960
And I have to start figuring out like a smarter way to make money.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.920
So your first year, 2008, you make 400,000 pounds.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.880
You clear for yourself personally, something like that now.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.560
Oh no, that was, that was 2008.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.720
So 2008, I started in June, 2008.

13:26.240 --> 13:30.960
2009, my boss who hired me quit basically,

13:30.960 --> 13:32.160
in the middle of the year.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.280
And how come?

13:34.800 --> 13:37.600
I think he made so much money in 2008 that like,

13:38.320 --> 13:39.280
he just thought, I'm going to quit.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.720
I'm going to like live the dream.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.960
I'm going to like build my house in California.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.520
And that's a whole nother story, which we can get into.

13:46.240 --> 13:51.120
But he quit and he said to me,

13:51.120 --> 13:52.160
you can ask me anything you want.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.480
And I said, what do I need to do to make 100 grand for the bank?

13:54.480 --> 13:57.200
At that age, so I would have been 20, just turned 22.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.160
100 grand in my mind was like the most money you could make.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.120
Like in a year basically.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.240
What do I have to do to make 100 grand bonus?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.120
You go, it's not possible.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.520
You need to make 10 million dollars for the bank.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.160
He said, I said, all right, I went back,

14:08.160 --> 14:10.720
put one massive bet on 12 million dollars by the end of the year.

14:10.720 --> 14:13.840
And then yeah, and I was expecting to get paid a bonus of like 100 grand.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.680
And I remember going to the meeting room and it was like,

14:15.680 --> 14:17.520
just under 400 grand on the piece of paper.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.880
And I remember looking at it and just being like,

14:20.240 --> 14:22.160
I remember, I could remember like it was yesterday.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.640
My boss was a massive guy and I pointed at the number.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.840
I thought it must be another number.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.280
I pointed at the number and I said, is it that?

14:27.280 --> 14:28.400
And he said, yeah.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.200
And I literally said, wow, that's a lot of money.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.000
How old are we?

14:32.000 --> 14:32.800
Just turned 23.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.880
And I think what is weird about that?

14:39.440 --> 14:40.880
You know, there'll be people who hear that story

14:40.880 --> 14:41.920
and they'll be like, that's fantastic.

14:41.920 --> 14:42.480
That's amazing.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.640
Like kids from poor background made a ton of money.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.360
That's really, really good.

14:45.920 --> 14:46.720
And it is good.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.720
And you know, I wouldn't be able to afford to do what I do now

14:48.720 --> 14:49.440
if it wasn't for that.

14:50.080 --> 14:54.320
But the actual experience of it was like weirdly quite traumatic.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.320
I remember seeing like, if I'd have had 100 grand,

14:56.320 --> 14:57.760
I would have gone home to my parents and be like,

14:57.760 --> 14:58.480
I got 100 grand.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.920
I would tell my mates, I got 100 grand.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.960
Yeah, I would have told my girlfriend about 100 grand.

15:02.960 --> 15:06.240
But like 400 grand just seemed like an inhuman amount of money.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.040
It felt like the kind of money that you couldn't tell anyone about.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.920
It felt like, I felt like, how can I tell my, I went out

15:12.960 --> 15:14.240
and I sat down next to this guy.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.320
I used to work this gas guy and he could see I was upset.

15:16.320 --> 15:17.680
And he said, go out and like sit down.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.360
And I remember just thinking like, I think about my dad.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.160
You know what I mean?

15:22.160 --> 15:24.240
My dad worked for post office for 35 years

15:24.240 --> 15:26.640
and he was probably never making much more than 20 grand.

15:26.640 --> 15:27.760
And he used to start work.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.440
He used to leave the house at like 5 a.m.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.680
And the train used to go past the back of my house.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.520
And my mum would wake me up and we try and look at him,

15:33.520 --> 15:35.120
like wave at him, go and pass the house.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.200
And obviously that's dark, you know, you see him

15:37.200 --> 15:40.560
and you think about how hard he worked day after day after day

15:40.560 --> 15:41.840
for 20 grand a year.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.640
And then here's me, just 10, 23, sitting at a desk,

15:44.640 --> 15:46.400
you know, for a year, 400 grand.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.760
It just seemed like-

15:47.760 --> 15:49.840
You were all of a sudden different to everybody you knew, right?

15:49.840 --> 15:50.960
You're sort of disconnected to them.

15:50.960 --> 15:51.440
Exactly.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.800
That is 100 grand is like a gift.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.720
400 grand like buys you out of your family,

15:56.720 --> 15:57.840
buys you out of your friend group.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.760
I remember like, I went around my mate's house

16:00.560 --> 16:02.480
and we were playing like Pro Evo.

16:02.480 --> 16:06.400
And they were all talking, a lot of them worked in finance.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.280
Oh, did you get a bonus?

16:07.280 --> 16:08.240
Oh yeah, I got five grand.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.000
Oh yeah, I got like seven grand.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.080
And then one of them said, did you get a bonus?

16:12.080 --> 16:13.120
And I didn't tell anyone.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.000
And I just thought, you know what?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.200
These are like my closest friends.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.480
I'm just going to fucking tell them, right?

16:16.480 --> 16:18.880
So I told them, oh yeah, I got 395 grand.

16:18.880 --> 16:22.400
And you could just like hear like the silence,

16:22.400 --> 16:25.440
like feel the room of this like shock.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.080
And it was almost, and then it started to feel like,

16:28.960 --> 16:30.880
it started to feel like a cruel thing to tell people

16:30.880 --> 16:31.840
in a weird way.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.200
I made this amount of money.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.600
And it was a, and it's, I know it's bizarre,

16:35.600 --> 16:37.200
but I think in a weird way it was a cruel thing

16:37.200 --> 16:38.000
to happen to me.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.080
And I know that sounds crazy, but it's just,

16:42.160 --> 16:44.000
that level of inequality, you know,

16:44.000 --> 16:45.760
I made a lot more than that in following years.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.320
You know what I mean?

16:46.320 --> 16:48.160
But like, it shouldn't exist.

16:48.160 --> 16:48.960
It shouldn't happen.

16:48.960 --> 16:49.760
You know what I mean?

16:49.760 --> 16:50.240
It shouldn't.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.880
And it's, don't get me wrong, right?

16:52.880 --> 16:54.960
I think that people who work hard and are talented

16:54.960 --> 16:56.560
and do good things should make money.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.160
I think we should live in a world where that is possible,

16:58.160 --> 16:59.280
100%.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.160
But like, people like me and people where I'm from,

17:02.160 --> 17:04.000
didn't even know that 400 grand was a thing

17:04.000 --> 17:04.960
somebody could make.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.080
I had no idea.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.760
And then like, I was thinking,

17:07.760 --> 17:09.440
if I've made 400 grand, what have the rest of these

17:09.440 --> 17:09.920
fuckers made?

17:09.920 --> 17:10.720
You know what I mean?

17:10.720 --> 17:11.760
I was just looking around,

17:11.760 --> 17:13.520
me thinking like, what is going on?

17:14.400 --> 17:16.640
So yeah, it was, it was a, it was a mad experience.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.880
You were city's most profitable trader globally

17:20.880 --> 17:22.240
at one point, is that correct?

17:22.240 --> 17:22.560
Yeah.

17:22.560 --> 17:23.920
So that was 2011.

17:23.920 --> 17:24.960
So basically like,

17:24.960 --> 17:26.720
so this is after you've lost the money from?

17:26.720 --> 17:27.040
Yeah.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.360
So this sort of just lending the dollar stopped working

17:29.360 --> 17:29.680
basically.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.040
And I had to realize, I had to think like,

17:31.040 --> 17:31.520
we're going to have to,

17:32.560 --> 17:33.840
we're going to have to figure out a smarter way

17:33.840 --> 17:34.640
to make money.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.600
And so the history of this is actually quite interesting,

17:37.600 --> 17:37.760
right?

17:37.760 --> 17:39.120
So I was an interest rates trader.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.240
We're going to get a bit technical here,

17:40.240 --> 17:41.280
but we'll keep it simple.

17:43.280 --> 17:47.120
So in 2008, all the interest rates in the,

17:47.120 --> 17:48.960
in the rich world collapsed to zero,

17:48.960 --> 17:51.040
because central bank cuts rates.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.080
We want to boost the economy.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.040
The economy is really shit.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.160
So everybody cut their rates.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.640
And then our job became basically

17:56.640 --> 17:58.080
to bet on when more rates go up again.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.360
And rates will go up when the economy recovers.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.640
You know, that's a simplification,

18:02.640 --> 18:04.960
but you know, that's basically what happens.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.400
And interest rates stayed zero from 2008

18:08.400 --> 18:11.200
until this year basically, 2022,

18:11.200 --> 18:12.160
which is 14 years.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.640
And in every single one of those years,

18:15.840 --> 18:17.280
markets and economies predicted

18:17.280 --> 18:18.640
that rates would go up the next year,

18:19.200 --> 18:21.600
which was wrong 12, 13 years in a row,

18:21.600 --> 18:22.880
which is interesting, right?

18:23.440 --> 18:25.120
These are the best paid guys in the world

18:25.840 --> 18:26.560
to do this thing.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.400
And they're wrong year after year.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.880
This is like if you studied, you know,

18:30.880 --> 18:32.160
weather forecasting at uni

18:32.160 --> 18:34.240
and you went to work at like the Met

18:34.240 --> 18:36.080
and you saw that every single year,

18:36.080 --> 18:37.280
every single day that like tomorrow's

18:37.280 --> 18:39.360
going to be like sunny and 30 degrees,

18:39.360 --> 18:40.640
you know, and they're always wrong.

18:41.280 --> 18:45.520
So, you know, this happened in 2008.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.880
And they're like, it'll get better next year.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.320
It didn't 2009.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.680
Okay, it was quite serious.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.280
Maybe next year, 2010.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.960
They're like, okay, well, just give it one more year.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.520
And sort of, by sort of late 2010,

18:55.520 --> 18:57.520
I'd seen these guys be wrong for two and a half years.

18:57.520 --> 19:01.920
And I started to think like, maybe they're just wrong.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.280
Maybe there isn't a recovery.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.520
I think the big thing for me was,

19:05.520 --> 19:07.280
because I came from a poor background,

19:08.080 --> 19:11.120
and, you know, I still had the same friends,

19:11.120 --> 19:11.840
the same family.

19:11.840 --> 19:16.560
I could see that things were getting actively worse

19:16.560 --> 19:17.520
for people from where I'm from.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.600
And it was like, well, how do you expect,

19:19.600 --> 19:21.920
the idea behind cutting interest rates

19:21.920 --> 19:23.200
is you get people spending money on

19:23.200 --> 19:24.400
because you can borrow money cheaply.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.600
Oh, it's great, spend money.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.480
But I look at the situation of my friends and family

19:28.480 --> 19:29.200
that I grew up with.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.880
These guys are losing their homes, right?

19:32.880 --> 19:33.920
Their parents had property.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.040
They'll never own property.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.880
So they're getting poor year after year.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.120
How the fuck are they going to start spending money

19:39.120 --> 19:40.960
because you give them access to a cheap loan?

19:40.960 --> 19:42.480
They don't even get access to that money.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.400
They can't go and borrow money at zero percent.

19:44.400 --> 19:44.880
You know what I mean?

19:44.880 --> 19:47.920
So I started to look at this and I started to think,

19:48.880 --> 19:50.720
I don't see it happening.

19:50.720 --> 19:51.600
I don't see it happening.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.000
And I guess I was in this sort of quite unique position

19:54.000 --> 19:55.520
because there's not many people that go from

19:55.520 --> 19:58.480
poor backgrounds to working in trading nowadays.

19:58.480 --> 20:02.640
So I could see what it was like for ordinary people.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.000
And I could also see what it was like

20:04.000 --> 20:05.680
for these rich guys working in the city.

20:05.680 --> 20:06.960
You know, it's a bunch of millionaires working in the city.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.200
Do you also think because you started in 2008,

20:09.200 --> 20:10.960
you had no sort of prior expectations?

20:10.960 --> 20:13.120
Whereas somebody has been in the industry 25 years,

20:13.120 --> 20:14.960
they've seen lots of ups and downs.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.280
And so there's going to be a bunch of cognitive biases

20:17.280 --> 20:19.520
where they say, I was here in the mid-80s.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.720
I was here in the early 90s.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.160
I was here for .com.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.520
This is just the same.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.800
But actually you didn't have any of that because there's all you knew.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.320
I guess they're used to interest rates up and down.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.240
They weren't used to this sort of flat lining, I think.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.680
But you know, I think if you consider how long that went on for,

20:33.680 --> 20:36.320
you know, even at the beginning of 2020,

20:36.320 --> 20:38.480
people were still predicting rates going to go up later that year.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.480
That's 12 years.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.240
12 years of incorrect predictions.

20:42.240 --> 20:42.800
It's incredible.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.400
I think that's, you know,

20:44.400 --> 20:46.800
we could have a whole discussion about why it is that happens.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.800
And you know, I went back to Oxford 2017-2019

20:50.800 --> 20:51.840
and I asked one of the professors,

20:51.840 --> 20:53.200
we had an electoral interest rates.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.000
And I went up to him afterwards and I said,

20:56.000 --> 20:56.800
why do you think we were so,

20:56.800 --> 20:58.480
we were wrong on these interest rates for so long?

20:59.040 --> 21:01.120
And he said, oh no, we always knew rates would stay zero.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.480
And I was like, I didn't know what to say to that

21:04.480 --> 21:06.000
because, you know, this is my job, you know.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.480
I know for fact that these guys predicted interest rates

21:08.480 --> 21:09.680
would go back up every single year.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.280
And I was like, no, you didn't.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.000
It was like, yeah, we knew.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.800
We knew.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.240
I just said, I'm going to go home.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.480
I'm going to send you the data and then we're going to talk about it.

21:16.480 --> 21:17.680
2017, he said that.

21:17.680 --> 21:18.320
Yeah, 2017.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.000
Because even you had Janet Yellen before then

21:20.000 --> 21:22.480
putting up US interest rates in like 2014, 2015,

21:22.480 --> 21:24.240
they were saying, oh, we're going to try and go back to normal.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.800
Yeah, which eventually came down again.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.280
Yeah.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.240
And I said, so I sent him the data and he was like, oh, that's interesting.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.840
Yeah, we have been wrong for 10 years.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.360
And his guy, right,

21:35.120 --> 21:37.840
professor of macroeconomics at Oxford University,

21:38.400 --> 21:39.920
he's been wrong for 10 years.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.400
Not only has he been wrong for 10 years in a row,

21:42.400 --> 21:44.320
he's not realized that he's done that.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.040
That is the level we are at here of economics.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.240
But look at this guy, rich guy, rich family.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.760
He used to wear a nice snake skin belt.

21:51.760 --> 21:52.320
You know what I mean?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.360
He doesn't get hurt, does he?

21:55.360 --> 21:57.360
This guy's wrong 10 years in a row.

21:57.360 --> 21:58.640
He never gets hurt.

21:58.640 --> 21:59.920
Of course, he doesn't notice.

21:59.920 --> 22:00.400
You know what I mean?

22:00.400 --> 22:01.200
I always, you know,

22:01.200 --> 22:03.200
I wrote some articles at the beginning of COVID saying like,

22:03.200 --> 22:05.360
this is going to cause a massive increase in inequality.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.120
It's going to cause a massive increase in house prices.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.800
It's going to cause a massive inflationary crisis.

22:08.800 --> 22:09.200
Okay.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.120
At the same time, Larry Elliott,

22:11.120 --> 22:13.760
like chief economics editor at The Guardian,

22:13.760 --> 22:15.360
was writing house prices are going to collapse.

22:15.360 --> 22:15.600
Okay.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.520
That was obviously wrong.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.880
Who's punishing Larry Elliott?

22:18.880 --> 22:19.680
You know what I mean?

22:19.680 --> 22:21.920
But why was, wait, so at the beginning of COVID?

22:21.920 --> 22:23.920
Yeah, because there was briefly,

22:23.920 --> 22:25.440
there was briefly a buyer's market

22:26.000 --> 22:29.600
because you did have lots of people with like student homes,

22:29.600 --> 22:31.600
buy to let landlords, they just thought,

22:31.600 --> 22:34.240
you know what, this is going to be unoccupied for God knows how long.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.760
The margins are low, you should get rid.

22:35.760 --> 22:38.160
So you got, you did get a big flood of those properties.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.120
For a brief moment, yeah.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.080
For about three, four months.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.640
I remember, and it was less that the market fell,

22:42.640 --> 22:43.760
there was just uncertainty.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.280
So you could get real value.

22:45.280 --> 22:45.600
Yeah.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.360
But I think what people were missing was,

22:47.360 --> 22:49.360
we knew at the beginning of COVID,

22:49.360 --> 22:51.360
the government is going to give a shit ton of money out.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.920
And in the end, the government gave out 600 billion pounds,

22:53.920 --> 22:54.960
which I want to emphasize,

22:55.760 --> 22:58.560
is 12,000 pounds for every single adult in the country.

22:58.560 --> 22:58.880
Okay.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.480
That's how much money the government gave out.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.200
Okay.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.120
And if anyone was bothered to do the analysis,

23:03.120 --> 23:04.560
which basically nobody was,

23:04.560 --> 23:06.560
you could see very quickly that that money is going to go

23:06.560 --> 23:08.720
overwhelmingly to richest people in the country.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.440
You could work that out.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.800
We can go through the logic of that, right?

23:10.800 --> 23:11.600
If there's a video on my YouTube,

23:12.080 --> 23:14.320
exactly, you could see 600 billion pounds

23:14.320 --> 23:16.000
is going to go to the richest people in the country.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.280
They're going to fucking buy houses.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.480
What the fuck house they're going to do with it?

23:18.480 --> 23:22.720
You know, we're literally talking about 100, 200 grand per person.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.000
Of course, house prices are going to go.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.440
And I think there's this real,

23:25.440 --> 23:26.640
I think the big problem is,

23:27.520 --> 23:29.760
number one, there's very few economists

23:29.760 --> 23:30.800
from poor backgrounds, right?

23:30.800 --> 23:32.800
So then they're not really keyed into what's happening.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.440
And number two, they don't get punished if they're wrong.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.880
They don't get punished if they're wrong.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.320
They don't get rewarded if they're right.

23:38.320 --> 23:39.760
What sort of punishment would you like them to see?

23:40.480 --> 23:43.440
Because obviously, you mean they lose legitimacy

23:43.440 --> 23:45.440
and there's no counter incentives, right?

23:45.440 --> 23:47.120
If you're right, you get low substates if you're wrong.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.520
I'm not asking for these guys to be spanked in the streets, right?

23:50.160 --> 23:52.400
At least knowledge is that they were wrong.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.400
This guy at Oxford University, wrong for 10 years,

23:56.400 --> 23:57.920
didn't even notice.

23:57.920 --> 23:58.400
You know what I mean?

23:58.400 --> 24:01.520
At least have some, you know, I'm from a poor background, right?

24:01.520 --> 24:02.480
I walk onto the trading floor.

24:02.480 --> 24:04.640
Within two years, I'm famous because I'm the guy who gets it right.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.640
You know, I've been writing articles

24:06.640 --> 24:08.560
for like two and a half years now about COVID.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.600
And, you know, go read my articles from the beginning of COVID.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.920
Every single thing I said would happen has happened, you know?

24:14.560 --> 24:16.880
But, you know, I don't get the attention that Larry Elliot gets.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.480
He's wrong in all his predictions.

24:18.480 --> 24:22.000
You know, I mean, the problem is, if you don't have any mechanism

24:22.000 --> 24:25.040
by which people who are consistently right get recognized

24:25.040 --> 24:28.480
and people who are consistently wrong get shown up for being wrong,

24:28.480 --> 24:29.760
then you will get shit analysis.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.960
Of course you will.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.080
It's obvious, isn't it?

24:32.080 --> 24:34.160
And not only that, but it is inevitable

24:34.160 --> 24:35.680
you'll end up with a posh boys club.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.400
Because if you have no mechanism

24:38.400 --> 24:40.320
by which people who actually understand

24:40.320 --> 24:42.560
but are from don't have the social capital

24:42.560 --> 24:44.160
can challenge people who are just chatting shit

24:44.160 --> 24:45.360
but do have the social capital,

24:45.920 --> 24:47.840
then you will just end up, you know,

24:48.960 --> 24:51.520
how am I going to, how are people going to find my article?

24:51.520 --> 24:52.480
You know what I mean?

24:52.480 --> 24:53.680
You know, whereas in the city,

24:53.680 --> 24:55.920
I could walk into any skyscrapers in Canary Wharf

24:55.920 --> 24:57.200
and get paid a million pound a year.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.200
Because these guys will look at my track record

24:59.200 --> 25:00.640
and say, this guy keeps getting it right.

25:01.360 --> 25:04.160
So actually there's more of a sort of meritocratic attitude

25:04.560 --> 25:06.400
in the city than in journalism or academia.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.160
Listen, there is no meritocracy in media.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.680
And to be honest, in my opinion,

25:09.680 --> 25:11.760
I look at economic analysis in the media,

25:11.760 --> 25:12.800
that is not analysis.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.320
That is an entertainment product.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.200
If you are not taking these guys

25:17.200 --> 25:18.720
and rewarding them for being right

25:18.720 --> 25:20.240
and punishing them for being wrong,

25:20.240 --> 25:22.720
then they are not analyzing their fucking dancing.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.600
That's what they're doing.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.760
You know, like, if you want them to be right,

25:25.760 --> 25:27.120
pay them to be fucking right.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.960
But we're not doing that, are we?

25:28.960 --> 25:29.840
We're not doing that.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.640
And if you think at the same time, right,

25:32.640 --> 25:34.320
imagine you are an economist who's good,

25:34.320 --> 25:35.280
who's really good.

25:35.280 --> 25:36.960
You know what's happening, right?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.960
You can write an article that's perfectly right

25:38.960 --> 25:40.720
and no one will ever fucking read it.

25:40.720 --> 25:42.320
Or you can go and work for fucking Bank of America

25:42.320 --> 25:43.360
and get paid a million pound a year.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.520
You know, that is the system that we've built.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.880
And then we're surprised that the economy goes to shit.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.840
You know, if you want, if you want good analysis,

25:51.840 --> 25:54.400
at the very least, recognize good analysis.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.640
This, nobody's even checking the homework here.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.440
It's crazy.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.240
There is some, well, I agree with you entirely.

26:00.320 --> 26:04.800
But financial times, certain journalists,

26:04.800 --> 26:08.320
instead of Ambrose Evans Pritchard at the Telegraph,

26:08.320 --> 26:09.600
for instance, is really good on Russia

26:09.600 --> 26:11.760
and the long-term consequences of what's going on there.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.640
Generally speaking, I entirely agree with you.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.240
And like you say, the incentives are much higher

26:16.240 --> 26:17.840
to shut your gob and just make loads of money.

26:17.840 --> 26:18.960
And the incentives aren't there to actually

26:18.960 --> 26:20.480
have top, top finance journalists.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.960
And I agree with you at the BBC,

26:22.960 --> 26:24.720
which of course is where most people get there,

26:24.720 --> 26:27.920
media in the UK, in most newspapers.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.040
You might as well not bother being quite and quite informed

26:31.040 --> 26:32.160
because you're not being informed.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.520
Yeah.

26:33.520 --> 26:37.840
But there are some good sources of news, surely,

26:37.840 --> 26:40.320
because you yourself must consume new sources on this stuff.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.040
So where are they?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.720
To be totally honest, what I do more than anything else

26:45.520 --> 26:47.440
is I trade and I talk to traders.

26:48.160 --> 26:48.640
Listen.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.400
There must be, there must be, there must be creditable,

26:51.040 --> 26:52.800
there must be more creditable news sources

26:52.800 --> 26:54.640
that at least some legitimacy is given to.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.960
Blogs, podcasts.

26:56.960 --> 26:57.520
You tell me.

27:02.240 --> 27:03.520
There are good individuals.

27:03.520 --> 27:05.280
You have good individuals who have good analysis.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.200
I was never really a news reader.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.680
I hired a guy to sit next to me and read the papers

27:12.400 --> 27:16.320
and tell me like what's, because as a trader,

27:16.320 --> 27:18.400
you need to know what people think.

27:19.040 --> 27:22.320
Because as a trader, you don't make money just by being right.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.240
You make money by being right specifically

27:24.240 --> 27:25.840
when other people are wrong.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.160
So it's actually like the art of understanding

27:28.160 --> 27:29.440
the way in which people are wrong.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.160
You know what I mean by that?

27:30.160 --> 27:31.360
Because if everybody knows something,

27:31.360 --> 27:32.000
it's not monetized.

27:32.000 --> 27:32.800
It's not valuable exactly.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.640
To be honest, I mean, I watch the news now largely because

27:39.680 --> 27:42.720
I've moved away from purely financial analysis.

27:42.720 --> 27:45.280
And now I'm in a space where what I want to do

27:45.920 --> 27:47.520
is explain to people what's happening

27:47.520 --> 27:50.640
to change the way that they view it and the way that they act.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.400
So I need to know what you're being told

27:52.400 --> 27:54.080
so I can explain to you why it's wrong.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.760
There are good people who do good analysis.

27:55.760 --> 27:57.280
There's, oh, I forget the names now.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.040
There's the Norwegian guy at Financial Times.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.480
I spoke to him, I should remember his name.

28:00.480 --> 28:01.200
He's quite good.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.800
But to be honest, when it comes to economics,

28:04.800 --> 28:08.400
like I trade.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.080
I trade.

28:10.080 --> 28:10.880
That's what I do.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.560
In terms of long-term market signals,

28:12.560 --> 28:13.840
in terms of political risk,

28:13.840 --> 28:15.440
and you think this might happen or this might happen,

28:15.440 --> 28:17.840
where are you saying, oh, that's good information then?

28:17.840 --> 28:18.960
So I talk to traders all the time.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.560
The long-term implications, for instance,

28:20.560 --> 28:24.240
of Russia's invasion of Ukraine

28:24.240 --> 28:26.800
and what that means are the kinds of trades

28:26.800 --> 28:28.000
you'd be involved in.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.520
Clearly, you need source of information about that

28:29.520 --> 28:31.280
because you're not in Ukraine.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.920
Yeah, I mean, I think it's important basically

28:35.920 --> 28:37.840
to know what you know about and what you don't know about.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.760
I think that actually, in my opinion,

28:39.760 --> 28:41.600
the economic significance,

28:41.600 --> 28:43.680
the war in Ukraine is obviously a terrible thing.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.080
But the economic significance of it in this country,

28:46.080 --> 28:48.720
I think has been significantly overplayed, in my opinion.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.040
I think that the inflation that we're seeing,

28:51.040 --> 28:52.960
specifically in energy markets,

28:52.960 --> 28:54.720
of course, it's affected the energy markets, right?

28:54.720 --> 28:56.720
But look what's happening to London housing,

28:56.720 --> 28:57.680
what's happening to London rents.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.520
So Vladimir Putin didn't do that.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.320
And I've been saying, from the beginning of COVID,

29:02.320 --> 29:05.120
you know, we're giving 600 billion pounds to rich people.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.040
If you don't expect an inflation in Christ after that,

29:07.040 --> 29:08.400
then you don't understand money.

29:08.400 --> 29:12.000
So you would put, let's say, well, we're at 10% now

29:12.000 --> 29:13.440
and we don't know where we're going.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.200
It was scheduled to go significantly higher.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.280
We don't know because there's big intervention from government.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.920
You would say, actually, the inflation we're seeing in this country

29:19.920 --> 29:22.720
is more to do with quantitative easing

29:22.720 --> 29:25.040
and printing money than Vladimir Putin.

29:25.040 --> 29:28.480
I would say it's to do with the very large government deficit

29:28.480 --> 29:30.480
during COVID and who ended up with that money.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.560
I think people don't realize that there's two sides to the balance sheet, right?

29:34.560 --> 29:36.640
If the government gives out 600 billion pounds,

29:36.640 --> 29:38.800
then somebody gets 600 billion pounds.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.640
600 billion pounds is a fucking lot of money, right?

29:40.640 --> 29:44.080
That's 12,000 pounds per adult in the entire country.

29:44.080 --> 29:49.280
So if you don't have 12,000 pounds more cash now than you had three years ago,

29:49.280 --> 29:51.200
someone's got your 12,000 pounds.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.080
That's a lot of fucking money.

29:52.080 --> 29:55.840
And if you, you know, if we assume that that all went to top 10%, right,

29:55.840 --> 29:58.800
which I think is a good sort of first order approximation,

29:58.800 --> 30:02.800
that means every single adult in the top 10% richest people in the country

30:02.800 --> 30:06.960
getting 120 grand cash, that fucking happened.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.840
You know, and where did that cash go?

30:10.640 --> 30:12.720
Well, they're going to, well, I think the thing is,

30:12.800 --> 30:16.080
the interesting thing is you can't get rid of it once it's out there, right?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.040
It only circulates, right?

30:17.040 --> 30:19.360
So the first thing they do is they try and buy assets

30:19.360 --> 30:20.400
because that's what rich people do.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.160
So that's why we saw this massive boom in the stock market

30:22.160 --> 30:24.160
and that's why we saw this massive boom in house prices.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.880
But the thing about that is that doesn't get rid of the money, right?

30:26.880 --> 30:28.720
I try and buy your house, you try and buy my house,

30:28.720 --> 30:30.160
we're just stopping the money between us.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.680
So the prices go up.

30:31.680 --> 30:35.360
What you will see is some richer people buying the houses of poorer people

30:35.360 --> 30:37.360
and that will often happen generationally.

30:37.360 --> 30:40.240
So for example, a lot of my friends from poorer backgrounds

30:40.320 --> 30:43.440
who've been saving up really hard 70, 80 grand deposits.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.000
Nowadays, you can't buy a house with 70, 80 grand deposit in London.

30:46.640 --> 30:49.760
Suddenly, they're competing with the kids of richer families.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.760
Their parents giving them the 300 grand and then so they don't get the house.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.920
So what you see is generationally houses

30:55.920 --> 30:58.000
that would have been bought by kids from poorer families

30:58.000 --> 30:59.600
are now being bought by kids from richer families.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.320
So you do see a loss of asset ownership in the poor.

31:02.880 --> 31:05.680
But essentially, the money doesn't disappear, it just circulates.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.400
If the government gives money out until the government taxes it back,

31:08.400 --> 31:10.080
people will have more money.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.480
And the big question is, who will have more money?

31:12.480 --> 31:15.280
And that is the question that nobody was asking during COVID.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.840
Do you think quantitative easing was a mistake then?

31:17.840 --> 31:20.960
Because obviously that creation of more money isn't just a response to COVID.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.920
That's been the default alongside low interest rates since 2008.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.120
That's a really good question.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.560
And my answer is actually no.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.400
And I think that might surprise some people.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.920
When I say what I said that inflation was caused

31:31.920 --> 31:34.240
by the government giving money out and by the low interest rates,

31:34.240 --> 31:36.880
you might think that I'm opposed to the government giving money out and low interest rates.

31:36.880 --> 31:37.520
I'm not.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.040
The government had to do that.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.560
I'm not opposed to furlough at all.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.760
I'm not opposed to the massive deficits the government ran during COVID at all.

31:43.760 --> 31:44.560
Those had to be done.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.240
Otherwise, people would have literally died.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.280
People would have not paid the rent.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.080
People would have become homeless.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.200
People would have not been able to eat.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.320
Had to be done.

31:50.320 --> 31:53.280
But at the same time, if you're giving out Â£600 billion,

31:53.280 --> 31:56.000
you have to do an analysis of who's going to end up with this money.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.600
And if that analysis had been done,

31:57.600 --> 32:01.760
then we would have seen, well, we're injecting a massive amount of money to the rich here.

32:01.760 --> 32:02.560
A massive amount.

32:02.560 --> 32:06.080
And then we had the period of lockdown when that money wasn't damaging,

32:06.080 --> 32:08.320
because the rich couldn't really spend it, because they're locked at home.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.120
We could have used that one and a half years, two years, to say,

32:11.120 --> 32:14.720
okay, we have to do this thing, which is going to make the rich fucking rich.

32:14.720 --> 32:19.360
So we use the time we have to work out a way to tax them effectively to take that money back.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.600
If you give Â£600 billion to the rich, and you don't want to see effects,

32:23.600 --> 32:25.120
you have to find ways to take that money back.

32:25.120 --> 32:28.720
And we had a year and a half where we could have had a sensible conversation about,

32:28.720 --> 32:31.920
okay, look, COVID's shit, we had to do this thing,

32:31.920 --> 32:33.920
and it's going to massively increase inequality.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.880
We need to figure out how to stop that from happening.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.520
And we didn't have that conversation, because nobody was talking about who's

32:39.520 --> 32:40.240
going to end up with this money.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.400
So the problem is not that the money was given out.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.920
And the problem is not the low interest rates.

32:43.920 --> 32:48.960
The problem is, we have an economic system here that is very happy to give tons of money to the rich,

32:48.960 --> 32:52.480
and has no mechanism of reliably getting money from the rich.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.160
That is fucking not sustainable.

32:54.160 --> 32:58.560
And the thing that really worried me, now you see energy prices going up,

32:58.560 --> 33:03.680
what's the solution, Â£150 billion direct from the government to the energy companies.

33:03.680 --> 33:07.280
So if you believe my analysis that the government deficit

33:07.280 --> 33:09.920
and increasing inequality caused inflation,

33:09.920 --> 33:13.760
their solution is another massive government deficit that will increase inequality.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.840
And I went out and I saw the fuck ton of government bonds,

33:15.840 --> 33:18.960
because I was like, these guys are trying to fix inflation with inflation.

33:18.960 --> 33:24.480
Listen, you need to have the systemic ability to take wealth away from rich people,

33:25.040 --> 33:28.640
because there's a massive systemic force to give wealth to rich people.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.760
If every time there's a crisis, you give a fuck ton to the rich,

33:31.760 --> 33:34.240
and you have no mechanism of taking money back from the rich,

33:34.240 --> 33:37.440
then you will impoverish and bankrupt your government and your fucking middle class.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.440
And we're seeing it in front of our eyes.

33:39.440 --> 33:44.160
And what frustrates me the most is just the lack of a discussion of,

33:44.160 --> 33:49.840
listen, in Covid we gave them Â£600 billion with no mechanism of getting it back from them.

33:49.840 --> 33:53.040
Well, in fact, we've actually just reduced their taxes.

33:53.040 --> 33:56.320
I mean, that was one of the maddest things I've seen in my life.

33:56.320 --> 34:01.680
And yeah, but when I saw that, I got very emotional when I saw that.

34:01.680 --> 34:05.520
When I saw that, you know, and this is for you and for me, right?

34:05.520 --> 34:10.320
When I saw that, I thought this is because me and people like me

34:10.320 --> 34:13.360
have not explained clearly enough to the people of this country

34:13.360 --> 34:19.120
that if the government gives you Â£10 and the rich Â£1,000, you are getting poorer.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.480
Because in Covid, the average family accumulated like one, two grand cash,

34:22.480 --> 34:25.200
and every rich family accumulated like 300 grand cash, okay?

34:26.080 --> 34:29.200
And that had the obvious predictable consequences, right?

34:29.200 --> 34:30.480
Money is not real resources.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.600
If I give you 100 quid and him 100 grand, you have gotten poorer.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.360
So after Covid, people had more money.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.200
Explain that because they would say, no, we've both got richer,

34:37.200 --> 34:39.280
but they've just got much richer than I have.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.640
Let's break this down.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.560
Money is not food.

34:42.560 --> 34:43.920
Money is not energy.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.440
Money is not housing.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.120
Money is not healthcare, okay?

34:47.120 --> 34:51.040
If we give everybody money, we have not increased the amount of actual resources

34:51.040 --> 34:52.960
and assets we have in our society, okay?

34:52.960 --> 34:55.760
So you don't make society richer by giving people money.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.680
You make society richer by creating and having more resources and assets.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.640
So if I give everybody more money, all that happens is the prices go up.

35:02.640 --> 35:05.520
But if I give you a bit of money and him a lot of money,

35:05.520 --> 35:08.080
then he gets richer and you get poorer because you have a bit more money,

35:08.080 --> 35:11.920
but the prices have gone up relative to both of your increases in money.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.280
So I think this is the thing I want to...

35:13.280 --> 35:16.320
And the reason I'm hammering this down is because they did that in Covid

35:16.320 --> 35:17.440
and they got away with it.

35:17.440 --> 35:22.960
And to be honest, the conservative government lucked out with the Ukraine war

35:22.960 --> 35:24.960
because that took the entire blame for the inflation,

35:24.960 --> 35:28.000
which in my opinion was caused by their massive increase in inequality.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.120
And because they got away with it, I'm not surprised to see them do it again

35:31.120 --> 35:33.680
because what they did in the tax cuts was quite interesting, right?

35:33.680 --> 35:37.120
They cut the taxes on ordinary people by a little bit, like 50 quid a month.

35:38.320 --> 35:41.120
Let's just... for our audience, we've got a bunch of tax cuts here,

35:41.120 --> 35:42.400
so corporation tax didn't go up.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.680
We'll park that for a moment.

35:43.680 --> 35:47.520
The basic rate, which we all pay, cut by 1%,

35:47.520 --> 35:50.000
but that benefits wealthier people far more than ordinary people.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.080
Well, yeah, they cut the basic rate by 1%.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.360
It doesn't really give you that much more money.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.560
It's like 50 quid a month, you know?

35:54.560 --> 35:57.200
And only if you're like a higher middle learner,

35:57.200 --> 35:59.040
if you're a lower middle learner, it doesn't benefit you at all, right?

35:59.040 --> 36:00.960
But they cut your taxes a tiny bit

36:00.960 --> 36:03.440
and then they cut the taxes of millionaires by like 50 grand.

36:04.320 --> 36:07.040
And then my mate called me up, he's from an ordinary background,

36:07.040 --> 36:08.480
and I was explaining that to him and he was like,

36:08.480 --> 36:11.440
you know, I think my mates might be happy because they got this 50 quid tax cut, right?

36:11.440 --> 36:14.080
And people need to understand if the government gives you 50 quid

36:14.080 --> 36:16.400
and the rich 50 grand, you will have more money

36:16.400 --> 36:20.080
and you will get less food, less energy, less housing, less health care,

36:20.080 --> 36:25.440
because money is the asset that we use to determine the distribution of real assets.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.360
Money does not make people rich.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.200
Money is how we determine distribution.

36:30.240 --> 36:32.080
Yeah, you can have as much money as you want, right?

36:32.080 --> 36:34.160
If it doesn't buy you housing, if it doesn't buy you food,

36:34.160 --> 36:35.760
it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, does it?

36:35.760 --> 36:37.920
So people need to understand that because the government

36:38.960 --> 36:42.880
has struck on this idea here where we give every poor person a bit of cash,

36:42.880 --> 36:45.040
and we give every rich person a ton of cash.

36:45.040 --> 36:49.520
And then the end result is prices go up a ton and ordinary people,

36:49.520 --> 36:51.200
they don't understand why they're getting poorer.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.040
Why? Because I've got more money, why is it happening?

36:53.040 --> 36:54.720
And it's not just the inflation, obviously, like you said.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.360
Wealthy people, they don't need to spend money,

36:57.360 --> 36:59.760
they've already got loads of money, so they pump that into assets.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.600
And then, of course, the assets are generally

37:02.640 --> 37:06.480
ways for them to make more money because they're living off the revenues from those assets.

37:06.480 --> 37:10.320
And of course, that's the rentierism that poor people find themselves subject to.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.320
I always say, yeah, I always say this, you know,

37:12.320 --> 37:14.240
we talk about shook with economics, if you give them money,

37:14.240 --> 37:16.960
that the wealth create is like they're fucking Gandalf or something, right?

37:16.960 --> 37:18.320
If you give them money, they'll boost the economy.

37:18.800 --> 37:22.320
If you give these guys money, they're going to fucking buy your mum's house.

37:22.320 --> 37:23.520
That is what they're going to do.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.480
Listen, my friends' mums had houses, and my friends will never have houses.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.720
Those houses are not fucking disappearing.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.760
Those houses are owned by rich people's kids now.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.920
That is what this means.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.360
This is ordinary families losing their fucking homes,

37:37.360 --> 37:39.520
and they will never have houses again.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.360
Their kids won't have houses, their grandkids,

37:41.360 --> 37:43.200
this is serious.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.200
You cannot give all of your assets away and expect not to be poor.

37:47.200 --> 37:50.480
Not only that, but we're giving the assets away to this group of rich people

37:50.480 --> 37:53.040
who are internationally mobile and don't pay any fucking taxes.

37:53.680 --> 37:58.320
I think it's, you know, I was not born and raised political.

37:58.320 --> 38:01.600
I do this because it was my job to look into the future

38:01.600 --> 38:03.680
and tell you what is going to happen to the economy.

38:03.680 --> 38:07.680
If we do not find a way to tax rich people seriously,

38:07.680 --> 38:10.560
the future of this economy is going to be a disaster.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.840
It's going to be a disaster because the government's going further into debt.

38:13.840 --> 38:15.600
Ordinary families are losing their homes.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.280
Ordinary families are going further into debt,

38:17.280 --> 38:20.000
and the homes are going to the rich and the debt is to the rich.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.360
And it's, as you say, what that means then is you pay more rent to the rich.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.960
You pay higher mortgages to the rich.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.960
So as inequality gets bigger,

38:26.960 --> 38:30.320
the cash flows from ordinary families to the rich get bigger,

38:30.320 --> 38:31.920
which means inequality will get bigger still.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.440
So it creates this really negative spiral.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.160
You know, this is all, it's not an optimistic outlook,

38:36.160 --> 38:37.200
but that is why I do what I do.

38:37.200 --> 38:39.360
And but the thing that is most maddening is,

38:39.360 --> 38:42.320
and also the thing which can give us a bit of hope is it's fixable

38:42.320 --> 38:44.000
because those assets have not disappeared.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.200
They are owned by the rich.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.960
And if we fix our tax system,

38:46.960 --> 38:50.400
we can, we can, we can get them given back to ordinary families.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.240
You've got a quote here, which I'm going to refer to.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.280
You've been a successful trader.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.080
We've talked about that.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.360
You're academically credentialed.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.160
We talked about that.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.000
I mean, it helps to be good in both fields

39:00.000 --> 39:01.600
because then people can't try and discredit you.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.680
You did maths and economics at the LSE and feel like you said Oxford.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.920
But you've said, quote, throw your textbooks in the bin

39:09.920 --> 39:12.800
if you want to really learn about economics.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.240
So you've already talked about that one academic

39:14.320 --> 39:16.080
who thought he wasn't a serious guy.

39:16.720 --> 39:17.760
You're basically saying, look,

39:17.760 --> 39:19.120
if you want to know what the story is,

39:19.680 --> 39:22.160
don't bother with the sort of fusty dons

39:22.160 --> 39:24.000
at these allegedly top universities.

39:24.000 --> 39:24.240
Yeah.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.800
That is a line from this Scous Trader who I used to work with.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.080
He was the only trader I worked with.

39:28.080 --> 39:28.960
He didn't go to university.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.160
He's from Liverpool and he worked,

39:30.160 --> 39:32.160
he worked on the cash desk when he was 18

39:32.160 --> 39:34.400
and he worked as we're up to being like the top trader of Citibank.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.480
And I was a Citibank's top trader in 2011

39:36.480 --> 39:40.400
and he was Citibank's top trader in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.440
This guy was a fucking genius.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.880
And when I got smashed that,

39:42.880 --> 39:44.480
when I lost that $8 million that one week,

39:44.480 --> 39:47.920
I brought up my instinct as a good economic student

39:47.920 --> 39:49.760
was to go and bring my textbooks in

39:49.760 --> 39:51.600
and start reading it and being like, what's happening?

39:51.600 --> 39:52.960
And he came up to me and just fucking grabbed him

39:52.960 --> 39:54.000
and he threw him in the bin.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.760
And he was like, listen, how fucking old are you?

39:55.760 --> 39:57.440
And I was like, I don't know, 23, 24, whatever.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.600
You are not going to learn about it from those fucking books.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.720
You want to learn about the economy?

40:02.720 --> 40:05.040
Go out onto the street, walk down the high street,

40:05.040 --> 40:06.400
see what shops are closing down.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.000
Look at what the adverts are on the tube.

40:08.000 --> 40:08.880
You know what I mean?

40:08.880 --> 40:10.640
Is there more homeless people that you're seeing?

40:10.640 --> 40:12.720
Ask your mum about her financial situation.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.800
Ask your friends and your friends' mums

40:14.800 --> 40:16.080
about their financial situation.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.600
That is the fucking economy.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.400
And look, I'm not saying nobody should study economics, all right?

40:20.400 --> 40:25.680
But you should be using your study of economics

40:25.680 --> 40:27.040
to get you into a situation

40:27.040 --> 40:28.960
where you can analyze the real world.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.640
And I'm going to use an example

40:30.640 --> 40:32.960
to illustrate the problem that we have here, okay?

40:33.760 --> 40:37.200
So this professor, the snakeskin belt professor, he...

40:38.400 --> 40:38.880
What was the belt?

40:38.880 --> 40:40.880
Did you know the belt make was Gucci or something like this?

40:40.880 --> 40:41.440
I didn't ask him.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.160
I don't think he'd tell me.

40:42.160 --> 40:43.040
He's not my big fan.

40:45.040 --> 40:49.440
He wrote a paper where he said that if the European Central

40:49.440 --> 40:53.040
Mac didn't do QE, European GDP would be like 4.7% lower,

40:53.040 --> 40:53.920
something like that.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.240
And I was quite pleased to see him make a firm prediction

40:56.240 --> 40:57.520
for once because these guys very rarely make

40:57.520 --> 40:58.000
firm predictions.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.200
And I put my hand up and I said to him,

40:59.760 --> 41:00.480
do you think that's right?

41:01.120 --> 41:03.040
And he was like, what do you mean?

41:04.080 --> 41:05.440
And I was like, do you think he's right?

41:05.440 --> 41:07.200
He's like, I don't understand the question.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.120
I was like, do you think if that hadn't have happened,

41:09.120 --> 41:10.560
GDP would be 4.7% lower?

41:10.560 --> 41:11.840
He was like, I don't know what you mean.

41:12.160 --> 41:14.800
And this guy, he is not analyzing the economy.

41:14.800 --> 41:15.840
He's writing fucking papers.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.520
He doesn't care if it's right.

41:17.520 --> 41:19.360
He doesn't even think about whether it's right.

41:19.360 --> 41:23.360
I asked him once, why do you think people have not

41:23.360 --> 41:24.960
been spending money since 2008?

41:24.960 --> 41:28.720
And he said, I'm not really sure,

41:28.720 --> 41:30.560
but I think it's because of an exogenous shock

41:30.560 --> 41:32.080
to consumption savings preferences.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.160
And yeah, I've asked a lot of people,

41:34.160 --> 41:35.760
nobody ever told me that was fucking why.

41:35.760 --> 41:36.400
You know what I mean?

41:36.960 --> 41:37.520
And I think-

41:37.520 --> 41:38.880
But maybe they said it in other words,

41:38.880 --> 41:40.880
which is there was this global financial crisis,

41:40.880 --> 41:42.720
which then changed people's consumption habits.

41:42.720 --> 41:43.920
The more you understand what that means,

41:43.920 --> 41:45.840
the madder it is, because an exogenous shock

41:45.840 --> 41:48.240
is a technical term referring to economic modeling.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.320
It means something happened outside of our model.

41:50.320 --> 41:50.880
All right?

41:50.880 --> 41:52.960
And I've asked him something about the real world,

41:52.960 --> 41:55.840
and his answer is something changed outside the model.

41:55.840 --> 41:56.960
That is fucking insane.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.560
That is an insane thing to say.

41:58.560 --> 42:02.560
And a professor should be ashamed to say something like that.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.000
So he's saying the global financial crisis

42:04.000 --> 42:05.040
was an exogenous shock.

42:05.040 --> 42:05.440
Exactly.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.520
So you cannot describe things in the real world

42:07.520 --> 42:08.560
as exogenous shocks.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.640
That means something outside the model changed.

42:10.640 --> 42:14.320
Well, no, for instance, you could say in the early 1970s,

42:14.320 --> 42:15.680
you have a massive rise in inflation

42:15.680 --> 42:17.040
because there is an exogenous shock,

42:17.040 --> 42:18.960
which is the global oil crisis.

42:18.960 --> 42:19.200
Yeah.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.400
But you say what the shock is.

42:20.400 --> 42:20.560
Yeah.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.480
You know, it happened because of the oil crisis.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.160
Okay, something over there changed.

42:24.160 --> 42:24.240
Yeah.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.160
But you can't just describe a real world change

42:26.160 --> 42:27.440
as an exogenous shock in general.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.760
What if something changed on fucking Jupiter or Mars?

42:29.760 --> 42:30.720
So you're just saying long words

42:30.720 --> 42:31.760
because he didn't really have a proper explanation.

42:31.760 --> 42:32.240
And this is-

42:32.240 --> 42:33.360
And the problem is he-

42:33.360 --> 42:36.320
But the first is obfuscating his own lack of knowledge.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.720
But the biggest problem is he thinks that's a legit answer.

42:38.720 --> 42:40.320
And that is the problem when you have people

42:40.880 --> 42:42.640
these guys live so much in the models

42:43.760 --> 42:45.760
and care so little about the real world

42:46.320 --> 42:48.880
that they don't even realize

42:48.880 --> 42:50.560
that they're talking about models anymore.

42:50.560 --> 42:53.840
You need to be coming to grips with the real world

42:53.840 --> 42:55.040
and what is happening in the real world.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.280
And this is why I get frustrated

42:57.280 --> 42:59.680
about the lack of sort of class representation in economics

42:59.680 --> 43:01.840
because they can get away with that

43:01.840 --> 43:03.920
because they're fucking rich and they don't get hurt.

43:03.920 --> 43:06.160
You know, whereas it's my mates who fucking lose

43:06.160 --> 43:06.880
their fucking homes.

43:07.520 --> 43:08.080
It's interesting.

43:08.160 --> 43:10.000
I remember having a sort of interaction

43:10.000 --> 43:11.600
with an economist recently.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.600
Actually, I think he was formerly at the Bank of England.

43:13.600 --> 43:14.240
I can't remember what it was.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.080
He was on some subcommittee.

43:16.080 --> 43:17.840
He wasn't like a big cheese

43:17.840 --> 43:20.560
but he's a relatively sort of esteemed economist.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.800
And I think I said some throwaway remark like

43:22.800 --> 43:23.840
somebody says something about growth

43:23.840 --> 43:25.040
and I said, mate, it's a little crap.

43:25.040 --> 43:25.920
Go down a high street.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.520
You know, I live in Portsmouth.

43:27.520 --> 43:30.720
Like I go down the town center, city center,

43:30.720 --> 43:32.160
I can tell you all born with where I'm from.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.280
We ain't growing and we're not going to see

43:35.280 --> 43:37.680
real meaningful economic growth for a long time.

43:37.680 --> 43:40.160
And he said, well, that's literally why we have economics.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.600
So we don't have to like go down the street

43:41.600 --> 43:42.640
and see what's going on.

43:42.640 --> 43:43.120
Oh my God.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.280
But what's crazy is the Bank of England

43:45.280 --> 43:48.240
even has methodologies which include survey data

43:48.240 --> 43:50.720
going to talk to people and saying, how do you feel?

43:50.720 --> 43:53.920
We have, you know, survey data about consumer confidence,

43:53.920 --> 43:55.680
business investment confidence.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.680
But like you say, like they just think it's the models

43:57.680 --> 43:58.880
and like this is reality.

43:59.440 --> 44:01.200
And the actual living organism out there

44:01.200 --> 44:03.040
where we do these transactions in real life,

44:03.040 --> 44:04.640
that's just, I'll forget about it.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.280
That doesn't matter.

44:05.280 --> 44:06.880
Yeah, but what's the point?

44:07.200 --> 44:09.120
You know, I always remember when Russell Brand was

44:09.120 --> 44:09.760
getting involved in the pot.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.440
And a lot of my mates from back home like Russell Brand.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.880
He's from not far where I'm from, right?

44:12.880 --> 44:15.440
When he was, and he went on Newsnight.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.080
And at that time it was E15 Mums.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.040
You remember E15 Mums?

44:19.040 --> 44:21.120
A bunch of Mums in Stratford too were losing their homes

44:21.120 --> 44:22.960
and were getting kicked out of the area where they lived.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.640
And he'd spoken to them and he went on

44:24.640 --> 44:27.760
and he spoke to, it was Evan Davis at BBC.

44:27.760 --> 44:30.960
And I thought he gave quite like a emotional like,

44:30.960 --> 44:32.720
you know, a genuine like belief,

44:32.720 --> 44:33.920
like the plight of these people,

44:33.920 --> 44:35.280
look what's happened to these people.

44:35.360 --> 44:39.040
And Evan Davis turned around and showed him a 150-year graph

44:39.920 --> 44:41.680
of per capita wage growth.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.440
150-year graph, right?

44:43.440 --> 44:44.720
Which is, and it's an average, right?

44:44.720 --> 44:45.440
It's an average, right?

44:45.440 --> 44:47.600
So that could be dragged up by the super rich, right?

44:47.600 --> 44:48.960
And he showed him this graph and he said,

44:48.960 --> 44:50.640
well, you know, I can see what you're saying,

44:50.640 --> 44:51.680
but look, you're wrong.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.680
I've shown you this 150-year graph and it's,

44:55.200 --> 44:57.040
this, that is sickening to me.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.240
That is sickening to me.

44:58.240 --> 44:59.520
Because here's a guy who's telling you,

44:59.520 --> 45:03.360
look, people from where I'm from are losing their homes.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.320
And the guys turn around and say,

45:04.400 --> 45:06.640
well, actually I've done the fucking numbers

45:06.640 --> 45:07.920
and it's, everything's fine.

45:07.920 --> 45:11.440
And you know, Evan Davis can say that to me

45:11.440 --> 45:13.120
because I've got fucking two economics degrees

45:13.120 --> 45:14.320
and I can turn around to him and say,

45:14.320 --> 45:15.280
well, that's a fucking average.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.440
Who fucking cares if it's just a bunch of fucking millionaires

45:17.440 --> 45:18.160
dragging it up?

45:18.160 --> 45:19.120
Doesn't help my mates.

45:19.120 --> 45:20.400
Doesn't help the E15 mums.

45:20.960 --> 45:21.440
What was that?

45:21.440 --> 45:22.480
That's a fucking comedian.

45:22.480 --> 45:24.000
You can't show him 150-year graph.

45:24.000 --> 45:24.320
It's fucking-

45:24.320 --> 45:25.520
Was that, what was it, GDP?

45:25.520 --> 45:26.080
What was it?

45:26.080 --> 45:27.840
It was what per capita wage growth, I think.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.600
And you can find, you can go over and look at it on YouTube.

45:29.600 --> 45:31.040
But I mean-

45:31.040 --> 45:31.680
But that's the force.

45:31.680 --> 45:32.720
So it's like, look,

45:32.720 --> 45:33.840
after you get the Industrial Revolution

45:33.840 --> 45:35.040
for the first 40, 50 years,

45:35.040 --> 45:37.120
there isn't actual meaningful improvements

45:37.120 --> 45:38.000
and living standards.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.320
That only happens when you get industrial actions,

45:40.320 --> 45:41.920
strikes, revolutions, riots,

45:41.920 --> 45:43.680
because they're all in class, realize,

45:43.680 --> 45:45.200
okay, well, we can't do this forever.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.000
And the thing is, Evan Davis will know something like that.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.200
It's called, you know, it's called the Engels Paws.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.480
It's named after Frederick Engels.

45:51.200 --> 45:52.640
Interestingly enough, we're going to the next question.

45:52.640 --> 45:55.200
Evan Davis was one of the people who pioneered

45:55.200 --> 45:56.080
the poll tax policy.

45:56.080 --> 45:56.880
And if you know that-

45:56.880 --> 45:57.600
I didn't know that.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.400
Yeah, he did.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.080
Just raising him my estimation even more.

46:00.080 --> 46:00.800
Yeah, he worked.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.640
He worked in a think tank in the late 80s.

46:02.640 --> 46:03.840
I can't remember which one it was.

46:03.840 --> 46:04.720
So I won't say,

46:04.720 --> 46:07.120
but it's one of these sort of pro-Proththrite think tanks.

46:07.120 --> 46:11.120
And he was one of the minds behind the poll tax policy,

46:11.120 --> 46:13.920
which is one of the most unpopular economic policies

46:13.920 --> 46:15.200
in the history of this country.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.360
And now he's just viewed as sort of some centrist,

46:18.000 --> 46:21.920
you know, clever BBC political economics finance voice.

46:22.560 --> 46:25.680
I mean, it shows you how extreme those voices really are.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.000
Let's talk about the Tori Minay budget.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.040
Yeah.

46:29.040 --> 46:30.480
Which became this massive news story.

46:31.600 --> 46:34.560
People who are watching this probably heard,

46:34.560 --> 46:35.760
I know what guilt are,

46:35.760 --> 46:36.960
but I don't talk about them very often.

46:36.960 --> 46:37.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.480
They heard lots of words like guilt for the first time.

46:41.200 --> 46:43.840
Just kind of briefly explain what actually happened.

46:44.960 --> 46:46.800
Okay, so let's break it down from basics.

46:46.800 --> 46:48.240
So the very first thing is they announced

46:50.480 --> 46:52.400
a big package of spending and also tax cuts.

46:54.480 --> 46:55.840
The big thing which wasn't expected was

46:55.840 --> 46:57.760
they had this cut of the 45p rate,

46:57.760 --> 46:59.200
which the first thing to say is

47:00.000 --> 47:01.760
that rate kicks in at 150 grand.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.600
It doesn't affect you through an 150 grand

47:03.600 --> 47:05.440
because it's only above 150 grand.

47:05.440 --> 47:08.320
So really, you're only significantly cutting tax

47:08.320 --> 47:11.040
on people who earn like 200, 300, 400 at grand

47:11.040 --> 47:11.920
or a million pound a year.

47:11.920 --> 47:14.720
So it's a big tax cut specifically for very high earners.

47:15.440 --> 47:16.560
Markets weren't expecting that.

47:16.560 --> 47:22.560
And traders looked at that and the next thing to say is,

47:22.560 --> 47:25.040
you know, these were unfunded tax cuts.

47:25.040 --> 47:27.600
So what that means is the government is planning

47:27.600 --> 47:28.640
to borrow that money.

47:28.640 --> 47:30.960
So, you know, it means we're getting less money in.

47:30.960 --> 47:32.880
We're having to spend more money on things like energy.

47:32.880 --> 47:33.920
We're going to borrow the difference.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.080
And when you borrow money,

47:36.080 --> 47:37.360
when the government borrows money,

47:37.360 --> 47:38.400
it doesn't just come out of thin air.

47:38.400 --> 47:41.200
They borrow it from people, essentially from rich people

47:41.200 --> 47:43.040
and those decisions of whether to lend it or not

47:43.040 --> 47:43.920
are made by traders.

47:44.640 --> 47:46.480
And the traders look at the government and they think, well,

47:47.120 --> 47:48.560
you know, COVID's finished now

47:48.560 --> 47:50.960
and we're in more ordinary economic times

47:50.960 --> 47:53.360
and you're planning to run a massive deficit

47:53.360 --> 47:57.200
just to stuff rich people's pockets with cash, right?

47:57.200 --> 48:00.480
And, you know, if you're going to run massive deficits

48:00.480 --> 48:02.080
in normal times, you know, you don't have to be a genius

48:02.080 --> 48:03.680
to be like, well, how are you going to pay that?

48:03.680 --> 48:04.640
Back then, basically.

48:04.640 --> 48:07.200
And traders basically thought, okay, well,

48:07.840 --> 48:10.720
this is not a coherent plan.

48:10.720 --> 48:13.520
So probably one of two things will happen.

48:13.520 --> 48:14.480
You're a student of history.

48:14.480 --> 48:16.000
You'll know that historically,

48:16.000 --> 48:18.240
when governments have borrowed massive amounts of money,

48:18.880 --> 48:21.120
the way they've paid it back normally is through inflation.

48:21.120 --> 48:22.800
So if you have very high inflation,

48:22.800 --> 48:25.440
prices go up, price go up, wages also go up

48:25.440 --> 48:27.440
and your tax take rises significantly.

48:27.440 --> 48:28.960
The debt stays the same size

48:28.960 --> 48:30.640
because it's fixed in nominal terms.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.320
And then it's easy to pay back.

48:32.320 --> 48:33.760
That's how the Second World War debt was paid back.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.600
So traders are looking at this thinking, well,

48:35.600 --> 48:36.720
they're not serious about paying it back.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.400
So maybe they're going to inflate it away.

48:39.360 --> 48:42.000
Not only that, but they're given a crap ton of money out.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.200
So that's going to cause inflation.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.200
So they start selling the pound

48:45.200 --> 48:46.080
because you don't want pounds.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.520
It's going to be inflation, right?

48:47.520 --> 48:49.440
You know, it basically means the pound is worthless.

48:49.440 --> 48:50.640
You can't get as much for it.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.840
They start selling the pound.

48:51.840 --> 48:52.720
The pound starts falling.

48:53.440 --> 48:56.080
The Bank of England, whose job is to keep inflation at 3%,

48:56.960 --> 48:58.560
look at that and they say, okay, number one,

48:58.560 --> 49:00.000
government's giving a crap ton of money out.

49:00.960 --> 49:02.880
Number two, pounds falling,

49:02.880 --> 49:05.120
which means our import's going to cost them all.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.960
The inflation situation is looking even worse.

49:07.680 --> 49:09.520
So people are looking at the Bank of England and thinking,

49:09.520 --> 49:12.560
okay, they're going to raise rates massively.

49:12.560 --> 49:14.000
And this is in the context of already,

49:14.000 --> 49:14.880
even before the budget,

49:14.880 --> 49:17.600
we're talking about rates going up to five, five and a half percent.

49:17.600 --> 49:18.880
So suddenly they're thinking, okay,

49:18.880 --> 49:21.680
maybe it's going to go up to six and a half, seven percent.

49:23.040 --> 49:26.080
And if you know the Bank of England's going to raise rates,

49:26.080 --> 49:27.760
then you're not going to lend to the government

49:27.760 --> 49:29.200
unless you can get a similar rate, right?

49:29.200 --> 49:31.600
You know, I'm not going to lend to the government for zero

49:31.600 --> 49:34.080
if I can get four or five percent from the Bank of England.

49:34.080 --> 49:35.440
So suddenly the Bank of England,

49:35.440 --> 49:37.280
the government bonds all go up to four and a half percent.

49:38.160 --> 49:40.960
And this creates a panic, basically,

49:40.960 --> 49:43.120
because everybody starts selling the government bonds.

49:44.080 --> 49:45.600
Pension funds, a lot of people's pensions

49:45.600 --> 49:46.480
are invested in government bonds.

49:46.480 --> 49:47.360
They start collapsing.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.920
And it basically just creates a broad market panic

49:49.920 --> 49:51.600
because traders are looking at the government

49:51.680 --> 49:54.480
and thinking they don't have a plan.

49:54.480 --> 49:55.680
They don't have a plan.

49:55.680 --> 49:56.720
They're not going to pay the debt back.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.240
Oh, they're going to inflate it away.

49:58.240 --> 50:00.000
The central bank's going to raise rates.

50:00.000 --> 50:00.640
People start thinking,

50:00.640 --> 50:02.240
well, if rates got to five, six, seven percent,

50:02.240 --> 50:03.680
what does that mean for mortgages?

50:03.680 --> 50:05.520
You know, I think this is the big question, right?

50:05.520 --> 50:07.280
You know, if the Bank of England rate goes up,

50:07.280 --> 50:08.640
your mortgage will go up.

50:08.640 --> 50:10.720
And you know, we all know how big mortgages are,

50:10.720 --> 50:11.520
especially in London,

50:11.520 --> 50:12.800
but also in the rest of the country.

50:13.440 --> 50:15.520
And if you can fund that two percent, fine,

50:15.520 --> 50:16.800
but can you fund it at 10 percent?

50:17.360 --> 50:18.400
Can you fund it at 8 percent?

50:18.400 --> 50:19.760
Well, there's this amazing data, isn't there,

50:19.840 --> 50:22.640
which says basically, obviously,

50:22.640 --> 50:26.320
people love to talk about 1990, 15 percent interest rates,

50:26.320 --> 50:28.720
but because obviously house prices are so much higher now,

50:28.720 --> 50:30.320
people have got much larger mortgages,

50:31.040 --> 50:33.200
actually interest rates at five, six percent now

50:33.200 --> 50:35.360
would feel like 15 percent in 1990.

50:35.360 --> 50:35.680
Yeah.

50:35.680 --> 50:38.160
And this seems kind of lost on a lot of analysis.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.280
Yeah, people need to, yeah, exactly.

50:39.280 --> 50:40.880
You know, house prices are a lot,

50:40.880 --> 50:42.400
a lot higher now than they were in the 80s.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.360
And you know, the reality of the situation

50:45.360 --> 50:46.720
is a lot of people,

50:46.720 --> 50:48.160
even people who are not that poor,

50:48.160 --> 50:49.440
are going to be brought into situations

50:49.440 --> 50:50.640
where they can't pay the mortgage.

50:50.640 --> 50:53.680
You know, a lot millions of people, you know, that's,

50:53.680 --> 50:55.280
and then you start questioning, you know,

50:55.840 --> 50:57.360
the economy of the whole country.

50:57.360 --> 51:00.800
You know, it's these guys and the maddest thing of it all

51:00.800 --> 51:04.080
is this situation was created simply to the government

51:04.080 --> 51:05.920
to give a tax cut to millionaires.

51:05.920 --> 51:08.560
And it's one of the maddest things I've ever seen.

51:09.760 --> 51:12.080
And it created this carnage.

51:12.080 --> 51:13.760
Eventually the Bank of England was forced to come in

51:13.760 --> 51:16.640
and agreed to start lending money to the government again.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.720
You know, there's talk about is this QE, is this not QE,

51:18.720 --> 51:20.880
but the Bank of England eventually came in

51:20.880 --> 51:22.800
and backstopped the bonds, the government bonds,

51:22.800 --> 51:24.320
start lending money to the government.

51:26.080 --> 51:30.000
And you know, I talked to traders and they're looking

51:30.000 --> 51:31.440
at the government and they're just thinking,

51:31.440 --> 51:33.040
what are these guys playing?

51:33.600 --> 51:35.200
It's such a fuck up.

51:35.200 --> 51:36.960
You know, I think a lot of people think,

51:36.960 --> 51:37.680
oh, this was the plan.

51:37.680 --> 51:38.480
This was not the plan.

51:39.040 --> 51:39.760
This was not the plan.

51:39.760 --> 51:41.680
I think they thought they'd get away with it.

51:41.680 --> 51:44.720
And yeah, they couldn't.

51:44.720 --> 51:48.000
But you know, even now they've basically backed away,

51:48.000 --> 51:49.040
you know, the U-turned on it.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.320
And I predicted they would U-turn.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.440
I put a video on Sunday.

51:51.440 --> 51:53.280
The reason I predicted that U-turn, by the way,

51:53.280 --> 51:54.000
is because I started-

51:54.000 --> 51:55.360
It's on the 45P top rate.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.880
On the 45P top rate.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.560
It's because I started getting texts from people.

51:58.560 --> 52:00.480
I don't get texts from, you know, like,

52:00.480 --> 52:03.280
I live in these worlds now, you know, I'm writing a book

52:03.280 --> 52:04.640
and I'm in this sort of publishing world,

52:04.640 --> 52:06.320
you know, I'm in the media world now.

52:06.320 --> 52:08.400
I'm getting texts from people who are not poor,

52:08.400 --> 52:10.000
saying this policy's fucked.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.440
And it's because they've got mortgages, right?

52:11.440 --> 52:12.640
You know, they've got massive mortgages.

52:12.640 --> 52:14.560
A lot of people who are not poor have got big mortgages.

52:14.560 --> 52:15.920
It's not the poorest people who have the mortgages,

52:15.920 --> 52:17.040
because they can't get mortgages, right?

52:17.040 --> 52:17.760
Yeah.

52:17.760 --> 52:19.600
And you know, these guys work in the media.

52:19.600 --> 52:21.520
They were, and you know, even these guys, some of them,

52:21.520 --> 52:24.480
you know, I guarantee you, those Tory-backed benches,

52:24.480 --> 52:26.240
they or their kids have got mortgages.

52:26.240 --> 52:28.960
You know, so what the Conservative government did here,

52:28.960 --> 52:30.960
you know, you know, I don't need to tell you,

52:30.960 --> 52:33.360
these guys have been hurting the poor for a long time.

52:33.360 --> 52:36.160
But suddenly they took this big step to hurt homeowners.

52:36.800 --> 52:39.600
And you know, a lot of people in the media are homeowners,

52:39.600 --> 52:42.160
and I just thought the media is not going to accept this.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.600
And if the media doesn't, you know,

52:43.600 --> 52:46.320
they need the media to go with it for it to happen.

52:46.320 --> 52:47.120
The media wouldn't accept it.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.480
They're going to have to back down it.

52:48.480 --> 52:49.200
Eventually they did.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.960
Well, that's the big difference to austerity, isn't it?

52:50.960 --> 52:53.040
And that's kind of what frustrates me the most with this stuff,

52:53.040 --> 52:55.760
is that after 2010 to 2015,

52:56.800 --> 52:59.840
the bottom 25% of this country were destroyed.

52:59.840 --> 53:00.960
They were crushed.

53:01.920 --> 53:05.920
And the middle class, the upper middle class,

53:05.920 --> 53:08.480
like you say, if your height, you can be even ultra-rich.

53:08.480 --> 53:11.600
If you're highly leveraged on loans for property,

53:11.600 --> 53:13.120
you might be a buy-to-let landlord or whatever,

53:13.440 --> 53:14.880
you're terrified by all of this, right?

53:16.080 --> 53:17.360
And they got a glimpse of that.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.600
And within a week, it was just amazing to see

53:19.600 --> 53:20.800
how radicalized they became.

53:20.800 --> 53:24.160
And it's like, welcome to reality for the rest of the country, right?

53:24.160 --> 53:24.640
Yeah.

53:24.640 --> 53:25.920
But I think this is kind of,

53:27.600 --> 53:30.560
you know, the rich have got unbelievably richer in the last 15 years.

53:32.160 --> 53:38.960
And personally, I think that the conservative party is basically behind this.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.720
But there comes to a point where you've cut everything,

53:40.720 --> 53:42.880
you know, the welfare state is cut to a bare minimum.

53:42.880 --> 53:44.960
If they cut that back further, it's going to be,

53:44.960 --> 53:45.920
and it looks like they might,

53:45.920 --> 53:49.120
you're going to see real, it's going to be bad, right?

53:49.120 --> 53:50.800
And it's difficult to cut stuff there.

53:50.800 --> 53:53.600
But then how do you make the rich richer?

53:53.600 --> 53:54.960
How do you keep making the rich richer?

53:54.960 --> 53:56.320
And, you know, the only assets left

53:56.320 --> 53:58.960
are the houses of the middle class now, you know?

53:58.960 --> 54:02.960
So it comes to a point where, you know,

54:02.960 --> 54:04.240
you need to hit those people

54:04.240 --> 54:05.920
if you want to make the rich richer anymore, you know?

54:05.920 --> 54:07.520
Because the economy is not growing.

54:07.520 --> 54:10.320
So the only way the rich get richer is taking assets from the rest of us.

54:10.320 --> 54:11.520
And you know, we've cut their taxes,

54:11.520 --> 54:13.280
we've cut, you know, government services.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.720
And now I think the conservatives are in this bind

54:16.720 --> 54:19.760
where it's like, how do you keep that machine going

54:19.760 --> 54:23.200
without hitting your core voter base, which is homeowners, you know?

54:23.200 --> 54:26.560
And I think they're, I think they're really stuck here because,

54:27.440 --> 54:31.440
you know, they, the only thing you can do here

54:31.440 --> 54:33.280
to prevent an economic collapse is tax the rich.

54:33.280 --> 54:37.040
And it's like their reason to be that they can't do that.

54:37.040 --> 54:40.400
So I think that they tried this thing,

54:40.400 --> 54:43.520
which is, well, why don't we, if you look at it,

54:43.520 --> 54:45.120
in a sense, it's a clever strategy, right?

54:45.120 --> 54:46.480
Because it worked in COVID.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.400
Give ordinary families a bit and the rich a lot.

54:50.560 --> 54:52.800
But the problem is, and I think this is like a great irony

54:52.800 --> 54:54.320
and something, you know, people who are on the left,

54:54.320 --> 54:56.320
such as yourself or myself should ask ourselves,

54:56.320 --> 54:58.960
the people who stopped that, it wasn't us, it was financial markets.

54:59.920 --> 55:03.040
And we need to be sending that message.

55:03.040 --> 55:05.120
Look, they are taking your assets

55:05.120 --> 55:07.040
and giving it to the rich and they're making you poorer.

55:07.040 --> 55:09.920
And you know, I think this is an opportunity

55:10.880 --> 55:12.800
because the conservatives need that wedge to be

55:12.800 --> 55:14.240
between the middle and the poor.

55:14.240 --> 55:14.720
Yeah.

55:14.720 --> 55:16.160
They need that wedge to be there.

55:16.160 --> 55:18.400
But at the same time, there's nothing left to take from the poor.

55:19.200 --> 55:21.600
So, you know, we need to convince the middle,

55:21.600 --> 55:23.760
look, these guys are not going to help you in the long run.

55:23.760 --> 55:25.120
You know, where your kid's going to live?

55:25.120 --> 55:26.400
How's your kid going to afford a house?

55:26.400 --> 55:27.520
Where your grandkids going to live?

55:27.520 --> 55:28.000
Yeah.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.800
You know, we, and we need to make the explanation,

55:30.800 --> 55:33.200
look, I know they're giving you money,

55:33.200 --> 55:35.280
but they're giving the rich a ton of more money

55:35.280 --> 55:35.920
than they're giving you.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.120
And that will make you poorer.

55:37.200 --> 55:41.360
We need to build that understanding.

55:41.360 --> 55:43.120
What I think is ironic is sort of,

55:43.120 --> 55:45.680
the riot has sort of built itself on economic credibility

55:45.680 --> 55:48.560
and like the empowerment of individual.

55:48.560 --> 55:51.200
And yet they are destroying the financial lives

55:51.200 --> 55:52.160
of ordinary families.

55:52.720 --> 55:55.040
And I think it's a great failing of us

55:55.040 --> 55:57.200
that we haven't managed to explain to ordinary families

55:57.200 --> 55:59.920
how bleak their future is on this path.

55:59.920 --> 56:02.080
And that's, you know, that's what I try to do on my YouTube.

56:02.080 --> 56:04.160
That's like my sort of mission to explain, look.

56:04.160 --> 56:08.480
And then, so I think it's, where we are now is bad,

56:09.360 --> 56:11.440
but that creates this opportunity to build

56:11.440 --> 56:14.400
this broader coalition that unites the middle

56:14.400 --> 56:16.720
and poorer people and says, look,

56:16.720 --> 56:17.680
this doesn't work for any of us.

56:18.320 --> 56:19.760
One of the most frustrating things for me, though,

56:19.760 --> 56:22.720
is people are saying, this is the Tories.

56:22.720 --> 56:24.400
And then when Labour come back in, you know,

56:24.400 --> 56:25.520
things will be fantastic.

56:26.240 --> 56:28.160
Some things will be obviously be significantly better.

56:28.160 --> 56:30.160
But like you say, our economic model

56:30.160 --> 56:32.880
is about generating revenues for a certain group of people.

56:32.880 --> 56:34.720
They're looking around for sources of wealth.

56:34.720 --> 56:36.720
What are they, NHS?

56:36.720 --> 56:38.320
And like you say, the housing assets

56:38.320 --> 56:39.680
of the middle class in this country,

56:39.680 --> 56:42.160
and they will gobble them up because that's how it works.

56:42.160 --> 56:43.760
Whoever the government is,

56:43.760 --> 56:45.280
that's where the pressure will come from.

56:45.920 --> 56:49.520
Housing, 2023, since we're talking about it.

56:49.520 --> 56:50.800
What's going to happen to the housing market?

56:50.800 --> 56:52.240
You said that you were right when

56:52.240 --> 56:54.800
Larry Elliott was wrong about house prices during COVID.

56:54.800 --> 56:55.680
What happens next year?

56:55.680 --> 56:57.600
So I'm actually quite confident,

56:57.600 --> 56:59.120
and most people won't agree with me on this,

56:59.120 --> 57:01.760
that in the medium to long term, house prices will go up.

57:01.760 --> 57:03.680
And the reason for that is because

57:03.680 --> 57:05.600
the government's giving a ton of money out,

57:05.600 --> 57:07.360
and that money's ending up with the rich,

57:07.360 --> 57:09.440
and that will, you know, rich will buy assets

57:09.440 --> 57:10.960
and that will push broadly assets up.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.600
Obviously in the short term, we've got massive headwinds,

57:13.600 --> 57:15.200
which is this massive increase in interest rates.

57:15.200 --> 57:17.040
So I think in the short term, anything could happen.

57:18.240 --> 57:21.120
I actually think, so I was of the opinion

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
that interest rates would come back down

57:24.000 --> 57:27.200
because ordinary families, you know,

57:27.200 --> 57:29.520
the bottom 70, 80% are being so squeezed

57:29.520 --> 57:31.440
by what's happening that they will not be able to spend,

57:31.440 --> 57:33.520
and that means inflation will be quite short lived,

57:33.520 --> 57:35.120
and that means the rates will come back down.

57:35.120 --> 57:37.200
But then what I saw was that the government

57:37.200 --> 57:40.240
is planning to fix that by running another massive deficit.

57:40.240 --> 57:43.520
And you know, I know you know your history.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.000
This has happened before, right?

57:46.000 --> 57:47.760
If the government gives out a ton of money,

57:47.760 --> 57:49.440
that creates inflation, and they try to deal with it

57:49.440 --> 57:50.880
by giving out a ton of money,

57:50.880 --> 57:52.800
that does not bode well for long term inflation

57:52.800 --> 57:54.240
and the long term value of the currency.

57:55.200 --> 57:57.280
So I sort of started to think, well, actually maybe

57:57.280 --> 57:59.360
we could enter a bit of a spiral here

57:59.360 --> 58:01.680
where inflation stays high and interest rates stay high.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.640
But then what happened is the market rejected that.

58:04.640 --> 58:08.960
So I think it depends on what the government does.

58:09.760 --> 58:11.760
And unfortunately, both outcomes are bad, right?

58:11.760 --> 58:14.480
If the government decides to just churn money out,

58:14.480 --> 58:16.480
which ends up going, ending up with the rich,

58:16.480 --> 58:19.920
then you will see a big rise in interest rates

58:19.920 --> 58:21.200
and a big rise in inflation.

58:21.200 --> 58:24.480
And that causes this kind of conflict, right?

58:24.480 --> 58:26.480
Because in the long run, assets have to go up,

58:26.480 --> 58:28.240
but people can't get mortgages.

58:28.240 --> 58:30.320
And I think what that would lead to in the end is basically,

58:30.320 --> 58:31.280
people who have used mortgages

58:31.280 --> 58:33.680
will have to sell their houses to the people who have the cash.

58:33.680 --> 58:36.320
Because I mean, you and I sit here and you think,

58:36.320 --> 58:39.200
oh, interest rates go up, that makes it harder to buy a house.

58:39.200 --> 58:41.440
A ton of people don't need a mortgage to buy a house nowadays,

58:41.440 --> 58:44.080
because the really rich are stacking up so much cash.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.920
And they are the guys who get paid

58:45.920 --> 58:47.760
the high rates of interest on this cash.

58:49.520 --> 58:53.040
But now it looks more likely, and this is very up in the air,

58:53.040 --> 58:54.320
we don't know what the government's going to do,

58:54.320 --> 58:57.680
that they're going to move towards a kind of austerity light model.

58:57.760 --> 58:59.440
And I think that will probably take us,

58:59.440 --> 59:02.400
if they do that to a more post-2008 situation,

59:02.400 --> 59:04.560
where it's immiseration for ordinary people.

59:05.680 --> 59:06.880
Inflation will eventually come down,

59:06.880 --> 59:09.920
because the middle class has their spending power so badly hit.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.520
And house prices end up going up,

59:13.520 --> 59:14.880
because the rich have so much money,

59:14.880 --> 59:17.040
and they need, they want assets,

59:17.040 --> 59:18.800
they want to buy things with that money.

59:20.240 --> 59:22.400
And I think that's the bigger risk,

59:22.400 --> 59:26.080
because I think people don't realize how much it,

59:26.160 --> 59:28.560
a lot of people in the middle of society economically,

59:28.560 --> 59:30.880
don't realize how much it hurts their family,

59:30.880 --> 59:31.920
especially the kids and their grandkids,

59:31.920 --> 59:32.880
when house prices go up.

59:34.800 --> 59:35.920
I think that is the risk,

59:35.920 --> 59:38.160
but medium to long term,

59:38.160 --> 59:40.160
I'm very confident that house prices will go up.

59:40.160 --> 59:45.920
And that's a very, that's a very anti-consensus view at the moment.

59:45.920 --> 59:48.720
But the fact is, and this is the thing people keep missing,

59:48.720 --> 59:50.400
and have missed this at the beginning of COVID,

59:50.400 --> 59:53.680
the rich are stacking up so much cash here,

59:53.680 --> 59:55.040
and they're not going to sit on it.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.000
They're going to use it to buy assets.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
And I think one thing that will have to happen,

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.240
is the government will end up being forced

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.920
to relax mortgage requirements, because...

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.800
We're all doing this, right?

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.480
That's why 50 year mortgage products and whatnot.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:09.520
They need to keep people being homeowners,

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.440
but they also want to make the rich richer.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.280
Well, how do you do that, bigger mortgages?

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.200
Then you can own your home technically,

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.440
you own your 800, 900 grand home,

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.520
but you also owe 800 grand debt to the rich.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.840
So you've got the home, but they've got the actual wealth.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.920
So I think that will happen.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.920
And I think the way that we fight that,

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.360
is we have to make this connection between the distribution

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.120
and the quality of life of ordinary people.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.320
We have to make that connection,

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.560
because if we don't make that, people's lives get worse,

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.760
and they don't understand why.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.720
They're like, well, I've got more money,

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.320
my house price is going up, I should be richer.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.200
But if you are getting relatively poor art,

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.640
then you will get less stuff.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.400
We've had in the last three years,

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.080
the biggest and fastest ever increase

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.600
in inequality in the country.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.280
And the biggest and fastest decrease

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.280
in living standards in peacetime,

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.640
and no one's connecting the two.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.120
And I think it's such an opportunity that we're missing.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.880
We need to say, look, you are getting poorer

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.320
because of that increase in inequalities.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.800
It's not a complicated connection.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.960
You increase inequality, you improve their living standards,

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:03.760
you decrease yours.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.800
I'm kind of surprised, actually,

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.640
the middle class aren't more angry about it.

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.120
Like, the people that shop at Waitrose,

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.840
very affluent, looking to retire in a couple of years,

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.280
there's many, many people like that who are very, very,

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.240
I'm not saying they all vote Labour or Tory or Lib Dem,

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.000
they do all three, or they don't vote at all.

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.160
But they know that they're really

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.880
fucking their kids and their grandkids.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.920
They know that.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.280
That's the connection we need to make.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.400
But they know that.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.880
Because there's polling out there, for instance,

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.720
about should house prices fall?

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:34.000
Which is really interesting.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.520
And actually, over 50% of the public

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.440
say it would be in the public interest

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.800
for house prices to fall.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.400
That doesn't mean they want house prices to fall

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.080
because it's not necessarily in their rational self-interest,

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.600
but they know what needs to happen.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.960
There's a lot of guilt out there, surely, amongst those people.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.000
You know there's this article,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.360
which always appears in the newspapers,

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.880
which is how I bought a house by saving up

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.160
and stop buying coffees.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.400
And famously, it always has, like, in there,

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.720
and then I got 300 grand from my mum, like, hidden in there.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.080
Those articles, in my opinion,

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.920
are to assuage the concerns of older property owners.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:07.920
Because older property owners,

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.720
which is massively the voting base of the Conservative Party,

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.760
have been to a large degree protected.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.640
You know, so, you know,

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.680
my parents have always been poor,

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.880
but they own their own property.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.240
And that means that, very likely,

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.320
they'll be able to live to some degree comfortably

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:20.960
until their retirement.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.640
They'll probably have to dissafe that property, right,

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.600
and they'll lose the home.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:24.960
But they've been protected,

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.480
even though they've been poor their whole lives, right?

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.120
But if they were to look more broadly

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:30.480
and to look at their kids and say,

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.640
oh, well, you know, how are my kids going to be?

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.320
They'd be like, they'd have to look realistically

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.920
and be like, fuck, that's what they earn.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.960
That's the house prices.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.840
What's their pension?

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.960
What's their retirement look like?

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.640
How do I have elderly care?

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.840
But people don't want to think about that.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.840
And then if the media tells you, well, listen, don't worry.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.000
You know what kids are like?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:48.880
They're a bit silly.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.760
They waste their money.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.200
They'll sort out.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.480
They'll stop buying the coffees.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:53.360
They'll stop buying that stuff.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.320
And they'll be okay.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.960
Those articles are there to tell.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.680
And, you know, it's easy to convince someone

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.200
something they want to believe, right?

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.440
Those guys grow out there and sell to older people

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.880
that you're protected.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.320
And we know you might look bad for your kids,

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:06.960
but don't worry.

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:08.480
We've got that.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.600
They don't have that.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.880
And we need to counter that.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.120
And it's not easy because our message is,

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.080
in some ways, unpalatable,

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.360
which is if we stay on this path,

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:16.800
your kids and your grandkids

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.480
will have very, very difficult economic lives.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.880
But we need to make that case.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.120
And, you know, those are the people,

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.240
in a sense, that we need to win.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.400
And, you know, it's their kids and their grandkids being hurt.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.840
And we need to find a way to communicate to them clearly

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.680
and compassionately so they don't feel attacked.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.000
Look, we are trying to protect your kids and your grandkids.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.280
We're not attacking you.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.800
You know, where are your kids going to live?

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:38.480
What is their life going to be like?

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.400
Are your kids going to be able to afford to have kids of their own?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.040
You know, that is the message that I think we need to be making.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.080
If there's a young person watching this

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.240
and they're thinking, I really want to get on the housing ladder,

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:52.240
and then there's loads of calculations at play, right?

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.600
Do I need to maybe move?

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.800
Or should I prioritize, et cetera, et cetera?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.840
Presumably, you would still,

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.880
it's not often on Navarro media,

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.480
we talk about financial advice.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.320
But presumably, you would therefore say to them,

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.840
given what you said five minutes ago about,

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.920
you think house prices will continue to go up,

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.040
that they should do that.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.600
I've been saying this, you know, consistently.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.480
If you can buy property.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.920
Don't wait for the market to go down.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.280
If you can do it, get on the ladder.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.640
If you can, if you can.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:16.880
Listen, if you don't have property,

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:17.760
that's not a flat position,

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:18.800
you're short one property,

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.320
because you've got to live somewhere.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.160
You know, the first thing you should be looking to do,

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:25.840
and I totally understand that in today's economy,

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.080
that means taking 300, 400,

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:30.640
if you're in London, 600, 700 grand of debt maybe.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.960
And that is risky, and that is unappealing.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.040
And I wish that we were not in that situation.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.440
But the truth is, if you don't own a property,

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.560
you are in a very precarious financial position.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.040
And the best way you can get yourself out of that,

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.160
is to get yourself a property.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.720
And you know, I wish that didn't mean

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.160
taking a massive, massive mortgage.

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.920
And I can't pretend to people

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.520
that you're not taking a massive financial risk

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.080
of buying a property.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.720
But the truth is, you are also taking a massive financial risk

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:55.840
of not buying a property.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.440
Because look what's happening to rents.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:58.640
Look what's happening to their house prices.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.480
You know, there's people in London now,

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.000
they don't even know where they're going to live.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.440
You know, and you know,

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.360
if you don't have a property, you are short one property.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.680
You need to get that, just to make yourself secure.

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.760
And I have to say when I say that, that I know,

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.520
I know full world, that that is advice,

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.800
that is impossible for a lot of people.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.600
And I understand that.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:15.920
Of course.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.440
But that is, you know, I have to tell people that,

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:19.920
and it's true.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.480
And if you are in a situation where you can't,

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.720
then you know, support me, follow my channel,

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.560
people like you, so we can come out and explain,

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:31.600
look, that it could be possible if we change things.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.520
I mean, I'll provide an example here.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.920
So I left, I left London because I'm with my now wife,

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.040
because we wanted to have children.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.200
And we knew that we had to own somewhere

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.360
to do that, because we, we couldn't,

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.480
we'd love to rent if you had five year, 10 years,

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.320
you didn't have a massive increase, et cetera,

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.920
and kind of sort of security around housing

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.360
that you say maybe have in Germany.

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:52.400
We don't have that here.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.920
So we knew that we had to buy somewhere.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.520
That meant we had to move out of London.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.880
We did buy somewhere on the south coast.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:06.160
And doing that, just open my eyes so much as to,

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.640
it's even worse than you think, if you're renting,

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.840
how rigged the system is.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.640
The minute we accessed the mortgage,

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.040
we didn't pay any stamp duty, that went.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:19.840
We then, that house in two years has gained more in value

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:20.720
than I've earned working.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.600
We actually bought in a really good moment

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.880
right at the beginning of the COVID crisis,

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.680
where lots of, like I say, sort of student property developers

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.040
just wanted to get rid of their assets, right?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.400
And I just feel like, and then as we're remortgaging,

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.800
fortunately we remortgaged just before all this happened,

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.320
you've got people saying, yeah, you can,

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.680
you can borrow against the increase

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.800
in the value of the house.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.440
And you think, this is nuts.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.520
And yet there are tens of millions of people in this country

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:47.840
who think it's not normal, not acceptable, they're virtuous.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:51.280
And it's like, you keep on being rewarded for being lucky

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.440
and then you get rewarded again and rewarded again.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.800
The people who actually down on their luck

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.440
because they couldn't get the initial cash capital for the deposit,

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.640
they keep on being punished.

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.480
And I just feel like, how do we get that?

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.880
I know renters know they're in a bad situation,

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.200
but it's like, it's so much worse than you even realize.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.160
Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, my channel,

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.160
it's mainly about sort of economics and politics,

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.640
but we do do sort of, we talk about investing,

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.760
we talk about buying property.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.560
And it's hard because I get so many messages like,

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.720
you know, what can I do to make money?

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.360
And the truth is like, you know, in the last years,

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.600
we've seen this big increase in sort of crypto

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.640
and online trading.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.000
And it sells this dream that you can sort of invest your way to wealth.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.520
But the truth is, you know, like, I live off of my assets,

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.440
you know, I'm a wealthy individual, I live off of my assets,

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.160
you know, if you come, if you come to me with like 500 grand,

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.760
then if you make 5% a year, you can make 25 grand,

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:44.800
you can live off that.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.560
If you come to me with 10, 15 grand, you make 5% a year,

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.640
you know, you're never going to make 100 pound.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.560
You know, so it's sort of, this is, and the thing is,

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.520
I want to tell people this, buy a property if you can,

01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.640
because it's good financial advice,

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.320
but I just know it's impossible.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.640
And then that's why I think what is really interesting,

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.880
you look at the journey that Martin Lewis has been on,

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.800
my Lewis Money-Saving Expert, I guess people know,

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.160
he's this guy that's like, protect your interests,

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.080
do what's good for you, change your mortgage provider,

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.360
change your electricity provider.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.240
And now he's coming out with, you have to fight the government.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.880
Because the problem is,

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.160
they, the rich have all the money and all the assets,

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.840
you are not going to beat them in that game.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:30.400
The only power you have, the only power you have is that there's more of you.

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.840
And if you try and use that by trading crypto,

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.720
you don't use that power.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.320
It's like the Kung Fu movies,

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.240
where 100 guys fight Bruce Lee one at a time.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.240
We need to explain to people that being political

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.520
is the best way to protect your financial interest

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.600
as an individual, as a family, as a community,

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.640
because it genuinely is, I genuinely believe that.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.920
And if you don't do that,

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.480
and you know, this thing recently where we suddenly saw,

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.440
a lot of nice, well-off people messaging me,

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:00.960
oh, my mortgage rate's going to go up,

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.400
and then the government backs down,

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.440
that is what happened when you act politically as a community.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.960
You force government to change.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:12.720
And I also understand that a lot of people are struggling financially,

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.360
and they struggle to have the energy to act politically.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.920
And you know, if you don't have anything to give,

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.720
don't give anything.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.160
But if you have a little bit of space, a little bit of energy,

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.600
you need to engage with this,

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.200
because you are under attack,

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.320
your houses are under attack,

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.000
your living stands are under attack.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.560
And the only way to push back is to be political.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.560
And you know, I come from a poor background,

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.240
and people where I grew up don't want to be political.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.320
But the truth is, this is what happens if you're not political,

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.280
you know, there's a fight going on.

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.560
If you don't fight it, you lose.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:47.440
Yeah. Going back to that thing about renting and homeownership,

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:49.200
because of course, if you say, well, we need,

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.160
and I believe this,

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.560
we need house prices to go down at least 10%, 15%,

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.480
and then stagnate, basically, for 20 years.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.400
And then somebody would say,

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.160
well, that means that somebody who's just bought a property here,

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:02.000
and there might be a young viewer of yours living in, I don't know,

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.400
Leicester, right?

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.000
And they've just bought a nice terraced house,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.720
nothing special, 230 grand,

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.160
and they're going to go into negative equity.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.080
Okay, they go into negative equity,

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.680
let's say for 18 months.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.280
I'd still rather be in their shoes,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.360
paying towards an asset,

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.120
which at least in the medium to long term,

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:22.240
is going to be making cash than renting.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.960
I don't understand how people think the negative,

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.480
you say negative equity and people go,

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.680
oh my God, they start panicking.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.160
Renting is much worse than negative equity.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.920
I was renting in London for 15 years,

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.920
I lost about 85 grand renting,

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.040
I've got nothing to show for it.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.040
And yet in the popular imagination,

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.840
somehow negative equity is way worse than renting.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.880
Yeah, I think what I say is,

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.440
the problem actually is the house price to wage ratio.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.720
If you think about it, that's the problem.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.480
That's gone up massively, 20 years ago, 30 years ago,

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.840
that was like three or four,

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.240
and now it's like in London, 20, 30 or more.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:56.960
So what you really want,

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.360
you can fix the problem with that house price

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.120
is coming down if you allow wages to rise.

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:03.120
And I think what's interesting is in the last 20, 30 years,

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.480
so we have the Bank of England,

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.240
who have this mandate to keep inflation down.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.160
Except housing inflation.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.880
Exactly, it doesn't look at house prices.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.480
That inflation does not include house prices.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.200
So we have a mechanism that allows house prices to go up,

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.600
but does not allow wages to go up.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.280
And because people want to avoid negative equity,

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.640
we do not allow house prices to come down.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.480
So we've created an unfixable problem.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.160
If you allow house prices to go up,

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.760
and you simultaneously will not accept

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.240
falling house prices or rising wages,

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.760
then that problem is unfixable.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.040
And I think we need to accept

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.480
that we have a problem here,

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.120
and we need to look realistically,

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:37.280
why is this so big, and how do we bring wages up?

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.520
In my opinion, the reason that

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.200
this market has become so big

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.440
is because the rich are so fucking rich now,

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:44.880
and these guys buy assets.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.640
It's not just houses that have gone up,

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.560
land prices gone up, stocks have gone up,

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.840
luxury cars have gone up,

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.000
luxury art has gone up, gold has gone up.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.800
Every single asset has rocketed in price

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.640
because the rich are unbelievably rich.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.680
People need to understand,

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.640
ultimately, there is a competition here

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.440
for who owns the assets.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.800
And if you allow the rich to be unbelievably rich,

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.920
think about it like this, right?

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.640
Imagine you are, Elon Musk is a billion or whatever,

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.920
but imagine you've got 100 million quid.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.480
Imagine that's your net worth, 100 million quid.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.920
You will make on that wealth

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.200
about five million pounds a year.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.560
Let's say four.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.240
You make four million pounds a year

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.120
just for getting out of bed.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:19.920
How much do you spend?

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:21.760
Per day.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:22.800
Per year.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.600
I could live on 15 grand a year easily.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.200
Well, you're making four million pounds a year.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.400
Yeah, but honestly, I mean,

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.160
as me, being a slightly 30 grand a year,

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.520
40 grand a year easily.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.200
A sensible person would spend 200, 300 grand a year,

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.560
live a life of luxury,

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.720
and use the other 3.7 million pounds

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.480
to buy more assets.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.120
That's what they do.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.960
And it's not that they're evil.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.840
I don't hate these people.

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:44.720
They're not bad people.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.400
It's just, if you're super rich,

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.920
you have a massive income.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.440
And it happens automatically.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.320
You just put it in the stock market.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.360
Those are the incentives.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.960
Yeah, you know, and that's so...

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.720
You create this vacuum of wealth

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.480
that sucks wealth out of ordinary family.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.920
So, of course, how's prices going to rise?

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.280
Because they have got so much money,

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.160
they're going to push it up.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:00.960
Let me ask you a question

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:01.840
that I'm actually relating to this,

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.600
because at Labour Party Conference,

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.880
Keir Starmer outlined a policy,

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.640
and he said he wanted home ownership

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.480
to go from 65% to 70%.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.080
It was 70% in 2003.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.320
So, important to say, we've gone backwards, right?

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.080
And that they would do this

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.360
basically through some government-led mortgage scheme,

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.440
presumably they would provide deposits to people.

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.480
I don't know how they would do it.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.400
They could be subprime mortgages,

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.760
presumably, which are backed by the state.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.400
I have no idea.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:26.960
That to me sounds like

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.160
you're only going to further inflate

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.040
the mortgage market, though,

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.400
because, of course, going from 65% to 70% again

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.800
means you've got massive increase in demand.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.640
Good, I'm happy to do that.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.240
But that doesn't sound like a solution to me,

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.240
if you're saying we're going to help home ownership

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.080
by increasing prices,

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.400
and, again, they're going to out ship wage increases.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.880
I think this is what happens when you don't deal

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.920
with the fundamental problem

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.000
that inequality is increasing massively.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.760
You know, how do you keep people in homes

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.360
when inequality is increasing massively?

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:56.880
You know, if you have this constant flow of wealth and assets

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.520
from ordinary families to the rich,

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.720
then how do you keep them in their homes?

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:01.920
The only way to do it,

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.360
because homes are ultimately

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.760
the largest form of wealth in the country,

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.320
the only way to do it is have massive increase in debt.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.600
And this is, if you start looking

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.960
for sort of technocratic solutions,

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.080
this is what will happen.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:14.080
You'll just end up putting people into more and more debt.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.520
And I think that is what will happen.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.080
And we need, people need to understand

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.160
that you cannot be rich without assets.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.280
And the current setup sees an enormous flow of assets

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.800
and wealth and money every year

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.400
from ordinary families to the rich.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.240
You know, you make 30 grand,

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.000
you spend all of that on mortgage, rent, food, bills, energy.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.120
That money doesn't disappear.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.480
It goes to the owner of your house,

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.520
the owner of your mortgage,

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.200
the owner of the food, the owner of Tesco,

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.720
the owner of the energy companies, right?

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.080
You earn 30 grand, you give all of it to the rich.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.000
And it is that guy, Rishi Sunaki,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.520
he's worth 700 million pounds, right?

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.520
You know, he will make every year,

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.640
he'll make 20 million pounds on that every single year.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.800
And that's where your mortgage payment goes.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.960
You know, so if you create a system

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.880
where there's this enormous flow of money,

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.840
wealth assets from ordinary families to the rich,

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.000
then year after year, generation after generation,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.560
ordinary families will get poorer.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.520
And this fundamentally needs to be fixed on it

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.880
until we grasp this problem,

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:12.560
life will get worse and worse.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.400
That is exactly why I do the job that I do.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.280
I don't need to do this.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.080
You know what I mean?

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.120
I've made a lot of money

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.160
and I could keep making more money.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.000
I could go live on a beach in the Philippines,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.760
but poverty will explode if we don't deal with this.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.040
Let's talk about deficits.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.480
It's a word that's not mentioned anymore.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.440
It was very common between 2010 and 2015.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.440
The Tories promised to eliminate the deficit by 2015

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.400
when they came into government

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.400
with the Liberal Democrats in 2010.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.160
We've been running a deficit since 2010.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:38.960
Actually, it's important to say,

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.960
we've been running virtually permanent deficits

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.320
since the late 1970s.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.520
For the Tories, quote unquote,

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:48.400
balancing the books is always this big watchword.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.880
Are they ever going to balance the books?

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:51.520
Which is to say,

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.600
are they ever going to preside over a situation

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.720
where actually they bring in more through general taxation

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.560
than they spend through public spending?

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:00.000
Because they promised to do that for years.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:00.880
It never happens.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.640
I think it will probably never happen.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.160
Okay, so, you know,

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.760
lots of people have lots of strong opinions on this.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:08.320
Governments don't need to run surpluses.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.200
You can run a deficit.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.840
The reason is because deficits get eroded over time

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:14.320
by both economic growth and by inflation.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.600
So, your debt is fixed in nominal terms.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.800
Inflation pushed all the prices up.

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.240
So, if you have growth of,

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.200
nowadays we don't get much,

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.480
but if you get one, two percent,

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.080
if you have inflation of two, three percent,

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.760
then your deficit is naturally falling

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.960
relative to the size of your economy by four or five percent every year.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:32.720
So, you can afford to run a four or five percent deficit over time.

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:33.680
You can, if that's what you want.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.840
I'm not opposed to deficits at all.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:40.560
I think the last few years,

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.400
I've seen some people sort of pushing this direction

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.920
of let's run massive deficits.

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.160
And I think the deficit in Corridor is necessary.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.400
I think the big problem that this sort of people saying

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:53.760
let's run massive deficits is,

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.040
it totally defangs people like me saying,

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.400
let's tax the rich.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.840
Because if you turn around to me and say,

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.280
there's no problem with deficits, even massive ones,

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.400
why tax the rich?

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.840
We just run a massive deficit.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.080
And then what you do is you politically enable

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.640
things like COVID where a massive crisis

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.400
led to a Â£600 billion wealth transfer to the rich.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.080
So, actually, you think the MMT people,

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.440
the modern monetary theory people,

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.720
they've got it completely wrong.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:20.560
They're providing the sort of intellectual foundations.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.720
If they're saying, and not all of them do say that,

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.920
we need to run massive deficits.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.040
Don't worry about class struggle.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.400
Don't worry about inequality.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:30.560
Actually, what they're doing is providing a license to the transfer

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.760
of wealth from poor to rich.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.960
I don't want to mischaracterize them

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.480
because it's a big community and different people

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.280
believe different things.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:38.080
And I think the high priests of it,

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.840
the people who are really into it,

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.800
often they will say, well, actually,

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.880
MMT does support taxation of the rich.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.280
The problem is the message that has cut through

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.640
is deficits are not dangerous.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.080
And the message that you need to tax the rich

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.120
has not cut through.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:51.280
Because I talk about taxing the rich all the time

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.680
and I frequently get people posting against me,

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.680
you don't need to tax the rich, you don't understand money.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.280
So, there's no doubt about it

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.280
that MMT has persuaded a lot of people,

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.640
you don't need to tax the rich.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:03.840
And I think, and people disagree with this,

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.840
but I think if you just print money

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.440
and that money ends up with the rich,

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.880
you will increase inequality

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.480
and you will decrease living standards.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.320
Distribution matters.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:12.960
It matters.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:13.920
Of course it does.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.000
You can't massively increase inequality

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.080
and not expect living standards to fall.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.760
And the last three years have shown exactly that happening.

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:24.320
So, I think I'm not against deficits.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.200
Of course, I'm not pro austerity.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.960
And government can afford to run a deficit.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.120
But if you take your eye off of inequality

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.440
and you say deficits are totally fine,

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:37.840
we don't really care about what that does to inequality,

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.920
you can't be surprised when the Tory government turns around

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.720
and say, okay, well, we're going to tax ordinary people's taxes,

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.960
we're going to cut ordinary people's taxes by 100 quid

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.640
and the richest taxes by 50 grand.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.600
You've allowed that, right?

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.360
You've allowed that because you've said to them,

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.960
we're not going to fight you on running deficits

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:52.560
and we're not going to fight you on inequality.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.800
So, they're going to run a deficit to increase inequality.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:58.960
So, I think deficits can be a tool in a certain time.

01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:00.240
Of course, the power is not unlimited.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.080
Of course, the power is not unlimited.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.320
But if you take your eye off the ball with inequality

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.640
and with distribution, it will rise.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.840
You need to watch it.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.280
So, you're talking about taxing the rich,

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:13.840
but we're often told that imposing higher taxes on profits,

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:16.320
higher incomes would drive business away from the UK.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.360
What would your response to that be?

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.840
So, the first thing is, I'm not talking about taxing incomes more.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.440
I'm talking about taxing wealth more.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.520
You can tax income less if you want, you know what I mean?

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.840
And then you can attract high earners here if you want.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.160
But when we talk about driving people away,

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.000
I think the one single only good thing to come out of this war in Ukraine

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.680
is that the government turned around and suddenly decided

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.120
they wanted to tax rich people.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.960
A very specific subset of rich people,

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.160
which is Russian billionaires.

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.800
And Roman Abramovich, who of course owns Chelsea Football Club,

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.400
he fucking paid it because you cannot put Chelsea Football Club in a bag.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.800
You know, I think that idea rests on a perception of rich people

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:56.080
as if they are guys with like a massive bag of cash, okay?

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.800
Rich people are rich because they own your houses.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.680
They own your house.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:00.800
They own your mortgage.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.320
They own fucking Tescos down the road.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.360
They own the skyscrapers.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.720
They own the fucking windmills.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.520
They own the oil rigs.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.440
They own the fucking land that makes the food.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.680
They are rich because they own real assets.

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:13.040
In this, they're rich because they own this country

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.480
and they can leave if they want.

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:17.280
The country will still be here and we can tax the assets

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.040
where the assets are, which is here.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.080
You know what I mean?

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:22.160
You know, Jeff Bezos owns Amazon,

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.600
but Amazon sells to the UK, to the US, to Europe, to Japan.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.080
You know what I mean?

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.120
You know, these guys can't just all move to the Cayman Islands.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.040
The assets are in the world.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:34.320
You know, they own real things and we can tax those real things.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.800
You know, ultimately it's a question of,

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.720
do you want your country to be owned by people who pay tax or people who don't?

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.800
You know, and it's, they can leave.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.680
The stuff is here.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:44.880
They own your mortgage.

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.600
What are they going to do?

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.040
You know, we can tax that payment when you make it.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.040
Ultimately, their money comes from you.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.760
Their money comes from when you, when you go to the supermarket,

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.360
when you work, when you pay your bills,

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.040
when you pay your mortgage, when you pay your rent.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.280
I think people need to, there's one video on my channel

01:20:59.280 --> 01:20:59.920
called What Is World?

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:02.320
You know, I'm going to just plug it because it's to explain,

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.480
these guys are rich because they own assets.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.440
They own this country.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:06.640
Of course, we can tax it.

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.640
And I think nothing shows that better than

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.840
Roman Abramovich turning around,

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.400
trying to sell Chelsea Football Club to the only one who's going to buy it.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.560
Because it's there.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.760
It exists and we can tax it.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.520
Why do you think Quasiquata and got rid of the Cap on Bankers bonuses?

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:22.000
Because presumably the same argument there, right?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.160
Actually, it's a little bit different because that's not a tax.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.600
It wasn't actually raising money.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.160
They might actually make the argument it will raise more money

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.720
because we'll have a larger financial service industry here.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.080
What was the thinking that you think?

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.080
I'll be honest.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.600
The thing, I understood the economics of the budget very well in my opinion.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:43.680
The thing which I'm struggling to understand is why they did what they did.

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:45.680
And the most people I speak to are struggling as well.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.480
And you know, some people say they're ideological.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.400
I'll be honest, a lot of people say that they're idiots.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.320
A lot of people in the markets genuinely think they're idiots.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.840
Quasiquating worked in markets.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:55.520
And everybody's saying, oh, I know this guy that worked with him.

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:56.800
He said he was an absolute idiot.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.640
He's got PhD in economic history.

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.200
Mind you, you've already said you've already rinsed academics.

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.280
I couldn't tell you honestly.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.120
I think that he probably thinks that it will...

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.560
Do you think he thinks it'll play well with a certain demographic?

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:16.800
That he's trying to pitch himself as we are pro-growth and we are pro-dynamism.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.000
One thing I think is interesting about Banker, because I was a banker for a long time.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.960
I was very poor growing up, right?

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:25.920
That is the kind of policy which you ask 15-year-old me,

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.720
doing maths lying on the floor of his front room, you know what I mean?

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.760
Who'll probably like it.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.320
You know what I mean?

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:37.760
Because I'm poor and I see a system where people around me in London are millionaires

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:38.880
and don't pay much tax.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.960
And I'm thinking, well, I want to get out that channel.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:44.000
Finance is aspirational, isn't it?

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.760
For me, it was aspirational.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.320
You know what I mean?

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:50.880
So I couldn't tell you for sure and I think it's fallen flat.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.200
But I think maybe he's trying to pitch himself as aspirational.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.880
That seems to be what they're going for as a brand.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.960
Would it play well with the sort of people you used to work with?

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.080
Would they sort of hear that come through in the mini-budget statement

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.240
at Citibank and go, fucking hell, brilliant.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.920
I'll tell you, I've got a good story about this.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:14.240
So I started working in 2008 and in 2009, I think it was in 2009,

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.360
it was still a Labour government and they announced a big increase in tax on the banks.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.040
And I was shitting myself, right?

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.960
Because I was still poor, I'd never been paid.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:25.040
You know, I had a job at a bank, but I didn't make any money yet.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:27.200
And I was like, fuck me, I'll work this hard to get here

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.880
and now they're going to raise taxes on me.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.800
And I looked around me at the traders on the desk,

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:31.920
they were fucking laughing.

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:35.200
They were fucking laughing because they knew it wouldn't affect them.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.400
They knew it wouldn't affect them.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.520
And I remember this sort of, it's weird for someone like me

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:43.120
who comes from a poor background to just see this confidence, this like,

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:44.880
and that was a Labour government, right?

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:48.480
This knowledge that, look, these guys, don't worry, we got them.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.000
They're going to come for us.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
It's just, it's just, it's for the people, you know, it's, you know,

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.240
and, you know, the bank of bonus cap, in the reality of it is,

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.800
all it led to was a massive increase in bank of salaries.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:04.080
You know, so it's a good example of a tax which is

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.880
for your image, basically.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:12.080
It's a messaging tax because, you know, essentially it's not a tax,

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.920
it's just a change in the structure of pay, you know.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:18.320
So I honestly think they probably don't really care.

01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.000
They understand that it's just, it's for messaging.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.720
It's for the conservative part in the way that they look.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:28.000
On the crypto thing, we mentioned it a bit earlier on.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.960
So tons of working-class guys and others as well,

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.680
but it is a thing, as far as I can see,

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.000
have sort of been sucked into crypto.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.520
Yeah.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.800
Are they being conned?

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.800
You know, you're somebody that's interested in financial markets

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.680
and assets and wealth, but the way it's being talked about

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.320
and speculated on, particularly on social media,

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.120
it seems a little bit more like a Ponzi scheme.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:50.160
Am I being unfair?

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.760
Basically, in my opinion, yes.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.280
Listen, I live on my investments.

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.400
I make investments.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.440
I'm an investor.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.640
If you want to invest in something, you should do a due diligence, okay?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.800
The number one thing that you should check before anything else,

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:03.840
you probably should need to check it,

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:05.520
is that the thing that you're buying fucking exists.

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:09.360
You know, these guys, it's fucking internet points, mate.

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.480
See, I'm going to get hate on this for the internet.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.280
That is what it is.

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.240
It's internet points, you know?

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.440
And I said this before this crash.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.560
I've been saying it for a long time.

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:19.360
These guys are selling you fucking snake oil, you know?

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:21.840
And they're going to take that money that you gave to them

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.680
to buy their fucking dog coin,

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.760
and they're going to buy your fucking mom's house.

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.040
That is what they're going to buy with it.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.760
You know, you could be saving that money to buy houses,

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.760
and they're selling you fucking points on the internet.

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.760
And I understand it.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.760
I understand it, you know, because I've been there.

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:36.480
I've been poor.

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:38.800
You see the guys, oh, I'm making money trading, blah, blah, blah.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.960
And you know, all the guys who, you know,

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.400
they're showing on their Instagram,

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.600
I bought a Lamborghini with crypto.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.360
Listen, I've come out on crypto,

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.800
so I get the messages from people, all right?

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.920
The guys who fucking lost their fucking life savings

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.160
trading crypto, they don't fucking post it on Instagram.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:53.520
You know?

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:54.240
It's as simple as that.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.280
But they message me.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.520
They message me saying, oh, I've lost all my money.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.400
Can you give me some advice?

01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.840
I've got this new strategy.

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.680
And I have to message them back saying, listen,

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.560
you've got a problem.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.600
It's an addiction.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.840
My advice is that you'd never trade this ever again.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.360
And you know, and you come out,

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.280
and you, once you speak out on it,

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.560
you get these guys flooding to you,

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.840
oh, I've lost all my fucking savings.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.000
And it's, you know, it's fucking gambling addiction, man.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.800
And it ruins, it ruins lives, it ruins family.

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.480
And you know, also, you know, these people, I've been poor.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.400
I've been that fucking young, dumb, full of cum guy

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.520
that wants to make a ton of cash.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.400
You know what I mean?

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.520
I understand it.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:28.640
But these people, they should be our best fighters

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.360
to make this fucking system better for ordinary families.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.560
The guys buying crypto.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.400
Yeah, because they're young, they've got energy.

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.000
Listen, I'm getting older now, you know what I mean?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.080
I can't be out every day like pushing this, you know?

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.840
But these guys, they're getting screwed over by the system,

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.760
and then they're getting sold the fucking fake cure

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.680
by the system that's taking all their money.

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:47.760
Come here and help us build a system

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.920
that will get you a fucking house, you know what I mean?

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.920
And, and I know it's a seductive idea

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.000
like you buy this coin, you can become a millionaire.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.200
And you know, I'm not telling you,

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.520
if you follow my fucking YouTube, you'll be a millionaire.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.800
That's not gonna work like that.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.520
But if we lose this fight, you and your family will be fucked.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.280
I'm sorry. I don't want to say it like that.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.160
But that is what it is.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.120
You know, this is not a fight where the winners make millions.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.960
This is a fight for survival, you know?

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.400
So I see-

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.400
You would put crypto as a very discreet asset sort of class,

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:21.280
which is nothing like, like you said, housing or land or gold.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.800
You wouldn't touch it with a barge pole.

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.640
I'm short. The reason I'm short,

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.560
people probably say I always send this shit because it's short.

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.720
The reason I'm short is because I started to get asked

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.240
to do a lot of interviews on crypto.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.880
And I went on TV and radio and said, I think it's bullshit.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:38.240
And, you know, I'm a big believer that you shouldn't say shit.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.760
You don't believe, okay?

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.000
So if I'm going to say something on the radio,

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.200
I've got my nuts on it, okay?

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.720
I still trade every day, right?

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.440
And the things that I say is going to happen, I'm betting on it.

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.760
So I went, I opened up and I went short crypto, you know?

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.320
I went short crypto just simply because-

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.520
So explain what that means to our audience.

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:55.120
It means I basically bet the price will go down.

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.680
And if the price goes down, I made money and I've made some money on it going down.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:59.520
And I'm still short because I think it will still go down.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.160
I don't consider myself to be a crypto trader.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:06.560
I'm just saying that because, you know, opinions are cheap, okay?

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:08.240
I've got my nuts on this.

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.680
If it goes up, I'm going to lose money.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.880
So you know what I believe.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:11.600
That's what I believe.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:15.840
And, you know, I was one of the top traders in the world and I'm a very successful trader.

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.920
People don't have to believe me, but that isn't,

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.360
for me, that is a statement of intent.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.280
And look, I don't want to trade crypto.

01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.240
I think it's bullshit.

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:23.760
And I think it takes away-

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:26.400
I think it's sucking the life out of a lot of talented young people.

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.080
And I've seen a lot of things do that in my time.

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.560
And it's turning them into gambling addicts.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.120
And I'm being very harsh on it here and I know people are going to come at me.

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:37.120
But I'm trying to save you money.

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:39.680
But seriously, you know, I'm just telling you what I believe.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:40.720
You don't have to agree with me.

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.440
But look, you know, we're losing our houses here.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.560
You're trading dog coins.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.640
Like you're going to play with us or you're going to play with that.

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:47.360
That's the way I see it.

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:48.960
Last question.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:55.120
You recently said, my grand macro thesis is that real interest rates have to stay low,

01:28:55.120 --> 01:28:55.680
as we've said.

01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.120
And that's because the rich have all the wealth and like saving, as you've said.

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.960
Now, no matter how hard you work, how smart you are, if you come from, quote,

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:06.080
the wrong family, you'll probably never own property.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:07.680
That is feudalism.

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:10.560
We're going back into a world of aristocracy.

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:12.000
Capitalism's over.

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:13.600
So capitalism's over.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:14.160
What does that mean?

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.920
So with quote, first of all-

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:16.640
It's a great quote.

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:17.600
That's why we're ending on it.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.920
When I say capitalism is over, I say capitalism is a big word.

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:23.360
People have different ideas of what it means.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.160
Okay.

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.120
But for me and for what I think a lot of people from where I'm from

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:31.440
believe capitalism is or should be, is a system where if you fucking work hard

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:34.800
and you're talented and you go through it and you do your best and you get the good degree

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.720
and you get the good job and you hit it, you should not necessarily become super rich,

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:43.040
but you should have there for you a nice, secure, comfortable life, house, family.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.120
If you want it, that's capitalism.

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:48.720
That is the way, I know some people are not agree with that, but that is the way people

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:52.560
where I'm from, I raise to believe that it's about a society where if you work hard,

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:56.400
if you do the right thing, you will be quite actually secure.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:00.640
Yeah, that is what we are like raised to believe that we live in that kind of society.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:04.400
And I live in a world now where look, I've got a mate, he's a big fan of yours by the way,

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.520
so we'll be happy to be mentioned.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.360
He works in fashion, smart guy, went to Central Saint Martin's big fashion school,

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.480
works fucking hard, he lives with his, he owes good money now,

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.680
he took him a long time to get there.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.520
He lives with his parents, saves up, saves up, saves up because he wants to buy a house.

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:22.560
But the fucking house price has gone quicker than his fucking deposit does.

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:26.160
And now mortgage has gone up, how's this guy going to get a house?

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.960
This guy's done fucking everything you want him to do, you know what I mean?

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:33.920
Studied, hard, best university, really gone for it, worked, worked, worked, saving up everything.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:37.440
This guy doesn't even know if he's ever going to be able to afford a family.

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:43.120
So from, and at the same time, I've got friends buying houses because their mom gave him 400 grand.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.320
That's not fucking capitalism, that is an inherited society.

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:51.120
We are moving away, you know, there was 30, 40, 50, 60 years where, you know,

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.400
my dad worked for the post office, you know, I grew up, it's all Pakistanis and Indians

01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.200
where I grew up, right? Their grandparents came over from Pakistan,

01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:01.200
from India, from Kenya, right? Just worked in shops, you know, some of them are cleaners

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.920
and they've got properties now, you know what I mean? They're secure now.

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.960
That was possible in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and it is not possible anymore.

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:12.640
We've got smart, bright, hardworking kids going to the best universities,

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.880
doing everything they can and they will never own property.

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:19.120
So when I say capitalism's over, that is what I mean because we have ended a society

01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:22.560
where ordinary people can expect to get a good quality of life for working hard.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:27.360
Gary, what a pleasure, mate. Thank you. Cheers.
