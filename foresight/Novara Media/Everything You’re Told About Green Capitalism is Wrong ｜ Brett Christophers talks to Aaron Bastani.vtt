00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Governments like the UK's but also elsewhere in the world are granting new oil and gas

00:05.200 --> 00:07.200
exploration licenses willy-nilly.

00:07.200 --> 00:11.680
So of course the BP's and the Shell's having been talking quite a good game a few years

00:11.680 --> 00:15.560
ago about transitioning and now are like, why did we bother with that?

00:15.560 --> 00:18.440
Governments aren't serious about this at all.

00:18.440 --> 00:28.200
Over recent decades, the price of energy coming from wind or solar has collapsed.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.800
The same is also true by the way for energy storage with lithium batteries, that's why

00:32.800 --> 00:37.400
increasingly we see things like electric vehicles because the economics of these things add

00:37.400 --> 00:38.400
up.

00:38.400 --> 00:44.080
Now for the optimists out there, they say that these falls in price for renewable technologies

00:44.080 --> 00:49.800
are brilliant, they're all we need and they are the panacea in terms of addressing the

00:49.800 --> 00:57.080
climate crisis and yet at the very same time we have seen the percentage of energy coming

00:57.080 --> 01:02.480
from non-fossil fuel sources remaining broadly the same.

01:02.480 --> 01:08.240
So what explains this strange contradiction, falling prices and yet we're not decarbonising

01:08.240 --> 01:10.560
particularly quickly?

01:10.560 --> 01:16.200
Today's guest has a pretty interesting hypothesis regarding all of that, he says we should not

01:16.200 --> 01:25.240
be focusing on prices but profits and simply put renewable energy isn't that profitable.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.400
Welcome to Downstream.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.440
Thanks for having me or thanks for having me back.

01:29.440 --> 01:34.520
Well I'm glad you said that because I had a few colleagues in video, they were a bit

01:34.520 --> 01:38.560
suspicious when I said we're going to talk to somebody about asset management, it's

01:38.560 --> 01:42.920
going to do really well, everybody wants to hear about it and they just didn't believe

01:42.920 --> 01:46.000
me but it ended up getting a quarter of a million views and counting.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.240
Amazing, amazing.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.240
Great book.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.240
Thank you.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.480
Asset management is also just something that I think people are picking up on.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.040
They are, absolutely they are.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.960
Yeah it's more and more in the news and it's not going to go away.

01:55.960 --> 01:56.960
Sadly.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.960
No, exactly.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.520
But we're talking about a different book today.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.520
We are but it's not unrelated.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.520
It's not unrelated.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.520
That's good.

02:04.520 --> 02:09.520
It's a very technical book, don't know if I'll put you off.

02:09.520 --> 02:14.400
The price is wrong why capitalism won't save the planet.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.760
I find it interesting because there's a bit of a distance between like I said very technical

02:17.760 --> 02:21.000
book which is very good because you're really getting to the heart of really important arguments

02:21.080 --> 02:23.280
as we will over the next hour as well.

02:23.280 --> 02:29.120
But then that is like a very populist broad statement why capitalism won't save the planet.

02:29.120 --> 02:34.160
We will get onto that in a moment because lots of people say it can but I want to start

02:34.160 --> 02:35.160
with the basics.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.160
Yes.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.720
Is net zero bullshit?

02:37.720 --> 02:42.720
Wow, what a question to start with.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.720
I don't know.

02:43.720 --> 02:52.240
I think that we are heading in our kind of muddled, convoluted, messy, insufficient way

02:52.240 --> 03:00.120
in that direction globally albeit at very, very different rates in different places and

03:00.120 --> 03:08.200
with varying degrees of likelihood of getting somewhere close to it eventually but we'll

03:08.200 --> 03:12.320
get close to it if not there eventually.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.840
Of course the question is what is net zero?

03:15.840 --> 03:21.920
What is because net zero is not absolute zero it means you reduce carbon and other greenhouse

03:21.920 --> 03:30.920
gas emissions but you do other stuff to compensate for that in various ways and I think the best

03:30.920 --> 03:37.120
answer I have to that question is that to me the most interesting thing about net zero

03:37.120 --> 03:46.920
is how we are consistently moving away from aspirations of real zero and so if you look

03:46.920 --> 03:47.920
for example-

03:47.920 --> 03:49.680
So real zero and net zero not the same?

03:49.680 --> 03:53.360
No, because real zero is no emissions essentially.

03:53.360 --> 03:57.880
Net zero is you still have emissions but you do other things like sucking carbon out of

03:57.880 --> 04:03.160
the atmosphere or whatever else it might be to offset that and the thing is if you look

04:03.160 --> 04:11.880
at the reports that get produced by the IPCC the international panel on climate change

04:11.880 --> 04:18.720
over time the reports that they produce on kind of their kind of core scenarios of where

04:18.720 --> 04:25.560
they think we are heading and kind of hopefully should be heading they have gradually gravitated

04:25.560 --> 04:34.280
away from essentially real zero aspirations and so with each iteration they basically

04:34.280 --> 04:41.520
say if we are going to get to whatever is plus two degrees or whatever it is 1.5, 2.5

04:41.520 --> 04:47.640
15 years ago they were saying we will get there just by through wind and solar for example

04:47.640 --> 04:53.320
just by mitigating emissions with each new iteration they said we will get there mainly

04:53.320 --> 04:57.560
with solar and wind but also we will have a bit of carbon capture and storage.

04:57.560 --> 05:01.760
Next iteration we will have a bit more carbon capture and storage so I think the really

05:01.760 --> 05:04.880
important criticism is the criticism that comes from people like Kevin Anderson who

05:04.880 --> 05:12.720
are very outspoken on this, the climate scientist who say we are increasingly banking on the

05:12.720 --> 05:18.360
efficacy of technologies which do not yet exist at any significant scale rather than

05:18.360 --> 05:24.000
banking on technologies which we have and we know that they work we are increasing the

05:24.000 --> 05:30.240
degree of our bet on technologies that we do not yet have in any meaningful shape or

05:30.240 --> 05:36.080
form at scale and affordability and so on and obviously the next step will be geoengineering

05:36.080 --> 05:40.760
and as I understand it that is the kind of that as many viewers will know the work of

05:40.760 --> 05:45.200
Andreas Maum and I think that is what his next book with Wim Carton is going to be

05:45.240 --> 05:51.520
focusing on is how we are heading towards a position of where we are essentially at

05:51.520 --> 05:55.000
default position is going to be relying on geoengineering to get us out of the hole we

05:55.000 --> 05:59.880
are increasingly digging. So fossil fuel combustion stays with us, the emissions stay

05:59.880 --> 06:04.520
with us but there is how Mary do other shit to help us out of the hole. And we are doing

06:04.520 --> 06:09.200
that already to an extent in so much as not geoengineering but the carbon sequestration

06:09.200 --> 06:12.440
does not need to be technology that is not already here because of course you have this

06:12.480 --> 06:17.440
ridiculous phrase I think of quote unquote nature based solutions which is basically

06:17.440 --> 06:18.440
planting trees.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.440
Essentially yeah.

06:19.440 --> 06:24.440
Often it is trees that are not actually designed for the habitats where you are planting them

06:24.440 --> 06:30.560
there is not the kind of biodiverse you would associate with wild habitats, it is the kind

06:30.560 --> 06:33.960
of trees you would plant for timber and what not, they are effectively ecological dead

06:33.960 --> 06:34.960
zones.

06:34.960 --> 06:35.960
Exactly.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.680
But you have had a load of money flood into this, people think they can make money off

06:39.680 --> 06:43.160
of it so of course the good and the great are very enthusiastic about it.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.160
Love it.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.160
They do love it.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.160
Yeah of course they do.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.160
But you are not optimistic about nature based solutions?

06:47.160 --> 06:54.120
Well I mean I think that the reality is that I am totally in agreement with the likes of

06:54.120 --> 06:59.240
Kevin Anderson that just say you know minimize emissions, just focus on minimizing emissions.

06:59.240 --> 07:03.640
You don't want the shit in the atmosphere, that is what you just don't want and anything

07:03.640 --> 07:12.200
that provides you with the kind of cover to think that you can continue happily in that

07:12.200 --> 07:14.920
merry way with emissions is not a good thing.

07:14.920 --> 07:20.480
So yes we should be exploring those types of things and yes we should be exploring carbon

07:20.480 --> 07:27.120
capture type technologies but we shouldn't be allowing that to serve as cover for not

07:27.120 --> 07:29.520
doing the things that we should be doing.

07:29.520 --> 07:36.800
And then there of course is the concern which kind of fits in with the Jevons paradox about

07:36.800 --> 07:40.400
you know the more efficient you are at doing something the more you do it rather than the

07:40.400 --> 07:41.400
less you do it.

07:41.400 --> 07:45.200
So for instance Jevons notices this in the 19th century as an economist.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.280
With regards to coal you know the more efficient steam engines became the more coal you use.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.280
Yep.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.920
Now that is a point we can put a pin in and that is very relevant for energy.

07:53.920 --> 07:54.920
It is.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.560
But also with regards to carbon sequestration obviously if that becomes incredibly efficient

07:57.600 --> 08:00.280
then people will say well you know we can burn this shit forever.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.280
It doesn't matter.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.280
Yeah.

08:02.280 --> 08:06.200
And you know and people living in people living here in the UK lovely we can just carry on

08:06.200 --> 08:10.600
flying going out and fantastic we'll offset that and we can do it and we can bomb our

08:10.600 --> 08:12.160
conscience and we don't have to worry about it.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.160
So what's wrong with that?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.480
Because I mean that will sound very appealing.

08:14.480 --> 08:19.320
Oh nothing can change but we can bring down CO2 levels of CO2 in the atmosphere what's

08:19.320 --> 08:20.320
wrong with that?

08:20.320 --> 08:29.960
Well my understanding is that simply those technologies are very very limited in their

08:29.960 --> 08:36.480
capacity to do what we hope they can do at scale and in an affordable way.

08:36.480 --> 08:44.320
And so we are and when I say we I mean including here the IPCC forecast that I refer to we

08:44.320 --> 08:50.600
are trusting that they are going to be able to do much more for us than we know that they

08:50.600 --> 08:51.600
can do.

08:51.600 --> 08:56.880
Essentially we are we're betting on something being able to happen and we have no proof

08:56.880 --> 09:03.000
of the fact that it will be able to whereas we do have technologies that we know work

09:03.000 --> 09:06.140
but we're just not doing enough of them and things like wind and so will be the classic

09:06.140 --> 09:07.640
examples of that.

09:07.640 --> 09:12.320
I suppose there's also the argument that you know nature is a good in itself and if you

09:12.320 --> 09:15.920
look at things like biodiversity and the destruction of wild habitats to go you mentioned

09:15.920 --> 09:21.320
Andres Malm you know his his perspective on COVID is amazing which is that actually this

09:21.320 --> 09:24.160
is an outgrowth of our change relationship to the other species.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.400
Yeah a great book that one.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.400
Great book.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.400
Yeah.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.400
What's it?

09:28.400 --> 09:30.400
War Communism and the Corona.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.400
Yeah.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
What was it?

09:32.400 --> 09:35.080
Coronavirus, climate emergence or something like that.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.080
It's a good book.

09:36.080 --> 09:40.960
Which is to say that you know look all the pathogens that we presume as being here you know in perpetuity

09:41.000 --> 09:45.280
you're actually not they're all quite recent humans are 300,000 years old we've had agriculture

09:45.280 --> 09:51.920
for 12,000 years and it's in that phase that we've had all of these pathogens that we think

09:51.920 --> 09:55.920
has never brought measles you know that's that's all stuff that's a result of species

09:55.920 --> 09:56.920
crossover and.

09:56.920 --> 09:57.920
Exactly.

09:57.920 --> 10:02.840
Andres his point is that the more we destroy the natural world the more of these pathogens

10:02.840 --> 10:05.320
are going to spill over into humans.

10:05.320 --> 10:09.120
So there's a sort of holistic approach that I think underpins all that stuff anyway.

10:09.160 --> 10:13.040
So let's just let's say that's right and let's say that like you say the technologies are

10:13.040 --> 10:15.960
hail marrying it's a bad bet.

10:15.960 --> 10:21.880
You would say let's electrify as much as possible now and let's get that from renewable energy.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.760
So why is electrification so critical here?

10:24.760 --> 10:27.400
Why do we want to electrify as much as we can?

10:27.400 --> 10:28.400
Yeah.

10:28.400 --> 10:35.240
So that's the way you put it I think I think I would phrase it differently.

10:35.240 --> 10:47.320
I would say that the electrification is is is a if not the principal strategy that the

10:47.320 --> 10:53.760
world currently has for climate mitigation to the extent that it's not relying on those

10:53.760 --> 10:54.760
other things.

10:54.760 --> 10:59.800
So to the extent that that we are attempting to mitigate existing emissions electrification

10:59.800 --> 11:04.400
is at the heart of it and and it's really important to understand why electrification

11:04.400 --> 11:07.760
and why electricity are so and why electricity are so important.

11:07.760 --> 11:11.320
So if we step back a set because I think this is really useful for people to understand

11:11.320 --> 11:14.480
and some of this is going to be really obvious to people but they'll some of it won't be

11:14.480 --> 11:16.800
obvious at least not to everyone.

11:16.800 --> 11:22.280
So if we think about just greenhouse gas emissions in general think about that.

11:22.280 --> 11:27.360
The totality of greenhouse gas emissions about 75% of that is carbon dioxide.

11:27.360 --> 11:34.280
If you then focus just on carbon dioxide about 75% of that again of that 75% is from the

11:34.280 --> 11:38.920
combustion of fossil fuels so oil natural gas and coal.

11:38.920 --> 11:43.160
And so as everyone knows the combustion of fossil fuels that's why that we talk about

11:43.160 --> 11:48.040
that because it's the heart of the problem of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions

11:48.040 --> 11:53.440
focus in on that 75% of 75% and the biggest part of it is the electricity sector.

11:53.440 --> 11:58.360
So electricity generation is the biggest source of emissions from the burning of fossil fuels

11:58.360 --> 12:00.800
principally natural gas and coal.

12:00.800 --> 12:06.280
So that's why decarbonizing the power sector is so important.

12:06.280 --> 12:12.080
That's why everyone talks about solar and wind and nuclear which we can talk about because

12:12.080 --> 12:15.000
that's how you decarbonize the power sector is really important.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.080
However it's because of what you refer to as electrification the electricity sector

12:19.080 --> 12:25.880
is actually even more important than that and because the way the world is principally

12:25.880 --> 12:30.360
approaching this is to say look we have those electricity sector emissions.

12:30.360 --> 12:37.760
We also have emissions from things like transportation and industrial processes and things like that.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.320
How are we going to decarbonize them?

12:40.320 --> 12:44.760
And the way that we are typically thinking about doing that is to say so take vehicle

12:44.760 --> 12:51.280
transportation as an example so cars and trucks which run on which historically run on internal

12:51.280 --> 12:54.600
combustion engines by burning gasoline.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.960
So in theory you could do two different things.

12:56.960 --> 13:04.200
You could either switch to a different non-carboniferous fuel like a biofuel of something, ethanol

13:04.200 --> 13:11.680
something like that or you switch to a motor which is basically a charged battery and charge

13:11.680 --> 13:17.440
it through electricity and that's kind of what we're doing and it's the same thing with

13:17.440 --> 13:20.820
industrial processes and buildings as much as possible.

13:20.820 --> 13:26.420
The strategy is basically run as much as we can off electricity and then generate that

13:26.420 --> 13:31.900
electricity through low carbon or zero carbon sources.

13:31.900 --> 13:37.740
So that makes the electricity sector even more important to the climate problem than

13:37.740 --> 13:42.780
it already is because it's going to get much bigger because we're electrifying everything

13:42.780 --> 13:49.260
so electricity consumption is going to go to much higher levels than we currently have

13:49.380 --> 13:53.140
which makes it doubly important that we decarbonize it.

13:53.140 --> 13:57.260
So electricity really is the kind of the heart of the problem because if we don't decarbonize

13:57.260 --> 14:01.020
it we're in even more trouble than we already are.

14:01.020 --> 14:09.900
And I think the point here that I would make is that we're not doing anything, people will

14:09.900 --> 14:15.700
look at charts for renewable energy growth worldwide and they'll think this looks awesome.

14:15.700 --> 14:22.780
The charts are sharply upwards both in terms of the amount of new renewables capacity that's

14:22.780 --> 14:29.660
being installed and the amount of electricity that we are generating from renewable sources.

14:29.660 --> 14:37.900
However, the problem is that because overall electricity consumption is going up so sharply

14:37.900 --> 14:40.020
that renewables growth is not proving enough.

14:40.020 --> 14:44.940
So fossil fuel electricity generation is also still growing every year.

14:44.940 --> 14:47.340
What I've been saying for a number of years now it's going to peak this year, it's going

14:47.340 --> 14:50.260
to peak this year but it still hasn't peaked, it's still going up.

14:50.260 --> 14:56.460
So our emissions from electricity generation are still going up despite the fact that we're

14:56.460 --> 15:00.820
two or three decades into the so-called renewables revolution.

15:00.820 --> 15:05.540
So that's kind of a snapshot of why electricity is so important I think.

15:05.540 --> 15:08.300
I'm going to interrupt this interview with Brett Christopher's for just one moment.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.020
I do hope you're enjoying it.

15:11.020 --> 15:15.700
As you may know right now we are in the middle of a general election here in the UK.

15:15.700 --> 15:21.460
That will happen on July 4th but of course there is a campaign before then.

15:21.460 --> 15:27.180
My view is that Navarro Media is without peer when it comes to covering that election,

15:27.180 --> 15:30.580
the policies, the personalities, the politics.

15:30.580 --> 15:34.540
We have no equivalent in my view.

15:34.540 --> 15:39.260
That is from our daily coverage on Navarro Live, that's weekdays, it's 6pm, it's our

15:39.260 --> 15:46.100
articles, our podcasts, our social first content, our news and comment, it's all there and

15:46.100 --> 15:49.980
my goodness for this general election we're really ramping things up.

15:49.980 --> 15:56.580
Imagine if you will a Lamborghini Contash, the light is red, Ash Sarkar is at the wheel,

15:56.580 --> 16:01.420
she's got her foot to the pedal, really getting it going and that's what we need to do.

16:01.420 --> 16:06.380
We need our supporters to help us get our acceleration right up, come right out of the

16:06.380 --> 16:11.020
blocks because as we've said since this project first started, you cannot have a different

16:11.020 --> 16:15.660
kind of politics without a different kind of media, new media for a different politics.

16:15.660 --> 16:20.940
Now that won't arrive on July 5th but we certainly think we're moving the dial left on a tonne

16:20.940 --> 16:24.900
of issues and in elections that is especially true.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.940
If you want to be a part of that, you know what to do.

16:27.940 --> 16:33.380
Go to navarromedia.com forward slash support, the link is in the description below.

16:33.380 --> 16:40.060
This is a momentous set of elections and I think it's a huge opportunity to shift the

16:40.060 --> 16:44.460
political conversation in this country into a much better direction.

16:44.460 --> 16:45.460
Be a part of it.

16:45.460 --> 16:49.020
Go to navarromedia.com forward slash support.

16:49.020 --> 16:55.980
You've got a statistic in the book which basically says, you know, global consumption of fossil

16:55.980 --> 17:01.820
fuels for electricity is actually quite stagnant over the last 10 years, primarily because

17:01.820 --> 17:06.340
of India, China and obviously demand going up and obviously, and it's something we don't

17:06.340 --> 17:09.340
talk about enough, is Africa.

17:09.340 --> 17:13.220
You know, Africa's population is set to double between 9 and 2050.

17:13.220 --> 17:17.220
That's going to have extraordinary consequences to the rest of the world, particularly because

17:17.220 --> 17:20.460
the rest of the world is getting older and looking at population decline.

17:20.460 --> 17:25.020
It's going to change our fundamental notion of humanity and the global community in really

17:25.020 --> 17:31.380
powerful ways but in terms of energy, obviously you're going to have more people in sub-Saharan

17:31.460 --> 17:34.500
Africa and more people consuming more energy than they're presently do.

17:34.500 --> 17:41.420
So we could be looking at maybe a doubling, or maybe just under, of energy globally between

17:41.420 --> 17:43.900
now and say the mid 2050s, 2060.

17:43.900 --> 17:44.900
Yeah.

17:44.900 --> 17:47.420
I think the International Energy Agency, if I recall correctly, is somewhere between

17:47.420 --> 17:50.100
two to three times where we are at at 2020 globally.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.100
Yeah.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.100
I mean, two times is the optimistic.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.100
Yeah.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.100
Exactly.

17:55.100 --> 17:56.100
Let's try and be optimistic.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.100
There's not much to be optimistic about.

17:57.220 --> 18:02.860
And in that context, basically, I presume you would say, well, look the next two decades,

18:02.860 --> 18:06.140
it's going to look like the last two decades, which is we'll decarbonise a ton of stuff

18:06.140 --> 18:07.620
that will still be burning more fossil fuels.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.620
Yeah.

18:08.620 --> 18:12.220
I think that's, if I had to guess, that that would be where we're going.

18:12.220 --> 18:15.940
And we can talk more about this because I think it's really, really important.

18:15.940 --> 18:23.500
And the reason I'm, one of the main reasons I'm relatively pessimistic about this is that

18:23.500 --> 18:28.460
it is simply stated, but it's quite complex to get one's head around.

18:28.460 --> 18:34.380
And it's this, which is that the parts of the world, which is essentially the parts

18:34.380 --> 18:38.980
of the world you've just been talking about, the parts of the world where the challenge

18:38.980 --> 18:45.220
of decarbonising the electricity sector is economically greatest, are precisely the parts

18:45.220 --> 18:52.500
of the world where it's most urgent, that decarbonisation proceeds rapidly.

18:53.500 --> 19:00.620
Which is to say that it's those parts of the world where investment will have a disproportionately

19:00.620 --> 19:01.620
important effect.

19:01.620 --> 19:06.740
So, and what I mean by that, and it's important to spell this out, is that the reality is that

19:06.740 --> 19:13.060
kind of what happens in Europe and North America is obviously important, but in terms of future

19:13.060 --> 19:19.380
global greenhouse gas emissions trajectories, it's way more important what happens in China

19:19.380 --> 19:24.260
and India and Africa and Vietnam than what happens here.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.460
And that's for two reasons.

19:25.460 --> 19:30.060
One of which you said is because that's where energy demand growth is concentrated.

19:30.060 --> 19:36.060
So if you've got energy demand growing, then obviously if you're still fossil fuel intensive,

19:36.060 --> 19:40.500
that's much more damaging than if your fossil fuel intensive in energy demand is not growing.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.420
So that's one thing.

19:42.420 --> 19:47.220
And then the other thing is that for very understandable reasons, it tends to be in those

19:47.220 --> 19:52.100
parts of the world that the electricity sectors are still most fossil fuels intensive.

19:52.100 --> 19:58.140
So here are some figures that just put a complexion on this that I think is important.

19:58.140 --> 20:02.780
So I live in Sweden, it's almost fully decarbonised, it's power sector.

20:02.780 --> 20:07.220
Something like 90% of electricity now is generated from non-carbon sources.

20:07.220 --> 20:13.660
I think it's like roughly 30, 30, 30 nuclear wind hydro, about 10% is natural gas.

20:13.700 --> 20:18.100
So Sweden's almost there on the power sector, at least.

20:18.100 --> 20:21.420
UK, Germany, US, quite a way behind that.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.820
Germany's pretty awful, lots of coal burning still.

20:24.820 --> 20:27.140
US, lots of coal and natural gas.

20:27.140 --> 20:28.340
UK, lots of natural gas.

20:28.340 --> 20:29.700
Scotland very good though.

20:29.700 --> 20:33.340
Yeah, we'll talk about Scotland because it's a big part of the story.

20:33.340 --> 20:38.780
So they're a way behind, but they're still a long way ahead of other parts of the world.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.900
China, 65% of electricity generation is coal.

20:41.900 --> 20:49.340
India, 75%, South Africa, 90%, other countries 95% to 98%.

20:49.340 --> 20:55.980
And so it's most urgent that investment in decarbonisation happens there.

20:55.980 --> 20:58.940
A, because their fossil fuel intent, very fossil fuel intensive.

20:58.940 --> 21:01.700
B, that's where energy demand growth is going to be concentrated.

21:01.700 --> 21:05.700
But that's where the challenge is greatest economically for reasons that we can talk about.

21:05.700 --> 21:08.140
And that's the real problem as I see it.

21:08.180 --> 21:10.780
So let's take an, again, an optimistic slant on this.

21:10.780 --> 21:14.340
Firstly, on China, I mean, China, again, we've got some great statistics.

21:14.340 --> 21:17.180
I'm sure you can bring it off the top of your head.

21:17.180 --> 21:23.460
For most of the last six, seven years, about 50% of sort of additional solar capacity

21:23.460 --> 21:26.580
being added worldwide is in China.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.980
It's a similar story with wind.

21:28.980 --> 21:29.300
Yep.

21:29.300 --> 21:31.060
It's blowing the United States out of the water.

21:31.060 --> 21:32.340
100%.

21:32.340 --> 21:34.220
Blowing the EU as well, but not quite as much.

21:34.220 --> 21:37.660
I mean, it's making it, you know, the US is a clown show compared to China.

21:37.660 --> 21:44.340
But obviously you have increasing demand, CO2 emissions per person still going up.

21:44.340 --> 21:51.660
But the optimistic story is this, CO2 emissions per person in China may reach a peak.

21:51.660 --> 21:55.620
Well, the plan was for 2030, but it's looking actually like the next couple of years,

21:55.620 --> 21:59.100
potentially, according to Xi.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.460
So that's one positive thing.

22:01.460 --> 22:02.140
Absolutely.

22:02.140 --> 22:07.020
Secondly, and this is probably where you're going to say that's completely wrong,

22:07.060 --> 22:10.700
there's this optimistic account of Africa, which is like,

22:10.700 --> 22:14.140
well, they didn't have landline connections, but they just, they skipped that bit

22:14.140 --> 22:18.020
and they did the mobile telephony and they're going to do the same with energy.

22:18.020 --> 22:20.460
They're going to skip, you know, national grids with fossil fuels.

22:20.460 --> 22:23.540
They're going to go straight to distributed solar.

22:23.540 --> 22:24.900
And on the one hand, that sounds absurd.

22:24.900 --> 22:27.620
But on the other hand, actually within the tropics,

22:27.620 --> 22:29.540
you do have an extraordinary amount of exposure to solar energy.

22:29.540 --> 22:30.100
Absolutely.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.260
It's a brilliant place to have it.

22:32.260 --> 22:34.340
So what's wrong with that account?

22:34.340 --> 22:38.660
An optimistic account of actually things are far better than the picture you're painting.

22:38.660 --> 22:39.060
Yeah.

22:39.060 --> 22:46.620
I mean, I think that both of those parts of the story have a strong degree of truth, actually.

22:46.620 --> 22:54.100
I think that China is a, you know, China's hugely paradoxical and for all sorts of different reasons.

22:54.100 --> 23:01.580
And right now, it's obviously the good news story on renewables,

23:01.580 --> 23:05.660
but it's also the bad news story on kind of new coal-fired plants as well,

23:05.660 --> 23:09.620
which is simply due to the fact, simply is probably the wrong word,

23:09.620 --> 23:14.060
but it's due to the fact that energy demand is growing still so strongly there,

23:14.060 --> 23:19.020
both from, you know, residential, commercial, industrial and so on.

23:19.020 --> 23:22.740
And so renewables in and of themselves are not proving sufficient for that,

23:22.740 --> 23:29.380
which is partly just a scale issue, but it's also partly about the different nature of the energy source.

23:29.420 --> 23:31.140
But China's important to talk about.

23:31.140 --> 23:39.580
And what I think is important is to understand the political economy of how it's doing things very differently to how we're doing it in the West.

23:39.580 --> 23:43.220
There's some commonalities, but there's some big important differences as well.

23:43.220 --> 23:47.500
I think on Africa, I think that is the big hope, actually.

23:47.500 --> 23:57.900
And, you know, I see conflicting accounts about how credible that story is about

23:57.900 --> 24:06.220
the extent to which it will be possible to build out a clean energy future there

24:06.220 --> 24:10.580
that does kind of leapfrog the kind of historical problems that we've,

24:10.580 --> 24:15.300
that are kind of almost a sunk cost here in the West,

24:15.300 --> 24:21.060
where we have a very kind of centralized grid-based energy system,

24:21.060 --> 24:26.380
which locks us into a certain kind of future that may not be necessary in Africa, as you say.

24:26.380 --> 24:32.380
If it moves towards more distributed energy resources, then maybe it's possible to do that.

24:32.380 --> 24:38.740
I mean, I think there are reasons to think both positively and negatively about that story.

24:38.740 --> 24:44.740
I think right now it's too early to tell which direction it's going.

24:44.740 --> 24:52.540
But possibly that's true, and I think that will be very, very important.

24:52.540 --> 24:58.140
And let's not forget that, you know, just, I mean, I think there's a connection between those two stories, right, that we just talked about.

24:58.140 --> 25:05.820
So if you look at what China did in 2023, when it was, you know, set all kinds of records for new renewable installation,

25:05.820 --> 25:10.940
something like 30% of that renewable installation in China was rooftop solar.

25:10.940 --> 25:17.620
So it wasn't commercial, large-scale, industrial power plants, wind and solar farms.

25:17.620 --> 25:20.500
It was rooftop domestic solar, 30%.

25:20.540 --> 25:26.340
Huge. All sorts of state subsidy necessary for that, but that's fine.

25:26.340 --> 25:30.980
So part of the China story is precisely that distributed energy story,

25:30.980 --> 25:34.820
which one would hope would be replicated in Africa as well.

25:34.820 --> 25:36.100
And Vietnam as well, right?

25:36.100 --> 25:39.780
Again, it's one of these stories in Europe and the West we don't really hear.

25:39.780 --> 25:43.660
Like, there is a heroic effort going into solar right now in Vietnam.

25:43.660 --> 25:44.100
There is.

25:44.100 --> 25:47.820
And it's not on our radar, and we think in Europe we're doing everything.

25:47.820 --> 25:52.580
You know, we've got, you go in Germany or Italy, you might see some solar cells.

25:52.580 --> 25:53.140
Great.

25:53.140 --> 25:56.580
But in Vietnam, they're doing what those countries did in 20 years.

25:56.580 --> 25:58.260
They're doing it in three or four years.

25:58.260 --> 25:59.180
Yeah, absolutely.

25:59.180 --> 26:04.500
And obviously, I mean, to take, I mean, China is the best example of this.

26:04.500 --> 26:12.460
But the reason that China can and is doing things at a much more rapid clip

26:12.500 --> 26:17.580
and on a much, much greater scale than is happening in the West

26:17.580 --> 26:21.140
is simply because it's essentially a state project, right?

26:21.140 --> 26:28.420
I mean, to take wind, something like 95% of the wind deployment sector,

26:28.420 --> 26:33.260
by which I mean the entities that are involved, not on the manufacturing side,

26:33.260 --> 26:36.620
building the turbines and building the cells and modules,

26:36.620 --> 26:39.900
although it's not hugely dissimilar there, but on the deployment side,

26:39.900 --> 26:42.860
by which I mean developing the wind and solar farms,

26:42.860 --> 26:46.140
owning and operating them and selling the electricity that they generate,

26:46.140 --> 26:50.460
something like 95% of that is state-owned enterprises.

26:50.460 --> 26:54.820
They are being financed by state-owned banks

26:54.820 --> 27:00.460
who are themselves having their debts subsidized by the state-owned central bank.

27:00.460 --> 27:05.060
And all of these entities are, at least if my understanding of this is correct,

27:05.060 --> 27:08.820
and it's a second-hand understanding based on kind of the work of China experts,

27:08.860 --> 27:11.260
you know, heck of a lot more about it than I do,

27:11.260 --> 27:16.260
all of these entities are only, what's the best word to you,

27:16.260 --> 27:21.180
modestly being driven by profit motives of one kind or another.

27:21.180 --> 27:28.300
They are, to one degree or another, working at the behest of provincial

27:28.300 --> 27:31.620
and or central government in China.

27:31.620 --> 27:36.100
They are being directed very substantially in terms of what they're doing now.

27:36.100 --> 27:39.100
And if you have the willpower and if you have the resources

27:39.100 --> 27:43.100
and you have the determination and the political intent

27:43.100 --> 27:47.140
to do that sort of thing on a huge scale and quickly,

27:47.140 --> 27:48.860
well, you can do that.

27:48.860 --> 27:54.940
But in the West, where we are essentially relying on the private sector to do this

27:54.940 --> 27:57.620
and we are relying on the kind of quote-unquote

27:57.620 --> 28:01.540
coordinating mechanisms of markets to do this,

28:01.540 --> 28:03.460
it's an entirely different project.

28:03.460 --> 28:09.300
You're expecting, you know, the independent decisions of thousands of different entities

28:09.300 --> 28:14.740
to kind of add up to this very complicated thing that we call a transition.

28:14.740 --> 28:18.420
And not surprisingly, it's not really happening in the same way

28:18.420 --> 28:21.380
that it is where you have a top-down approach to this

28:21.380 --> 28:25.860
that can be very, very coordinated and very, very joined up

28:25.860 --> 28:29.180
because you have one entity that is overseeing all of it.

28:29.180 --> 28:32.860
I mean, we had this debate recently on the Var Alive, Michael and I,

28:32.900 --> 28:35.500
and he was saying China is a capitalist society.

28:35.500 --> 28:37.260
And I said, it's not a capitalist society.

28:37.260 --> 28:39.660
It's a market society.

28:39.660 --> 28:41.780
But there's a huge difference in that in a capitalist society.

28:41.780 --> 28:42.540
I mean, I totally agree.

28:42.540 --> 28:44.340
And even then, is it a market society?

28:44.340 --> 28:45.460
I mean, even this is the debate.

28:45.460 --> 28:48.580
I mean, if you look at what's going on in the energy sector,

28:48.580 --> 28:52.860
I would be quite reticent to call the mechanisms

28:52.860 --> 28:58.100
whereby and the context within which electricity is bought and sold,

28:58.100 --> 29:00.580
markets in anything like the shape of which we're used to.

29:00.700 --> 29:04.260
The firms that are building, you know, the firms that are making the PV cells,

29:04.260 --> 29:07.460
which would take over the world if we weren't imposing tariffs on them.

29:07.460 --> 29:10.180
That is all being done by private actors in competition.

29:10.180 --> 29:12.740
And I think this is something that Michael and I really discredent.

29:12.740 --> 29:15.060
And I said, it's a market society.

29:15.060 --> 29:17.420
But the point is, it's not capitalist because Eric E. Lee,

29:17.420 --> 29:19.180
who's a political scientist, Chinese political scientist,

29:19.180 --> 29:22.580
he said, we're not a capitalist society because, yes, we have markets,

29:22.580 --> 29:27.020
but capital does not determine how our society allocates resources.

29:27.020 --> 29:28.700
The interests of capital are not so enormous

29:28.740 --> 29:30.620
with the interests of the ruling class.

29:30.620 --> 29:33.820
Our ruling class has national political priorities, which sometimes...

29:33.820 --> 29:34.820
100%.

29:34.820 --> 29:36.260
Which is odds with capital.

29:36.260 --> 29:38.620
And I think for people in the West, that's a really hard thing to engage with.

29:38.620 --> 29:39.620
It is.

29:39.620 --> 29:42.900
You have markets, but you don't allow capital to determine political priorities.

29:42.900 --> 29:46.740
So I was on a panel recently and there was a sociologist,

29:46.740 --> 29:50.460
a Chinese sociologist who works in the US called Karl Chan,

29:50.460 --> 29:52.740
who's been doing a lot of really interesting research

29:52.740 --> 29:54.860
about Chinese state-owned enterprises.

29:54.860 --> 29:58.220
And I think the concept he uses to try to capture what it is they do,

29:58.220 --> 30:00.340
I think he calls it managed competition.

30:00.340 --> 30:01.180
What's the chap's name?

30:01.180 --> 30:03.340
Kyle Chan, C-H-A-N.

30:03.340 --> 30:08.260
And it's a really evocative and useful way of thinking about this,

30:08.260 --> 30:11.740
that it's just not competition in the way we think about it.

30:11.740 --> 30:16.380
It's a managed process towards a particular end

30:16.380 --> 30:20.460
to which competition is being mobilized in some way,

30:20.460 --> 30:24.500
but only in a very limited capacity to make sure that these things are happening.

30:25.340 --> 30:29.980
It was quite interesting hearing basically Chinese automotive manufacturers,

30:29.980 --> 30:32.220
they were being asked, are you gunning for the US?

30:32.220 --> 30:33.140
Are you gunning for Tesla?

30:33.140 --> 30:36.260
And they're like, we have enough problems with our own people back home,

30:36.260 --> 30:40.660
like BYD are terrified of the next four or five companies beneath them.

30:40.660 --> 30:43.260
And of course, if you look at that from a sort of classical,

30:43.260 --> 30:46.700
a neoclassical sort of political economy perspective,

30:46.700 --> 30:48.660
you'd be like, well, those are exactly the sorts of incentives

30:48.660 --> 30:51.860
which are meant to be driving firms and industrialists.

30:52.260 --> 30:56.780
And it's so strange that China and its firms are talking in that language.

30:56.780 --> 30:59.500
And yet, the US is talking in a very protectionist language,

30:59.500 --> 31:01.100
he's talking about national champions.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.900
China is not talking about national champions.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.620
No, no, no, no, no.

31:04.620 --> 31:06.860
No, because they've already, they're already the champions.

31:06.860 --> 31:09.620
They're the international champions.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.660
Yeah, this is another one, this is a bit of an aside,

31:11.660 --> 31:14.860
but again, you're going to be a lot more familiar with the reality of this

31:14.860 --> 31:16.540
because you do all these academic panels and whatnot.

31:16.540 --> 31:19.380
But we have a friend here at Navarro who sometimes works with us

31:19.380 --> 31:23.660
on sort of helping us out, kind of like a consultant guy.

31:23.660 --> 31:26.660
And they were recently in, I think, Vietnam.

31:26.660 --> 31:30.140
And they kept on seeing all these brands they just never heard of.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.740
And then they were like, what's that? Google that, Google that, Google that.

31:32.740 --> 31:36.060
And then they said, look, after a while, I realized that like the world's number one,

31:36.060 --> 31:41.220
two, three producer for dozens of, you know, commodities, which I've granted,

31:41.220 --> 31:42.940
they're all East Asian, right?

31:42.940 --> 31:44.860
You know, they're Chinese or if they're not Chinese,

31:44.860 --> 31:47.940
they'll be Japanese or Taiwanese or and I was like, yeah.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.180
We do live in a little closeted world in some respects.

31:50.180 --> 31:51.900
But I think Europeans don't realize.

31:51.900 --> 31:53.860
No, of course they don't. No, absolutely not.

31:53.860 --> 31:55.100
Very stretch.

31:55.100 --> 31:58.420
So you're optimistic, but also in a way pessimistic about China.

31:58.420 --> 32:01.260
I suppose one good way of looking at China is

32:01.260 --> 32:03.660
we would be really screwed if they weren't doing all the things.

32:03.660 --> 32:08.300
They would be. I mean, the way, I mean, not least in terms of, I mean,

32:08.300 --> 32:11.260
there's for one thing, there's the fact that they are making progress

32:11.260 --> 32:12.580
domestically on renewables, right?

32:12.580 --> 32:13.380
Fantastic.

32:13.380 --> 32:17.460
But there's also the fact that let's not forget that it's unimaginable

32:17.460 --> 32:22.820
that in places like Europe, that to the extent that it's happened so far,

32:22.820 --> 32:26.180
that the energy transition, the decarbonization of power sector

32:26.180 --> 32:33.540
would have gone as far, as fast and at such a low, relatively low cost as it has.

32:33.540 --> 32:38.020
Were it not from the fact that it's China that drove down the cost of the technologies, right?

32:38.020 --> 32:42.340
I mean, there's no, there's no way it would have gone as far as fast or at such low cost

32:42.340 --> 32:44.100
without China doing what it's done.

32:44.180 --> 32:49.780
We've, we collectively have been benefiting environmentally and economically

32:49.780 --> 32:52.180
from what China's been doing for the last 15 to 20 years.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.540
That is such a good point.

32:53.540 --> 32:57.100
So people are saying, and we'll talk about obviously that the fallen price for renewables,

32:57.100 --> 32:59.500
how it's competitive with fossil fuels, and a big part of that,

32:59.500 --> 33:03.460
that disinflationary pressure is the fact that stuff is being manufactured in China.

33:03.460 --> 33:04.860
Almost all about China.

33:04.860 --> 33:06.180
And that's very rarely in the conversation.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.100
No, no, no, no.

33:07.100 --> 33:10.060
Because we talk about energy security, but we can have, we can have our cake and eat it.

33:10.060 --> 33:12.220
It can be cheap and it can be energy secure.

33:12.220 --> 33:12.940
Hold on a second.

33:12.940 --> 33:15.180
It's cheap because it's not made here.

33:15.180 --> 33:16.940
It's actually made outside of the planet.

33:16.940 --> 33:17.740
Yeah, absolutely.

33:17.740 --> 33:20.500
And obviously what's going on in the U.S. right now, and again,

33:20.500 --> 33:24.780
there's a bit of a tangent, but it's important, is that the Biden administration

33:24.780 --> 33:39.060
is trying to thread the needle between not wanting to entirely give up those economic gains

33:39.060 --> 33:41.980
that have been delivered and continued to be delivered by China.

33:41.980 --> 33:44.460
While at the same time benefiting domestic industry.

33:44.460 --> 33:48.900
So they're trying to play this delicate game where they're like saying to the renewable energy developers,

33:48.900 --> 33:54.580
look, if you, if you source your technology locally, rather than from China,

33:54.580 --> 34:02.180
from local manufacturers, you get an extra 10% credit on your, on your renewables development.

34:02.180 --> 34:06.260
And, but I, you know, based on the conversations I've had with people in the U.S.,

34:06.260 --> 34:10.980
it's still entirely unclear whether that incremental benefit is proving sufficient

34:10.980 --> 34:16.580
to persuade them to source locally or whether it still makes economic sense for them to source from China.

34:16.580 --> 34:17.500
Yeah, they don't know yet.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.620
Well, because you have these recent tariffs announced by Biden, right?

34:19.620 --> 34:20.780
Yeah, that was, that was a lot.

34:20.780 --> 34:21.500
They've changed it.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.300
They've introduced some new tariffs last week.

34:23.300 --> 34:27.540
So 100% on automotive, you know, so electric vehicles will have 100% tariffs.

34:27.540 --> 34:32.380
So if I'm buying a BYD car and it's $30,000 in China, I'm going to have to pay $30,000 tariff on it.

34:32.380 --> 34:33.580
Yep, exactly.

34:33.580 --> 34:35.500
And I still think that car might be competitive.

34:35.500 --> 34:36.460
Yeah, it could well be.

34:36.460 --> 34:38.340
Which is the terrifying thing for the U.S. car industry.

34:38.340 --> 34:39.420
Yeah, no, absolutely.

34:39.460 --> 34:45.540
Yeah, so they're, they're playing a very challenging game over there, which, which, which, I mean, I understand that game politically.

34:46.380 --> 34:49.940
I mean, it makes, it makes it's easy to understand where they're coming from.

34:50.780 --> 34:51.580
Politically, yes.

34:51.580 --> 34:52.860
But then you can't say climate change...

34:52.860 --> 34:54.780
Oh, not necessarily economically, environmentally, no.

34:54.780 --> 34:58.420
You can't say climate change is existential, but then put 50% tariffs on PV cells.

34:58.420 --> 34:58.860
No.

34:58.860 --> 35:00.180
Well, you don't believe that then, do you?

35:00.180 --> 35:09.380
But then, but then the whole, I mean, let's be honest about this, but the whole, the whole climate policy,

35:09.620 --> 35:21.020
thing in the U.S. perspective is entirely contradictory, by which I mean, you know, I think the Inflation Reduction Act is actually pretty good policy for the, for the most part.

35:22.060 --> 35:32.100
And I think that given the, given the political conditions under which Biden has been operating, it was probably about as good as, as he could have got through at the time.

35:33.100 --> 35:37.980
And yet, you know, one day Biden will be extolling the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act.

35:37.980 --> 35:57.380
And yet the very next day, he'll be like calling out OPEC for introducing new production quotas to dampen oil and gas production, because Biden is concerned that that, that constraint in global oil and gas supply will have, you know, will put the price of gasoline up 3 cents.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.700
And it means that he won't, he won't get voted into power.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.660
So he's telling OPEC to open the pumps.

36:01.980 --> 36:05.740
So it's just like, it's the most contradictory thing imaginable.

36:06.100 --> 36:17.980
And, and, and that's the thing I think we have to grapple with, is that the whole kind of U.S. political, economic, ecological complex is fundamentally driven with contradiction.

36:19.100 --> 36:22.340
And you compare that to Europe, which for the most part has proportional representation.

36:22.980 --> 36:26.140
At least you can build in a consensus around a certain policy direction.

36:26.540 --> 36:27.060
That's true.

36:27.100 --> 36:31.020
Whereas in the U.S., you have like, I mean, it's crazy, you have Biden saying, I'm a green champion.

36:31.020 --> 36:37.580
And then, and then, but then, and it's, and you understand why they'll be saying, look, if inflation is 5% in November, we're out, we're gone.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.220
100%.

36:38.340 --> 36:38.620
Right.

36:38.620 --> 36:39.380
And they know that.

36:40.260 --> 36:44.660
And so you have these wildly diverging policies, messages.

36:44.700 --> 36:50.820
And we, we in the West, but especially in America, live very carbon intensive lifestyles.

36:50.980 --> 36:55.900
And so inflation is, is a carboniferous phenomenon in the U.S.

36:55.940 --> 36:57.620
more than anywhere else.

36:57.900 --> 36:59.460
And it's really important to remember that.

36:59.740 --> 37:04.540
So the inflation discussion is a significant part of carbon discussion in the U.S.

37:04.620 --> 37:07.500
And it's very, very important to remember that politically as well as economically.

37:08.220 --> 37:15.260
Going back to Europe, you mentioned the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA Act, IRA Act.

37:15.260 --> 37:20.500
I can't say that without, yeah, having memories of growing up in Croydon in the 1970s.

37:20.620 --> 37:30.860
And, you know, Biden's, Biden's famous Irish heritage, I do find it, I'm sure he probably finds it quite, you know, you know, interesting.

37:30.900 --> 37:31.300
Yes.

37:33.300 --> 37:35.860
You got the IRA Act, you got the CHIPS Act, that's not really related.

37:35.860 --> 37:48.980
And at the same time as the IRA Act, which is this, you know, huge amount of money basically going into reshore lots of manufacturing in the UK, but also it's ostensibly about a decarbonisation agenda.

37:49.420 --> 37:51.780
At the same time, you have, obviously, Russia, Ukraine.

37:52.340 --> 37:55.460
And what you're seeing right now is that sort of amazing statistic in the FT recently.

37:55.460 --> 38:00.620
I think it's like 45% of German manufacturing companies are looking at setting up shop in the U.S.

38:01.180 --> 38:07.340
Because energy in Germany compared to the U.S. is six times more expensive, six times more.

38:07.340 --> 38:08.300
Wow, I hadn't seen that statistic.

38:08.300 --> 38:11.060
Yeah, industrial energy, I think it was five to six times more.

38:11.100 --> 38:11.380
Wow.

38:11.420 --> 38:16.420
But then on top of that, you have the IRA, you know, subsidies or whatever, tax, you know, breaks and what not.

38:16.740 --> 38:23.140
All of a sudden, you know, these industrial firms that have been in Germany for like 800 years thinking, am I going to Texas?

38:23.580 --> 38:27.900
Germany really isn't heading in a good direction in any sense, in any shape or form right now, is it?

38:27.900 --> 38:30.060
So, yeah, okay, so explain that.

38:30.060 --> 38:33.780
So what, and where does U.S. policies fit on this?

38:33.780 --> 38:41.900
So is that, is that, is that an intentional effort by the United States government to basically say, you know what, we're going to reindustrialise on the back of deindustrialisation in Germany?

38:42.060 --> 38:43.140
Or is it not that deep?

38:43.380 --> 38:44.780
Am I being too conspiratorial?

38:44.780 --> 38:57.980
I'm not sure it's that deep, but certainly on the manufacturing side, U.S. policymakers have been, have been making an active effort to woo European companies, for sure.

38:58.140 --> 39:01.940
And not just on the manufacturing side, but also on the renewable energy development side.

39:02.020 --> 39:14.660
They've, you know, they've been trying to get the Iberdrohlers and the Orstedts and so on, much more interested in the U.S. as a place for investment in new, in new wind and solar power, as well as the manufacturing side of the business.

39:14.860 --> 39:16.700
But I'm not sure it's, I'm not sure it's that deep.

39:17.860 --> 39:28.740
But, you know, the EU, sorry, has been through, you know, a very difficult few years on the energy front in a way that the U.S. largely avoided.

39:29.980 --> 39:32.660
And I think there are, there are still lingering effects from that.

39:32.660 --> 39:41.860
And it's important to think about what's going on in Germany in relation to what happened in 2021 to 2022, which, which didn't really happen in the U.S.

39:42.860 --> 39:58.500
The energy crisis was a, was a phenomenon that was, it wasn't limited to the EU, but to the extent that it was significant outside the EU, it was, it was significant more to the East, not least in China than it was in the U.S.

39:59.500 --> 40:09.500
So the, the EU occupies this kind of strange sort of third provisional position in the kind of game between China and the U.S.

40:09.500 --> 40:17.500
The EU is in this uncertain position where it seems to be neither one thing or the other.

40:17.500 --> 40:27.500
It doesn't seem to be in a position to be calling any shots, but it's also not reacting as far as I can tell in the kind of deeply protectionist way that the U.S. has reacted.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.500
Yeah. So it's interesting.

40:30.500 --> 40:39.500
There was a great quote a year or two ago, basically saying that the energy crisis of, you know, 2022-2023, was it 2022-2022?

40:39.500 --> 40:40.500
21-22.

40:40.500 --> 40:41.500
21-22.

40:41.500 --> 40:42.500
Yeah.

40:42.500 --> 40:47.500
It's, you know, post-Covid, but also, you know, in relation to Germany in particular, post-Ukraine war.

40:47.500 --> 40:52.500
And they said, look, the last several years have basically brought into focus that there are two kinds of countries.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.500
Those with energy and those without.

40:54.500 --> 40:55.500
Yeah.

40:56.500 --> 40:59.500
You know, go massive on nuclear renewables, coal.

40:59.500 --> 41:02.500
The U.S. is where we have tons of energy anyway.

41:02.500 --> 41:07.500
And Europe doesn't have any energy, but it's not adopted a sort of a strategy like you say.

41:07.500 --> 41:15.500
No. I mean, Germany was the most extreme example of sort of essentially relying on Russia for energy.

41:15.500 --> 41:24.500
And that was true to a lesser extent, but also not to an insignificant extent in other parts of Europe as well.

41:24.500 --> 41:36.500
I mean, it just, I mean, it's, in that context, it is worth going back to China and the question of trying to understand its investment,

41:36.500 --> 41:44.500
that kind of hybrid state capitalist investment that it's been undertaking in its renewables industry,

41:44.500 --> 41:48.500
both the manufacturing side and the deployment side in the last couple of decades,

41:48.500 --> 41:51.500
and to think, well, what kind of strategy is that?

41:51.500 --> 42:03.500
And it's kind of a three-fold strategy by which I mean it's been partly a strategy that is about environmentalism.

42:03.500 --> 42:10.500
It's been partly a strategy which is an industrial strategy, trying to build global champions,

42:10.500 --> 42:15.500
global leadership in a particular sector, but it's also been a strategy about energy security.

42:15.500 --> 42:24.500
And by my understanding, it's the reverse order, actually, that the energy security was the kind of the main strategy

42:24.500 --> 42:31.500
and arguably still is the main strategy, then industrial strategy, and that the environmental part of it, I mean, it's become more important.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.500
20 years ago, it wasn't a significant part of the strategy.

42:34.500 --> 42:40.500
But even today, my suspicion is it's still not the first of those three and maybe not even the second of those three.

42:40.500 --> 42:42.500
And it's been about energy security.

42:42.500 --> 42:48.500
And so what happened in Europe, I mean, it's a different slant on the same question,

42:48.500 --> 42:53.500
but what happened in 2022 was there was a bit of a fillip in renewables investment in Europe.

42:53.500 --> 42:59.500
And a lot of people were saying, oh, this is further evidence of the fact that renewables are forging ahead

42:59.500 --> 43:02.500
because they're very, very cheap and they're economically competitive.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.500
And no, that wasn't really what happened.

43:04.500 --> 43:05.500
It was about energy security, right?

43:05.500 --> 43:11.500
If you have renewable and solar power, you're not reliant on importing fuel from overseas.

43:11.500 --> 43:14.500
You're not reliant on a rush or whoever else it might be.

43:14.500 --> 43:17.500
So I think it was an energy security issue that was driving that investment.

43:17.500 --> 43:20.500
What you just said is the crux of the book.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.500
And we'll get to that in a moment about the price.

43:22.500 --> 43:24.500
Yeah, we haven't really got to the book yet.

43:24.500 --> 43:27.500
No, it's critical because it's not about prices.

43:27.500 --> 43:32.500
We're getting to a point of price parity with regards to fossil fuels and renewables, but that's not the point.

43:32.500 --> 43:34.500
But particularly on Europe.

43:34.500 --> 43:35.500
Yes.

43:35.500 --> 43:43.500
I mean, that was the, you know, what we saw in 2022, 2023 was 101 think pieces about finally Europe is on the stage.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.500
Not only was it meant to remilitarize.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.500
Okay, what's happening there?

43:46.500 --> 43:48.500
It was meant to be rebuilding its domestic industry.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.500
It's doing the opposite, actually.

43:50.500 --> 43:54.500
It was also meant to be getting serious about renewals and nuclear energy.

43:54.500 --> 43:55.500
Yes.

43:55.500 --> 43:56.500
Not just upticks.

43:56.500 --> 43:59.500
And there has been much progress made and there is progress is being made.

43:59.500 --> 44:02.500
But it's not decarbonizing as quickly as we were told.

44:02.500 --> 44:03.500
No.

44:03.500 --> 44:04.500
Why is that?

44:04.500 --> 44:05.500
Russia?

44:05.500 --> 44:06.500
Russia's gone.

44:06.500 --> 44:07.500
Yeah.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.500
For the near future.

44:08.500 --> 44:15.500
And Germany's industrial prowess is literally, well, not entirely based on, but it was significantly based on cheap Russian energy.

44:15.500 --> 44:23.500
That's now gone, but there doesn't seem to be the political leadership in places like Germany to say, you know what, we now need to build a ton of wind, solar, nuclear.

44:23.500 --> 44:25.500
And you've got a green-red coalition there.

44:25.500 --> 44:30.500
You think, well, this should be the perfect set of circumstances for Germany to become a world leader in renewable energy.

44:30.500 --> 44:31.500
Yeah.

44:31.500 --> 44:32.500
So it's not happening.

44:32.500 --> 44:33.500
No, it's not.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.500
Why?

44:34.500 --> 44:58.500
So the narrative that you will typically hear about this, across the board actually politically and almost analytically as well, but certainly from both left and right, is that the problem is found in the realm of, for want of a better kind of label, politics and planning and bureaucracy.

44:58.500 --> 45:12.500
You'll have seen a thousand think pieces saying, look, the problem is that there's all this money waiting to go into renewables, but it's being held up by, you know, obstructionist local planning authorities.

45:12.500 --> 45:16.500
It's being held up by slow processes to get planning permission.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.500
It's being held up by long queues to get grid connections.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.500
It's being held up by nimbyism.

45:21.500 --> 45:22.500
And you know what?

45:22.500 --> 45:24.500
It is held up by all of those things.

45:24.500 --> 45:25.500
Absolutely.

45:25.500 --> 45:35.500
However, the other crucial part of that key of that main dominant narrative about this says what it's not being held up by is the economics.

45:35.500 --> 45:46.500
The economics has been solved because the price of generating electricity from solar and wind has come down sharply historically.

45:47.500 --> 46:01.500
And it has, over time, to a point of where, as you said, it's as cheap or often in many places even cheaper to generate solar and wind power than it is by burning natural gas or coal.

46:01.500 --> 46:05.500
So that's the key narrative is that it's all these other things.

46:05.500 --> 46:06.500
It's not the economics.

46:06.500 --> 46:10.500
My argument in the book is that, yes, it's all those other things, but it's also the economics.

46:10.500 --> 46:29.500
And the argument there is that the thinking specifically on the question of generating price, which is what all those think pieces do, and they reproduce the same charts showing the same cost curves coming down over time, is the wrong prism through which to think about it.

46:29.500 --> 46:37.500
And that we can understand much more about the industry and about why things are going too slowly if we focus on the question of profitability rather than price.

46:37.500 --> 46:39.500
So that's the argument I made.

46:39.500 --> 46:42.500
And so it's a complex, as you said, right at the outset.

46:42.500 --> 46:43.500
There's a lot of detail in it.

46:43.500 --> 46:44.500
It's quite wonky.

46:44.500 --> 46:45.500
It's quite complex.

46:45.500 --> 46:50.500
But the actual main argument is really straightforward, which is this.

46:50.500 --> 46:57.500
It's like, in profitability terms, renewables deployment is actually quite a problematic proposition.

46:57.500 --> 47:00.500
And I'll explain what I mean by that in a second.

47:01.500 --> 47:09.500
And that's a problem because we're relying on the private sector and the private sector is driven above all else by profitability expectations.

47:09.500 --> 47:17.500
If its expectations are on profitability are not adequate, it will not invest or it will not invest on the sufficient sale.

47:17.500 --> 47:23.500
So my argument is like, you need to understand that, A, we are relying mainly on solar and wind.

47:23.500 --> 47:31.500
So yes, there are countries in which there's much more of a role being given to nuclear and even in some countries, geothermal and hydro and so on.

47:31.500 --> 47:37.500
But for the most part, the world is kind of betting the house on solar and wind to a significant extent.

47:37.500 --> 47:45.500
And second, the world is banking on the private sector, not China, but elsewhere in the world, government policy is not to do it itself.

47:45.500 --> 47:48.500
It's to say, we expect you, the private sector, to do it.

47:48.500 --> 47:55.500
We will nudge you in the right direction through various incentives and subsidy mechanisms on where you're not doing it quickly enough.

47:55.500 --> 47:58.500
We'll provide you that help, but we're not going to do it.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.500
You're going to do it. We're expecting you to do it.

48:00.500 --> 48:08.500
That's fine if the private sector consistently sees sufficient profitability in that proposition to do it quickly and at scale.

48:08.500 --> 48:09.500
But it doesn't.

48:09.500 --> 48:12.500
And you talk to people in the industry and they're like, no, of course not.

48:13.500 --> 48:15.500
But policymakers are completely deaf to this.

48:15.500 --> 48:22.500
And I think for all sorts of reasons, but partly because they've been persuaded by those simplistic arguments about falling prices.

48:22.500 --> 48:27.500
And to them, it's like, well, surely if the prices have fallen, the profits must be there.

48:27.500 --> 48:28.500
The profits must be going up.

48:28.500 --> 48:30.500
But it's just not true.

48:30.500 --> 48:33.500
It's a problematic industry in terms of profitability expectations.

48:33.500 --> 48:36.500
And that's the kind of core of the book as to why that is.

48:36.500 --> 48:38.500
And it is a bit of a wonky book.

48:38.500 --> 48:39.500
We like wonky books.

48:39.500 --> 48:40.500
Oh, yeah.

48:40.500 --> 48:41.500
Well, yeah, I hope so.

48:41.500 --> 48:42.500
We love wonky books.

48:42.500 --> 48:44.500
I mean, don't let that put you off.

48:44.500 --> 48:47.500
I think particularly, look, for anybody who wants to know the subject well.

48:47.500 --> 48:51.500
And the point is, like you say, the core proposition at the heart of the book is a very important one.

48:51.500 --> 48:53.500
And, you know, it's like...

48:53.500 --> 48:55.500
I think it's really important.

48:55.500 --> 48:56.500
Yeah.

48:56.500 --> 49:01.500
It's like the arrow that goes through, you know, Harold Goodwin's Anziah Hastings.

49:01.500 --> 49:02.500
You know, it's...

49:02.500 --> 49:03.500
That's it.

49:03.500 --> 49:05.500
It's game over for that worldview of...

49:05.500 --> 49:10.500
Well, actually, private firms, the private sector with the profit motive can solve the climate crisis.

49:10.500 --> 49:11.500
Exactly.

49:11.500 --> 49:12.500
They can't.

49:12.500 --> 49:13.500
It's not about costs.

49:13.500 --> 49:14.500
It's about...

49:14.500 --> 49:15.500
It's not about prices or other.

49:15.500 --> 49:16.500
It's about profit.

49:16.500 --> 49:17.500
Yeah.

49:17.500 --> 49:20.500
And obviously, profitability is shaped by generating prices.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.500
That's part of the equation, but it's not the totality.

49:22.500 --> 49:23.500
That's the issue.

49:23.500 --> 49:24.500
Yeah.

49:24.500 --> 49:29.500
And I actually feel like there are some similarities here with the debates I've had recently with

49:29.500 --> 49:34.500
people in regards to, you know, privatised utilities of things like mail, rail, water.

49:34.500 --> 49:37.500
And they're arguing for, you know, the private sector should control these.

49:37.500 --> 49:42.500
And I go, look, best-case scenario, best-case scenario, they're very low margin.

49:42.500 --> 49:44.500
You want it to be very competitive.

49:44.500 --> 49:46.500
They're very physically hard to administer.

49:46.500 --> 49:47.500
They're not very exciting.

49:47.500 --> 49:48.500
No.

49:48.500 --> 49:51.500
Like, why do you want the private sector here?

49:51.500 --> 49:53.500
And they're also very important.

49:53.500 --> 49:54.500
Go...

49:54.500 --> 49:55.500
100%.

49:55.500 --> 49:57.500
Go make, like, shirts.

49:57.500 --> 49:58.500
I mean, it's true, right?

49:58.500 --> 49:59.500
No.

49:59.500 --> 50:00.500
Or glasses or mobile phones or...

50:00.500 --> 50:01.500
Come up with a coffee machine.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.500
Exactly.

50:02.500 --> 50:05.500
Or like a scalable social network where you can 10X your...

50:05.500 --> 50:06.500
Knock yourself out.

50:06.500 --> 50:07.500
Do you see something different and better?

50:07.500 --> 50:08.500
Yeah.

50:08.500 --> 50:09.500
Yes.

50:09.500 --> 50:10.500
Water can't do that.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.500
No.

50:11.500 --> 50:12.500
And I feel like renewables are in a similar situation.

50:12.500 --> 50:13.500
100%.

50:13.500 --> 50:14.500
It's just a low margin thing.

50:14.500 --> 50:15.500
It's just electrons.

50:15.500 --> 50:16.500
Yeah.

50:16.500 --> 50:17.500
Just leave it alone.

50:17.500 --> 50:18.500
I know.

50:18.500 --> 50:19.500
I know.

50:19.500 --> 50:20.500
Yeah.

50:20.500 --> 50:21.500
It's bizarre.

50:21.500 --> 50:22.500
And the thing is, right...

50:22.500 --> 50:23.500
I think the other thing to...

50:23.500 --> 50:29.500
You know, one of the ways I think it's useful to think about this is that governments,

50:29.500 --> 50:34.500
for very understandable reasons, going back to what we were talking about inflation, they

50:34.500 --> 50:37.500
want electricity to be affordable.

50:37.500 --> 50:38.500
They want to be cheap.

50:38.500 --> 50:39.500
Rightly so.

50:39.500 --> 50:47.380
Well, in general, doing stuff at rock bottom prices to consumers isn't normally a recipe

50:47.380 --> 50:48.500
for massive profitability.

50:48.500 --> 50:53.100
I mean, I know that's a generalization, but it's worth keeping in mind.

50:53.100 --> 51:00.540
And so what's happened is that governments have designed electricity markets and they

51:00.540 --> 51:05.540
have designed the support mechanisms that they provide to renewables operators precisely

51:05.540 --> 51:13.900
in such a way as to maximize the likelihood that the economic gains associated with kind

51:13.900 --> 51:19.460
of falling production costs thanks to China are not captured by nasty capitalist firms,

51:19.460 --> 51:22.740
but they're passed on to consumers.

51:22.740 --> 51:26.380
So what does that mean in terms of capitalist incentives to invest in those things?

51:26.380 --> 51:29.780
Well, if they're not able to capture it, then of course they're not going to do it at the

51:29.780 --> 51:34.940
scale we want because they're being passed on to consumers, which is what we want.

51:34.940 --> 51:39.460
But I mean, there's politicians that don't stay honestly, and it's something I just,

51:39.460 --> 51:42.300
my mind is blown every time I think about it, but it's particularly a problem on the

51:42.300 --> 51:43.300
center left.

51:43.300 --> 51:47.140
But a problem in the center is they genuinely seem to think that private enterprises do

51:47.140 --> 51:48.660
things out of the goodness of their heart.

51:48.660 --> 51:49.660
Yeah.

51:49.660 --> 51:50.660
I mean, it's...

51:50.660 --> 51:51.660
It's just wild.

51:51.660 --> 51:54.140
They want to make lots of money and they want to make as much money as possible.

51:54.140 --> 51:55.140
And here's the other thing, right?

51:55.140 --> 51:56.140
As quickly as possible.

51:57.140 --> 52:01.180
And the other point I would make before we get, before if we want to get into the meat

52:01.180 --> 52:07.580
of it is this, which is that profitability, economic returns are always a relative phenomenon

52:07.580 --> 52:08.860
rather than an absolute phenomenon.

52:08.860 --> 52:15.580
And what I mean by that is that for any capitalist actor, there is always a kind of palette of

52:15.580 --> 52:19.060
different investment opportunities available to them.

52:19.060 --> 52:25.180
And so it's much more, so I give some figures in the book around kind of the average profitability

52:25.220 --> 52:30.540
of renewables deployment, which of course varies across time and space, but most studies

52:30.540 --> 52:34.140
point to somewhere in a region of kind of five to 8% returns.

52:34.140 --> 52:38.380
Now, in isolation, that number doesn't really mean anything.

52:38.380 --> 52:42.380
It only really means anything if you think about the alternative returns that are available

52:42.380 --> 52:44.540
to the relevant actors from doing different things.

52:44.540 --> 52:49.820
Now, and I want to just give two sort of comparators that I think are really valuable

52:49.820 --> 52:51.060
to think about.

52:51.060 --> 52:55.700
The first of those is this, which is to say that five to 8% look pretty good when interest

52:55.700 --> 52:56.980
rates were zero.

52:56.980 --> 53:03.820
But when interest rates are like 5%, and you can get five, six, even 7% returns from sticking

53:03.820 --> 53:11.020
your money in the bank or investing it in US risk-free US government bonds, why on earth

53:11.020 --> 53:19.180
would you go to the hassle of building a wind farm with the major risk that investment entails

53:19.180 --> 53:23.700
when there are risk-free opportunities available to make essentially the same returns?

53:23.700 --> 53:24.700
That's the first comparator.

53:24.700 --> 53:26.020
Really important to think about.

53:26.020 --> 53:31.380
And that's one of the reasons why the industry is really struggling right now is because

53:31.380 --> 53:34.980
of the macroeconomic environment has changed fundamentally in the last couple of years

53:34.980 --> 53:36.980
with the uptick in inflation and interest rates.

53:36.980 --> 53:38.580
So that's the first comparison.

53:38.580 --> 53:43.980
Second comparison is to focus on, you know, perhaps the key constituency that governments

53:43.980 --> 53:51.460
in their wisdom, let me use that word advisedly, have been kind of assuming would take the

53:51.460 --> 53:55.060
lead on the renewable transition, which is the big oil and gas companies.

53:55.060 --> 54:00.100
So they've been hoping that the BP's and the Shells and the Exxons would kind of magically

54:00.100 --> 54:03.860
transition away from oil and gas to offshore wind.

54:03.860 --> 54:10.180
They know how things work offshore, they'll switch their rigs for offshore wind farms.

54:10.180 --> 54:16.300
Well, over the last 10 years or so, those companies have not got out of bed for oil

54:16.300 --> 54:20.620
and gas projects that deliver anything less than 15% returns.

54:20.620 --> 54:23.380
That's what they expect and that's what they get.

54:23.380 --> 54:28.060
And the idea that companies that are used to 15% plus returns in their core business

54:28.060 --> 54:33.620
are somehow going to make the decision to switch to businesses with returns like a third

54:33.620 --> 54:36.420
of that level is absurd.

54:36.420 --> 54:40.500
It's economically madness to think that that's going to happen.

54:40.500 --> 54:45.420
And here's the kicker, as long as they think that those above average returns are going

54:45.420 --> 54:47.540
to continue to be available, right?

54:47.540 --> 54:54.420
If they thought that those 15% returns are going to disappear because of, for example,

54:54.420 --> 55:00.100
meaningful government action on things like carbon taxes, then of course they would think

55:00.100 --> 55:02.340
about alternative investment options.

55:02.340 --> 55:07.660
But everything that's happened in the last five years or so has shown those companies

55:07.660 --> 55:11.940
that governments are not serious about clamping down on their traditional business.

55:11.940 --> 55:13.500
In fact, the opposite.

55:13.500 --> 55:18.060
Governments like the UK's but also elsewhere in the world are granting new oil and gas

55:18.060 --> 55:20.020
exploration licenses willy-nilly.

55:20.020 --> 55:24.540
So of course the BP's and the Shells having been talking quite a good game a few years

55:24.540 --> 55:28.420
ago about transitioning are now like, why did we bother with that?

55:28.420 --> 55:30.300
Governments aren't serious about this at all.

55:30.300 --> 55:34.460
They have no intention of stranding our oil and gas assets any time in the next 20 or

55:34.460 --> 55:35.460
30 years.

55:35.460 --> 55:38.220
So we're just going to carry on as we can because we know those returns are going to

55:38.220 --> 55:39.220
continue to be available.

55:39.220 --> 55:43.100
And it's not just why would they adopt a lower rate of return.

55:43.100 --> 55:46.420
It's why would they spend a hell of a lot of money?

55:46.420 --> 55:50.700
Why would they invest in a whole different cadre of employee?

55:50.700 --> 55:55.220
Why would they dump a whole bunch of human capital value with regards to like engineering

55:55.220 --> 55:57.260
know-how and whatnot, get rid of all that?

55:57.260 --> 55:58.260
So we can earn less money.

55:58.260 --> 55:59.260
Nobody's going to do that.

55:59.260 --> 56:00.260
No, of course not.

56:01.220 --> 56:05.460
Again, it goes back to some core ideological presumptions of our political class and our

56:05.460 --> 56:09.980
media class, which is that businesses always write, markets always work, and they literally

56:09.980 --> 56:12.820
cannot get their heads around businesses do things for profit.

56:12.820 --> 56:13.820
It's not profitable.

56:13.820 --> 56:14.820
It's not going to work.

56:14.820 --> 56:16.180
And something that's, it's not there in the book.

56:16.180 --> 56:18.780
It's kind of implicit or maybe it is, maybe I didn't see it.

56:18.780 --> 56:19.780
It's something I thought about a lot.

56:19.780 --> 56:22.780
It's in my book when I talk about for the automated luxury of communism, when I talk

56:22.780 --> 56:29.180
about energy is that you have with wind, with solar, with storage, permanent price decline.

56:29.220 --> 56:30.780
So you have deflation.

56:30.780 --> 56:33.100
And again, if you want to make a profit, that's a real problem.

56:33.100 --> 56:36.540
Permanently falling prices is a really bad thing.

56:36.540 --> 56:40.540
If you want to make money, it's great for the consumer.

56:40.540 --> 56:44.580
But again, there's this tension isn't really obvious to people who are making the policies.

56:44.580 --> 56:45.580
No, no.

56:45.580 --> 56:49.140
And you listen to, you listen to the, you know, the labor government in waiting talking

56:49.140 --> 56:50.700
about this.

56:50.700 --> 56:54.340
And they're, and it's a really strange thing.

56:54.340 --> 57:01.020
They're kind of like, well, we'll, we'll develop a new renewable energy generator, great British

57:01.020 --> 57:02.260
energy.

57:02.260 --> 57:08.100
And, and, and the whole idea behind it as, as they seem to be articulating it is like,

57:08.100 --> 57:10.420
because the renewables business is swimming in profits.

57:10.420 --> 57:14.660
And so we'll have this public entity that will capture those profits while delivering

57:14.660 --> 57:15.660
really cheap energy.

57:15.660 --> 57:17.780
And it's like, what are you talking about?

57:17.780 --> 57:19.260
So it's not swimming in profits?

57:19.260 --> 57:20.780
No, no, it's absolutely not.

57:20.780 --> 57:23.820
And that's why the investment isn't happening.

57:23.820 --> 57:28.500
And actually one thing, one thing that you, that you mentioned just now is, is, is one

57:28.500 --> 57:30.740
of the important explanations for why that is.

57:30.740 --> 57:33.540
And so let's, let's talk about that.

57:33.540 --> 57:39.740
So you were, you were saying, look, the prices have been consistently coming down and, and

57:39.740 --> 57:44.540
they have the, that, that chart, that chart I talked about in terms of the cost of generating

57:44.540 --> 57:48.580
electricity from wind and solar shows consistent price declines.

57:48.580 --> 57:52.860
And so you would think, so let's imagine you are a wind energy generator and you've been

57:52.900 --> 57:55.220
in business for like 20 years.

57:55.220 --> 58:01.780
And as your, as your costs go down, you're generating costs go down over time.

58:01.780 --> 58:05.700
Simple economics would say, well, my costs are going down the cost of genera, of actually

58:05.700 --> 58:07.620
generating the power.

58:07.620 --> 58:11.540
So my profits are going to be going up accordingly, fine, you know, lovely jubbly.

58:11.540 --> 58:20.300
But that assumes that you have the capacity to capture and privatize those growing economic

58:20.300 --> 58:21.300
efficiencies.

58:22.300 --> 58:28.020
The reality of the, of the electricity sector is that you now in many, in many, if not most

58:28.020 --> 58:32.820
parts of the world, but certainly in the UK, the electricity generation sector, which is

58:32.820 --> 58:36.740
largely a self-standing sector, it's been cleaved off from transmission and distribution

58:36.740 --> 58:38.060
and retail.

58:38.060 --> 58:44.380
And in particular, the renewable energy generation sector is incredibly competitive.

58:44.380 --> 58:47.540
There are thousands of entities in that market.

58:47.540 --> 58:52.660
They compete purely on price, selling into really, really competitive wholesale markets.

58:52.660 --> 58:59.340
So what happens when price, when, when costs decline, well, they compete those cost gains

58:59.340 --> 59:05.260
away and those cost gains get passed downstream to transmission and distribution entities

59:05.260 --> 59:10.780
and retailers and in large part all the way to consumers, precisely in the way governments

59:10.780 --> 59:12.380
hope they do.

59:12.380 --> 59:18.580
But if generators can't capture and privatize the upsides of those growing cost efficiencies,

59:18.580 --> 59:22.180
why would they invest in their technologies in the first place?

59:22.180 --> 59:25.820
Because they know that because of that competition, I mean, Mark's called it the coercive law

59:25.820 --> 59:27.740
of competition, right?

59:27.740 --> 59:33.140
They're coerced to engage in this activity, but competition forces them to pass those

59:33.140 --> 59:35.100
things downstream.

59:35.100 --> 59:39.500
And we have, you know, in the UK, many people will have heard of the subsidy scheme that

59:39.500 --> 59:46.140
exists for, for wind, for offshore wind, in particular in the UK, which is the contracts

59:46.140 --> 59:47.980
for different scheme.

59:47.980 --> 59:52.180
And as I said earlier, you have this kind of, you have this intensification of competition

59:52.180 --> 59:53.740
which is built into that system.

59:53.740 --> 59:57.700
So it's worth just talking a little bit about how that happens.

59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.100
So if the government says, okay, we're going to award these new offshore wind licenses

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:06.900
off for new renewables development, what happens is that different generating companies will,

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:11.660
there's an auction process where effectively what happened is they bid against each other

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:16.060
for this contract where the government will say, the government or a government backed

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:21.940
entity says, we will, we, we enter this contract to buy the electricity that you generate at

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:26.260
a fixed price, essentially a fixed price for the next 12 years or so.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:31.820
And so one company will bid for, will bid and say, well, we'll bid, we'll, we'll enter

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.500
that contract with you at 50 pounds per megawatt hour for the next 12 years.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.300
Another company will say 49, the next one will say 48.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.620
And essentially what happens is they bid it down until it gets to the point where no one

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.420
can bid any lower because they won't make any money out of it.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:50.500
So that's what I mean is that this price based competition is baked into the, is baked into

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:56.420
the process for good reasons on the consumer side, because that's what you want as a government

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:01.980
is keeping electricity prices down, but the profit, the potential profitability for generators

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:03.580
just gets, gets competed away.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.220
I mean, what you're talking about there with regards to the auctions as well, I mean, it

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:07.860
applies to outsourcing companies too.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:11.820
I mean, the reason why Carillion blasts from the past, you know, they collapse because

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:16.180
they kept on basically taking contracts, they couldn't make money because they were taking

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.180
all these jobs.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.180
Everybody else was like,

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.340
I wouldn't touch them with a barge, but you're going to, you're going to bust if you carry

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.340
on like that.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.340
And guess what happens?

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:26.380
They go bust and the, the people that are on the hook with a taxpayer and you don't have

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:31.380
to go bust for that to be a problem, whether it's Sodexo, Circa, Capita, whatever, G4S,

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.420
they get in these outsourced contracts with local councils and the price is so low.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.660
They can only make money if they do an absolutely, guess what, shit job.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:39.660
Exactly.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:42.860
And if they destroy people's labor conditions, that's the only way they're going to make

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:43.860
money.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.620
But you have the political class going, this is how we get value for money for the taxpayer.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.500
No, it means they do a crap job.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.500
People are laid off.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.820
The firm might even go bankrupt and you socialise the risk anyway.

01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:52.820
Yeah.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:58.380
And in the renewable sector, again, you have to do something kind of clever to make profits

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:02.060
and so it becomes a question of like financial engineering, you know, what can you do with

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.660
on the debt side in terms of securitising it and that sort of thing.

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.940
And they kind of get forced into that because you can't make money just out of the, you

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.660
can't make good money out of the contract because the competition is so intense.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:12.660
It was so interesting.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:14.820
It was massively interesting.

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:19.300
Just how neoliberalism with regards to these low margin industries is just so stupid, so

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:21.260
destructive, so deeply destructive.

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:22.260
Yeah.

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:25.740
I mean, the other way I like to put it, that I like to put it is that, and it's like in

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.940
a one sentence is like, there's no OPEC in the electricity sector.

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:38.540
So I mean, OPEC in oil and gas exists in significant part to have price control, to keep prices

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:44.900
and profitability up, so if there's the danger of a kind of supply glut, they tell the members

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:50.420
of OPEC, you know, close the taps for a bit to keep prices and therefore profits up.

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:54.180
Well, there's nothing like that in the electricity sector.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:59.660
Which is, again, kind of good from a consumer perspective, but in terms of incentivising

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.580
investment is a different question entirely.

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:07.380
The thing about, we were talking with regards to the falling costs of solar, I think it's

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:09.020
called Swanson's Law, isn't it?

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.020
Something like that.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.020
Something like that, yeah.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.420
And this is an all outgrowth of what's called the experience curve.

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.780
If you double the production of something, then the price of manufacturing falls by like

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:17.780
15.

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.300
Yeah, and solar has come down a huge amount, massive amount.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:24.620
And so that trend is going to carry on, I mean, that's kind of inarguable, it might

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:26.140
slow down, but it's going to get cheaper.

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.740
I think it has slowed down a lot, but it should continue.

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:29.740
Yeah.

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:33.140
And just for people watching, it's not the same as Moore's Law, which is, you know,

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.140
exponential.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.940
We're not talking about exponential price falls, we're talking about, you know, dramatic

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:43.420
falls, but not as dramatic as something like Moore's Law, you know, the halving or the

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:47.740
halving of costs every 18 months or the doubling of processing speed per dollar every 18 months.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.740
No.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:54.900
So, we've talked about Europe, we've talked about the US, we've talked about the failure

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.460
of markets to deliver with this stuff.

01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:01.620
So what is the proposal then?

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:07.820
Because you've argued that competition makes sense from the perspective of the consumer,

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:11.860
but then you've also said that competition and falling prices are at odds with profitability.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:15.820
And if we're having a private market system for this, then you need to have profits.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:19.140
So, how do we administer electricity or energy, which is cheap?

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.140
Yeah, it's a great question.

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:21.620
But from renewable sources too.

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.540
Yeah, it's a great question.

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:28.820
And I think that, you know, I'll be completely honest about this and say that I don't have

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:29.820
the answer.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:37.140
I think I have a perspective on the range of answers that exists, if that makes sense.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:42.060
And so, I think what's useful potentially for viewers is to understand the kind of range

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:48.780
of main answers that are out there and then to judge for themselves based on some commentary

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:52.980
that I make on each of those answers.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:59.100
And so, there are essentially three main answers out there.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:07.420
But I'll caveat this or preface it by saying all of what I'm going to talk about here are

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:11.660
answers that are kind of on the supply side, by which I mean, they're all answers that

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:21.060
are oriented towards boosting investment in solar and wind capacity.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:28.060
On the assumption that you continue to need to do that because there are those existing

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.860
profitability constraints.

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:34.340
And of course, there are other answers out there, you know, people who are of a kind

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:38.140
of degrowth persuasion would say, actually, we need to be thinking about the demand side

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:41.580
as well and curbing energy consumption.

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:46.220
And I think that there's a lot of truth in that argument as well.

01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:51.100
But I'm not going to go there today, but clearly any answer that is going to be even close

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:55.260
to sufficient is going to have to address the supply side and the demand side.

01:05:55.260 --> 01:06:02.140
Also, you know, the other argument will be, hang on a second, we historically globally,

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:08.580
not just in the West, but globally, in order to try to make renewables more competitive,

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:15.780
the way we have typically done that is by working on the renewable side, offering subsidy

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:21.860
mechanisms, support mechanisms on, rather than taxing the dirty side.

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.620
You know, that's essentially what we've done.

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.580
We've thought, OK, we'll do that.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:30.500
And so economists, mainstream economists will say, well, actually, the answer is that,

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:34.260
you know, the externalities associated with fossil fuels are not being properly priced.

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:39.380
And so the answer is to price those externalities properly.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:44.060
And again, I think that I understand that argument, but obviously that's a politically

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:47.580
very difficult argument because we live such carbon intensive lifestyle.

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:54.340
So if you start taxing that, it really hurts consumers in terms of inflation.

01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:59.340
And I think that's the main reason why we haven't gone there is that politicians are

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.540
very, very, very concerned about that.

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:06.740
They don't want consumers to be hurt through higher inflation because of the carnivorous

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:11.180
nature of the consumer baskets that we all have in our lifestyles.

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:16.580
So with that said, the three main solutions that are out there in terms of boosting the

01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:22.420
support, you know, boosting the speed of the energy transition on the renewable side are

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:25.340
and not surprisingly, they're associated with three different kind of interest groups

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.100
for want of a better term.

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:31.700
And they're all interesting and they all have their merits as well as their drawbacks,

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:32.700
I think.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:37.580
So the first answer is the one that you hear from sort of mainstream energy economists.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:43.180
So economists who are trained in orthodox economics and they're focused on energy markets.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.420
Great people to talk to you because they at least, unlike a lot of my colleagues on the

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:53.140
left know the energy markets, they really know what they're talking about there, although

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.220
they look at them through certain in certain blinked ways, I would argue.

01:07:57.220 --> 01:08:02.500
So what they argue is, look, the problem is not that we're relying on the private sector

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:06.780
and the profit motive and markets to do this, of course, they wouldn't, they don't say that.

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.780
That's fine.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:12.180
What they argue is that the problem is that the market design is not right.

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:17.580
So what they would say is that, is that, and I have some sympathy with this argument because

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:24.420
they're right when they say that electricity markets as they exist worldwide today are market

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:29.860
mechanisms that were designed essentially in a fossil fuel world and they haven't really

01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:32.660
been changed in the last 20, 30, and that's true.

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:33.660
They haven't.

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:36.380
They're pretty much the way they've always been.

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:41.420
And they argue and it's understandable, they say, look, we just need to redesign those

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.380
market mechanisms, rethink the way we price electricity and wholesale and retail markets,

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:49.180
and then everything will fall magically into place.

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.260
But of course, economists always say that, that's the answer to every problem, which

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:57.420
is that the problem with markets is not that we have markets, the problem is that we haven't

01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.420
got them right yet.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.420
We haven't perfected them.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.340
We haven't optimised them.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:06.540
And also there are lots of recommendations out there circulating in different forums

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.740
for how you might do that.

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:14.300
But all of them have distinctive drawbacks as well as potential advantages associated

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.300
with them.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.700
That's that answer.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.940
And as I said, I have some sympathy with that argument, but I'm definitely not convinced

01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:20.940
by it.

01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:23.220
The second answer is, again, is very, very interesting.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:28.940
And that's the answer you typically hear from the energy industry itself.

01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:33.140
And so what they say, obviously they agree with economists that the problem is not that

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:37.420
we're relying on the private sector markets, but where they disagree largely with economists

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.460
is they don't think the problem is in market design.

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.060
They say, no, that's fine as well.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:44.980
Just keep existing markets as they are.

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:48.100
The problem is that the subsidies to renewables aren't big enough.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:53.740
So they basically say, look, keep everything as it is, but just like double the support

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:57.980
mechanisms may provide more of it and make them more attractive.

01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:02.700
And that's what the Inflation Reduction Act was in the renewable sector.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:09.900
Industry had been saying to the US government, you have been attenuating the subsidies you

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:13.540
provide us with lowering the level of tax credit.

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.700
And it's stagnating.

01:10:14.700 --> 01:10:17.260
That's what you get if you do that.

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:18.260
Lift it back up.

01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.860
And so that's what the government did.

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:21.980
We get to see whether that will have the desired impact.

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:28.420
But that was, in my view, was all about re-inflating profitability in the renewables industry to

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:33.980
re-attract investment into that sector, very, very straightforward actually.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:42.300
And I have some sympathy with that as well, because if the totality of our options is the

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.900
private sector, what else are you going to do?

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.100
That would work, is what you're saying, in your opinion.

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.460
I think it probably would.

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:57.100
If you essentially guarantee profits, and if those profits are attractive in relative

01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:02.060
terms according to the different alternatives that are out there, then, yeah, money will

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.060
flow in.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.060
Absolutely.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:11.420
I mean, it would be really costly for the consumer and or the taxpayer in some combination.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:14.140
But I think it would work if the government did that enough.

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:18.020
But obviously, there's huge reluctance to do that for all sorts of reasons.

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:21.180
Not just the cost to the consumer, you don't want to see it be seen to be lining the pockets

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.740
of nasty big capital.

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:24.740
That's the second option.

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:31.140
The third option is the one that those on the left will typically say, which is to say,

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:34.260
the problem is that we're relying on the private sector and markets to do this.

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:35.740
It doesn't work.

01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:41.140
We've been doing it for 30 years, still isn't working, still going much too slowly.

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:47.180
Let's try something different by which they normally mean, or we, if I count myself in

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:57.260
this group, normally mean mass public sector ownership and investment in renewable energy.

01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:00.700
The argument being that the private sector and markets isn't working, isn't being shown

01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:07.820
not to be working, even though that all these subsidies continue to be available worldwide.

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:15.700
That's a really, in many ways, at least on the face of things, a very attractive option.

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:19.700
If you think about it like this, so go back to what I was saying earlier about five to

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:25.220
eight percent returns, well, if five percent, eight percent returns are not sufficiently

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:30.940
attractive to draw in mass private sector investment on a significant scale, you would

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:35.060
imagine that returns of five to eight percent would be perfectly attractive for the public

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.060
sector.

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:41.940
Presumably, if you are a government, you would just be happy with an investment that kind

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:47.740
of covers the cost of capital, and if it doesn't do any more than fine, why would you need

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.500
any more than that?

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:58.540
In principle, I think that that is a very attractive option, but of course, there are

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:05.300
obstacles of all sorts of different nature, of an ideological nature, clearly.

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:12.740
The fact that the idea that the private sector can't or shouldn't do this is anathema to

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:22.140
the political class in large parts, not just of the West, but of the world more generally.

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:29.460
Governments around the world, including in what, by global standards, are rich countries,

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:34.140
have persuaded themselves or allowed themselves to be persuaded that they don't have the fiscal

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:38.820
capacity to carry out that type of investment, they need to be fiscally conservative, it's

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:43.580
all about tightening belts, you can't grow the public balance sheet, even if it is to

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:47.900
invest in revenue-generating assets, and I don't really buy those arguments, but those

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:54.980
arguments are very, very powerful, and it seems right now, at least, that very few mainstream

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:59.700
parties at least are even willing to count on any departure from that kind of economic

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:00.700
orthodoxy.

01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:08.540
So, while I think that it's a credible proposition for rich countries, it doesn't seem very likely

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.220
that it's going to be happening any time soon.

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:15.540
Any talk of public sector ownership of energy in places like the UK is, any propositions

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:18.660
along those lines are very, very limited, very, very small scale.

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.220
Stam has killed it, right?

01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.220
Basically, yeah.

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:26.700
It means overtly saying, this will be the market, we're not the Tories, but it will be the market.

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:31.500
Which means that, as we were talking about earlier, great British energy such as it is,

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:35.060
or such as it might be, what's the point?

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:40.300
It's going to be a bit-part player in a private market that is completely unchanged, so it

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:43.220
will just be like another private sector player, basically, and it probably won't even do it

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.620
as well as those in the private sector.

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:49.460
What's the point of doing it on a small scale if you're not doing something fundamentally

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:50.460
different?

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:54.940
There's no point, in my view, there's literally no point in public sector ownership unless

01:14:55.180 --> 01:15:00.660
you are enabling and incentivising that actor to do something fundamentally differently

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:01.660
from a private sector.

01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.860
Otherwise, there's no point, just let the private sector do it.

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:06.860
It's going to be a private sector actor which pays shit wages to people.

01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:07.860
Probably.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:08.860
And does a shit job.

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.860
Yeah, that's what's going to happen.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:10.860
Yeah, of course.

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:13.980
Best case scenario, it will be mediocre market actor and it will be privatised by the Tories

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:14.980
in 15 years.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:15.980
That's what's going to happen.

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:16.980
Best case scenario.

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:17.980
100%.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:18.980
Yeah.

01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:19.980
There's no point.

01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:24.420
Unless you're going to do it on a large scale with the ambition to do something fundamentally

01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:27.420
differently, there's no point in doing it in my view.

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:31.300
The only argument for doing it would be that it's like a wedge in the door and that then

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:34.620
you can build on it potentially.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:39.940
Maybe that's the grand plan that's not being talked about, but I'm doubtful anyway.

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:42.580
But the other thing about public sector ownership, I think, the only other thing I would like

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:52.620
to say about that is that even if it is theoretically, to my mind, quite credible and possible in

01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:56.540
the relatively rich parts of the world, it's a different matter entirely in going back to

01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.460
where we started our conversation.

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:04.980
In those parts of the world where investment is most vital, if you're talking about those

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:10.100
countries in the global south that we were talking about, the idea that governments in

01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:18.900
those parts of the world, which are struggling under infinitely more severe fiscal constraints

01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:24.780
than the governments of the US or Germany or the UK, are going to kind of borrow cheaply

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:31.420
on the capital markets for investment in public ownership of renewables, ain't going to happen.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:36.340
You could say we're going to recalibrate the provider of the World Bank and so it's not

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:39.260
like implausible, but it's not going to happen right now.

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.260
No.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.260
It's definitely not going to happen right now.

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:47.100
But you would need to give it insofar as the fact that, for example, many of those

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:55.580
countries are kind of staggering under huge existing debt servicing obligations from the

01:16:55.580 --> 01:17:02.300
past, those would have to just be written off essentially in order to enable that kind

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.300
of new investment to take place.

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.300
So it's a big ask politically as well as economically.

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:10.860
Speaking of the kind of austerity arrangements, and I find this quite funny, it's a bit of

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:18.260
a tangent, but you have in Europe with the Eurozone and European monetary integration,

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:22.820
you've had since 1999, since there's been the Euro as a currency, the stability and

01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:27.540
growth pact, which all the members of the European Union actually, I think, have to

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:32.420
adhere to, one of the major parts of that is to not run deficits of more than 3%.

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:35.660
Now of course, if your economy is growing at 3%, 4% and you've got inflation of 3%,

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:40.980
4%, a deficit of 3% forever is absolutely fine actually.

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.940
But what's really interesting is they suspended it in 2020, I don't know if you saw the story,

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:50.780
they suspended it in 2020, and it's only going to come back now, I think it was 2020 to 2023.

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:56.980
And over that time frame, Italy's GDP per capita grows quickly as the United States,

01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:00.460
because there was loads of public sector investment in really important infrastructure.

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:05.620
And now the European Union is saying to Italy, you can't run deficits anymore, and if you

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:09.100
don't, we'll sanction you, and you think, fuck, they've just literally been growing

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:14.100
at their best clip in 25 years, but their stupid little brains can't get around it.

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:20.060
On the point you said about public ownership, and again, it's like an ideological default

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:22.740
now, which people do not understand.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.540
The idea of public ownership making money.

01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:25.540
Absolutely.

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:29.580
It's only going to be us sinking money, losing money.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.380
You're talking about investing in revenue generating assets.

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:33.380
What's the problem with that?

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:36.460
I mean, if you look at, for instance, where I live, Portsmouth, I did an article about

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:41.220
this recently, you've got Portsmouth International Port, which was built in the early 1970s.

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:47.540
The idea of a city, a medium sized city like Portsmouth, building infrastructure like that

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:51.620
today in partnership with the private sector is just like implausible.

01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:55.260
So they built Portsmouth International Port, I think it adds a couple of hundred million

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:58.420
to the national economy, it employs 5,000 people.

01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.500
Last year it made eight million pound profit.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.780
It's publicly owned, right?

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:07.800
And basically, since it's been built and it's not been privatized, that has basically

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.460
meant hundreds of millions of pounds going to local people in Portsmouth.

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:14.660
It means lower council tax and it's paid for a ton of services.

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:20.220
Up there in Southampton, where the airport's privatized, guess what, the city's busts.

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:25.940
But people were spending too much, or maybe actually it's about ownership and you're

01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:27.740
not owning the things that make cash.

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:28.740
100%.

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:31.820
And there are two things I would add to that.

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:38.580
One of them is, you mentioned parenthetically, which is, you said it's built by the public

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:40.700
sector in collaboration with the private sector.

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.540
So lots of people, when you talk about public sector ownership of energy, they say, well,

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:46.500
the public sector can't do that, public sector doesn't have the capacity and the expertise.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:49.900
You don't have to build it yourself, you just give a contract to someone to the private

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:50.900
sector to build it.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:54.660
It's the ownership that matters, you don't have to build it, it's the capacity.

01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:58.460
And then the second thing is, they're like, well, then the public sector will fuck up

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.460
the operation.

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:02.340
Or a wind and solar farm doesn't take much operation.

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:05.140
Once they're built, you don't have to do anything.

01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:09.060
Occasionally a rotor will stop turning and you have to send an engineer out with a screwdriver

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.220
to get it going again.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:11.580
But that's about it.

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:14.380
It doesn't take like a rocket scientist to run a wind or solar farm.

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.380
So the idea that the public sector can't do this is preposterous.

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:21.740
And I think about Southampton up the road.

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:27.020
Like I say, their bust, they're dimmed street lights in Southampton, like 20%.

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:32.580
They're going off an hour earlier and you think you've got the country's second biggest

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:37.900
commercial port after Felix, though, and it's in private hands and you're turning off the

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.300
fucking lights an hour earlier.

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.660
Like this is a madhouse.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:45.500
Many people in Pompey would say Southampton's a madhouse, but for very different reasons.

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.860
They probably lose to their football team next year as well.

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:49.700
Well, Southampton might get promoted.

01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:50.700
Oh yeah, they're in the final.

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:51.700
Good point.

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:52.700
They might get promoted.

01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:55.540
I don't want them to get promoted for people who aren't aware, but Portsmouth has just been

01:20:55.580 --> 01:21:00.300
promoted to the championship and thanks to our in that league as well.

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:03.700
So I mean, that to me is interesting, the idea of public ownership or something, which

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:07.260
is going to make money, which, you know, again, a lot of the public doesn't understand that.

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.980
It's not because the public are daft, it's because literally no politician other than

01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:15.300
Jeremy Corbyn has actually even made tried to make the argument for 30 years, but it seems

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.580
to me like you're saying...

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:19.140
And Bernie Sanders in the US made the exact same argument.

01:21:19.140 --> 01:21:24.820
We can have public ownership with a decent rate of return, really good social externalities

01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:25.820
as they be called.

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:26.820
Yeah.

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:27.820
Yeah.

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:28.820
Decarbonizing.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:29.820
What's the problem?

01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:30.820
So what is the problem?

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:31.820
Well, I think it's ideological.

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.100
I mean, I think, I think that's, that's what it is.

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.900
But there's no special interest groups stopping them from doing that.

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:37.900
In the globe.

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:42.060
No, no, I don't think, I mean, except for the fact that, of course, behind the scenes,

01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:48.020
the energy sector, the asset managers and so on, are telling them that they can't do

01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:51.940
it for all those reasons that we've, that we've touched on already.

01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:56.860
So it's not just, I mean, ideology is kind of created by interest groups to a significant

01:21:56.860 --> 01:22:02.780
extent, but I don't think they, I don't think there are substantive economic arguments against

01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:05.140
it in, in certain countries of the world.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:11.180
And I think that it's much more challenging in parts of the world where, you know, absent

01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:19.060
really significant transformations, but certainly in a place like the UK, it's completely, completely

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.060
credible.

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.180
Okay.

01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.260
So it's public ownership, but it's public ownership without conflict.

01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:26.540
It's not like you're saying, right, we're going to bring this stuff into public ownership.

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.700
It's literally saying, okay, well, we're going to build new capacity in the state.

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:29.700
It's going to do it in the state.

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:30.700
We'll own it.

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:31.700
Yeah.

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.940
You're not saying, okay, well, these water companies, they're, they're screwing up, they've

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:36.820
failed, screw them, because of course, their counter-argument is where your bills are going

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:37.820
to go up.

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:38.820
Right.

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.100
So it's, it's, it seems like a very low cost form of public ownership.

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:42.100
I think so.

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:43.100
Yeah.

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.100
No, I think so.

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:51.580
I think that, that's, that's where the kind of really interesting arguments are coming

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:52.580
from.

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:57.220
And, and, and there are some, some initiatives in that direction, not in the UK, but in, in,

01:22:57.220 --> 01:23:01.020
in New York state, many people might have heard the, there's, there was a build public

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:07.100
renewables act that was passed last year, I think it was, which at least on paper looks

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:12.420
like it could be quite significant in terms of public ownership of electricity generation,

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:18.860
in New York state remains to be seen whether it will actually be actioned in significant

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:19.860
part.

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:25.340
You know, the, the, the, the degree to, you know, just because it's there on paper doesn't

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:29.020
necessarily mean it's actually going to, going to happen on the ground.

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:34.220
There are, there are lots of potential obstacles in the way of a political nature, but things

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:35.580
are happening on that front.

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:39.220
So there is reason, there is reason for hope, I think, on that front.

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:44.940
But I, you know, I think that of, of the three kind of options I outlined, that seems to

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:52.540
me at least, to be the one with the most potential, to get things, to get things going more quickly

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:53.660
than they currently are.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:59.940
And that's the thing, that's the thing right is like every year matters on this, because

01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:04.620
you know, every, every year with emissions that are higher than they need to be means

01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:08.700
that extra little bit of carbon in the atmosphere or extra large bit of carbon in the atmosphere.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:11.340
I just want to go back to something we were talking about earlier on.

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:15.380
I mentioned Scotland, which actually in terms of the percentage of electricity coming from

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:17.420
renewables is really impressive.

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.420
Yes.

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.660
And you said you want to talk about Scotland more.

01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:20.660
Yes.

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:21.660
Please go ahead.

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:22.660
Good point.

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:23.900
I'd forgotten about that, but very, very good point.

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:28.460
So here's the interesting, here's the interesting thing and this, this, this point about the

01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:32.940
geography of renewables, which is what I'm going to talk about, bears directly on that

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:33.940
question of profitability.

01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:38.420
We were talking about earlier this, this kind of paradox of why renewables deployment

01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:41.580
is not as profitable as people think it might be.

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.820
And part of the answer is the geography of this.

01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:50.460
So in the UK, but not just in the UK, pretty much anywhere in the world you look, it's

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:53.780
the same in Sweden where I live, it's the same in China, it's the same in India and

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:59.900
also in Germany and the US, the, the, the recurring geographical feature that you see

01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:07.260
about renewables is that wind and solar facilities tend to be located at the opposite ends of

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:10.740
the country to where most people live and most industry is located.

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:15.020
So in the, in, in Sweden, for example, the population is disproportionately located

01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:21.220
in the south and all the wind power is up in the north, exactly the same in the UK.

01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:24.860
Now there are two important things to, to understand about that.

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:28.020
Firstly is, is, is why that happens.

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:34.140
And then the second thing is what the implications are there, are there of that for the profitability

01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:36.100
of renewables generators.

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:39.460
So why it happens, it happens for all sorts of different reasons.

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:44.500
And in the UK case, there are certain physical reasons about wind speeds and stuff like that.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:49.340
But the main reason that happens everywhere is, is, is precisely because that's where

01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:51.040
people don't live.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:56.220
And if you are developing a wind or solar farm, one of your biggest costs is likely

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:59.500
to be land, is likely to be land costs, right?

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:03.520
Unlike conventional power plants, wind and solar facilities take up a huge amount of

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.520
land.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.400
If you're going to be generating a lot of power, it's a huge amount of land.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:12.160
And so all other things being equal, developers of renewables projects always will try to

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:16.280
cite their facilities where land is cheapest.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:21.960
So take the, take the US case, for example, you know, the cost of land in, in, you know,

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:28.160
the northwest in, in, in, in Montana or something like that is like 1% of the cost in the east

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.160
coast.

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:33.360
So of course you're going to put your facility there because your land cost is cheaper.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:38.440
And land costs, the cost of leasing or buy it, a part of that generating costs we talked

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.360
about earlier, that's, that's factored into that generating costs.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:45.440
So the fact, those generating costs that come down so much, that includes land costs.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.960
So that's why you get this geographical pattern.

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.200
Now what does that mean in terms of profitability?

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:58.200
Well, the thing is, is that if, if your facilities are located a very, very far away on average

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:05.480
from where the demand for that electricity is concentrated, then your facility is, is,

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:11.600
is, is, is exerting a disproportionate burden on the grid, on the, on the transmission and

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:19.800
distribution grid, because it's much more, you are, you are basically, it's much more

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:24.960
expensive to maintain a grid over long distances, obviously, than over short distances.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:28.800
And the way that this works is that, is that grid operators, those that run the grid in

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:34.480
any case of the national grid in the UK, it, for the cost, that for all the costs of maintaining

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:39.400
that grid and upgrading it and improving it and adding to it, those costs are borne by

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:44.880
everyone who's part of, of the system, both on the consumption side and on the demand

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.880
side.

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:49.840
So on the consumption side, you at home and you pay your electricity bill, you are paying

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:54.000
for electricity to be generated, but you're also paying for it to be transported.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.320
So your share of the grid costs, essentially, to where you live.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.840
But generators are also charged for that.

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:06.760
And while they're not necessarily charged perfectly based on where they, where they

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:13.680
are based, but in general, they are charged much more the further they are away from where

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.640
demand for electricity is located.

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:21.240
So, renewables developers are essentially, because they're much more further away on

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:24.560
average in conventional power plants from where their electricity demand is located,

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:27.840
they have much higher transportation costs.

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.640
So the thing is, right, when, when those, those people focus on, when, when the analysts

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:37.920
focus on generating costs, low cost of renewables, it's actually a completely artificial cost

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:41.320
because it excludes those transportation costs.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:42.440
And you can even say it better than that.

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.840
You can say the generating costs are only low because the transportation costs are high.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.200
Do you see what I mean?

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:53.800
It's like you only have low generating costs because you have low land costs and you only

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:58.800
have low land costs because you're a million miles away from where the demand is located.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:02.320
So you're going to have a huge burden on their transmission system and high transmission

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.520
charges.

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:06.880
So you may think that you're going to be really profitable because you're, because you're

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:12.080
generating costs are very low, but your transportation costs, which no one ever talks about, are

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.080
really, really high.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:18.080
So the geography of this, the economic geography of electricity is unbelievably important.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:22.000
That seems to have big implications for things like municipally owned renewable capacity.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.040
So if I'm Andy Burnham and I'm the mayor of, you know, Greater Manchester, you know, great

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.480
Andy Burnham, great guy, he loves public ownership, you know, he's, well, he does now anyway.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.200
He's all in favor of it, but obviously the land values of Manchester are relatively

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.200
high.

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:37.200
They're going up.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.200
Yes.

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:39.720
And so all of a sudden, actually, it doesn't really make sense for him to be saying, I'm

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:42.160
going to use X amount of square kilometers to build.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.160
Yeah.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.160
Solar or wind.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:45.880
No, two, two things to say about that.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:54.200
So one is, and so a lot of the kind of hope that people have is for, is for kind of distributed

01:29:54.200 --> 01:30:01.280
renewable energy generation that is not sort of one large scale facility that requires

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:05.880
lots of land, but is kind of rooftop solar, things like that, that is attached to households

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:08.760
because it doesn't have those land costs associated.

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:13.920
And so, and so, and so I, and I think that that, as I was mentioning earlier, like 30%

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:19.080
of the Chinese additions in 2023 were rooftop solar that don't have those land implications

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.080
attached in.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:24.960
But in so far as you do need those large scale renewables facilities to kind of really bend

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.600
the curve on emissions, land is obviously a big issue precisely, as you say.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:35.000
And so there are, there are countries in the world where precisely one of the things that

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.720
state authorities are doing in terms of enabling renew, private sector renewables development

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:47.360
is exactly on the land question is, is, for example, aggregating land ownership through

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:53.800
powers of expropriation, for example, to enable renewables developers to get their hands on

01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:57.440
the land more readily and more cheaply than might otherwise be possible.

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:02.480
So I think that that's the way to think about it in the UK context would be that that's

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:05.720
the sort of thing that municipal authorities would have to be thinking about.

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.680
And of course, 40 years ago, it would have been much easier because the state owned much

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:12.160
more land than but it's privatized all of it.

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:16.920
But also suppose if you're if you're a big manufacturing region, so if you're, you know,

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:21.440
that belt in in Germany where you've got so much heavy industry or historically in this

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:26.680
country, you might say the West Midlands, you want, you've got these big factories,

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:30.080
you want to make lots of stuff and you want really cheap energy inputs, you're not going

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:36.840
to want, you know, a wind turbine next to Birmingham, or a or a or a set of solar cells

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:41.280
in Solihull, you're going to want the wind coming from the outer Hebrides, maybe the

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.360
sun coming from further to your south.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.200
So that kind of quite progressive.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.200
It sounds lovely.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:51.120
We all love community ownership and, you know, small scale distributed fine.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:54.960
And sometimes it's great, you know, my mother-in-law shares solar cells on her house that their

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:55.960
energy bills have collapsed.

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:56.960
Yeah.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:00.360
But actually in terms of if you want to have a vibrant industrial sector, we want to manufacture

01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360
stuff.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.680
So that's a big deal.

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.680
It is.

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:04.680
Yeah, absolutely.

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:05.960
No, you're absolutely right.

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:17.680
And I think that and I think that, you know, where where big commercial consumers of electricity,

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:23.280
the Amazons and the Microsofts and so on are investing in supporting the development

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:26.280
of large, large renewable facilities.

01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:29.000
It tends to be a long, long way away from where people are living.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.200
So they're building data centers in nor in parts of Norway, for example, where you can

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:39.120
have these huge server farms because land is precisely because land is relatively cheap

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:44.920
and they can build these huge renewables facilities that can be built at a relatively low cost.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:48.720
And that's obviously very, very different in manufacturing regions of the world.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.720
You mentioned Amazon.

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:50.720
Yes.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:51.720
Microsoft.

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:52.720
Yes.

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:57.600
We're seeing apparently something of a revival of nuclear in the United States.

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.320
Yeah, I've been reading about that.

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:04.280
Obviously because Big Tech, Amazon, Meta as well, potentially, if they go into AI are

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:07.960
saying, look, we need lots of cheap energy and we've done the numbers and we think nuclear

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:08.960
makes the most of it.

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:09.960
Yeah.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:12.360
And I think part and exactly part of that is the land cost.

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:17.040
You know, nuclear takes much less land than wind than wind and solar.

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:22.240
And again, it says partly it's the land cost issue, partly it's the nature of the energy

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.240
resources they want.

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:24.240
Right.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:30.720
Wind and solar are intermittent renewable sources and so they can do certain things,

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:36.880
but you also, whether you are a company or a country, you also want a source of kind

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:40.520
of what's often called base load power, which is the source of power that you can always

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.520
turn on when you need to.

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:49.440
And nuclear is a very, very consistent, reliable, carbon-free source of base load power.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.720
Should we have a nuclear in the UK?

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:54.080
I mean, it's kind of implicit at the start of the book because you talk about the percentage

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:59.240
of energy globally, which is coming from carbon and non-carbon sources, energy coming

01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:03.320
from non-carbon sources when solar has gone up, but at the same time it's gone down from

01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:06.400
nuclear and hydro-hydroelectricity, so actually the shares about the same.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.400
Yeah.

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:10.320
I mean, I think that, I think that, you know, my view, I don't have a very strong view on

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:16.720
nuclear one way or another, you know, I think that, what do I think?

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:22.480
I think that governments, unless they're going to build this, all of this stuff themselves,

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:24.520
which I think they should be, to a significant extent.

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:29.320
But if they're not, they should be doing everything they can to incentivize the private

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:33.960
sector development of as much carbon-free stuff as possible.

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:38.720
And I think nuclear should absolutely be a significant part of that, as well as solar

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.080
wind, not instead of it, but as well as it.

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.480
Brett, such an informative conversation.

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:46.960
As ever, our first conversation was brilliant.

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:47.960
So was this.

01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.720
Maybe we'll get you back on again sometime soon.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:51.720
I hope so.

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:52.720
We'll do that.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:53.720
Thanks for having me again.

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:54.720
Hugely enlightening.

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:55.720
Thank you.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.720
Awesome.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:56.740
Thanks for having me.
