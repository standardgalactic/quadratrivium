0	5760	what they cannot and will never understand is that what they and other liberals call populism
7760	13920	is the political blowback, is political blowback against the social disruption that their policies
13920	18800	have produced. They can't understand the connection between what they've done and populism.
23440	28880	Today's guest is very much an original thinker. He's independently minded. Of course,
28880	33040	everyone likes to think they're independently minded, but over the course of his career,
33040	38880	he's pissed off just about everyone. He first shot to the forefront of the national conversation
38880	45680	about 25 years ago, writing a trenchant critique of globalization and being entirely skeptical,
45680	50400	pessimistic even, about the possibility of a successful war of occupation in either
50400	54640	Afghanistan or Iraq. On both counts, he was proven right.
54800	61600	Now he's turned his attention to the West. He says that the parties of recent decades,
61600	67360	cultural, social and economic, are over that the status quo can't carry on that we're very much
67360	74480	at a crossroads. So what next? He thinks the future will in many ways resemble the past.
75280	81120	Perhaps things like religion, ultranationalism, maybe even feudalism might be on their way back.
82080	86080	Big questions and different answers to what you'd hear elsewhere,
86720	90960	but that's what we like here on Downstream. John Gray, thanks for joining us.
90960	94240	Very pleased to be here, Erin. Very pleased to be talking to you today.
94240	100240	We're very happy to have you. I just wanted to start by saying I first read you around 2001,
101680	107520	Fullstone and thereafter Straw Dogs, but Fullstone I think was the first time I'd read you. I was 17.
108320	112000	For me, that put you on the map. Obviously, you existed well before then and we'll talk about
112000	117120	that as well. What was the response to that book? Because it was a very provocative thesis at the
117120	124720	time, namely that globalization, ever larger swathes of the planet falling under the guise of
124720	130960	liberal market capitalism isn't necessarily going to happen and maybe it has some big downsides and
130960	133600	some people didn't quite agree with your conclusions, did they?
133600	140000	Well, it was considered off the wall because it was published at a time
141920	150080	when globalization as a mood and an idea and a profitable project was at a tight.
150880	154560	So if I'd been calculating the time to do it, I wouldn't have done it then.
155360	163680	And the reviews it got were without exception, with one exception, I think a friend took pity
163680	170640	on me halfway through the process, but were all extremely negative. I mean, normally my books
171520	178720	polarize people in a Marmite-like way. This didn't. Everyone hated it. And I thought at the time
178800	184400	that, and I think I still think this, it simply went against the mood. The Cold War had ended,
184400	189760	it was supposed to have ended in victory. Although even 10 years before I published
191520	199200	False Dawn, I'd written in a conservative magazine a piece on Fukuyama's essay before he
199200	204720	wrote the book. The essay came out in the fall of 1989 before the world came down,
205680	211920	but very close to the time when it came down. I had written then that the coming collapse of
211920	217440	communism, which I thought was going to happen, would be the resumption of history on very
217440	223120	traditional lines. It would not be the end of history at all. I mean, I think I later joked it was
223920	228560	rather like one of Beckett's stories where he, which contains the line, the end again.
230160	234160	It wasn't the end of anything. It was the resumption of history because the Cold War was a rather
235520	242400	anomalous period in which global politics, not completely because there were the non-aligned
242400	248000	movements and so on and so forth, but was organized in a binary opposition between two
248000	252160	Enlightenment ideologies. And that was very liberalism and communism. They both spring from
252160	257840	the Enlightenment as a broad family of ideas. And liberalism appeared two of one, but I never
257840	266560	thought that it had one because it was liberal. I'd knew some of the people in Poland who were
267520	275280	and other East European countries who were working against the Soviet control of their
275280	281600	countries. And some were intellectuals, but many were religious intellectuals. Some were Catholics.
281600	286800	Many were nationalists. I mean, what brought down communism was not intellectual dissenting.
286800	292960	It wasn't economic inefficiency. It was solidarity, the Roman Catholic Church and Baltic nationalism.
294000	299920	Now, they were, so even before it happened, my interpretation of the weakness, the fragility
299920	306400	and the ultimate collapse of the Soviet project was completely different from that of Western
306400	312160	liberals. My interpretation of it was that what was happening, it was that these regimes were
312160	318960	becoming illegitimate, even in Russia, ultimately. But before that, in communist Europe and in the
318960	325440	Baltic states, they were becoming more and more illegitimate and hollow, even among their servants,
325440	332240	even the elites were less and less willing to use force to rule. And that this was not because
332240	339440	liberalism was spreading as a universal ideology. It was because in nationalist and religious and
339440	344400	other traditions, particular traditions and particular forms of life and thinking in these
344400	349920	different countries were reasserting themselves. So I never expected that it would turn into a
349920	357280	universal liberal hegemony, not for a single moment. So when I 10 years later published
358880	364000	False Dawn, I wasn't surprised either. I was surprised by the intensity and the
364960	371040	consistency and the near uniformity of the negative reaction. But then I reasoned.
372960	378080	That's because we're at the height of this project now. It'll take a while. And it took a long time,
378080	385920	actually, it took almost till now, that the globalizing project would fragment partly for the
385920	393200	it partly fragmented because of things I didn't anticipate, like the pandemic. Although I do say
393200	398400	in Straw Dog, someone reminded me, I'd forgotten that if you have long term plans, don't ask your
399040	406560	financial advisor, ask an epidemiologist. Because even then, 2001 or 2002, when it appeared,
408640	416880	I'd been reading about the way plagues had had an impact on various junctures in history.
417680	424720	So I hope it's a rather digressive answer to your question. But I think these thoughts then were so
425360	432400	antagonistic to the ruling worldview at the time, and the ruling mood at the time,
432400	437280	which is one of boosterism. Remember, one thing I've learned is this, is that if you have a
438240	448720	a view which everyone accepts as being the truth, and it promises good things and is also profitable,
449520	455520	which so if you if you talk to banks on those days, which I did a bit and you say to them,
455520	463680	as I did, China will not become a liberal state will not happen. Why will it not happen? Because
463680	467200	first of all, this is in the 90s, they looked at what happened in the Soviet Union, they're not
467200	476160	going to repeat it. Secondly, it's a Leninist state and the judicial system and the courts are all
476960	482400	subject to the party. It's not going to change. Thirdly, every enterprise that have any significance
482400	487600	and generally big enterprise has party categories implanted in which we have to be consulted at
487600	491920	every point. They're not going to permit a revolution and a liberal state could only come
491920	496480	about in China by a revolution. So it's not going to happen. No one believed me. First of all,
496480	504080	because it meant that the ruling worldview was false, which while worldviews last, which is
504080	510880	sometimes not very long, they're very contagious. Group think heard thinking comes in. And secondly,
510880	514960	it would have made them doubtful about the profits they were going to make. So when you have a
514960	521840	conjunction of group think with the prospect of serious money being made, it's irresistible.
522560	530000	So it goes on for as long as the profits seem to come in or as long as the underlying geopolitical
530000	535680	tensions don't become too obvious, which they now have. So now we're almost into a position where
535680	541440	de-globalization has become a cliche. We're almost in a position in which everybody accepts
541520	546080	that globalization role, which it is in many important respects, but not all. Does that answer
546080	551760	your question? It answers my question very well. I think for younger listeners and viewers,
551760	559920	people younger than, say, 25, they will find it almost impossible to believe quite how distinctive
559920	565360	and sincerely held the ideology you just said was. If you said to somebody,
566080	569200	no, I don't think China will actually get more liberal. They would say, well, of course,
569280	573200	they will have rising GDP, they'll be falling birthright. The bourgeoisie will emerge.
574640	577440	And the bourgeoisie, they would say, they could do with a bit of Marxism on this,
577440	581120	has always been liberal. It hasn't always been liberal. The bourgeoisie in Europe in the
581120	585920	mid-20th century backed fascism, not liberalism. It's a complete historical myth.
585920	592160	Well, yeah. Or you look at the rise of anarchism at the turn of the 20th century, late 19th century,
592160	595840	the guy that killed McKinley. These were basically small business owners. They were radicalized members
595840	600000	of the petty bourgeois. They were attracted to anarchism. The idea that they would fall
600000	606240	in behind some sort of stolid progressive bourgeois ideology. Anyway, the funniest point
606960	612000	for me was in about 1989, 1990, when I would say, what's going to happen
613520	618160	is that history will go on as usual. And people said, you're an apocalyptic pessimist.
619040	622480	So if you say things are going to go on as normal as they've always done,
623440	627200	you're an apocalyptic pessimist. If you say they're going to change completely from what they've
627200	635520	ever been, you're a realist. Now, when I was in Washington in the 89, 90, one of the things
635520	641760	that happened then is that some of the big foundations that were backing foreign policy
641760	646400	programs, these ones I knew were mostly on the right, pulled most or all of their money out.
646400	649120	So was this like the Atlantic Council people? I can't remember now.
649600	654080	Heritage, all of those people were getting them. They either cut it down or cut it off
654800	659760	because they said it's not needed. We won. And we haven't just won for five years or 10 years
659760	665120	or even a generation. We've won forever. So the idea that, I mean, this was what Fukuyama
665120	671760	calls capital letter history, capital letter history, Hegelian history, Koyevian history.
672400	676960	These were, that's to say, a certain idea, a certain conception of what it means to be recognized,
676960	685120	to be seen as a human being had become universal, always in the process of becoming universal
686400	692080	or near universal. And nothing could stop that. But it could be accelerated so that
692080	698880	what I didn't anticipate until it began to be clear around about 2001, 2002, I suppose,
699680	703520	is that the people who believed this would want to accelerate this inevitable process
703520	710320	by regime change. That's to say, you could say the whole world is changing on these lines.
710320	713680	There might be a few holdouts. There might be a few Taliban. There might be a few
713680	717280	nationalists here and there. But basically, the whole world is accepting this idea,
717280	722240	this big capital letter. But that's the way it's going to be. But if it's somewhat slower
722800	728720	than we imagined, by then, more than 10 years after the fall of the wall, it was become,
728720	734960	we can accelerate it by not just one, but a succession of wars of choice. Now, by the way,
734960	740640	I don't say they were the only reasons or the only people who were pushing for these wars. There were
741280	746640	military bureaucrats in the Pentagon, some of them. There were supposedly hard
748560	754000	men and women thinkers and so on and tough guys of various kinds who, for their own reasons,
754320	759840	wanted the war. But I don't think it would have happened. I was there a lot in those days.
759840	764160	I don't think it would have happened without the new conservatives. They created the background.
764160	768400	There were other people who supported it. It was a coalition of supporters of the war with
768400	773120	different views. What changed, though, with all this? Because are you a fan of science fiction?
773120	777200	Yes. Yeah. So you look at people like the Foundation series, or you look at Duke
777200	780720	publishing the 50s and the United States. Now a movie. Yeah, two movies.
780720	787520	Yeah, great. It was just a great book, and it has such a firm grasp on what the long span of
787520	794640	history, how empires and enmity and all these primal things you're talking about, nations,
794640	800400	religion. Not only that, but Dune is much more interesting to me than Asimov or Star Wars,
800400	804320	because it's neo-feudal. Well, precisely. But it's in the distant, distant, distant future.
804320	808320	But it's the feudal future. And one of the things about this...
808560	815680	It's a very modern book, right? Yes. Well, a very 21st century or late 21st century book,
815680	819840	because one of the things about one of the features of the worldview, and this was common,
819840	824640	I think, to Marxism as well as liberalism, but certainly of that worldview was the idea of
824640	830400	irreversible phases in history. If you'd gone through feudalism and into liberal capitalism,
830400	835280	you could never go back. You can go back. Not exactly to feudalism, because that was, of course,
836240	840400	an agrarian economy based on land, but you can go back to a set of social relations
841040	845520	and political structures, which are very like feudalism. They're not quite feudalism. As you
845520	849280	know, in my book, I discussed the arguments of some people in America who say, we've got feudalism.
849280	854960	It's not quite feudalism. In some ways, it's worse than feudalism, because in feudalism,
855840	860480	tremendous corruption, wars of religion, so on and so forth, power of the church,
860560	867600	censoring ideas, and so on. They're all those kind of features, but you couldn't actually easily,
867600	873040	not many people until the early modern period when feudalism began to fray. Not large numbers of
873040	877760	people didn't fall out of the system altogether into freefall, which has happened in America.
877760	881520	That's to say, you've got large numbers of people, hundreds of thousands or even millions,
882080	892240	who are basically, apart from some bits of public welfare and charity and crime,
893600	899840	have no position in society at all. That didn't happen. But in other respects,
900880	908640	you can have, and according to some American critics of their own type of society,
908640	913200	you do have a near feudal relation. So I think what's interesting about science fiction or the
913200	923040	science fiction writers who did not accept an Asimov-like or a Star Wars-like view that
923040	926240	these liberal ideas would spread not only all over the world, but all over the galaxy,
926240	931680	all over the world. They thought that previous social forms involving things like, I mean,
931680	938240	loyalties are a big thing in Dune, is it not? Hierarchy. People are told what they can do and
938240	946480	not do. Religion or obligation of and shamanism of various kinds is there. Divination is there.
946480	951920	Roman practice, they've reinvented. Even pre-futile has Roman elements as well in which
954160	960480	divination and other practices were important. So I think there are, I think science fiction,
960480	966000	I mean, I knew J.G. Ballard, who at one point in his life was a science fiction writer,
966000	971200	who wrote other genres as well, of course. But I think science fiction of the best sort is a
971200	976400	good lens to view the present. The great thing with the Foundation series is, and like you say,
976400	981920	there's almost two competing visions of how history works, Foundation and Dune, is that
983040	987760	it offers an amazing snapshot at how people thought, you know, this thing called, we now
987760	993360	call it, in reflection, the great acceleration, permanently rising populations ever greater.
993360	999200	Go on forever. Yeah, you know, because he talks about the, you know, the population of this
999200	1003200	ginormous empire. So that would be too big for the plant. You know, in the tens of billions and
1003200	1008640	billions of billions of people, when in reality, what we know is in the 21st century, this plant's
1008640	1013520	population, probably about 10 billion, and then start to fall. But like you say, they were making
1013520	1018640	inferences from the early 1800s. It'll go from 10, 10 billion to 100. Yeah, this will go on forever,
1018640	1021920	or of course it did. But there were two reasons they were wrong. I mean, the big expansion of
1021920	1029360	population in human history was over two or 300 years, not two or 3000 years, let alone 30,000
1029360	1036240	years. It happened as a, as a, as a byproduct, I think, of hydrocarbons of industrialization.
1036240	1039440	So it was quite, it's quite brief, quite brief 300 years.
1040400	1045840	Well, you know, my grandmother, my grandmother, she died at 98. She was born in a world where
1045840	1049440	there were two billion people. She died this year. She died in a world where there are eight
1049440	1054480	billion people. So that is incredible, right? The planet's population quadruples in the span
1054480	1061520	of a person's life. Wow. So their idea was that that two or 300 years was a template for universal
1061520	1067440	history forever after. Now one, back to nature, that things like that never happen in nature.
1067440	1072720	You never have, in the natural order of things, it all, it all turns on the view that on the
1072720	1078480	belief which liberals have, but never admit to, I never believe, liberals generally nowadays don't
1078480	1083440	admit to ever having any of the beliefs they really do have, or that they've, that they've had in the
1083440	1088640	past. It turns on the idea, which not only liberals, but some Marxists as well, have that
1089360	1096320	the human animal can do a very con humanized nature or transcend nature. They might say, well,
1096320	1099520	this might have been true in the days of Malthus. It might have been true in the days of the Roman
1099520	1105040	Empire. Plagues might have been important in ancient Rome and so on, but why in a completely
1105040	1111920	different perspective. What they didn't bring out was a feature I'd argued in rather rudimentary form,
1111920	1118560	perhaps, in false stone, which is that the more integrated a global economy and a global
1118560	1125520	civilization was, the more fragile it would be. I mean, until, I suppose the start of the 20th
1125520	1133840	century, when you had a world flu epidemic, plagues weren't global because most of the human
1133840	1138480	beings in the world lived in economies that were separate from each other. They didn't touch each
1138480	1143440	other very much, and it's no accident that when you had big plagues in the ancient world, they
1143440	1150720	were in Rome, which was an early experiment, if you like, in globalization and closely
1150720	1156720	interconnected by trade. So they didn't take on board that the either in history, in earlier
1156720	1165040	periods of history, like the Roman period, or in the natural, in the systems of nature,
1165040	1174080	natural systems, growth of this exponential kind is never full stop, never permanent.
1174800	1179040	It always comes to some kind of stop. I want to pick up on something that you said,
1179040	1181840	because this is really fascinating. And it was one of those two or three insights of the book,
1181840	1187600	which just really hit me. One was this idea that, and we've said it many times on this show,
1187600	1192640	you know, we're reverting to a genre of capitalism, a kind of political economy,
1192640	1197760	which in some ways resembles feudalism, gains in productivity only go to the top 1%,
1198400	1204160	increasingly profits and revenues generated through asset ownership,
1204160	1208560	renterism, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is not no arbitrage, not production.
1208560	1211360	Yeah, exactly. Value, capture, not creation, blah, blah, blah. People have been saying this
1211360	1218000	for like 15 years. What you say is that actually, in some ways, the system we have now is worse
1218000	1223280	than feudalism. Can you explain why? Because I think obviously most people would disagree with that.
1223280	1231200	Well, in one reason is the one I've already given you, but it's connected with the one reason is
1231200	1239920	that large parts of the formerly productive population in Western countries, particularly
1240720	1247920	United States, have no productive role in the society. And since their identities,
1247920	1257360	their communities, but also their medical care and their incomes depend on their role in the economy,
1258160	1264400	they have nothing basically. And one of the things they don't have is what people had in the
1264400	1268800	feudal period. Of course, if you're a Marxist or a certain kind of liberal rationalist, you say
1268800	1274000	that this is just an illusion that pacified them. Even though they knew the society around them
1274000	1279920	was thoroughly corrupt, they still actually, I think, believed, I mean the evidences they believed
1279920	1286560	that in the rationality of society, which was that it was an afterlife in which injustices
1286560	1290160	would be corrected. It might also be hierarchical after and after, but it would be much better.
1290160	1294560	By the way, the reason we know they believed this is that there were also radical and revolutionary
1294560	1299280	millenarian movements in the Middle Ages, which said we do believe this, but we don't accept the
1299280	1309600	society. So the millenarians in the proto-communists, if you like, in the late medieval early modern
1309600	1315600	period were not atheists ever. They were eschatological Christians, that's to say they believed
1315600	1320000	that they believed these legitimating rules. Now the difference now is that, I think, and this is
1320000	1326400	new, but something that young people can, I think, understand. No one really expects now.
1326400	1331280	Certainly no one's confident. Certainly no one thinks it's inevitable, but actually hardly anyone
1331280	1336480	really expects the rest of their lives or their children's if they have children or their children's
1336480	1341520	children's lives to be better than theirs. That's a fundamental change. It's a fundamental, a really
1341520	1349040	profound change because the the militaristic ideology of increasing material well-being
1349600	1355280	interlocked with the progressive ideology that each stage of emancipation society built on the
1355280	1361040	previous one. So women get the vote, they're partially emancipated, still very unequal,
1361040	1367920	but that can be remedied once that's happened. Prisoners can get basic rights, ethnic groups
1367920	1372560	to struggle against colonialism. It was a kind of, it was a stadial theory, it was a theory of
1372560	1379120	stages, and the assumption was that each stage that had been reached in the past would remain fixed,
1380400	1386160	would remain there. Now one of the features of the 20th century, that was disproved in Europe,
1386160	1395280	because Europe in the interwar period saw tremendous conflicts of ideologies and ethnicities
1395280	1401200	and so forth. And when the Nazis then came, they swept away, not only, I mean they achieved,
1401200	1409040	it isn't that they went from some kind of level of staircase three back to staircase two, they went
1409040	1415440	to minus 20, sweeping away enormous amounts of what had been achieved before, sweeping away even
1415440	1423120	the good bits of the Bolshevik civilization were swept away. But this is happening now as a
1423200	1428560	common experience and not in the context of catastrophic wars necessarily. The common experience
1428560	1434000	now is that there'll be many young people who will say to you, I'll never be able to afford to own
1434000	1439520	a house. I can't even afford to rent in London. If one room in London is now over a thousand pounds a
1439520	1451040	month, one room, I just can't do it. And they don't see a point in the future where that will be
1451040	1456480	different. So it's most acute though, I mean if you have some kind of a job, if you have some kind
1456480	1462720	of education, if you live in a country where there are, however semi-collapsed till some welfare
1462720	1469440	institutions and NHS and with all of its problems and others, then people can sink into a mood of
1469440	1477200	resigned hedonism, which I think is a common response. But if you're in, if you have nothing at all,
1477200	1483360	if you live in a semi-collapsed of state of nature in a post-industrial
1485680	1492080	part of the United States where there is epidemic drug use, then you'll have what is now in fact
1492080	1499840	happening, which is huge levels of early death, falling longevity. I think longevity in Mississippi
1499840	1504800	is roughly that of Bangladesh. Just building on what you said there, there's a great line in the
1504800	1509440	book which basically says religion historically was the opium of the masses and now they're just
1509440	1513440	being offered opium, fentanyl, oxy-concentrate. But before they were offered fentanyl, they were
1513440	1516880	offered the future. Precisely. So this is the typology I sort of just want to quickly offer. So
1516880	1526160	like you say, feudalism, you have eschatological afterlife, modernity, you have like you said,
1526160	1530240	the future, world temporarily embarrassed millionaires, the sort of American ideology.
1530240	1535200	And now, like you say, we don't even have that. There is no future. So you have high inequality
1535200	1540800	potentially under all of these scenarios, personal income deprivation, suffering. But like you say,
1540800	1547040	there are two big amelioratives in those first two categories, feudalism, pre-21st century
1547040	1551680	capitalism, let's say, mid-20th century capitalism. And then now we have something quite distinct.
1551680	1556320	And you also see this, I think, in the built environment. The built environment across much
1556320	1561520	of the UK and the United States is just collapsing. It is collapsing. Literally in many cases.
1561520	1568000	It's a visible expression of giving up on both faith and the future. We have buildings now
1568000	1572160	built for 30, 40 years, which look like crap, don't really serve any purpose. And nobody
1572160	1576160	thinks they'll be there three or four decades from now. And not only that, but they're becoming
1576160	1584000	either toxic or fragile. With the cladding and the rack concrete. Let's think of a period though
1584000	1589040	in our history, one which I'm old enough to remember even, in which this was not the case.
1589040	1594240	There was a period after the Second World War in not just in Britain, but in other Western
1594240	1601280	countries, European countries in America, when the state assumed certain responsibilities
1602080	1608960	for moderating inequality, mitigating suffering, and reinforcing social cohesion.
1608960	1614960	They weren't, in other words, old labor weren't anti-capitalists, but they wanted to
1614960	1619840	restrain capitalism. And they thought it was necessary to do so. Why did they think that?
1619840	1625360	Because many of them had lived through the 1930s. They were from a generation that had not only
1625360	1631440	fought in the Second World War, so they knew what could happen when a social system had
1631440	1636240	melted down. But even some of them were old enough to remember the tremendous meltdown of
1636320	1640880	capitalism, which had triggered Nazism, which had triggered various fascist movements, or at
1640880	1647600	least energised them. And so then in the after the Second World War, for maybe up to a generation,
1648960	1655840	30 years perhaps, mid-70s, there was a system in many European countries, which was called
1655840	1661600	Social Democracy, and I think had many achievements to its name. And so that was the kind of,
1661600	1673360	it depended on an environment which began to change, even as early as the late 70s, I would say,
1675040	1679040	but an environment in which there were relatively close economies, in which there wasn't much
1679040	1684080	globalization. It only really began to get going in China and elsewhere, the market
1684080	1690400	reforms began to get going in late 70s. But for 30 years, there was a more
1690400	1697200	restrained form of capitalism based on what? Based on the perception, the experience,
1697200	1703680	not just the theory, that capitalist economies can go badly wrong. When they go badly wrong,
1703680	1708000	they can be really badly wrong, and that can have terrible political repercussions,
1708000	1712640	including fascism. That was common sense, and it was well founded common sense among
1712640	1722960	the old Labour people. That was then, that insight was then lost in the 80s, and after the 80s.
1722960	1728560	Well, let me give you again, maybe an anecdote. I came from a northeastern working class background,
1728560	1734800	and in the first part of my life in the 50s, Britain was still poor after the Second World War,
1735360	1741360	was still a poor country. And yet, NHS doctors came out if you had a cold, a flu.
1743120	1750480	I remember them coming to my house, unthinkable now, even before the pandemic, that anyone would
1750480	1756720	come out for anything short of a major emergency. And yet, well, we are richer even now. You might
1756720	1761840	be getting poorer now, actually, but we have been richer. What changed? What changed was
1761840	1765680	the global environment of capitalism, and the dominant beliefs about the state, and about what
1765680	1772960	the state should do and not do. And this is produced in Britain, a tremendous confusion. So,
1773760	1785120	part of the confusion was that when Brexit became an issue, most of the Brexiters in the run-up to
1785680	1795680	2016, thought that Brexit was a window to further globalization, to an even smaller state.
1796400	1798400	Most of the people who voted for it did not share that.
1798400	1799280	No, of course not.
1799280	1804640	Yeah. But that's created, I mean, that's one of the reasons why the Brexit project has been
1804640	1806720	aborted and botched.
1806720	1809360	Let's return to Brexit in a second, but I just want to stick on this. So, you say that...
1810080	1810960	There was a period.
1810960	1814320	There was a period, and these people weren't anti-capitalist. So, what I would say to that is,
1814320	1819120	and that's obviously correct, is that those people today would be classified as anti-capitalist.
1819120	1823440	So, if you say... And this is... There's a great talk by Eric X. Lee about the Chinese Communist
1823440	1828800	Party, and it's a TED talk. And he said elsewhere that we still believe in markets in China.
1829440	1836240	We still... There's still money making money, ergo capital. The big difference is that those who
1836240	1842000	make political decisions don't view the interests of capital as superseding the national interest
1842000	1846160	of the public good. That's what he says. So, the interests of capital aren't the sort of
1846160	1847920	political sum on bonds.
1847920	1853040	Although, let's never forget that the power of workers to resist capital in China is even
1853040	1853920	less than it is in China.
1853920	1854400	Absolutely, absolutely.
1854400	1854880	Much less.
1854880	1855840	Yeah, but it's a really interesting...
1855840	1855920	Much less.
1855920	1856400	It's a really interesting insight.
1856400	1857680	I know trade unions for a while.
1857680	1859360	No, absolutely. I'm not... I'm not sort of sad.
1859360	1859760	No, I know.
1859760	1863360	Yeah. But it's a really interesting insight, which is to say that, okay, well, China has markets,
1863360	1868080	China is deeply embedded in global sort of production, commodity chains, yada, yada, yada.
1868080	1870800	What is different? Because clearly, there are differences in terms of the sort of political
1870800	1871040	decisions.
1871040	1873840	Well, the difference I say in the book is, and this is maybe...
1873840	1878000	But let me just talk, because I want to stick with this, because I think what he's saying
1878000	1884160	about the public good, about certain values taking priority over the interests of capital,
1884160	1888480	I think that broadly applied to European social democracies from 45 until the late 1970s.
1888480	1889120	And so, I think...
1889120	1891840	And even earlier, because in that article you wrote about boots.
1891840	1894880	Yeah, yeah, exactly. But if you say... But if you said that now...
1894880	1899440	The capitalists themselves accepted limitations on what they could do.
1899440	1903680	But if you're a politician now and you say that, you say there should be limits on what
1903680	1908160	capital can do, where it can go, what it can buy, that is viewed by...
1908160	1908960	As anti-capitalists.
1908960	1909920	Yes. Yes.
1909920	1914640	So Ernest Bevan would be an anti-capitalist for the lobbyists and news people in 2023,
1914640	1915760	even though he obviously never was.
1915760	1918320	Yeah, yeah. And Peter Shaw would be anti-capitalist.
1918320	1919920	And Hugh Gateskill would be anti-capitalist.
1919920	1923680	Quite. Well, this is one of the absurdities of presentism,
1924640	1930480	that one of the features of intellectual and public life now is that what went before even
1931280	1934560	20 years before. Sooner it'll be five years, maybe it'll be five minutes.
1935520	1939680	It's just vanished. It's just erased. So if you'd say, well, you know, you can go to a
1939680	1944080	library, there are still libraries, you can look up on the internet, you can buy books on Amazon,
1944080	1951600	they're still there, and A-books and so on, written by these people, where they criticize
1951600	1959840	many aspects of capitalism, and that would now lead them to be viewed as almost revolutionaries
1959840	1965440	anti-capitalists, but were then normal, moderate opinion. So we get all this utter nonsense about
1965440	1977760	centrism. Centrism means a kind of a collation of policies, none of which are popular, many of which
1977760	1982720	are radically rejected by most of the population, but they're attenuated and triangulated to the
1982720	1987440	point in which it's thought that they can be put over on the population. That's what centrism is.
1989120	1992800	Most of the centrist ideas, most of them are extremely unpopular,
1993840	1997760	rejected by large parts of the population. Most of the rich population, for example,
1999120	2004240	favours, as I do, but I think it's not going to happen, it's not possible, favours nationalization,
2004960	2008080	taking back to some form of public ownership, most of the utilities,
2010640	2017040	obviously water, large parts of energy, maybe parts of the banks, railways and so on, that would be a
2017040	2024720	very good move, and if you check even conservative voters, well over half, sometimes 67% here,
2024720	2029440	very good idea, why don't we do it? It's an extremist idea now, well then you've got to,
2030000	2035040	it's represented as an extremist idea. Now there are reasons why it might not be possible,
2035040	2039040	including some I've talked about in some of my recent, it might not be possible because
2039040	2044800	Britain is very highly exposed to international capital flows. So if these policies were done
2044800	2055040	in a way which the markets perceived to be dangerous to the financial system, the markets would
2055040	2059840	veto it, so it might be that it is impossible, but there's nothing extreme about them.
2060640	2066800	They were the common bread and butter of British politics from, at least from the Second World War
2066800	2074240	before that of course as well, but from the 45, the government of 1945 up to, even I would say
2074240	2082080	periods of statureism, because as I mentioned in my book, she had these rather charming inconsistencies,
2082880	2087920	we can never privatise the post office because the queen's head is on the steps. Now that was
2087920	2095360	actually a deep thing. She didn't grasp the way in which liberated markets, dissolved the culture
2095360	2102240	around them, including the national culture. She strongly opposed, I think BA as British
2102240	2106880	Airways changed the logo on the back of the plane and took the flag off, strongly opposed,
2106880	2110480	couldn't understand that BA was now a global capitalist entity.
2110480	2115680	She should have read some marks about how capital, about how markets can dissolve previous
2115680	2119200	traditions, there's all in the communist manifesto. Absolutely, whether that was where
2119200	2126160	Marx was right, it was prophetic, but she wouldn't have done that, but in her favour,
2126880	2134400	she also, and this is in false dawn, she responded to an account of Phukyama's
2135360	2140640	ideas saying, end of history, beginning of nonsense, didn't believe any of that rubbish.
2140640	2147600	She saw the kind of bourgeois society, basically an idealised model of the 1950s,
2147600	2152800	actually, or even the 30s. She saw that as something that required political struggle.
2153680	2158720	She thought it could be revived. The paradox was, and this is what she was sort of skewered on,
2158720	2163520	this paradox, and the deepest paradoxes are the ones that the people involved in them never,
2163600	2170640	never understand, was that what she did in the economy destroyed all possibility and even then
2170640	2176000	all memory of the society she wanted to rebuild. That's the deep paradox of Thatcherism, which
2176000	2181680	I began to understand myself, maybe from about 87 to 88 and onwards, and that was when I
2182720	2191200	became, adopted a slightly bookaridist role of making cryptic criticisms of all this,
2191280	2197520	very unwelcome criticism. I didn't end up in a camp or something or a cell like
2197520	2204400	Buchanan, but they were very unwelcome. When she was still in power, although she never embraced
2206160	2211680	Phukyama's theory, her own view of the world and that of many Thatcherites had become a form of
2211680	2218000	universal triumphalism, a kind of upside down Marxism. What I'd objected to in Marxism,
2218000	2222880	you might not take this view, but is what I object to in all radical progressive ideologies,
2222880	2226720	which is the contempt they display for the casualties of progress. Say, well, but
2227440	2234800	4 million, 10 million Russian peasants died. Well, they were peasants. People know what
2234800	2240880	cultivated. Did they have degrees? Were they graduates? The left response would be, well,
2240880	2246560	precisely all this happens with regards to the formation of markets in the whole world, right?
2247280	2253040	The Irish famine, for instance, is the exact same phenomenon. I suppose a reasonable, I hope,
2253040	2257680	left response would be, that's absolutely correct. The point is that market ideologues don't
2257680	2264640	understand they did the exact same thing. No, they don't. When there had been moderate forms
2264640	2271120	of capitalism, that was understandable. But when a more radical form of capitalism was reinvented
2271120	2275760	or invented a new form even, actually, because it was more global than it had ever been before,
2275760	2284240	even in the colonial period, it was more global than that. There was this, to me, very repellent,
2285360	2292560	morally repellent, even aesthetically repellent view that if there are groups that can't fit
2292560	2300400	into this, well, let them go. So they would go by living in broken down cities. They'd
2300400	2306080	gradually, some would leave, some would die, some would have short lives. And this is on a bigger
2306080	2310960	scale happening in America, where, of course, as we've discussed earlier in our conversation today
2310960	2318320	are, and there are these really large numbers of deaths from drugs. I mean, of course, that's,
2318320	2322720	I mean, you can look at it another way. You could say, you know, drugs are the hyper-capitalist
2322800	2332400	commodity. It's interesting, but if you, many of the big series in television and series in the
2332400	2340640	last few years coming out of America have been about ordinary people, middle-class people and
2340640	2346560	other people entering the drug economy, breaking bad, but lots of them have been like that.
2347520	2356480	Great TV, but it also tells you something, which is that the only way for many people to either
2356480	2365120	live a normal life, which in breaking bad men, funding cancer care, or to accumulate substantial
2365120	2375600	capital is the drug economy. I mean, large parts of America are now such that the living parts of
2375600	2380880	the economy are the drug economy and its various extensions, because, of course, it then funds
2380880	2386000	legitimate businesses and gains hold of them. So that's a very interesting feature, I think, of,
2387280	2392960	and that connects with our earlier discussion of feudalism. I mean, I think, however much one
2392960	2401120	criticizes the feudal lords and aristocrats, which I would myself in many ways, they weren't as cruel
2401120	2412480	or as anarchical as Mexican or Colombian or Russian cartels. I mean, they're extraordinarily cruel.
2412480	2419440	They're extraordinarily violent and kill enormous numbers of people. And yet, there are large parts
2419440	2426480	of Latin America and other countries that have fallen into that, that condition. And that connects,
2426480	2432240	by the way, with another feature of my book, which is very much resisted and might even be
2432240	2439280	resisted by my Hobbes, if he could be brought back, which is that one of the ways in which I
2439280	2446240	represent Hobbes as a liberal rationalist and a liberal optimist is that he did think that his
2446240	2451280	ideas were, which he are in some respects universal, but he did think that they could be applied to get
2452160	2456240	societies that and fall into what he called a state of nature, that's warring groups,
2456240	2459840	warring over position and power and resources. They could get out of that by
2461920	2466080	inventing a sovereign by sort of contract. I don't think history supports that. I think there are
2466080	2472240	lots of periods in history which show that states of nature in society, state of nature is not
2472240	2476400	something in Hobbes before society is formed. It's something, it's a condition that societies can
2477120	2484480	fall into it at any time. They last for ages, centuries even. It's very hard to get out of a
2484480	2487600	situation like that. And that was something also, by the way, which the liberals of the
2489200	2496160	Iraq war and of the Libyan regime change didn't understand, which is that it's comparatively
2496160	2502560	easy to destroy a state. It's extremely difficult to recreate it in Libya, for example. I mean,
2502560	2510240	one of the features of the current life now is that Libya doesn't just have two governments,
2510240	2515120	which in practice means it hasn't got any government, but it's also one of the really
2515920	2524640	principal gateways of illegal migration into Europe. So that problem was, or that reality,
2524720	2535280	that flow was created by or magnified by the regime change that Cameron and
2537200	2542080	the French imposed on Libya. I mean, when people say you've got to stamp down on the
2543440	2551120	gangs and you've got to repress the people's traffickers, that might be possible to do in
2551760	2556880	Europe where there are still relatively strong states. You can't do it in Libya because there
2556880	2563520	is, in fact, there is no state. So it just can't be done in there. And that's connected. On how
2563520	2570080	many occasions have you watched reports about Lampedusa or other migration flows, big libations?
2570080	2574720	How many times when they mentioned that some of them have come from Libya, how often has it been
2574720	2579360	mentioned that the Libyan state was destroyed by Western intervention? I would say practically
2579360	2583600	never. And that's not deliberate, by the way. It's not a conspiracy which we're not going to
2583600	2587920	mention this. First of all, they never heard they're too young or they're too, they don't know
2587920	2592800	anything about it. They don't care. The business, the rapid business of generating news doesn't
2592800	2599600	permit that kind of reflection. It just isn't in the range of thoughts and experiences and histories
2599600	2604720	that people know. I mean, this to me seems like a core small sea conservative insight
2604720	2610640	as somebody who's a socialist that agrees with this insight, which is, like you say, it's very,
2610640	2616480	very easy comparatively to destroy a state, state infrastructure. It's very hard to build it.
2617520	2620800	And Libya is really the great example here because I tweeted this, I think earlier on the week,
2620800	2625200	with regards to these floods, tens of thousands of people dying, open air slave markets,
2626000	2631520	like you say, this is absolutely astonishing stuff. And I say clearly Qaddafi was better. Clearly,
2631520	2634960	human development index, I think in 2010, they were like 55th in the world,
2634960	2640080	number one in Africa. Now there are 115th, you know, just human development index is literally
2640080	2644720	and some of this is measurable. A lot of it is exactly. Yeah, exactly. So clearly, clearly,
2644720	2649760	you know, you'd want to, you'd probably want to go back in time if you could if you were Libyan.
2649760	2654800	And then some people said, yeah, but he was going to get Benghazi. Benghazi is now right round by
2655680	2659440	basically a form of the Taliban. I don't think they recognize quite what they've unleashed.
2659440	2662080	Well, there's a reason for that, though. It's part of the liberal,
2662080	2665360	a liberal worldview, which is that nothing can be worse than tyranny.
2666240	2672400	But lots of things are worse than tyranny. I mean, some tyrannies differ. There can be tyrannies
2672400	2680000	that are limited in their goals to enriching a few people. And though that might be terrible,
2680960	2685680	it can be less humanly costly than tyrannies which want to change the whole society according
2685680	2692160	to some model, which could be communist or fascist. So there can be different kinds of tyrannies.
2692160	2699840	But it simply isn't true that on any reasonable ethical or empirical assessment that tyrannies
2699840	2705360	are always the worst thing. Where do you think it ends? Because, you know, we've seen so many
2705360	2711040	of these mistakes, like I say with Libya, Afghanistan. After it was said by nearly everybody,
2711040	2715120	this will never happen again. Yeah, it did happen. But people still defend it. That's the thing.
2715120	2719040	That's what I find really, really interesting. Well, they say that it's because they say
2719040	2724640	tyranny is the worst thing. They still believe that. And they don't see the necessity. Well,
2724640	2729280	there's maybe an even deeper reason which wouldn't fit in easily the most aspects of
2730240	2736640	left-wing thought, which is that much of political life as of much of ethical life
2737200	2745440	is a choice in which involves options and choices in which whatever is done involves irreparable loss
2746400	2754400	or even wrong, even injustice. In other words, if you think that, then not just a choice between
2754400	2758720	evils, because you could say, well, choice between evils, we will maximize the good and minimize
2758720	2763120	the evil, which is a kind of utilitarian way of thinking. So in a sense, the evils don't matter.
2763120	2767040	If you get the maximum out of it, the evils don't matter. But I don't think that's
2767040	2775760	true to human experience. Human experience is of choosing between options, recurring options,
2775760	2780800	options that don't go away. They keep recurring in different forms in which whatever is done involves
2780800	2786560	what those who have acted or failed to act recognize to be irreparable losses. I'll tell you
2787120	2794080	an example from that in the Second World War, which was told me by, I thought I have a link,
2794080	2798080	which was that a government officer, government official, appeared, or a minister,
2798080	2802400	even I can't remember now, appeared before his typing pool and said, we're going to sack every
2802400	2807520	single person who's typing, which would be a great injustice to all but one of you,
2808160	2811360	because not only will you be sacked, you'll never get a job again. There'll be a black
2811360	2814880	mark over your security, because you're sacked for security reasons. One of you is leaking,
2815520	2819280	but we don't know who that is, and we haven't got time to find out. And in the meantime,
2819280	2823120	brave men and women are being dropped into parts of the inventory and dying terrible deaths,
2824400	2830800	terrible deaths. So we're sacking a lot of you, and you sacked them all.
2831600	2837120	Now, the interesting thing about that is, to me, is that he recognized that what he was doing
2837120	2842880	involved injustice and wrong, not just a utilitarian calculation. He didn't turn into
2842880	2847600	utilities and said, it'll be more utiles, it'll be more pleasure and less pain in the world.
2848240	2853280	It was a deep injustice to those who suffered it. Their lives were effectively, their productive
2853280	2858800	lives were ruined, permanently and irreparably ruined. Even after the war, they'd never get a
2858800	2863840	job in this, again, but for the sake of a goal, winning the war and also
2865840	2870320	protecting these people who are going out there to be tortured to death and so on and betrayed.
2870320	2876800	Now, a basic question for ethics and political theories, will there ever be a point in the human
2876800	2880240	world where this is to be true? Now, if you're a certain kind of progressive, a certain kind of
2880240	2883760	Marxist and a certain kind of, there will be, there won't be in my view, there won't be, it'll
2883760	2887200	always be like this. Why it'll be like this? Because that's what human beings are like.
2887200	2893040	We are conflicting needs, conflicting impulses, conflicting, even if we had material abundance,
2893040	2898240	it would appear and these kinds of, but that's something which many people are extremely
2898320	2903600	resistant. It's an idea which to them is deeply pessimistic. Although you can turn it around
2903600	2908560	and you can say that in times of tragic choices, they also are periods of context where people
2908560	2915440	can display extraordinary nobility. They can take on the irreparable loss to themselves even.
2915440	2920320	I agree with what you've just said there. I say this when you wrote a book about moving to society
2920320	2926000	beyond capitalism and of a kind of abundance, but not really familiar with. I agree with what
2926000	2934640	you've just said. And I would say in response that human frailties and all the kinds of discontent
2934640	2938640	you just talked about will never go away. And in fact, some people have already lived under
2938640	2943920	conditions of comparative posterity and abundance. We call them the aristocracy. And if you read the
2943920	2948240	sort of novels like La Classe and these kinds of people. How they lived. Yeah, how they live.
2948240	2953200	They're often very sad, very tragic. So there's big parts of their lives which don't, you know,
2954160	2958240	of human experience which won't disappear. And competitive. Yeah. Or quite. But then I suppose
2958240	2966400	the question is, what's a bigger problem? People are getting upset about love affairs or the
2966400	2971840	paradox of choice or not being able to feed themselves or dying from diphtheria. But I'm
2971840	2976560	making an extreme comparison there. But I think you're absolutely right about certain aspects of
2976560	2982080	these things never. But for many people, it's a hard choice to, it's a hard truth, I would say.
2982240	2988000	It's a fact. It's a fact of ethical life. There are these recurring situations. And
2989680	2995520	even in, you see, the paradox emerges for revolutionaries in that in an attempt to create
2995520	3004320	a world in which these tragic choices don't need to be made or they only occur in personal life
3004320	3011600	with love affairs and friendships and so on. The revolutionaries find themselves with precise
3011680	3016160	having to make the decisions and the choices that they want to abolish. So one of the things
3016160	3019760	that's not understood, as you know, a lot of my book is about Russia and I don't deal with this
3019760	3028240	part in Russia. One of the reasons that a post-star is Russia turned into a Bolshevik state. And one
3028240	3032960	of the reasons that was highly repressive was partly Western intervention and partly to struggle
3032960	3037200	with the whites. But one of the things that happens in all revolutionary situations
3037200	3043760	is that the revolutionaries struggle among themselves. And the ones that are the least
3043760	3050880	ruthless, like the Russian anarchists, are the ones that are eliminated, exterminated either
3050880	3056560	physically or politically marginalized. So that the paradox of revolutionary action, and of all
3056560	3062880	political action in my view, even, you know, conventional political action, is that if it's
3062880	3068480	motivated by these grandiose ideas of getting to a world in which tragic choices don't exist,
3068480	3077120	it will find itself making these choices in order to achieve the world in which they don't exist.
3077120	3081600	So perpetuating the world in which it is. And I think that's, I think that's, you see, this is
3081600	3087280	maybe an irreconcilable, I mean, left-wing thinkers and conservative thinkers agree on more than real
3087280	3091920	left-wing thinkers and real conservative thinkers. I don't mean neoliberals on either side agree on
3091920	3098000	more than either, usually realize. But there's a fundamental difference between the view that I
3098000	3103600	take and many people on the left take. And even on the right, of course, the neoliberal right,
3103600	3106960	if you would say to them, they would say exactly in a way what use they say. Well,
3106960	3112400	we may get it to a world where the people have to make choices among ethnic cuisines. They may get
3112400	3117600	to a world in which, I don't know how it could be tragic to choose between Indian and Chinese. But
3117600	3122640	anyway, we may have a world in which people have unhappy love affairs. They do have unhappy love
3122640	3127360	affairs. And we may have a world in which people suddenly die of new diseases and so on. So that
3127360	3134160	might be, that might be, but we won't have a world in which the structures of power are such
3134960	3139840	that they impose these choices, tragic choices on large numbers of people.
3140480	3144160	So I suppose there's two, there's two, having read your corpus, read this book,
3144160	3151040	there's pretty two points of disagreement or interesting conflict and tension. So the first
3151040	3160240	is you've got a quite justified and understandable contempt, critique of utopianism. I would say
3160240	3165200	the major problem for the West in the 21st century is the lack of utopia, is anti-utopianism.
3165200	3168000	Because what it does, and you sort of talk about this a little bit in the book, because you don't
3168000	3173360	say explicitly, you know, is that, well, okay, living standards have been flat for a long time,
3173360	3177920	productivity flat of 15 years, yet we really can't get a handle on any one of about a dozen
3177920	3182720	social challenges that working and middle-class people really care about. But you know what,
3182720	3187600	you're not a peasant living in 15th century France. So stop complaining. So I think,
3188320	3193280	so I think there is a real, there's a toolkit for intellectuals and politicians, which I think
3193280	3197920	was very well suited to the problems of the 20th century. But I think this aversion, skepticism,
3197920	3203360	hostility to utopianism is increasingly constraining the ability of the West to solve
3203360	3209040	its basic problems. No, I would think it's slightly different than that. I mean, the difference is that
3210640	3216080	liberal capitalists don't understand the respects in which they view as utopian.
3217440	3222720	They don't understand the respects in which it can't be made global or universal.
3223440	3230000	The more it extends itself, the more fragile it becomes. And they think of it as permanent when
3230000	3234080	there can be a boom, of course, a boom period. There have been many boom periods in history,
3234080	3238320	that could last for a while, but they have the seeds in them of their own destruction.
3238320	3241280	So they, when they say, I mean, this is the, if you like the problem with
3242000	3247520	what's come to be called capitalist realism, which is it assumes the situation, assumes the system
3247520	3254560	can be indefinitely malleable and indefinitely managed. So this is a form of the end of history.
3254560	3256960	Capitalism is a form of the end of history. So you could say, well,
3257840	3260800	what about the Great Wall Street Cash? Well, that will never be allowed to happen again.
3262880	3266960	What about the rise of fascism in the 30s? Well, that's not going to happen. It is happening,
3266960	3272560	actually, under various forms now. But so by the way, we can be sure it's possible if it's actually
3272560	3278880	happening. One little piece of logic you can get out of philosophy is if something's actually
3278880	3282880	happening, that's definitely possible. But they say, no, we can, we can, we can manage the system,
3282880	3291120	we can keep it going, we can, now that might not always be a bad position to take if the alternatives
3292480	3299120	are very much worse. So if you were, if you're saying to me, if supposing I was in,
3299120	3305520	by my Germany, and before I was born, and there was a program, someone was, came up with a program
3305520	3310320	that would somehow have stabilized by my Germany, difficult given what was happening in the world
3310320	3314480	and so on, and given the conflicts in Central Europe and other impossible, probably, actually.
3314480	3320800	But would I support it? Yes, I would have supported. It could be, it could even be thought of as a
3320800	3324800	conservative program or a conservative program. I would have because if I'd had any insight at
3324800	3329280	that time, which some people I think did actually think how bad it could be, they didn't quite
3329280	3333440	anticipate the full horrors of Nazism, but they thought it could be pretty bad, including people
3333440	3339200	on the left. If you could say, well, if this, if this is the, if would I support a, so to speak,
3340320	3345680	a conservative strategy, then yes, definitely. But the argument then would be, no, that's too,
3346880	3350800	it's too, I mean, if I, maybe I'm putting these arguments into your mouth, but you could say,
3350800	3354320	but that assumes there's no alternative at all, that all the alternatives are disastrous,
3354320	3358400	there could be better alternatives. That's what I think. So for instance, you said that you support
3358400	3362320	public ownership of, let's say something really uncontroversial, rail, because the franchises
3362320	3365840	and it's very easy to water is even less controversial. Yeah, very, these are all quite
3365840	3371280	moderately easy to execute, right? And I think for some people that would be viewed as utopian.
3371280	3375360	And I think what this feeds into is the anti utopianism as the default. It might, I don't think
3375360	3379280	you see, they don't, they don't recognize the premise of politics. So for instance, they would say,
3379280	3382880	well, the shareholders or not, no, they won't have that and the banks and there's,
3382880	3386480	and that's what they didn't get about Brexit is the primacy of politics. If you have a social
3386480	3391440	majority wanting something very passionately in a system where people in order to be reelected
3391440	3395520	have to broadly do what people tell them to do, then that's, there's a difference here.
3395520	3398800	That's the direction in terms of the outcome. There's a difference. Something can be utopian
3400240	3405600	in the sense that it includes, it involves a system that has never existed or has never
3405600	3409520	been, never worked. No, we live in a world where people think that public ownership of rail is
3409520	3412720	utopian. That's what these people think. We're not in a world where it's like
3412720	3417600	St. Simon and Fourier, the sea, St. Lemonade, they think public ownership of energy is utopian.
3417600	3422800	Now, yes, but it may be impossible without being utopian. Again, we know it's not utopian
3422800	3426400	in the sense of being impossible because it did exist. It's a reputation where I say,
3426400	3432400	if something did exist, it's not impossible. Again, so their argument against it is by
3432400	3436320	deploying anti utopianism. Well, if we do that, then we don't know where all that any,
3436320	3441680	any politics, which is... The really hard truth is that what I would prefer in,
3443440	3451040	in regard to public utilities is desirable and certainly possible because it existed before,
3452080	3457760	but may well not be possible for any British government of any complexion as long as it
3457760	3462320	remains as dependent on capital markets as it is. And that's probably right now.
3462400	3467200	That's the hard truth. In other words, it is desirable, it is possible, it did occur before,
3467200	3471680	it could in principle occur again, just not utopian in that sense, not utopian,
3471680	3476880	but it's also impossible for the foreseeable future. As long as we're as exposed, as long as I've
3476880	3482880	argued, perhaps, it was not entirely frivolous when I compared Britain in a piece I did in my column
3482880	3488640	for the two Argentina, one of the richest countries in the world, top 10, which countries 100
3488640	3498400	years ago, went from being in that position in the 30s and then later to becoming a basket case,
3500320	3503840	such that it's actually very high, such that now the various
3505520	3511760	products of the Argentine political culture include radical anti-anarcho-capitalists by
3511760	3516960	their own description who want to burn down the central bank, they want to abolish the
3516960	3524960	national currency and replace it by a mixture of dollars and crypto. They want free markets in
3524960	3529840	sex and also human organs, but they're strongly anti-abortion. I haven't quite worked out how
3529840	3539440	that works, but anyway, that's what some of them are. Millet, the front-runner for the presidency,
3539440	3543200	who could, by the way, I think there's a non-trivial chance that he could be elected,
3543200	3545440	could become, what would he do then? That'd be the interesting thing.
3546960	3552160	But probably, I mean, I have been to Argentina, it was a long time ago, so I don't know what
3552160	3561440	it's like now, but the hard truth is that certain social and political systems get themselves into
3561440	3567120	a historical cul-de-sac from which it's very difficult to get out because their own politicians
3567120	3575200	are thoroughly corrupt, thoroughly irresponsible, and the global capital markets won't, will veto
3575200	3584640	anything that could be done anyway, probably. So the really bad prospect for Britain, which I think
3584640	3588240	is not at all unrealistic, I don't say it's inevitable, but it's not at all unrealistic,
3588240	3595200	is that we're actually either already or entering that position. And this takes us
3595200	3598400	on to Brexit because, of course, what people say, well, we wouldn't be as isolated if we're in the
3598400	3604240	magnificent colossus of Europe, that eternal thing, by the way. I mean, one of the odd things about
3604880	3611280	the EU is that it's almost like a line from Eliot, T.S. Eliot, he talks about the still point
3611280	3617360	of an eternal turning world in one of his mystical poems. That's what the EU is for,
3618320	3622320	the remainder of mind. I don't mean all of those people who voted remain, lots of my friends voted
3622560	3629520	remain. By the way, the best argument against Brexit I've heard was one put to me by a friend who
3629520	3634160	said, why are you voting Romain? He said, because the British political class simply isn't up to
3634160	3638640	making Brexit, they're just hopeless. It's a very good, very good argument. Very powerful argument.
3638640	3643920	That's the best, I think, the best argument. And it's proved to be true. They weren't up to it.
3643920	3648320	They didn't want to, and the political class didn't want to do it. It was handed to them,
3648320	3652800	and they didn't do it. They thought that they put up, they tried to overturn it for several years,
3653840	3658320	then they accepted it, but even now they didn't accept it. Basically, they still want to reverse
3658320	3666960	it, as has been seen recently in Stammer's revelation of the fact that he does have one belief,
3666960	3671280	one feature he has the belief in. Europe, in the EU, the still point in the eternal,
3671280	3675840	in the eternal. If we're in there, nothing bad can happen to us. Nothing bad can happen to Europe.
3675840	3682000	One thing's already bad that is Ukraine. That's pretty bad. But also,
3683440	3688480	many European countries now, for various reasons, partly connected with immigration, partly connected
3688480	3695680	with climate policy and other factors, have seen a continuing trend, not just the blip
3696560	3703040	of the emergence of far-right parties. So we're not that way far off a situation in which
3704000	3710080	the EU will be predominantly a far-right bloc. Now, you would think, wouldn't you,
3710720	3715200	if the attitude of British Remainers to Europe was empirical and not mystical,
3715840	3719440	you would think that they would take note of this and say, well, do we really want to be
3721040	3726960	part of a, we rejoin or in some looser relationship, but still much closer than we are now,
3727680	3731600	to a bloc in which many governments are dependent on far-right support and which
3731680	3738720	will probably include 20% of the vote in Germany is far-right. Over 40% of,
3740160	3746160	I think, if I remember my figures right, of the French electorate in the last presidential
3746160	3751920	election vote for Le Pen. Do we want to be a part of that? No, they don't say that. They never
3751920	3756320	discussed the matter because, as you and I, I think, they're not really interested in Europe.
3756320	3763760	Brexit, for them, was a fetid intratory dispute where they wanted to, they're not doing nothing
3763760	3767760	about Europe and they don't care about Europe, but it does embody a kind of semi-mystical ideal
3767760	3773200	for them in which we can escape the problems which are singular to Britain by merging with this other
3773200	3778080	entity, which has all the virtues that we lack. And it forms, and this is the crucial thing about
3778080	3783440	their resistance to empirical thinking, which is that this is part of a worldview of those,
3783440	3790400	which is that all of the experiences since 2006-16 are departures from the normal course of history.
3791280	3797040	What they cannot and will never understand is that what they and other liberals call populism
3799040	3805200	is the political blowback, is political blowback against the social disruption that their policies
3805200	3810240	have produced. They can't understand the connection between what they've done and populism.
3810320	3814640	Populism comes from nowhere or from very evil people. What they come up with in the end is a
3814640	3821520	theory of evil. Well, there are these evil demagogues who've been lying around for a long time and they
3821520	3827840	suddenly emerge and they deceive the gullible masses, the uneducated, the uneducated. That's what,
3827840	3832240	that's what, it's a theory of evil. It's odd from those who say there isn't such a thing as evil,
3832240	3837040	there's only error, human beings are indefinitely improvable, they're getting better, but they've
3837040	3840960	come up with a theory that explains it. But whatever the explanation they might come up with,
3842560	3852640	2016 onwards, or even before that, is an anomaly in the normal course of human history. The normal
3852640	3858960	course of human history would have seen Hillary Clinton re-elected. Why didn't that happen?
3859200	3867440	The Russians, it's usually something exogenous to society, or some mistake that could easily
3867440	3873760	have been altered but wasn't. Remember at the time they said, well, Trump hasn't got a majority.
3873760	3878880	They never said that about, but previously, I mean, he had a majority. It's an entire worldview
3878880	3883920	which is on the line for them, and it's on the line for them partly of course, because they are
3883920	3890240	the vanguard of the normal course of history. I mean, the normal course of history was that it
3890240	3901440	would be, which was dislocated or derailed from 2016 onwards. It would be that a transnational,
3901440	3906000	potentially global, but at least European state, which wasn't an empire, but wasn't
3906000	3910960	a nation state either. It's not an empire, but it isn't a nation. It's some new, completely new.
3910960	3913520	And it wants to go all the way to Georgia, but it's definitely not an empire.
3913600	3919040	But also, it hasn't got most of the, it's where I disagree with some of the Brexit.
3919040	3923520	They say it's an incipient super state. It isn't an incipient super state.
3923520	3929440	It hasn't got fiscal union. It hasn't got armed forces. At the moment,
3930480	3936240	some people on the right of European politics are asking that a naval blockade be put around
3937120	3944000	a land producer. It hasn't got a navy, small problem. So it isn't a state. It's not going
3944000	3948640	to become a state, in my view. There is an argument, I mean, some kind of ultra-sophisticated
3949520	3955760	ex-Brexiteers now say, well, by leaving it, we've made them more likely. Some Remainers
3955760	3960960	say this too. We've made it more likely for Europe to become a dangerous super state.
3961680	3965840	Absolute nonsense. There are too many conflicts within Europe and too many problems that
3966320	3973600	Europe can't resolve. There are conflicts between Poland and Hungary on the one hand,
3973600	3979120	and even between them, but on the one hand, and Germany and France on the other. Then there's
3980000	3985280	the Baltic states. Then there's Scandinavia, Sweden. These all have different interests and
3985280	3991760	different trajectories. But also, in many of the states, as I mentioned earlier,
3992720	3997440	the far-right which is emerging. It's not a pan-European far-right. These are not the
3997440	4001920	fascists and Nazis of the 30s who wanted to abolish nations, actually, some of them did.
4002640	4007840	Some of them were pan-European. They fell up with these small ones, get rid of them, kill them all,
4007840	4014480	enslave them. They're not, they're nationalists. So actually, the strong, the emerging far-right
4015440	4022240	groups, they may or may not be proposing to leave the EU, which Le Pen doesn't anymore,
4022240	4026800	and because actually, the obstacles to leaving, if you're in the euro, are huge.
4027440	4032320	We were able to leave, when we did leave, just because we weren't in the euro. But if you're in,
4032320	4037600	it's a revolutionary act, and a revolution of that kind, which would probably involve in Italy and
4037600	4045040	in France, for example, a devaluation of savings of those who had them in 20, 30, 40%. You're not
4045040	4049040	going to get bourgeois support for that. I mean, the only people who will want it will be impoverished
4049040	4052960	young people. Another feature, by the way, of this is that these right-wing movements in Europe
4052960	4060320	are very often youth movements. Very much lost on English speakers. They think that young people
4060320	4066240	are all liberals and not in Europe and not in America now. I mean, the conversion rate into
4066240	4069600	far-right positions is high, very high among young people.
4070160	4075600	Amongst the one, the cohort below Gen Z is particularly concerning, actually. But what's
4075600	4079840	interesting is, if you look at, I think, people now entering college, 18 to 21-year-olds,
4079840	4086160	there is this extraordinary divergence in political sympathies by gender in the US,
4086160	4090000	which is just, obviously, that's always existed to some extent, but now it's just,
4090720	4094560	it's blown up in the last five years. It's partly for a reason, which I read about in the book,
4094560	4102960	which is back in the early 90s, when I first got the idea that America might come a cropper
4102960	4106560	because of its internal divisions. Can we say a cropper? What do you mean, a civil war?
4106560	4112880	Not civil war. No, it could be civil warfare, which is chronic sort of low-level violence
4112880	4120560	and disruption of institutions, but was partly because of abortion. America's different,
4120560	4126080	not different from everywhere. It's also been conflicts in Poland and some European countries.
4126720	4131040	But America is, because of its religious composition and others, and that spills
4131040	4137280	over into a gender politics. And it's one of the reasons that DeSantis, I think, never really had
4137280	4142640	a chance, because unlike Trump, who could flirt with the pro-life wife, who doesn't believe any of
4142640	4149200	it, and everybody knows he doesn't believe any of it, DeSantis really did. So he really would
4149200	4155600	have pushed, I think, and I think that would have killed Republican support among many Republican
4155600	4161280	women, killed at Stone Dead. They don't want to lose this freedom. Why should they? They may not
4162160	4166560	find the present situation satisfactory in many ways, and because one of the reasons I
4166560	4176400	argued this back in the 1890s is that turning values into rights works when the values are
4176400	4180960	broadly and generally accepted in society. So you can have a right against torture, you can have a
4180960	4186640	right, various rights of free speech and so on, though defining them is not always easy.
4187200	4194400	But if a value position is turned into a right, which is deeply controversial in the society,
4194400	4199600	which is deeply disputed and conflicted, as abortion always has been in America,
4201360	4205920	then in the long run, and it may take, as it did take 30 years for this to happen, back then,
4205920	4211280	what I wrote was the inevitable result is that the constitutional, the supreme constitutional
4211280	4217280	authority will become an object of political capture. If it constitutionalizes rights to
4217280	4222000	activities that a third or a quarter of the population or regard is basically wrong,
4223840	4231040	in the long run, which has taken a generation, there will be a pushback by the conservatives,
4231040	4237520	and that was achieved under Trump, that would point these conservative judges, who had various
4237520	4242960	complex constitutional arguments why abortion should never have been turned into a right,
4242960	4249760	but all of those are irrelevant to me, they're just local American fetishes about constitutionalism.
4249760	4257600	The real reason is that rights cannot insulate from politics, culture and other conflicts,
4258320	4262720	which are deep-seated. If you try to do that, you eventually threaten the regime.
4262720	4266320	But this is very relevant to the UK context, because we, of course, now have a Supreme Court.
4266320	4266960	Yes, we do.
4266960	4268560	Which is very alien to the...
4268560	4270480	Well, it's American in position.
4270480	4271760	Yeah, and that was Blair.
4271760	4275920	Yeah, well, I love talking to conservatives about this, because I say, look, if we had Lord
4275920	4279040	Derrierev and the courts wouldn't be in this mess, sentencing wouldn't be like...
4279040	4279600	Absolutely.
4279600	4283440	The police, this would not be anything like this, and there's probably something to that.
4283440	4286880	But what's interesting with Blair is, when he introduces the Supreme Court,
4287600	4290080	I don't think he realises the gravity of what he's doing.
4290080	4290720	No, he didn't.
4290720	4291200	He didn't.
4291200	4294720	You're changing the complexion of the democracy quite fundamentally.
4294720	4295360	Rightly.
4295360	4300400	Well, I agree with that 100% herein, because what it's done is,
4302880	4304080	it's produced a kind of...
4304720	4308480	I mean, the American system has produced its pathologies, which is that everything is litigated.
4310640	4311200	It's part...
4311200	4313200	And if you capture this one body, you control the...
4313200	4313680	You know, like...
4313680	4314880	Controls everything.
4314880	4316400	But everything is litigated.
4316400	4319120	And politics becomes...
4320400	4322080	Law becomes a surrogate for politics.
4322080	4326080	But when law becomes a surrogate for politics, law becomes politicised.
4326080	4330960	And eventually, that politics becomes Schmidian politics, the politics of enemies,
4330960	4332320	which has happened now in America.
4332960	4335360	That's one end point of that.
4335360	4339600	Now, we are in a kind of halfway house here, which is that
4340480	4350960	lawfare was promoted by the Remainers, but it now covers vast swathes of government activity,
4351520	4356240	to the point at which it's even questionable whether we have a government, actually,
4357200	4358800	because you could say, well, we should do this.
4358800	4360240	You say, well, yes, but you'll have to.
4360240	4361360	I mean, this would be a good thing to do.
4361360	4363680	There might even be agreement, but it'll be litigated.
4363680	4364880	We stop for years.
4364880	4366000	We should build more houses.
4366960	4369520	I'm not saying whether we should or we shouldn't, but we should build more houses.
4369840	4374880	We can't do that because it'll be endlessly litigated through the courts by the Nimbis,
4375840	4376560	which does.
4376560	4380720	And in that circumstance, what it produces in Britain is not yet,
4380720	4383200	or not so much the Schmidian politics of enmity,
4384000	4391600	but paralysis, in which nothing can actually be done on a wide range of issues,
4391600	4396400	unless you're ready to get out of the European Convention of Human Rights,
4396400	4400240	which a few conservatives and others are.
4402240	4404560	Anything that's done about immigration will be litigated,
4405360	4407600	whether you agree with it or not, anything.
4408800	4416320	And many other issues, I mean, issues of town planning and of building and so it applies to them all.
4416320	4422400	So what we've got in Britain is a kind of paralyzing version of lawfare,
4422400	4428960	and it does, I think, emerge primarily, well, at least the starting point of it was Blair's creation.
4428960	4432480	I mean, the very name tells you what he was doing.
4432480	4438480	He was trying to sort of superimpose on a fundamentally different system of parliamentary sovereignty.
4438480	4439040	Let me go.
4439040	4439840	History of ideas.
4439840	4442560	I used to be a historian of ideas and I spent 20 years
4444320	4446320	working and reading about John Stuart Mill.
4446320	4450800	When John Stuart Mill writes about liberty, his background idea is not a court.
4452400	4453600	There wasn't a Supreme Court.
4453600	4456400	There was parliamentary sovereignty, which was pretty well absolute.
4456400	4458480	By the way, it was absolute, up to and including Thatcher.
4459200	4460400	She could do whatever she wanted.
4461680	4463520	I mean, feasibly, it's still here, right?
4463520	4466400	They could scrap the Supreme Court if there was an act of Parliament to get rid of the Supreme Court.
4466400	4469200	Legally, it could all still be scrapped, but there's not the political will then.
4469200	4469760	There won't be.
4469760	4473120	Well, I think I'm sort of surprised the Tories never talk about that.
4473680	4475840	Oh, they have been talking about the European Convention.
4475840	4479440	I mean, the Supreme Court, because that's lower hanging fruit, right?
4479440	4481440	It would be semi-revolutionary.
4481440	4486160	I mean, in a sense, again, look what's happening in Israel.
4486960	4489600	Similar in some respects to us, that there isn't a fixed constitution.
4489600	4490800	There isn't a written constitution.
4491440	4494800	The attempt by Netanyahu to get to limit, even just limit,
4494800	4498960	not abolish the Supreme Court produced profound internal divisions.
4498960	4503680	I also followed and I even went there for on some occasions.
4503680	4508320	I followed the evolution of political development in New Zealand.
4508320	4511040	Now, New Zealand was interesting because its original constitution
4511040	4513360	was an extreme version of the British constitution,
4513360	4515600	which is that there were no set rights.
4515600	4516960	There was no Supreme Court.
4516960	4523840	When I went in the early 90s, late 80s, there was no second chamber.
4525040	4528240	It was a billiard hall, at least when I visited them.
4528240	4531680	And I think the second chamber was abolished there in the 1950s.
4532320	4535840	So there was one Parliament which could do anything.
4535840	4538480	And that was why, by the way, that was the reason,
4539040	4541920	the basic fundamental constitutional political reason,
4542960	4547440	why neoliberalism there was more radical than anywhere else.
4547440	4553840	It's the only country of which I'm aware in which farming was marketized,
4554800	4555920	radically marketized.
4555920	4558240	Usually power, you can do all sorts of things about farm,
4558240	4562480	but you actually just defund them completely, which they did, almost unthinkable.
4562480	4564080	And it all happened rather quickly.
4564080	4566800	There were local reasons for that, which is that the
4567760	4571840	their Labour Party was taken over by someone with strong neoliberal views,
4571840	4573680	but a somewhat left-wing foreign policy.
4574320	4577360	And that led to the left to think that none of this was going to happen.
4577360	4579440	Or it was obvious to me that it was going to happen.
4579440	4582160	But it was also obvious to me that it would melt down for various reasons,
4582160	4584400	because they started talking about changing the electoral system,
4584400	4588880	which they did, and then the party consolation of parties all changed.
4589920	4592080	So most of what had been done was kept,
4592080	4595920	but some of the more extreme entries for their faturism were sort of made.
4597040	4599760	A bit more bearable.
4600640	4603840	But you're absolutely right about this.
4603840	4607760	I think Blair didn't grasp what a fundamental change was.
4607760	4611040	Or maybe he did, but he thought it would be coherent.
4611040	4613520	He didn't understand that underneath, there'd still be parliament,
4614240	4617120	there'd still be local authorities, and they would be political bodies.
4618320	4622160	And then you superimpose this structure of law going up to the Supreme Court.
4622160	4624480	But the Supreme Court still can't overrule parliament.
4624560	4630480	If parliament comes up with a decision, which is what it wants,
4631200	4633040	but the political will is absent.
4633040	4636240	In practice, what that means is my political hope,
4636240	4640160	insofar as I still have any, is for a hung parliament,
4642160	4643840	which may not happen either.
4643840	4646720	There may not be a hung parliament because of what's happened in Scotland.
4646720	4652480	The meltdown of the SNP may give Labour a working majority,
4652480	4655120	in which case there will not be proportional representation.
4655120	4658000	I've now come to the view, which I have posed for many, many, many years.
4659200	4662000	But I pride myself on being something of an empiricist.
4662000	4667200	So I come to this view from observations and evidence that electoral reform
4667200	4672640	is a precondition of any kind of emergence of better political ideas
4672640	4675440	and better political coalitions in Britain.
4675440	4678240	And the reason I came to that is that the principal argument
4678240	4681680	against proportional representation is that it doesn't produce strong government,
4681680	4684320	but we've had governments with massive majorities that have been weak,
4685440	4689360	very weak, have been locked in internal 80 majority,
4689360	4698320	produced chaos and anarchy and various kinds of internal party conflict and division,
4698320	4699680	and achieved nothing, basically.
4700880	4707040	So having that experience and seeing all the parties converging on the non-existent centre,
4708000	4711760	that strange confluence of watered down policies,
4711760	4714720	all of which are opposed by the British majority.
4715680	4720000	And the only way that can be broken up is by changing the electoral system.
4720000	4723440	And I think that is possible. There may yet be a hung parliament.
4723440	4726240	And if there isn't a hung parliament this time, there may be after that.
4726240	4732640	Because one thing I would confidently make a prediction, many other things.
4732640	4734800	It's not clear who's going to win the American elections,
4735040	4738640	not clear whether Biden will be around, not clear what's going to happen.
4738640	4742080	But in Britain, I'm pretty confident Labour will be overwhelmed quite quickly
4742080	4743120	if it becomes a government.
4744720	4747120	Because it has nothing, essentially.
4749200	4754320	Its only policies are a green agenda, which is not affordable
4754320	4757440	and which imposes disproportionate costs on working people.
4757440	4760800	So we'll be rejected by the trade unions and already is being to some extent.
4761600	4765600	And a pro-European policy, which is anachronistic, a nostalgist,
4766160	4767920	and won't occur, probably something like that.
4767920	4768640	Probably won't occur.
4769600	4774080	Because it will be difficult to legitimate democratically in Britain,
4774080	4778720	any really transformative re-engagement with Europe.
4778720	4780880	So it's a cul-de-sac that they're moving into.
4780880	4783040	That will break down and then something else will happen.
4783040	4785680	It's interesting about the parliamentary sovereignty bit,
4785680	4788400	because Ramsay McDonald said this in the early 20th century,
4788480	4791040	which is, we don't need to do what the Bolsheviks have done in Russia.
4792160	4795840	We have a sovereign parliament, which gives the person with the largest number of seats
4795840	4797040	an extraordinary amount of power.
4797040	4797520	I want to finish this.
4797520	4799680	But that's one of my, I'm not a socialist.
4799680	4801680	It's one of my objections to the EU.
4801680	4803760	It's constructed to make socialism impossible.
4803760	4805440	Yeah, well, moderate social democracy.
4805440	4808080	No, I mean, it's constructed to make social democracy impossible.
4808080	4810960	I mean, if it achieved all its goals, it would have done that.
4810960	4813760	It would have been a vast neoliberal market of capital and labour.
4813760	4815600	That's what it explicitly is.
4816320	4820720	So what I find puzzling among on the left, moderate or radical left,
4821600	4825360	is that they hold out these hopes and illusions about the EU.
4825360	4826960	It's very explicit what the EU wants.
4826960	4829120	They want a neoliberal continent.
4829120	4829680	Last question.
4831040	4833760	You talk about the rise of hyper-liberal ideology
4833760	4836400	and the woke religion of surplus elites.
4836400	4837920	So I'm going to read this quote here.
4837920	4839840	Hyper-liberal ideology plays a number of roles.
4839840	4843360	It operates as a rationale for a failing variety of capitalism
4843360	4846160	in a vehicle through which surplus elites struggle to secure a position
4846160	4847360	of power in society.
4847360	4850320	And so far as it expresses a coherent system of ideas,
4850320	4854240	it is the anti-Western creed of an antinomian intelligentsia
4854240	4856880	that is ineffably Western.
4857680	4858480	So this is fascinating.
4858480	4860000	There's a lot of packed into this.
4860000	4860880	Yeah, that's fascinating.
4860880	4867600	So this idea that hyper-liberalism, woke movement, etc.,
4867600	4871120	is drawing upon the intellectual reservoirs of Western liberalism
4871120	4873760	in order to attack Western liberalism.
4873760	4877120	And you see really strong parallels between that
4877120	4879200	and sort of late Tsarist Russia.
4879200	4880400	I do see some parallels,
4880400	4882400	but the interesting point I would make now,
4883760	4886160	I mean, there wouldn't have been the Russian Revolution
4886160	4887520	if there hadn't been the First World War.
4889040	4891440	Of course, there could be a bigger war than we've had so far.
4892160	4894480	It could be that the United States would get into a war.
4894480	4897280	I think it's quite unlikely, actually, with China.
4897280	4899680	And it's very unclear who would prevail
4899680	4901440	or who would lose the most from that war.
4901440	4903840	So there can be more than one comparison.
4903840	4905680	But the key thing about the hyper-liberals
4905680	4908640	is I think the key contradiction or paradox in them
4908640	4910880	is on the one hand, they're tremendously anti-Western,
4910880	4912880	or claim to be the anti-colonial.
4912880	4915040	They think Western societies are incurably rotten.
4915040	4917920	Western civilization was a blot on the planet and on human history.
4917920	4921760	And on the other hand, their ideological goals
4921760	4924240	of deconstructing the self of radical autonomy
4924880	4927680	are all hyperbolic versions of Western ideals.
4927680	4928560	And not only that.
4928560	4930080	They think that all the countries in the world
4930080	4931440	will have to go through this process.
4932000	4934720	They think that the Taliban must become liberal.
4934720	4936800	I don't know if anything's wrong with the Taliban,
4936800	4938080	in my view, at least.
4938080	4941600	But is there only one alternative?
4941600	4943600	Deconstructionist, radical hyperliberalism?
4943600	4944880	They're not going to become like that.
4944880	4946560	Most of the world isn't like that.
4946560	4948640	Indeed, the hyperliberalism of America
4950160	4951920	is strongest in the Anglesphere.
4952560	4956640	Beyond that, it's weak in Eastern post-communist Europe.
4956640	4957760	It's very weak in India.
4957760	4959520	It's weak in China.
4959520	4960480	It's very weak.
4960480	4963520	It's regarded in most of the world with a mixture of
4965520	4968160	gleeful, chadenoid, and pity and contempt.
4969360	4970400	Nobody admires it.
4970960	4973040	And yet, it's very strong in the Anglesphere
4973040	4973840	in many parts of the world.
4973840	4977120	So America's in this strange paradoxical position now,
4977120	4978160	when hyperliberals are that.
4978960	4981760	America has no soft power in the world.
4981760	4983840	I mean, there's no country in the world
4983840	4987280	and no where there are strong majorities
4987280	4989280	which see America as an ideal to be adopted.
4989280	4990880	There are some people that emigrate to America
4990880	4994640	from Latin America, Haiti, China to some extent, India.
4995600	4996640	But it has no soft power.
4996640	4999600	And yet, this parochial, peculiar American ideology
4999600	5003520	which universalizes certain American dilemmas and problems,
5003520	5006640	certain features of racism and colonialism,
5006640	5007680	some of which are universal.
5007680	5009600	But the ones out there, what that universe is,
5009600	5011920	their own peculiar parochial history
5011920	5014320	has spread in many other parts of the world.
5014320	5019920	So it's a projection of a hyperbolic projection
5019920	5022640	of certain Western ideals and forms of thinking,
5022640	5026000	Christianity to some extent, which is a cult of the victim.
5028160	5032720	The Enlightenment, which is part of a cult of human autonomy,
5032720	5035280	are radicalized to an extreme point.
5035280	5036960	And then the idea is the whole world is,
5036960	5038880	isn't it going to become like that?
5038880	5039920	Five or 10 years from now,
5040640	5042240	certainly 20 years from now,
5042240	5044960	the situation in Britain and Europe and in America
5044960	5048640	will be unrecognizably different because this is not,
5048640	5050880	I don't know what it'll be, it'll be quite different from now.
5050880	5052720	But it won't be one in which this is stable,
5052720	5054960	hyperliberal elite running everything.
5054960	5059920	So there are huge movements of discontent,
5059920	5061760	some of them very unpleasant movements,
5061760	5064080	some of them horrifying movements in Europe and elsewhere,
5064080	5065600	but they're vast movements.
5065600	5067440	For example, in their song,
5067440	5070240	Rich Men North of Richmond in America,
5070240	5071040	you heard about that?
5071040	5072240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5072240	5073360	How many views did it get?
5074000	5076160	Now, the left is furious about that
5076160	5077600	and the liberals are furious about this.
5077600	5078800	I'm writing about this shortly,
5078800	5080640	I've written about it in the New States,
5080640	5081600	but they're furious about it because they say,
5081600	5084560	well, it's not really a critique of capitalism,
5084560	5086160	it's racism.
5086160	5090480	Richmond was the capital of the Confederate regime
5090480	5092560	and so on in the Civil War, it's all terrible stuff.
5092560	5095760	But why has it got so many listeners?
5096560	5098320	One of the reasons is surely that
5099840	5103760	the marginalization and the suffering
5103760	5105360	and the loss of a productive role
5106080	5108960	of millions and millions of Americans,
5108960	5110560	along with the stagnant incomes
5110560	5112160	of millions and millions more,
5112720	5114880	in other words, the rise of extreme inequality
5114880	5118640	and so on, is being either ignored
5118640	5121920	or very inadequately treated by the mainstream parties.
5121920	5122880	That's the reason.
5122880	5124560	So there's no way that,
5124560	5127120	there's no way out of this situation
5127120	5129120	and put it into a very simple thing.
5129120	5132000	Whoever wins the next presidential election in America
5132000	5133520	will not be accepted as legitimate
5133520	5135040	by at least a third of the population.
5136000	5138240	So they've entered what Marxists used to call
5138240	5139760	a legitimation crisis.
5139760	5140640	They're already in it
5141200	5143360	and it will become acute after the next election.
5143360	5145440	Whoever wins, because whoever wins
5145440	5147520	is not going to win by a sweeping majority.
5147520	5150000	Worse than that, there'll be a large block,
5150640	5152560	20, 30, 40% maybe,
5152560	5155040	who regard it as not just of Trumpists.
5155040	5155920	What if Trump wins?
5157440	5159840	He will regard it as illegitimate
5159840	5161600	by liberals and Democrats.
5161600	5163680	It's entered an irreversible period
5163680	5164960	of legitimation crisis.
5164960	5166320	It doesn't mean the state's going to collapse.
5166320	5167440	It doesn't mean there's going to be anarchy.
5167440	5168640	It doesn't mean there's going to be civil war,
5168640	5170480	like in the 1860s,
5170480	5174560	but it does mean that it'll be a dysfunctional state
5174560	5175680	which is semi-failed
5176560	5179200	and probably will withdraw
5179200	5181600	if there isn't an accidental big war before then
5181600	5182800	probably will withdraw
5182800	5185840	for some of its major commitments abroad
5186480	5187520	to begin with Ukraine
5188080	5190880	and possibly even its support for Taiwan.
5192240	5193680	In other words, turn into a more,
5194320	5199200	there might be a goal of an autocratic economy
5199200	5200560	which America could achieve,
5200560	5204000	if anyone can, probably in the United States,
5205680	5208240	mixed with a willingness to trade
5208240	5211120	on negotiators with anybody, including China.
5211120	5213120	So it could be that this whole anti-Chinese,
5213120	5217200	I mean, it's more deeply rooted than the support for Ukraine,
5217200	5219280	but it could be that this whole anti-Chinese,
5220400	5221600	by the way, I'm strongly critical
5221600	5222960	of many aspects of the Chinese regime
5222960	5224400	and I also regard it as a threat.
5225200	5227440	Espionage and other things, absolutely real.
5227440	5229680	They're not made up by conspiracy theories.
5229680	5230720	They're real, real threats.
5231360	5232960	But America's not ready for war.
5233520	5234720	It's not prepared for war.
5234720	5236480	I don't convince it will fight a war
5236480	5239120	and that it's the economic interests
5239120	5241280	of many sectors of American society
5242720	5245680	wouldn't benefit from because a lot of companies,
5245680	5248480	I mean, America, it's unlike the Cold War, fundamental point.
5249040	5250800	The relationship between America and China
5250800	5252560	is completely unlike the Cold War
5252560	5254560	because they co-dependent economically,
5254560	5257600	which the Soviet Union and the West was not in the course.
5257600	5258960	Fundamentally different situation.
5258960	5260800	So it'll be something different will happen out there.
5260800	5262080	War could happen by accident,
5262080	5263440	but if it doesn't happen by accident,
5263440	5264640	I think the most likely outcome
5265280	5268160	is that America will fall in on itself,
5268720	5270560	introvert, become even more introverted
5270560	5272640	than it is really actually now.
5273200	5274960	And that would fundamentally change
5274960	5276960	the whole world geopolitical situation,
5276960	5278160	including in Europe,
5278160	5280640	because America's never been stronger in Europe
5280640	5282000	than it is now.
5282000	5283360	If the rug is pulled on that,
5284080	5285120	what happens in Europe?
5286080	5289040	Not just in Ukraine, but in other parts of it.
5289040	5289520	What happens?
5289520	5292320	What happens to the EU, for example?
5292880	5294160	So I think we are approaching
5294160	5299360	an historical juncture in which
5300080	5301440	certain options, which have been options,
5301440	5302480	will cease to be options.
5303360	5306480	And other options will be sort of embedded for some time.
5306480	5309280	And that's not a deterministic or a fatalistic view,
5309280	5312240	but it's one which accepts the irreversibility
5312240	5313520	of historical changes.
5314560	5316560	Even neo feudalism isn't feudalism.
5318240	5319920	And also accepts that
5320640	5325120	the situation that we're in now, politically speaking,
5325120	5326880	is in some respects a tragic one.
5327440	5328960	John Gray, thanks so much for joining us.
5328960	5331040	No, thank you for your questions.
5331040	5333040	And thank you for the very interesting conversation
5333040	5334400	in which you've put counterarguments
5334960	5336080	from which I've learned.
5336080	5337200	I'm very glad to hear it.
5337200	5337840	My pleasure.
5337840	5338400	Thank you.
