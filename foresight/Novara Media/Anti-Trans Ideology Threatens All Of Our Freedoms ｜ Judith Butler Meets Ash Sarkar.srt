1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
Neoliberalism has devastated so many people's ways of living and ways of working, forced

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,600
them from their homes and their jobs, or made life increasingly precarious.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,240
So people are made nervous, they're made nervous by climate change, by war escalating

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,360
as we speak.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,600
As a right-wing political operator, if you reach into that fear and say, guess what?

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,520
The reason you're so afraid, the reason you're so anxious, the reason that the future is unclear,

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:47,600
is gender or race or migration, you're able to reorganize and stoke those fears and anxieties

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,080
in a direction that moves against those minorities or against those populations in favor of

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,200
a really strong state.

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:11,480
Hello and welcome to this very special edition of Downstream IRL, very kindly hosted by Reference

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,720
Point.

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,000
If you're watching this on YouTube, you've got no idea that 100 people have dragged their

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,240
carcasses early in the morning to be with us today, and that's for a very special reason

14
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:38,480
that I'm delighted to say that we are joined by Judith Butler, philosopher, author and

15
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,320
as I found out this morning, fan of hard-boiled eggs.

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,280
They need no introduction, but I'm going to do it anyway.

17
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,120
They are the author of seminal works such as Gender Trouble, Bodies That Matter, Frames

18
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,320
of War and their new book, Who's Afraid of Gender, which examines how a transphobic backlash

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,760
morphed into an all-out war against so-called gender ideology.

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:13,680
It takes us from the Vatican to the conservative right, and it best of all dissects how Britain

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,840
became turf island.

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,240
I'm so sorry that you have to be with us today, but I'm glad to be here, glad to be here.

23
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,680
Very honored actually.

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,880
So I guess my first question is, when someone pops up and says, what is a woman, what are

25
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
they really asking?

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,120
How is that such a good question?

27
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:49,520
Well, it depends who's asking and to whom the question is addressed.

28
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,520
But if Rishi Sunak asks that question of the Labour Party more generally, or its current

29
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:02,440
representative, he's trying to ridicule them or catch them out because you look kind of

30
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,200
foolish if you don't know, or you say, well, I'm not sure, or actually the category is

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
open.

32
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,240
It's like, oh, come on, it's common sense.

33
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:24,200
Everybody knows you're like in some airy, obscurantist, woke ether, and you're having

34
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,160
a problem with a very commonsensical question.

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:36,720
So the person who asks it in that way is trying to ally with common sense or with the common

36
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,600
people who share a common sense.

37
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,400
But the so-called common people who share a common sense also might have a trans kid

38
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,240
or a cousin or have a gender non-conforming uncle, didn't we all have a gender non-conforming

39
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
uncle?

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,320
I'm going to ask him.

41
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Yeah.

42
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
No.

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,840
I mean, it's a way of re-consolidating this idea of common sense, of natural difference,

44
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,840
debunking those who open up the question as either detached intellectuals out of touch

45
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:18,920
with common sense or with some kind of wokeism understood as a set of principles that are

46
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,440
being imposed on common sense reality from a doctrinaire position.

47
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,920
Is there a way to answer that question in good faith, in a way which is inclusive and

48
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,360
acknowledges the variety of the human species, but also is able to grapple with that when

49
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,880
someone says, woman, it doesn't mean something to most people?

50
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,040
Well, I think if we were even to try to answer the question, we would need a multilingual

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
framework.

52
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Right?

53
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
What's that?

54
00:04:52,040 --> 00:05:01,560
Well, how are women referred to or understood in various languages, in various ways of speaking?

55
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,760
How are women thought about in history?

56
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,640
How has the idea of what a woman is changed in different histories, in different parts

57
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,880
of the globe?

58
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,320
So we would need a global framework.

59
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,320
We would need a multilingual framework looking at different ways that women are defined.

60
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,960
We would then need to understand why it was always so important to feminism to keep the

61
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
question open.

62
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
Why would feminists do that?

63
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,280
Well, because they didn't like received ideas of what a woman is or is supposed to be, right?

64
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,840
Stays at home, involved in reproductive labor alone, supposed to be sentimental, not supposed

65
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:46,440
to be rational, not capable of certain kinds of labor, uniquely capable for other kinds

66
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,360
of labor.

67
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,880
We opened the question, what is a woman?

68
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,360
We even opened the question, what does a woman want in psychoanalysis?

69
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,280
We opened those questions because we were not happy with the ways in which those definitions

70
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,360
were operating.

71
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:14,680
And people did, of course, have some pretty intense ways of thinking about this.

72
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,960
So if you live in a society in which women aren't supposed to do certain labor or aren't

73
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,080
supposed to look a certain way, are you still a woman if you do that labor or you look a

74
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
certain way?

75
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Right?

76
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,440
We, as feminists, I thought, we're saying, yeah, you are, of course you are.

77
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,080
You want to be a woman, come on in, of course you are.

78
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,600
Let's expand that category.

79
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,720
Let's make it more inclusive.

80
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,680
So it's been important to an emancipatory project to keep the question of what a woman

81
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
is open.

82
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,800
So why would we, at a certain point in our illustrious history, as feminists, ever decide,

83
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,840
no, we're closing the door.

84
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,360
We're not going to extend the category.

85
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,600
You can't claim it.

86
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,960
Well, why not?

87
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,840
We've been expanding that category, accepting its internal diversification for a really

88
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
long time.

89
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,360
We've gone on the streets for that purpose.

90
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,520
Why would we suddenly decide, oh, this is the limit case?

91
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,720
I mean, you're referring a lot to feminism there, and I suppose that leads me onto the

92
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,600
question of why is it that in the UK, transphobia has come in the guise of feminism, so-called

93
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:32,840
gender critical feminism, as opposed to the much more explicitly right-wing, family-oriented,

94
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,360
religiously inflected iterations of other countries?

95
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,840
That's such a good question.

96
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,960
Well, first of all, let me just say, I think we need to reclaim feminism, transfeminism,

97
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,360
intersectional feminism, post-ND colonial feminism.

98
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,920
There are all kinds of feminisms out there that are really important abolitionists.

99
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,320
Black feminism, we do not give feminism away.

100
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
We do not.

101
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,520
We reclaim it.

102
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:08,240
We make sure that we know how to keep it open, keep it thoughtful, keep it self-critical.

103
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,880
We talk about critical, gender-critical.

104
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,920
I never understand what's being said.

105
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,120
Because critical means, what does it mean if you're a feminist and you're critical?

106
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,040
That means you call into question the presuppositions that you have received unthinkingly.

107
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,400
It's like you become more thoughtful.

108
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,680
You ask, well, why have I proceeded with that category in that way?

109
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,600
You allow yourself to be changed by the history of emancipatory movements to rethink the fundamental

110
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:44,680
categories and you have humility and you change and you become more inclusive and you

111
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,440
offer more recognition and you accept that the categories that we often consider to be

112
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,440
so fundamental are historically changing and it's a good thing because we want to be part

113
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
of that historical change.

114
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:07,880
I think that I can't give you the so-called account diagnosis of UK turfism.

115
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
I think...

116
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,800
We're undiagnosable as a country and they take great pride in that.

117
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:22,680
But I do think it's against the background of a shattered left that these kinds of intensely

118
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,520
sectarian fights start happening.

119
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,640
The only way to have a political position is to identify perhaps as a woman or perhaps

120
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:43,280
as a lesbian and to guard that territory and to make it into a kind of vault or a gated

121
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:51,240
community that controls who can enter and who belongs.

122
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,160
And I think that kind of territoriality happens when people are very unsure about their alliances

123
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:05,600
or where they belong and what their broader political aims are.

124
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:14,720
So I don't exactly know how to account for it but I do think that there are great fears

125
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,880
that I hear trans-exclusionary feminists speaking about.

126
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,400
They're afraid of being replaced.

127
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,800
They're afraid of being violated.

128
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:37,920
They're afraid of having the definition of womanhood appropriated.

129
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,560
And I think it's worth thinking about, well, what are the conditions under which those

130
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,360
become primary fears?

131
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,200
And what are the ways of addressing that fear without seeking recourse to an exclusionary

132
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,600
politics?

133
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,520
It would be great if that could be opened as a debate, as a really serious question.

134
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,000
I think we should take other people's fears seriously, especially when they turn quickly

135
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,680
to either to hatred or to discriminatory or exclusionary politics.

136
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,880
But maybe there's a way to go back to the fear and say, well, let's talk about that

137
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,320
first and see whether another path is possible.

138
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm using the word transphobia quite broadly and of course a lot of the time what we're

139
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,840
talking about is the demonization of trans women in particular.

140
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,160
We're not talking about the demonization of trans men, though of course that does happen.

141
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,560
I don't know.

142
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:37,040
Trans men are called self-hating lesbians or whatever happened to the butch.

143
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:45,440
The butch is being effaced from the earth and the trans, you know, you know.

144
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,880
How are the butches getting along?

145
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Still there?

146
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Still all right?

147
00:11:49,880 --> 00:12:00,080
I mean, well, you can affirm a history as a butch and be a trans man and Jack Halberstam

148
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:08,720
has taught us a little bit about how trans-astrics works in that way to be a more inclusive category.

149
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,040
But why is it trans women in particular?

150
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,080
Because when I try and sort of extract what the big story is from a lot of the things that

151
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm reading, whether it's in The Times of the Guardian, it's sort of this idea of, you

152
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,120
know, here's someone who's assigned male at birth and they've got this power and they

153
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,800
can only be using it for ill, they're becoming like a wolf in sheep's clothing or something

154
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,680
like that.

155
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:44,560
Is that a genuine fear or is it a convenient way of appropriating the position of the victim

156
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,120
when wanting to oppress others?

157
00:12:48,120 --> 00:13:00,200
You know, I think the fear does rest on a misunderstanding or perhaps a willful ignorance

158
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:07,280
about what trans masculinity is and how it operates or what trans femininity is and

159
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,560
how it operates.

160
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:15,480
And I think we need to go back to some fundamentals here.

161
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,600
If you're assigned male at birth that doesn't immediately give you power.

162
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,560
It's once you enter into the social world that you see what that assignment can mean.

163
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,280
A lot of people assigned male at birth are really unhappy with that assignment and it

164
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,320
doesn't serve them and in fact they suffer under it.

165
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:44,360
And they may well not like the expectations of sexuality or the expectations of gender

166
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,840
that go along with that assignment and contest it.

167
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:56,080
Those folks have to go through some real social challenges to secure the sex assignment that

168
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,360
they do want and need to live in the way that they want.

169
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:12,000
So that history of suffering, of aspiration, of desire, that deep sense of self that needs

170
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,920
and ought to have social recognition is not properly honored by those who would reduce

171
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:30,080
somebody to their sex assignment or even the fact that they may well have a penis.

172
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,760
Having a penis does not immediately give you social power, especially if you don't want

173
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,840
it.

174
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,200
It's just kind of complicated.

175
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,120
Or you want it out of play or some other things are more erotic for you.

176
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,000
We don't even have that discussion openly.

177
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,920
It's just assumed like, oh, you're assigned male, you have a penis, therefore you are

178
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,200
a potential rapist.

179
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,320
Is that the way we feel about our sons?

180
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
No.

181
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,280
Our fathers, our friends, our lovers, no.

182
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,400
We know that men negotiate social violence in different ways that a lot of men can be

183
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,480
ethical and that masculinity is in the process of being reproduced in some interesting ways

184
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:20,720
by trans men, by younger men who've been brought up by feminist parents or who've entered culture

185
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,440
and learned a lot about what it is ethically to be a man, how to comport yourself ethically

186
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,920
as a man in this world.

187
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
We want that.

188
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
We hope for that.

189
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,280
We support that.

190
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:42,520
Like I was saying about the category of woman, the category of man is also historical.

191
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,800
We need to be interested in the social reproduction of masculinity and make sure it's being reproduced

192
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,280
in some good ways.

193
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,120
Not that the devil needs an advocate, but someone like J.K. Rowling or Julie Bindle,

194
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,160
they would say that they're speaking up for the most disadvantaged women in society.

195
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,760
Women in prison, survivors of domestic violence, and sure, debating who goes in what prison

196
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,800
might be an edge case, but it certainly does matter if you're a woman in that prison.

197
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,480
So what would you say to those people who would say that actually they're coming at

198
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,960
it from a perspective of risk management?

199
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Yes.

200
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:32,200
I wonder whether we could easily in the U.K., in the U.S. and elsewhere find statistics that

201
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,560
support the notion that prison guards are actually more dangerous to women in prison.

202
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,880
By whom are women in prison violated?

203
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,640
Sometimes by other women, sometimes by prison guards, both men and women.

204
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,400
I think the way gender operates, the way power operates in prison, the way sexual violation

205
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,920
operates is a larger picture.

206
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:00,440
I'd like to see the larger picture first, and then we can ask that question about this

207
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,800
trans woman who happens to be in a women's prison rather than a men's, because what's

208
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,440
going to happen to that trans woman in a men's prison, that trans woman is going to be the

209
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,360
object of sexual violation.

210
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:20,880
So if you say that person should, out of concern for the sexual violation of women, and we'll

211
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:29,400
just leave that open category, that a trans woman should be in a men's prison, what you're

212
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:37,920
doing is recommending sexual violation over there in order to protect yourself against

213
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,200
the prospect, the fantasy of a sexual violation over here.

214
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,320
Maybe we need the broader picture of how is sexual violation actually happening in prisons,

215
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,240
and then we can make a more grounded judgment.

216
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,640
I mean, what we know is that trans women in prisons in England or Wales are much more

217
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,760
likely to be victims of sexual violation than perpetrators of sexual violation, and

218
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,720
that broader picture of statistics bears that out, but someone might say, okay, drawing

219
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,040
back to that bigger picture isn't telling me what to do with this immediate situation

220
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,240
as and when it arises.

221
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,320
There's a question of rights here and how you balance them, and I suppose I'm interested

222
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,320
in, do you buy that there are conflicts of rights here, or are there ways to integrate

223
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
them?

224
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:35,040
The question for anybody who is at risk of being sexually violated in prison is what

225
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,920
is the recourse within prison to protect oneself against it?

226
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:47,840
So the group that we would want women to be protected against are all those who might

227
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,320
violate them.

228
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:59,720
So the same procedure that would be used against a male guard or a woman guard or the exceptional

229
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,800
trans woman would hold.

230
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,840
We wouldn't single out a particular group, especially if statistically that group is

231
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,760
not primarily responsible for sexual violation in prison.

232
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,960
So it's not on the basis of identity or classification that we make that decision.

233
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:30,800
We say anybody who violates another person sexually needs to be held accountable, and

234
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,560
we need procedures for that, but we don't discriminate against kinds of violators.

235
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,040
They're all bad.

236
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,240
But look, there's an obvious point here that probably needs to be restated, and I always

237
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,640
forget.

238
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:54,760
You can find your example of a trans woman who did, in fact, threaten or violate another

239
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,880
woman in prison.

240
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,440
You can find your example.

241
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:05,200
But if you make that example into then the general truth of the category, all trans women

242
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,360
are this way, or all trans women represent this risk, then you are actually engaging

243
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,400
in what's technically transphobia.

244
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:24,720
Because we wouldn't say, oh, you know, I went into this store, and I bought something from

245
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,440
a Jewish store owner, and I think I was overcharged.

246
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,720
Somebody said to you, oh yeah, all the Jews do that.

247
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,920
You would say, fuck you, that's like, excuse my language, sorry, you would say that's anti-Semitism.

248
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,640
Don't worry, I've heard that before.

249
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,480
No, no, no, no, no, but seriously, or one black person does one thing, well, that's what

250
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,880
black people, and that's what happens in right wing propaganda.

251
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,200
That is exactly how presidential elections are run in the US.

252
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,240
You find one migrant who did this one thing, and then that stands for all migrants.

253
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,560
So that's a right wing strategy, it's a racist, it's a transphobic, it's an anti-Semitic

254
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
strategy.

255
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,880
You know how that works, you take the instance, you inflate it into the general category.

256
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,760
So that needs to be stopped.

257
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,080
Before we move on from this discussion about gender critical feminism, I'm going to do

258
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,200
something really annoying and quote your own partner back to you, but as I was reading

259
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,640
your book, I was wondering about whether this narrative that you get from gender critical

260
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,640
feminists that trans and non-binary people are taking something from them.

261
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,160
Yeah, what are they taking?

262
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:44,120
Taking language, taking attention, taking social capital status from them.

263
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,360
I wonder if that could be linked to Wendy Brown's idea of wounded attachment, that you have

264
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,920
a wounded attachment to a position of marginality and there is a certain amount of social capital

265
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,200
that comes with it, and you don't want to let it go.

266
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Well, if I understand Wendy Brown correctly.

267
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,000
This is the scariest moment of my life, by the way.

268
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,880
She's actually up the road, we could probably call her.

269
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:25,000
We do suffer wounds, many of us, gay, lesbian, trans, women, people of color, workers, a

270
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,040
lot of us have been wounded, exploited, violated, we come with histories of wounds, there's

271
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,040
no question about it.

272
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,400
The question is, do we then stay attached to that wound, and does that wound become

273
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,280
the source of our identity, and we just stay as a wounded identity in the political sphere,

274
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,520
and that's our operation to assert that wounded identity and stay attached to it?

275
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,560
Or do we look around and say, well, who else got wounded, and what did they do to overcome

276
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,120
those wounds, and what kind of alliances are necessary to make sure other people don't

277
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,680
get wounded in this way, and that we can affirm life, not just from a wounded position, but

278
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:11,600
from a place of what she's now calling reparation, or a place indeed of emancipation or social

279
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
struggle.

280
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,160
So, there are different trajectories that you can go through, but the question is, what

281
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:25,440
is the wound to feminism, what's the wound to lesbianism really, if the category of

282
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,600
women is expanded to include trans women?

283
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,280
How do any of the people who live in that category, how are they actually suffering?

284
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,540
It seems to me that what they're suffering from is a kind of hatred or phobia that is

285
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:50,440
overwhelming to them, and that that's a corrosive set of emotions to live with, but I do understand

286
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,560
that as, unfortunately, self-inflicted.

287
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,360
I do think some of the debates here in the UK, especially online, where people are free

288
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,000
to be as mean as they possibly can, some of the debates on all sides in the UK have been

289
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,320
very disturbing to me.

290
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:13,600
I don't think hideous insults and condemnations and accusations and vile ways of referring

291
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
to other people are okay.

292
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,560
I'd rather see kind of meaningful open debate on these issues, so I don't think social media

293
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:30,120
has helped this so-called conflict, because it does escalate and foreground the cruelest

294
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:37,640
and the meanest kinds of utterances, and maybe it's important to stay away from those.

295
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,480
It's hard when you're fighting, you want to be cruel, you want to be snide, you want

296
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,280
to ridicule people, you want to show that their position is preposterous.

297
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,800
It's not going to persuade anybody.

298
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,560
I think it might be better to figure out what are people really fearing and do they need

299
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,880
to, and is there another way to talk about that?

300
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,360
I want to move the conversation on a little bit.

301
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,920
When somebody says, I'm a man, I'm a woman, I'm non-binary, it's not just about their

302
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,040
right to perceive themselves in a certain way, it's also about the right to be perceived

303
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,720
and affirmed and addressed in a certain way.

304
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,240
I'm interested in the bit which is socially negotiated, so it's not just about what I

305
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,240
say about myself, it's also about how other people address me, perceive me.

306
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,680
Are there limits to the powers of self-definition?

307
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,760
Tell me what you have in mind.

308
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,480
So for instance, if I was to continue presenting in the way that I am now exactly the same

309
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,120
and I was to say, actually, my preference would be for he, him pronouns, I'd like to

310
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,160
be addressed as a man, there are lots of people who would say, I find this very challenging

311
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,120
what I'm seeing in front of me and what you're asking me to do.

312
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,840
There's a challenge here, so I've got the right to say, live with it, live with the

313
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,840
challenge.

314
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,800
I do think your question raises something interesting, the term gender.

315
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:24,080
Back in the day, we would talk about the gender division of labor and some socialist

316
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,040
feminists still do, and it's important to do that, especially as we think about care

317
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,800
work and social reproduction, and their gender is not about identity, it's actually about

318
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,120
how society is organized according to this exceedingly important power differential.

319
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,400
So gender is a framework, it's a structure, and then there's gender identity, and some

320
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,800
people think, oh, gender is just gender identity, it's become synonymous with or shorthand for.

321
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,600
And then once we go into the question of gender identity, we see that there's gender

322
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:03,280
presentation, how we appear to ourselves, perhaps or to others, and that can be very

323
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,400
divergent, but that's divergent anyway, even among like so-called cis people.

324
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,640
It's like, I think I look a certain way and you think I don't, and it's like, well, why?

325
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,800
Well, because the way we perceive ourselves in the ways others perceive us can differ,

326
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,200
and they can differ actually rather radically.

327
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:32,560
So let's hold that in mind, that there's no bridging of that gap once and for all

328
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,880
in my mind, even if you say, I'm a woman, and I say, yeah, I think you probably are,

329
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,080
do we mean the same thing at that moment? Maybe not, maybe I'm thinking one thing

330
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,880
and you're thinking another, okay. And there are different ways of being and presenting as a woman,

331
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,480
right? And then it gets controversial. It's like, well, I don't think that presentation is,

332
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:04,960
okay, in any case, my point is simply that very often of a felt sense of who one is

333
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:13,200
and how one identifies is not always matched by a socially perceived gender presentation.

334
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:22,000
And so if somebody tells you this is actually how I understand myself, this is my lived reality,

335
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:31,520
you do have a challenge, but you have a challenge because you are, if you're having trouble

336
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,480
reconciling a certain gender presentation with that person's self-definition,

337
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:45,120
you're assuming that gender identification can be read off of gender presentation and it is not

338
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,480
always the case. I understand that, and I understand that it's not always the case,

339
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,040
but if I was talking to someone who was outside of this room, not super duper political, they say,

340
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:04,640
it is quite often the case though. And as a society, we live by rules of thumb, we can change

341
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,960
those rules of thumb when we come across an exception, but I make judgments in a generalized

342
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,680
way. That's how I get through my day. We do, and it's actually one of the reasons why queer and

343
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,000
gender non-conforming and trans kids have had such a hard time, because they're coming to school,

344
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,120
they're looking the way they're supposed to look, more or less, where they're challenging that and

345
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,320
people are just saying, you're in this category, you're in this one, we need to order society in a

346
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:37,600
certain way. And what is the internal sense of suffering happens when you're put into a

347
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,040
category that actually effaces who you are because you look a certain way to somebody

348
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:51,360
who's imposing a set of social expectations on you at school, in religious institutions,

349
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,840
on the street, in the family. It's like, but that's who you are, but that's how you look,

350
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:03,600
but that's how I understand you. It's like, how to live with that deep sense of disjunction,

351
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,520
and you're effaced by the very category by which you are generally recognized.

352
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,720
So it seems to me that a lot of the time when I'm talking to people, I'm very, very much

353
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,880
involved with trans rights. There's sort of two ways of understanding it. There's one way where

354
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,000
you sort of say, okay, what we're asking for isn't very much at all. It is the right to be

355
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,320
affirmed in our chosen gender, and that is not an imposition on anyone else at all.

356
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,920
Changing how you speak, and it's coming from a respect for my humanity. And then there's

357
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,920
another way of looking at it, which is saying, well, actually, people choosing to live in a gender,

358
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,520
which is not the one they were assigned at birth, and straining against these categories,

359
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,560
and challenging these categories, and the connections between gender identification,

360
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,680
gender presentation, and socially recognized gender, that that is actually a really big deal.

361
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,560
And so I suppose my question is, how much of a big deal is it? Is it a small

362
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,600
alteration of social norms, or is it actually something which is a lot more fundamental

363
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:14,000
that's being posed here? Inherently, we're talking about blowing up some of these categories of gender.

364
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:22,800
Well, if you're a biological essentialist, it's a revolution. If you are

365
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,040
a member of a right-wing partisan of the Catholic Church, and you believe in the

366
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,080
natural family and creationism, and that God created male and female, it's revolutionary.

367
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,120
Okay, so for all those folks, it's really rough. And I'm sorry that they're having a hard time,

368
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,800
but I think they need to go through it, and come out the other end, and join the rest of us in a

369
00:31:50,800 --> 00:32:00,160
better world. So it's okay, you know. I mean, I accept it's hard. Sure, it's like deeply

370
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:07,600
sentimented, kind of the lease and habits and ways of seeing. But it is true that a lot of people

371
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,880
just want to be left alone and live without being pathologized and discriminated against,

372
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,680
or the object of violence or disdain. And that seems right to be able to,

373
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,360
like, natal women, they want to walk down the street without being harassed.

374
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,880
Like natal women, they want to get a job without being discriminated against. They want to love

375
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,640
who they want to love. They want their lives and their loves to be recognized minimally or

376
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:48,160
maximally by society and to live in freedom and without fear. Seems pretty reasonable.

377
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,680
One of the things that you object to in the book is an idea of self-definition as being

378
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,280
simply a form of radical liberty. The idea of, well, anyone can do anything now.

379
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,920
That's right.

380
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:06,000
So what is self-definition if not a form of radical liberty? And not a simply a

381
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,200
volunteerist decision of I'm just now? I think it's really important to understand

382
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:22,480
that there's a wide range of positions about gender identification or what some would insist is

383
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,040
sex identifications. Identify as the sex, right? So I don't want to any more at least make a

384
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,240
distinction between sex as somehow natural and gender is somehow cultural and social.

385
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:40,720
I think sex assignment is already political. It's already the act of social institutions.

386
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,600
It's a way of organizing our bodies at the very beginning of time. So sex assignment is

387
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,080
already the work of gender in my framework. You don't have to accept my framework.

388
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,360
But I think for many people,

389
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,160
the sex assignment they receive is deeply right and true and absolutely

390
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,800
incontrovertible and they would never change it and they kind of like it or they really like it

391
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,680
and they're living it out and it's all good. Okay, but that's a relationship to a sex assignment.

392
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,960
Happens to be a very harmonious one. It's like, yeah, I was called a girl. Now I'm a girl and

393
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,320
this girl is great and I'm working with this category and I love it. Okay, good. Go live, enjoy.

394
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,800
I feel like you are channeling every member of the Spice Girls at once for that.

395
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,480
We really, really were. Well, but it's also kind of, it's always been amazing to me how people

396
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,280
like do their girl thing. It's like, wow. You know, and I'm still kind of a child. I think I was,

397
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,600
and I was a child ethnographer. It's like, wow. Look at these people. They're like doing their

398
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:55,680
gender in this way. It's like so amazing. It's like, wow, it's like a boy. It's like boy, boy.

399
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,600
It's like doing this boy thing. It's like, wow. And I was like, you know, I was, I was in this

400
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:10,000
ethnographic, you know, interval, like, not sure, not sure, can do either one very well.

401
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:18,240
You know, so it's, but it's interesting. But then look for some people, it's very fundamental.

402
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,600
Like this was never right. And for some, it's like, well, this was right for a while. That

403
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,360
don't really wasn't right. Or this was okay for a while. And then it was not right. Or I'm able to

404
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:36,560
change this category and the expectations that it makes of me and still stay within it. And others

405
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,720
are like, I can't stay within this category. It's unlivable to me. So I think what we're asking

406
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,720
about is what is the threshold of livability for people? And why wouldn't we respect that?

407
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,480
If somebody says this, this is not livable. And this is, and this is my chance for a livable life.

408
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,880
Why would we say, oh, no, no, no, sorry, you stay in the unlivable category and deprive you and we

409
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:09,200
will deprive you of a livable life? No, I think if we're not cruel people, we accept that somebody

410
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,800
is telling us what's livable and what's unlivable. But do we call that a choice? It's like, well,

411
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,440
it may be that the deepest sense of who one is as a sexed being or

412
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:32,080
as a gender if we're using that language is not fully formed by us, right? We find ourselves

413
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,800
feeling a certain way. We find ourselves understanding ourselves in a certain way.

414
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:44,320
We come to grips with our sense of reality. And it's, we're formed, we're formed by

415
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:52,480
many different social familial institutional powers, but we also form ourselves or we come

416
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,520
to understand ourselves. And it's at that point that we do make a choice, but it doesn't mean

417
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,760
it's a choice from the very beginning. I mean, thinking about, you know, something that you

418
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,760
said in your book is that no one individual or class owns a gender category. So you can't say

419
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:20,160
what Beyonce does. So glad you said that. That was such an easy derailment. It really threw me

420
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,240
like she's doing country music now, guys, and I really feel we need to discuss it.

421
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,160
Taking over, just taking over. It's so easy to distract me. So easy. But like, you know,

422
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,160
no one individual class owns gender categories apart from Beyonce, the exception to every

423
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:45,360
philosophical rule. We're clear. Yeah, we are very, very clear. Does the same apply to race?

424
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,240
Because when I saw Rachel Dollars out, I had this instinctive sense that there's something

425
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:57,760
wrong here. Yes. But I don't own the category of race, right, no individual black person or class,

426
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,400
right, socially constructed class of black people in the category of race. Rachel Dollars out saying,

427
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,040
well, look, I'm identifying as a black woman, I live my life as a black woman. My appearance is

428
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,720
such that people are treating me as a black woman. Is it logically coherent to have different rules

429
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,840
for gender as opposed to race? Was it coherent for me to feel very differently about

430
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:27,840
Rachel Dollars out than I intuitively think about gender identity? Well, first of all, I agree with

431
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:40,880
you that what Rachel Dollars out did and what white people do who want to capitalize on

432
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:51,600
cross-racial definition, identification, is completely objectionable. But they're not exactly

433
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:59,280
parallel. As I was just saying, you know, gender is formed. It's very complicated.

434
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:08,640
Race as a category, race as a classification has a different history. And anybody who works in

435
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,200
intersectional feminism would know that you don't tell the history of gender in the exact same way

436
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,960
you tell the history of race, you actually look to see how these categories are intersecting

437
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:31,360
in specific sites and through historical practices. But I don't think that they are parallel

438
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:40,480
because I don't even accept the idea that you just arbitrarily announce what your gender is.

439
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,920
There's a formation process there. But racial identification is so intensely a

440
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,360
matter of interpolation like how you have been born into the world in and through a set of

441
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:00,640
racial categories and formed as part of a community or part of a demographic classification,

442
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,480
how you've been treated, how your self-understanding emerges. So we need to tell the specific history

443
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:19,200
of that in order to understand why what Donazal did was so inappropriate and wrong.

444
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:30,080
And she wasn't... I think when this question gets posed in this way, it assumes like, oh,

445
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:39,440
I'm just going to choose a new sex because I'm going to get some kind of publicity for this,

446
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:48,960
like a fully volunteeristic notion. So I neither think of trans reassignment or self-definition

447
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:58,400
as radically arbitrary, nor do I think it is possible or right for that to happen,

448
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:14,080
for that particular kind of volunteeristic self-interested claim on blackness.

449
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:22,880
I don't think that's ever justified. She didn't have that history. She didn't come into the world

450
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,720
that way. She has not been interpolated. She has not lived through the history of that interpolation

451
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,640
in the way that black people actually have. And that's a violation of that history.

452
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:39,680
But when we're talking about the history of a trans person, well, they have been violated

453
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,960
by categories, the wrong ones, and they're trying to emerge from violation. So let's think about

454
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,320
where and how do we locate violation in both of those scenes? I mean, to take it away from

455
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:57,920
Rachel Dolezal, perhaps locate it in someone who is racialized in a way which marginalizes them,

456
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,560
you talk about the threshold of livability. For lots of people of color, they'd say, well,

457
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,200
this racial category is a violation of my humanity, how it's been made and how I'm

458
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,520
made to live in it the way society treats me. It is a violation. But the only thing there is to do

459
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:20,480
is to sort of strain at what it might mean to be South Asian, to be Muslim, to be black, to be

460
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:28,720
indigenous. And again, it's sort of saying, you know, is it okay to have just different rules for

461
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:35,200
it? Like different rules, different pathways to go down when you are at that threshold of livability

462
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,960
that is just different for race and for gender? Well, it is, although, you know,

463
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:52,480
it's very funny that we're involved in a discussion about analogy, because race and gender are lived

464
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,600
together. Like gender is never unmarked by race, race is never unmarked by gender, and we know this.

465
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:07,680
And yet, analytically, we set up this kind of hypothesis, which forces us into a kind of separation

466
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,360
that's problematic. But just to stay with your example, I mean, isn't the lived historical

467
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,960
reality that there are people who are like, don't racialize me, I'm just a human, treat me like a

468
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,680
human. Others are like, don't racialize me in this way. This is the way I am participating in and

469
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:38,080
living out my racial affinity, identity, community. I may be straining against an interpolation that

470
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:44,720
I feel like is falsifying or discriminatory, but I am also reproducing it in a way that I find to

471
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:52,320
be affirmative, and actually making connections and coalitions among people of color or across

472
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:59,440
even larger alliances. So we see that this is all lived out differently. I don't know if that answers

473
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,600
your question, but I mean, that's the norm. That's the descriptive fact. I mean, moving on a little

474
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:11,840
bit. In the book, you distinguish between the demonization of so-called gender ideology and

475
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:17,600
legitimate fears like forced migration, climate change, economic inequality, so on and so forth.

476
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,480
An imaginary thoughtful right-winger might say, well, look, actually

477
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,120
fearing the breakdown of social reproduction is a legitimate fear. You look at what happens in

478
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:40,960
countries which are richer, which have got more rights for women in terms of reproduction and

479
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:47,920
the labor market, you get falling birth rates. And so without the sort of coercive stick of gender

480
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:55,200
roles, you don't get babies. I mean, how would you respond to this? Well, that is Victor Orban's

481
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:02,480
argument, right? But he's also really worried, not just that he won't get babies, but that they

482
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,880
won't be reproducing the nation in its purity, which is why he's opposed to miscegenation.

483
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:17,440
So I think we actually have to think about how the emphasis on birth rates is linked to nationalism

484
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:29,200
and also the war against migration, right? So the same people, Orban is one, Maloney is another,

485
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,520
who want to reproduce the nation and want to have control over social reproduction in that way

486
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:45,840
are, tend to be both racist and homophobic and transphobic. I'm sorry, not both, but all of these

487
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:53,040
things are working together. There's an anti-migrant, pro-heteronormative family, anti-gay lesbian

488
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:59,040
family in most cases, not Israel, because if you're reproducing the demographic advantage for

489
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:07,120
Jewish people, they will give you technology. So I think we have to put it in that context.

490
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,680
I'm not worried about falling birth rates. I think the earth could probably handle that.

491
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:20,080
I mean, is there a way to talk about demographic aging without falling into, as you say, these

492
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:24,720
very homophobic, very transphobic and often very nationalist and racist discourses?

493
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:32,160
Yes. Well, give me an example. Okay. So for instance, if I'm looking at the UK and I go,

494
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:42,000
okay, we have an aging population, my friends, we have a economy which is then going to require

495
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,720
much more taxation on the working age population to support people who are aging. So a way to talk

496
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:54,000
about that and talk about the, I mean, to put it really crudely, the sort of needs of the labor

497
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,280
market and how it relates to social reproduction without falling into something which is inherently,

498
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,000
yeah, like a patriarch or forcing people into these categories which might not fit with

499
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,760
them, some humanity. I think opening the door to further migration would be a great idea,

500
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,480
emptying your indefinite detention camps. Yeah, I think that would be good. You'd have labor,

501
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:28,080
more people. Seems like a great idea. I'm with you. You in the book, you connect this war on

502
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:34,720
so-called gender ideology to fascism, to climate catastrophe and saying these are not things that

503
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,920
you can separate off from one another. These are all working to support one another. And then when

504
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,880
it comes to what is to be done about it, you talk about developing a counter-imaginary. And I suppose

505
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,800
I'm wondering, what is a counter-imaginary? Yeah, what's what we're doing right now? We're

506
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:57,040
developing one together. I don't think it can defeat Victor Orban though. We're just getting started.

507
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,320
But I mean, to talk about, you know, what we're doing now and to be harsh on it, like,

508
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,680
are we not sort of, this is a self-selecting group of people? Yes, but we are interested in this.

509
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:17,920
We all go out in the world. Is the sort of the ambition of political activity to sort of get

510
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,360
self-selecting groups of people to change how they talk and think and the hope that it will change

511
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,680
how other people talk and think? Because the other side, they've got newspapers. I know, I know.

512
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,760
Fuck ton of money. Think tanks. I know. Are we bringing vibes to a gunfight?

513
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:40,800
I hear what you're saying. Well, let me take a couple of steps back and

514
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:49,680
quit my vocation as a comedian, although it was always an alternative path for me.

515
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,800
I do regret not having taken it sometimes, especially last week when the media was so

516
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:07,040
rough on me. Okay. This is what I think. First of all, I just think it needs to be known that the

517
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:13,040
anti-gender ideology movement, as it works throughout Eastern Europe, Latin America,

518
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:26,080
parts of Africa, East Asia, certainly Russia as well, as we know, that it is not just focused

519
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:32,640
on trans. It's focused on gay and lesbian rights, gay and lesbian parenting and families.

520
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:39,040
It's focused on women, women's reproductive rights. It's focused on gender-based violence,

521
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:49,680
wanting to undermine international protections against gender-based violence, as, for instance,

522
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:57,120
encoded in the Istanbul Convention. Many countries have now, under the influence of the

523
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:04,560
anti-gender ideology movement, withdrawn from that convention, including Turkey.

524
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:15,600
Okay. So this movement is not just focused on trans. It certainly is. But it's actually

525
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:25,200
sex education, books, books for children, activism, lesbian, gay, trans feminist activism in Russia

526
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:31,920
elsewhere, in Hungary, very rough going, Poland's opening a little bit more now. We should ask about

527
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,480
their mobilizations and why that's happening in the way that it is. It's really exciting.

528
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:47,920
But I think we have to remember that this right-wing movement, it's a movement, but it's also a trend

529
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,080
within several right-wing movements, which is a distinction, that this is targeting all these

530
00:50:54,080 --> 00:51:00,400
people who are arguing with each other here. Okay. We think we're on different sides of the debate,

531
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,160
but we're being targeted by the exact same people. And we would be very foolish to let them

532
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:16,160
target us and unify us as a target better than we unify ourselves as a movement of

533
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:23,600
resistance and social transformation. So this book is trying to produce a more global framework

534
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,840
for some of these local debates so that we might remind ourselves what the stakes are.

535
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:34,240
And if you look in Latin America, for instance, in Chile or Argentina, the feminist movements

536
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:41,840
are saying we're against violence and genocide, we're also against the killing of trans people,

537
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:51,840
we're against the abandonment and injury of Indigenous people and the killing of Indigenous

538
00:51:51,840 --> 00:52:00,480
people. We actually are seeing that the same powers or an interlocking set of powers are

539
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:07,440
hurting a wide range of people in very similar ways, and we need to bond together. And that's

540
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,960
what an expansive coalition is. So if you ask me about a counter-imaginary, I want to say,

541
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,800
let's look at the expansive coalitions and see how they're operating, how they represent themselves,

542
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:26,880
how they persuade broader publics. And they went into churches, they went into factories,

543
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:38,080
they helped unionize the women janitors. They went into a wide number of communities where it

544
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:43,840
was not clear that they would be welcomed, both to listen and to also revise their analysis on

545
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:51,360
the basis of what they heard. Oh, great idea. And to make broader alliances, which is why they

546
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:58,560
could have a million people on the street just, I think, 10 days ago. So I think the counter-imaginary

547
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:04,080
is with us, but it has to do with being willing to be part of alliances where we don't love each

548
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:10,560
other. We don't want to have dinner together. We're not going to be reading the same books,

549
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,840
maybe some of the same books. That would be good if we could have a reading list for a potential

550
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:22,000
future alliance. You know, alliance is not love. Alliance can be really rough. But right now,

551
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:29,680
it seems to me, given how I do think that there are fascist passions being stoked, like

552
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,120
migrants are going to come take your job, the Great Replacement Theory, trans people are going

553
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,880
to come take your status as a woman away. Trans people are going to de-sex you. You're not going

554
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:47,280
to be able to be a male or a female anymore. They're going to destroy your family. They're going to

555
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:55,760
insert the devil into your children's curriculum rather than God's word.

556
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,800
You know, we actually need to get smarter about how this is working, because all those people

557
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:12,800
who are now afraid, oh, race, gender, ethnic studies, migrants, trans people, those fears

558
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:20,960
help support increasingly authoritarian regimes that promise order, authority, a return to a

559
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:27,520
time past when everything was ordered and you knew who you were and what your life was and your

560
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,800
livelihood was secured. Now, when I say your livelihood was secured, we see

561
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,400
a lot of people are afraid that their livelihood is no longer secured. Most young people I know

562
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:49,040
don't believe their livelihood is secured. Neoliberalism has devastated so many people's

563
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:54,800
ways of living and ways of working, forced them from their homes and their jobs or made life

564
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:00,800
increasingly precarious. So people are made nervous. They're made nervous by climate change,

565
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:09,920
by war escalating as we speak. As a right-wing political operator, if you reach into that fear

566
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,440
and say, guess what? The reason you're so afraid, the reason you're so anxious, the reason that the

567
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:28,880
future is unclear, is gender or race or migration, you're able to reorganize and stoke those fears

568
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:37,200
and anxieties in a direction that moves against those minorities or against those populations

569
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:44,320
in favor of a really strong state and that promises you a reactionary and impossible dream of return.

570
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,400
So I think we have to get wise that this is happening. And for my friends on the left,

571
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:58,320
I would also say I would not dismiss gender as some distraction or problem or mere identity

572
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,920
politics that's getting in the way of a broader left coalition. No, no, there is no broader left

573
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,920
coalition without having this at its center because the attack on gender isn't an attack on

574
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:16,080
democracy. It's also an attack on education. So we should not be letting them assign us a

575
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,160
tertiary place in the hierarchy of oppression. I'm just not going to do that.

576
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,760
That's all we have time for. And I want to say thank you all for coming this morning and thank

577
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:40,800
you so much, Judith, for joining us. It's been a delight.
