1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Governments like the UK's but also elsewhere in the world are granting new oil and gas

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
exploration licenses willy-nilly.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,680
So of course the BP's and the Shell's having been talking quite a good game a few years

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,560
ago about transitioning and now are like, why did we bother with that?

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,440
Governments aren't serious about this at all.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:28,200
Over recent decades, the price of energy coming from wind or solar has collapsed.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,800
The same is also true by the way for energy storage with lithium batteries, that's why

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,400
increasingly we see things like electric vehicles because the economics of these things add

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
up.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,080
Now for the optimists out there, they say that these falls in price for renewable technologies

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,800
are brilliant, they're all we need and they are the panacea in terms of addressing the

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,080
climate crisis and yet at the very same time we have seen the percentage of energy coming

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,480
from non-fossil fuel sources remaining broadly the same.

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,240
So what explains this strange contradiction, falling prices and yet we're not decarbonising

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,560
particularly quickly?

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,200
Today's guest has a pretty interesting hypothesis regarding all of that, he says we should not

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:25,240
be focusing on prices but profits and simply put renewable energy isn't that profitable.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,400
Welcome to Downstream.

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,440
Thanks for having me or thanks for having me back.

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,520
Well I'm glad you said that because I had a few colleagues in video, they were a bit

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,560
suspicious when I said we're going to talk to somebody about asset management, it's

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,920
going to do really well, everybody wants to hear about it and they just didn't believe

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,000
me but it ended up getting a quarter of a million views and counting.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,240
Amazing, amazing.

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
Great book.

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
Thank you.

27
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,480
Asset management is also just something that I think people are picking up on.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,040
They are, absolutely they are.

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,960
Yeah it's more and more in the news and it's not going to go away.

30
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Sadly.

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
No, exactly.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,520
But we're talking about a different book today.

33
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
We are but it's not unrelated.

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
It's not unrelated.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
That's good.

36
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,520
It's a very technical book, don't know if I'll put you off.

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,400
The price is wrong why capitalism won't save the planet.

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,760
I find it interesting because there's a bit of a distance between like I said very technical

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,000
book which is very good because you're really getting to the heart of really important arguments

40
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,280
as we will over the next hour as well.

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,120
But then that is like a very populist broad statement why capitalism won't save the planet.

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,160
We will get onto that in a moment because lots of people say it can but I want to start

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
with the basics.

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Yes.

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,720
Is net zero bullshit?

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Wow, what a question to start with.

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
I don't know.

48
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:52,240
I think that we are heading in our kind of muddled, convoluted, messy, insufficient way

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:03:00,120
in that direction globally albeit at very, very different rates in different places and

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:08,200
with varying degrees of likelihood of getting somewhere close to it eventually but we'll

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,320
get close to it if not there eventually.

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,840
Of course the question is what is net zero?

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,920
What is because net zero is not absolute zero it means you reduce carbon and other greenhouse

54
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:30,920
gas emissions but you do other stuff to compensate for that in various ways and I think the best

55
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,120
answer I have to that question is that to me the most interesting thing about net zero

56
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:46,920
is how we are consistently moving away from aspirations of real zero and so if you look

57
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
for example-

58
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,680
So real zero and net zero not the same?

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,360
No, because real zero is no emissions essentially.

60
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,880
Net zero is you still have emissions but you do other things like sucking carbon out of

61
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,160
the atmosphere or whatever else it might be to offset that and the thing is if you look

62
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:11,880
at the reports that get produced by the IPCC the international panel on climate change

63
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,720
over time the reports that they produce on kind of their kind of core scenarios of where

64
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,560
they think we are heading and kind of hopefully should be heading they have gradually gravitated

65
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:34,280
away from essentially real zero aspirations and so with each iteration they basically

66
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:41,520
say if we are going to get to whatever is plus two degrees or whatever it is 1.5, 2.5

67
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,640
15 years ago they were saying we will get there just by through wind and solar for example

68
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,320
just by mitigating emissions with each new iteration they said we will get there mainly

69
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,560
with solar and wind but also we will have a bit of carbon capture and storage.

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,760
Next iteration we will have a bit more carbon capture and storage so I think the really

71
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,880
important criticism is the criticism that comes from people like Kevin Anderson who

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,720
are very outspoken on this, the climate scientist who say we are increasingly banking on the

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,360
efficacy of technologies which do not yet exist at any significant scale rather than

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,000
banking on technologies which we have and we know that they work we are increasing the

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,240
degree of our bet on technologies that we do not yet have in any meaningful shape or

76
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,080
form at scale and affordability and so on and obviously the next step will be geoengineering

77
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,760
and as I understand it that is the kind of that as many viewers will know the work of

78
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,200
Andreas Maum and I think that is what his next book with Wim Carton is going to be

79
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,520
focusing on is how we are heading towards a position of where we are essentially at

80
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,000
default position is going to be relying on geoengineering to get us out of the hole we

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,880
are increasingly digging. So fossil fuel combustion stays with us, the emissions stay

82
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,520
with us but there is how Mary do other shit to help us out of the hole. And we are doing

83
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,200
that already to an extent in so much as not geoengineering but the carbon sequestration

84
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,440
does not need to be technology that is not already here because of course you have this

85
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,440
ridiculous phrase I think of quote unquote nature based solutions which is basically

86
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
planting trees.

87
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Essentially yeah.

88
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Often it is trees that are not actually designed for the habitats where you are planting them

89
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,560
there is not the kind of biodiverse you would associate with wild habitats, it is the kind

90
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,960
of trees you would plant for timber and what not, they are effectively ecological dead

91
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,960
zones.

92
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Exactly.

93
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,680
But you have had a load of money flood into this, people think they can make money off

94
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,160
of it so of course the good and the great are very enthusiastic about it.

95
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Love it.

96
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
They do love it.

97
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Yeah of course they do.

98
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
But you are not optimistic about nature based solutions?

99
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:54,120
Well I mean I think that the reality is that I am totally in agreement with the likes of

100
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,240
Kevin Anderson that just say you know minimize emissions, just focus on minimizing emissions.

101
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,640
You don't want the shit in the atmosphere, that is what you just don't want and anything

102
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:12,200
that provides you with the kind of cover to think that you can continue happily in that

103
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,920
merry way with emissions is not a good thing.

104
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,480
So yes we should be exploring those types of things and yes we should be exploring carbon

105
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:27,120
capture type technologies but we shouldn't be allowing that to serve as cover for not

106
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
doing the things that we should be doing.

107
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,800
And then there of course is the concern which kind of fits in with the Jevons paradox about

108
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,400
you know the more efficient you are at doing something the more you do it rather than the

109
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
less you do it.

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,200
So for instance Jevons notices this in the 19th century as an economist.

111
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,280
With regards to coal you know the more efficient steam engines became the more coal you use.

112
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Yep.

113
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,920
Now that is a point we can put a pin in and that is very relevant for energy.

114
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
It is.

115
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,560
But also with regards to carbon sequestration obviously if that becomes incredibly efficient

116
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,280
then people will say well you know we can burn this shit forever.

117
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
It doesn't matter.

118
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Yeah.

119
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,200
And you know and people living in people living here in the UK lovely we can just carry on

120
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,600
flying going out and fantastic we'll offset that and we can do it and we can bomb our

121
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,160
conscience and we don't have to worry about it.

122
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
So what's wrong with that?

123
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,480
Because I mean that will sound very appealing.

124
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,320
Oh nothing can change but we can bring down CO2 levels of CO2 in the atmosphere what's

125
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
wrong with that?

126
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:29,960
Well my understanding is that simply those technologies are very very limited in their

127
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,480
capacity to do what we hope they can do at scale and in an affordable way.

128
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:44,320
And so we are and when I say we I mean including here the IPCC forecast that I refer to we

129
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,600
are trusting that they are going to be able to do much more for us than we know that they

130
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
can do.

131
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,880
Essentially we are we're betting on something being able to happen and we have no proof

132
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,000
of the fact that it will be able to whereas we do have technologies that we know work

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,140
but we're just not doing enough of them and things like wind and so will be the classic

134
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,640
examples of that.

135
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,320
I suppose there's also the argument that you know nature is a good in itself and if you

136
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,920
look at things like biodiversity and the destruction of wild habitats to go you mentioned

137
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,320
Andres Malm you know his his perspective on COVID is amazing which is that actually this

138
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,160
is an outgrowth of our change relationship to the other species.

139
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,400
Yeah a great book that one.

140
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Great book.

141
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Yeah.

142
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
What's it?

143
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
War Communism and the Corona.

144
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Yeah.

145
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
What was it?

146
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,080
Coronavirus, climate emergence or something like that.

147
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
It's a good book.

148
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,960
Which is to say that you know look all the pathogens that we presume as being here you know in perpetuity

149
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,280
you're actually not they're all quite recent humans are 300,000 years old we've had agriculture

150
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,920
for 12,000 years and it's in that phase that we've had all of these pathogens that we think

151
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,920
has never brought measles you know that's that's all stuff that's a result of species

152
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
crossover and.

153
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Exactly.

154
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,840
Andres his point is that the more we destroy the natural world the more of these pathogens

155
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,320
are going to spill over into humans.

156
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,120
So there's a sort of holistic approach that I think underpins all that stuff anyway.

157
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,040
So let's just let's say that's right and let's say that like you say the technologies are

158
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,960
hail marrying it's a bad bet.

159
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,880
You would say let's electrify as much as possible now and let's get that from renewable energy.

160
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,760
So why is electrification so critical here?

161
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,400
Why do we want to electrify as much as we can?

162
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Yeah.

163
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:35,240
So that's the way you put it I think I think I would phrase it differently.

164
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:47,320
I would say that the electrification is is is a if not the principal strategy that the

165
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,760
world currently has for climate mitigation to the extent that it's not relying on those

166
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
other things.

167
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,800
So to the extent that that we are attempting to mitigate existing emissions electrification

168
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,400
is at the heart of it and and it's really important to understand why electrification

169
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,760
and why electricity are so and why electricity are so important.

170
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,320
So if we step back a set because I think this is really useful for people to understand

171
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,480
and some of this is going to be really obvious to people but they'll some of it won't be

172
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,800
obvious at least not to everyone.

173
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,280
So if we think about just greenhouse gas emissions in general think about that.

174
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,360
The totality of greenhouse gas emissions about 75% of that is carbon dioxide.

175
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,280
If you then focus just on carbon dioxide about 75% of that again of that 75% is from the

176
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,920
combustion of fossil fuels so oil natural gas and coal.

177
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,160
And so as everyone knows the combustion of fossil fuels that's why that we talk about

178
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,040
that because it's the heart of the problem of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions

179
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,440
focus in on that 75% of 75% and the biggest part of it is the electricity sector.

180
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,360
So electricity generation is the biggest source of emissions from the burning of fossil fuels

181
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,800
principally natural gas and coal.

182
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,280
So that's why decarbonizing the power sector is so important.

183
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:12,080
That's why everyone talks about solar and wind and nuclear which we can talk about because

184
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,000
that's how you decarbonize the power sector is really important.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,080
However it's because of what you refer to as electrification the electricity sector

186
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,880
is actually even more important than that and because the way the world is principally

187
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,360
approaching this is to say look we have those electricity sector emissions.

188
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,760
We also have emissions from things like transportation and industrial processes and things like that.

189
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,320
How are we going to decarbonize them?

190
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,760
And the way that we are typically thinking about doing that is to say so take vehicle

191
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,280
transportation as an example so cars and trucks which run on which historically run on internal

192
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,600
combustion engines by burning gasoline.

193
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,960
So in theory you could do two different things.

194
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:04,200
You could either switch to a different non-carboniferous fuel like a biofuel of something, ethanol

195
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:11,680
something like that or you switch to a motor which is basically a charged battery and charge

196
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,440
it through electricity and that's kind of what we're doing and it's the same thing with

197
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,820
industrial processes and buildings as much as possible.

198
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,420
The strategy is basically run as much as we can off electricity and then generate that

199
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,900
electricity through low carbon or zero carbon sources.

200
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,740
So that makes the electricity sector even more important to the climate problem than

201
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,780
it already is because it's going to get much bigger because we're electrifying everything

202
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:49,260
so electricity consumption is going to go to much higher levels than we currently have

203
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,140
which makes it doubly important that we decarbonize it.

204
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,260
So electricity really is the kind of the heart of the problem because if we don't decarbonize

205
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,020
it we're in even more trouble than we already are.

206
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:09,900
And I think the point here that I would make is that we're not doing anything, people will

207
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,700
look at charts for renewable energy growth worldwide and they'll think this looks awesome.

208
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:22,780
The charts are sharply upwards both in terms of the amount of new renewables capacity that's

209
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:29,660
being installed and the amount of electricity that we are generating from renewable sources.

210
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:37,900
However, the problem is that because overall electricity consumption is going up so sharply

211
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,020
that renewables growth is not proving enough.

212
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,940
So fossil fuel electricity generation is also still growing every year.

213
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,340
What I've been saying for a number of years now it's going to peak this year, it's going

214
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,260
to peak this year but it still hasn't peaked, it's still going up.

215
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:56,460
So our emissions from electricity generation are still going up despite the fact that we're

216
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,820
two or three decades into the so-called renewables revolution.

217
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,540
So that's kind of a snapshot of why electricity is so important I think.

218
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,300
I'm going to interrupt this interview with Brett Christopher's for just one moment.

219
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,020
I do hope you're enjoying it.

220
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,700
As you may know right now we are in the middle of a general election here in the UK.

221
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,460
That will happen on July 4th but of course there is a campaign before then.

222
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,180
My view is that Navarro Media is without peer when it comes to covering that election,

223
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,580
the policies, the personalities, the politics.

224
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,540
We have no equivalent in my view.

225
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,260
That is from our daily coverage on Navarro Live, that's weekdays, it's 6pm, it's our

226
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:46,100
articles, our podcasts, our social first content, our news and comment, it's all there and

227
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,980
my goodness for this general election we're really ramping things up.

228
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:56,580
Imagine if you will a Lamborghini Contash, the light is red, Ash Sarkar is at the wheel,

229
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,420
she's got her foot to the pedal, really getting it going and that's what we need to do.

230
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,380
We need our supporters to help us get our acceleration right up, come right out of the

231
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:11,020
blocks because as we've said since this project first started, you cannot have a different

232
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,660
kind of politics without a different kind of media, new media for a different politics.

233
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,940
Now that won't arrive on July 5th but we certainly think we're moving the dial left on a tonne

234
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,900
of issues and in elections that is especially true.

235
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,940
If you want to be a part of that, you know what to do.

236
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,380
Go to navarromedia.com forward slash support, the link is in the description below.

237
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:40,060
This is a momentous set of elections and I think it's a huge opportunity to shift the

238
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,460
political conversation in this country into a much better direction.

239
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460
Be a part of it.

240
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,020
Go to navarromedia.com forward slash support.

241
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:55,980
You've got a statistic in the book which basically says, you know, global consumption of fossil

242
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,820
fuels for electricity is actually quite stagnant over the last 10 years, primarily because

243
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,340
of India, China and obviously demand going up and obviously, and it's something we don't

244
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,340
talk about enough, is Africa.

245
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,220
You know, Africa's population is set to double between 9 and 2050.

246
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,220
That's going to have extraordinary consequences to the rest of the world, particularly because

247
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,460
the rest of the world is getting older and looking at population decline.

248
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,020
It's going to change our fundamental notion of humanity and the global community in really

249
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,380
powerful ways but in terms of energy, obviously you're going to have more people in sub-Saharan

250
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,500
Africa and more people consuming more energy than they're presently do.

251
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:41,420
So we could be looking at maybe a doubling, or maybe just under, of energy globally between

252
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,900
now and say the mid 2050s, 2060.

253
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
Yeah.

254
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,420
I think the International Energy Agency, if I recall correctly, is somewhere between

255
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,100
two to three times where we are at at 2020 globally.

256
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Yeah.

257
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
I mean, two times is the optimistic.

258
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Yeah.

259
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Exactly.

260
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Let's try and be optimistic.

261
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
There's not much to be optimistic about.

262
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,860
And in that context, basically, I presume you would say, well, look the next two decades,

263
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,140
it's going to look like the last two decades, which is we'll decarbonise a ton of stuff

264
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,620
that will still be burning more fossil fuels.

265
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
Yeah.

266
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,220
I think that's, if I had to guess, that that would be where we're going.

267
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,940
And we can talk more about this because I think it's really, really important.

268
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:23,500
And the reason I'm, one of the main reasons I'm relatively pessimistic about this is that

269
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,460
it is simply stated, but it's quite complex to get one's head around.

270
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,380
And it's this, which is that the parts of the world, which is essentially the parts

271
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,980
of the world you've just been talking about, the parts of the world where the challenge

272
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:45,220
of decarbonising the electricity sector is economically greatest, are precisely the parts

273
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:52,500
of the world where it's most urgent, that decarbonisation proceeds rapidly.

274
00:18:53,500 --> 00:19:00,620
Which is to say that it's those parts of the world where investment will have a disproportionately

275
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,620
important effect.

276
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,740
So, and what I mean by that, and it's important to spell this out, is that the reality is that

277
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:13,060
kind of what happens in Europe and North America is obviously important, but in terms of future

278
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:19,380
global greenhouse gas emissions trajectories, it's way more important what happens in China

279
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,260
and India and Africa and Vietnam than what happens here.

280
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,460
And that's for two reasons.

281
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,060
One of which you said is because that's where energy demand growth is concentrated.

282
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:36,060
So if you've got energy demand growing, then obviously if you're still fossil fuel intensive,

283
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,500
that's much more damaging than if your fossil fuel intensive in energy demand is not growing.

284
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,420
So that's one thing.

285
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,220
And then the other thing is that for very understandable reasons, it tends to be in those

286
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,100
parts of the world that the electricity sectors are still most fossil fuels intensive.

287
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:58,140
So here are some figures that just put a complexion on this that I think is important.

288
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,780
So I live in Sweden, it's almost fully decarbonised, it's power sector.

289
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:07,220
Something like 90% of electricity now is generated from non-carbon sources.

290
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,660
I think it's like roughly 30, 30, 30 nuclear wind hydro, about 10% is natural gas.

291
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,100
So Sweden's almost there on the power sector, at least.

292
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,420
UK, Germany, US, quite a way behind that.

293
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,820
Germany's pretty awful, lots of coal burning still.

294
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,140
US, lots of coal and natural gas.

295
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,340
UK, lots of natural gas.

296
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,700
Scotland very good though.

297
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,340
Yeah, we'll talk about Scotland because it's a big part of the story.

298
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,780
So they're a way behind, but they're still a long way ahead of other parts of the world.

299
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,900
China, 65% of electricity generation is coal.

300
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:49,340
India, 75%, South Africa, 90%, other countries 95% to 98%.

301
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:55,980
And so it's most urgent that investment in decarbonisation happens there.

302
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,940
A, because their fossil fuel intent, very fossil fuel intensive.

303
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,700
B, that's where energy demand growth is going to be concentrated.

304
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,700
But that's where the challenge is greatest economically for reasons that we can talk about.

305
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,140
And that's the real problem as I see it.

306
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,780
So let's take an, again, an optimistic slant on this.

307
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,340
Firstly, on China, I mean, China, again, we've got some great statistics.

308
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,180
I'm sure you can bring it off the top of your head.

309
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:23,460
For most of the last six, seven years, about 50% of sort of additional solar capacity

310
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,580
being added worldwide is in China.

311
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,980
It's a similar story with wind.

312
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,300
Yep.

313
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,060
It's blowing the United States out of the water.

314
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,340
100%.

315
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,220
Blowing the EU as well, but not quite as much.

316
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,660
I mean, it's making it, you know, the US is a clown show compared to China.

317
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:44,340
But obviously you have increasing demand, CO2 emissions per person still going up.

318
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:51,660
But the optimistic story is this, CO2 emissions per person in China may reach a peak.

319
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,620
Well, the plan was for 2030, but it's looking actually like the next couple of years,

320
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,100
potentially, according to Xi.

321
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,460
So that's one positive thing.

322
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,140
Absolutely.

323
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,020
Secondly, and this is probably where you're going to say that's completely wrong,

324
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,700
there's this optimistic account of Africa, which is like,

325
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,140
well, they didn't have landline connections, but they just, they skipped that bit

326
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,020
and they did the mobile telephony and they're going to do the same with energy.

327
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,460
They're going to skip, you know, national grids with fossil fuels.

328
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,540
They're going to go straight to distributed solar.

329
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,900
And on the one hand, that sounds absurd.

330
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,620
But on the other hand, actually within the tropics,

331
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,540
you do have an extraordinary amount of exposure to solar energy.

332
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,100
Absolutely.

333
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,260
It's a brilliant place to have it.

334
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,340
So what's wrong with that account?

335
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,660
An optimistic account of actually things are far better than the picture you're painting.

336
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,060
Yeah.

337
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:46,620
I mean, I think that both of those parts of the story have a strong degree of truth, actually.

338
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:54,100
I think that China is a, you know, China's hugely paradoxical and for all sorts of different reasons.

339
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:01,580
And right now, it's obviously the good news story on renewables,

340
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,660
but it's also the bad news story on kind of new coal-fired plants as well,

341
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,620
which is simply due to the fact, simply is probably the wrong word,

342
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:14,060
but it's due to the fact that energy demand is growing still so strongly there,

343
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,020
both from, you know, residential, commercial, industrial and so on.

344
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,740
And so renewables in and of themselves are not proving sufficient for that,

345
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:29,380
which is partly just a scale issue, but it's also partly about the different nature of the energy source.

346
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,140
But China's important to talk about.

347
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:39,580
And what I think is important is to understand the political economy of how it's doing things very differently to how we're doing it in the West.

348
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,220
There's some commonalities, but there's some big important differences as well.

349
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,500
I think on Africa, I think that is the big hope, actually.

350
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:57,900
And, you know, I see conflicting accounts about how credible that story is about

351
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:06,220
the extent to which it will be possible to build out a clean energy future there

352
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,580
that does kind of leapfrog the kind of historical problems that we've,

353
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:15,300
that are kind of almost a sunk cost here in the West,

354
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:21,060
where we have a very kind of centralized grid-based energy system,

355
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:26,380
which locks us into a certain kind of future that may not be necessary in Africa, as you say.

356
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,380
If it moves towards more distributed energy resources, then maybe it's possible to do that.

357
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:38,740
I mean, I think there are reasons to think both positively and negatively about that story.

358
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:44,740
I think right now it's too early to tell which direction it's going.

359
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:52,540
But possibly that's true, and I think that will be very, very important.

360
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:58,140
And let's not forget that, you know, just, I mean, I think there's a connection between those two stories, right, that we just talked about.

361
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:05,820
So if you look at what China did in 2023, when it was, you know, set all kinds of records for new renewable installation,

362
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,940
something like 30% of that renewable installation in China was rooftop solar.

363
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:17,620
So it wasn't commercial, large-scale, industrial power plants, wind and solar farms.

364
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,500
It was rooftop domestic solar, 30%.

365
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,340
Huge. All sorts of state subsidy necessary for that, but that's fine.

366
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,980
So part of the China story is precisely that distributed energy story,

367
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,820
which one would hope would be replicated in Africa as well.

368
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,100
And Vietnam as well, right?

369
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,780
Again, it's one of these stories in Europe and the West we don't really hear.

370
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,660
Like, there is a heroic effort going into solar right now in Vietnam.

371
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,100
There is.

372
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,820
And it's not on our radar, and we think in Europe we're doing everything.

373
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,580
You know, we've got, you go in Germany or Italy, you might see some solar cells.

374
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,140
Great.

375
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,580
But in Vietnam, they're doing what those countries did in 20 years.

376
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,260
They're doing it in three or four years.

377
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,180
Yeah, absolutely.

378
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,500
And obviously, I mean, to take, I mean, China is the best example of this.

379
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:12,460
But the reason that China can and is doing things at a much more rapid clip

380
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,580
and on a much, much greater scale than is happening in the West

381
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,140
is simply because it's essentially a state project, right?

382
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:28,420
I mean, to take wind, something like 95% of the wind deployment sector,

383
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,260
by which I mean the entities that are involved, not on the manufacturing side,

384
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,620
building the turbines and building the cells and modules,

385
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,900
although it's not hugely dissimilar there, but on the deployment side,

386
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,860
by which I mean developing the wind and solar farms,

387
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,140
owning and operating them and selling the electricity that they generate,

388
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,460
something like 95% of that is state-owned enterprises.

389
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,820
They are being financed by state-owned banks

390
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:00,460
who are themselves having their debts subsidized by the state-owned central bank.

391
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:05,060
And all of these entities are, at least if my understanding of this is correct,

392
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,820
and it's a second-hand understanding based on kind of the work of China experts,

393
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,260
you know, heck of a lot more about it than I do,

394
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,260
all of these entities are only, what's the best word to you,

395
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,180
modestly being driven by profit motives of one kind or another.

396
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:28,300
They are, to one degree or another, working at the behest of provincial

397
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,620
and or central government in China.

398
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,100
They are being directed very substantially in terms of what they're doing now.

399
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,100
And if you have the willpower and if you have the resources

400
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,100
and you have the determination and the political intent

401
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,140
to do that sort of thing on a huge scale and quickly,

402
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,860
well, you can do that.

403
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,940
But in the West, where we are essentially relying on the private sector to do this

404
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,620
and we are relying on the kind of quote-unquote

405
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,540
coordinating mechanisms of markets to do this,

406
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,460
it's an entirely different project.

407
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:09,300
You're expecting, you know, the independent decisions of thousands of different entities

408
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,740
to kind of add up to this very complicated thing that we call a transition.

409
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,420
And not surprisingly, it's not really happening in the same way

410
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,380
that it is where you have a top-down approach to this

411
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:25,860
that can be very, very coordinated and very, very joined up

412
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,180
because you have one entity that is overseeing all of it.

413
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,860
I mean, we had this debate recently on the Var Alive, Michael and I,

414
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,500
and he was saying China is a capitalist society.

415
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,260
And I said, it's not a capitalist society.

416
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,660
It's a market society.

417
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,780
But there's a huge difference in that in a capitalist society.

418
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,540
I mean, I totally agree.

419
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,340
And even then, is it a market society?

420
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,460
I mean, even this is the debate.

421
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,580
I mean, if you look at what's going on in the energy sector,

422
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,860
I would be quite reticent to call the mechanisms

423
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:58,100
whereby and the context within which electricity is bought and sold,

424
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,580
markets in anything like the shape of which we're used to.

425
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,260
The firms that are building, you know, the firms that are making the PV cells,

426
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,460
which would take over the world if we weren't imposing tariffs on them.

427
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,180
That is all being done by private actors in competition.

428
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,740
And I think this is something that Michael and I really discredent.

429
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,060
And I said, it's a market society.

430
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,420
But the point is, it's not capitalist because Eric E. Lee,

431
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,180
who's a political scientist, Chinese political scientist,

432
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,580
he said, we're not a capitalist society because, yes, we have markets,

433
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,020
but capital does not determine how our society allocates resources.

434
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,700
The interests of capital are not so enormous

435
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,620
with the interests of the ruling class.

436
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,820
Our ruling class has national political priorities, which sometimes...

437
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,820
100%.

438
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,260
Which is odds with capital.

439
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,620
And I think for people in the West, that's a really hard thing to engage with.

440
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,620
It is.

441
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,900
You have markets, but you don't allow capital to determine political priorities.

442
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,740
So I was on a panel recently and there was a sociologist,

443
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,460
a Chinese sociologist who works in the US called Karl Chan,

444
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,740
who's been doing a lot of really interesting research

445
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,860
about Chinese state-owned enterprises.

446
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,220
And I think the concept he uses to try to capture what it is they do,

447
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,340
I think he calls it managed competition.

448
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,180
What's the chap's name?

449
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,340
Kyle Chan, C-H-A-N.

450
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:08,260
And it's a really evocative and useful way of thinking about this,

451
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,740
that it's just not competition in the way we think about it.

452
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,380
It's a managed process towards a particular end

453
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,460
to which competition is being mobilized in some way,

454
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,500
but only in a very limited capacity to make sure that these things are happening.

455
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,980
It was quite interesting hearing basically Chinese automotive manufacturers,

456
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,220
they were being asked, are you gunning for the US?

457
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,140
Are you gunning for Tesla?

458
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,260
And they're like, we have enough problems with our own people back home,

459
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,660
like BYD are terrified of the next four or five companies beneath them.

460
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,260
And of course, if you look at that from a sort of classical,

461
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,700
a neoclassical sort of political economy perspective,

462
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,660
you'd be like, well, those are exactly the sorts of incentives

463
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,860
which are meant to be driving firms and industrialists.

464
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,780
And it's so strange that China and its firms are talking in that language.

465
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,500
And yet, the US is talking in a very protectionist language,

466
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,100
he's talking about national champions.

467
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,900
China is not talking about national champions.

468
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,620
No, no, no, no, no.

469
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,860
No, because they've already, they're already the champions.

470
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,620
They're the international champions.

471
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,660
Yeah, this is another one, this is a bit of an aside,

472
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,860
but again, you're going to be a lot more familiar with the reality of this

473
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,540
because you do all these academic panels and whatnot.

474
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,380
But we have a friend here at Navarro who sometimes works with us

475
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,660
on sort of helping us out, kind of like a consultant guy.

476
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,660
And they were recently in, I think, Vietnam.

477
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,140
And they kept on seeing all these brands they just never heard of.

478
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,740
And then they were like, what's that? Google that, Google that, Google that.

479
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,060
And then they said, look, after a while, I realized that like the world's number one,

480
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:41,220
two, three producer for dozens of, you know, commodities, which I've granted,

481
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,940
they're all East Asian, right?

482
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,860
You know, they're Chinese or if they're not Chinese,

483
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,940
they'll be Japanese or Taiwanese or and I was like, yeah.

484
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,180
We do live in a little closeted world in some respects.

485
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,900
But I think Europeans don't realize.

486
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,860
No, of course they don't. No, absolutely not.

487
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,100
Very stretch.

488
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,420
So you're optimistic, but also in a way pessimistic about China.

489
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,260
I suppose one good way of looking at China is

490
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,660
we would be really screwed if they weren't doing all the things.

491
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,300
They would be. I mean, the way, I mean, not least in terms of, I mean,

492
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,260
there's for one thing, there's the fact that they are making progress

493
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,580
domestically on renewables, right?

494
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,380
Fantastic.

495
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,460
But there's also the fact that let's not forget that it's unimaginable

496
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,820
that in places like Europe, that to the extent that it's happened so far,

497
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,180
that the energy transition, the decarbonization of power sector

498
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:33,540
would have gone as far, as fast and at such a low, relatively low cost as it has.

499
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:38,020
Were it not from the fact that it's China that drove down the cost of the technologies, right?

500
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,340
I mean, there's no, there's no way it would have gone as far as fast or at such low cost

501
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,100
without China doing what it's done.

502
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:49,780
We've, we collectively have been benefiting environmentally and economically

503
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,180
from what China's been doing for the last 15 to 20 years.

504
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,540
That is such a good point.

505
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,100
So people are saying, and we'll talk about obviously that the fallen price for renewables,

506
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,500
how it's competitive with fossil fuels, and a big part of that,

507
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,460
that disinflationary pressure is the fact that stuff is being manufactured in China.

508
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,860
Almost all about China.

509
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,180
And that's very rarely in the conversation.

510
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,100
No, no, no, no.

511
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,060
Because we talk about energy security, but we can have, we can have our cake and eat it.

512
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,220
It can be cheap and it can be energy secure.

513
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:12,940
Hold on a second.

514
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,180
It's cheap because it's not made here.

515
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,940
It's actually made outside of the planet.

516
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,740
Yeah, absolutely.

517
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,500
And obviously what's going on in the U.S. right now, and again,

518
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,780
there's a bit of a tangent, but it's important, is that the Biden administration

519
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:39,060
is trying to thread the needle between not wanting to entirely give up those economic gains

520
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,980
that have been delivered and continued to be delivered by China.

521
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,460
While at the same time benefiting domestic industry.

522
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,900
So they're trying to play this delicate game where they're like saying to the renewable energy developers,

523
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:54,580
look, if you, if you source your technology locally, rather than from China,

524
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:02,180
from local manufacturers, you get an extra 10% credit on your, on your renewables development.

525
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,260
And, but I, you know, based on the conversations I've had with people in the U.S.,

526
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,980
it's still entirely unclear whether that incremental benefit is proving sufficient

527
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,580
to persuade them to source locally or whether it still makes economic sense for them to source from China.

528
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,500
Yeah, they don't know yet.

529
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,620
Well, because you have these recent tariffs announced by Biden, right?

530
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,780
Yeah, that was, that was a lot.

531
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,500
They've changed it.

532
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,300
They've introduced some new tariffs last week.

533
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,540
So 100% on automotive, you know, so electric vehicles will have 100% tariffs.

534
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:32,380
So if I'm buying a BYD car and it's $30,000 in China, I'm going to have to pay $30,000 tariff on it.

535
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,580
Yep, exactly.

536
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,500
And I still think that car might be competitive.

537
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,460
Yeah, it could well be.

538
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,340
Which is the terrifying thing for the U.S. car industry.

539
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,420
Yeah, no, absolutely.

540
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:45,540
Yeah, so they're, they're playing a very challenging game over there, which, which, which, I mean, I understand that game politically.

541
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,940
I mean, it makes, it makes it's easy to understand where they're coming from.

542
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,580
Politically, yes.

543
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,860
But then you can't say climate change...

544
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,780
Oh, not necessarily economically, environmentally, no.

545
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,420
You can't say climate change is existential, but then put 50% tariffs on PV cells.

546
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:58,860
No.

547
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,180
Well, you don't believe that then, do you?

548
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:09,380
But then, but then the whole, I mean, let's be honest about this, but the whole, the whole climate policy,

549
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:21,020
thing in the U.S. perspective is entirely contradictory, by which I mean, you know, I think the Inflation Reduction Act is actually pretty good policy for the, for the most part.

550
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:32,100
And I think that given the, given the political conditions under which Biden has been operating, it was probably about as good as, as he could have got through at the time.

551
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,980
And yet, you know, one day Biden will be extolling the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act.

552
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:57,380
And yet the very next day, he'll be like calling out OPEC for introducing new production quotas to dampen oil and gas production, because Biden is concerned that that, that constraint in global oil and gas supply will have, you know, will put the price of gasoline up 3 cents.

553
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,700
And it means that he won't, he won't get voted into power.

554
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,660
So he's telling OPEC to open the pumps.

555
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,740
So it's just like, it's the most contradictory thing imaginable.

556
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:17,980
And, and, and that's the thing I think we have to grapple with, is that the whole kind of U.S. political, economic, ecological complex is fundamentally driven with contradiction.

557
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,340
And you compare that to Europe, which for the most part has proportional representation.

558
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,140
At least you can build in a consensus around a certain policy direction.

559
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,060
That's true.

560
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,020
Whereas in the U.S., you have like, I mean, it's crazy, you have Biden saying, I'm a green champion.

561
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:37,580
And then, and then, but then, and it's, and you understand why they'll be saying, look, if inflation is 5% in November, we're out, we're gone.

562
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,220
100%.

563
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:38,620
Right.

564
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,380
And they know that.

565
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,660
And so you have these wildly diverging policies, messages.

566
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:50,820
And we, we in the West, but especially in America, live very carbon intensive lifestyles.

567
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,900
And so inflation is, is a carboniferous phenomenon in the U.S.

568
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,620
more than anywhere else.

569
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,460
And it's really important to remember that.

570
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,540
So the inflation discussion is a significant part of carbon discussion in the U.S.

571
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,500
And it's very, very important to remember that politically as well as economically.

572
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:15,260
Going back to Europe, you mentioned the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA Act, IRA Act.

573
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,500
I can't say that without, yeah, having memories of growing up in Croydon in the 1970s.

574
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:30,860
And, you know, Biden's, Biden's famous Irish heritage, I do find it, I'm sure he probably finds it quite, you know, you know, interesting.

575
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,300
Yes.

576
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,860
You got the IRA Act, you got the CHIPS Act, that's not really related.

577
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:48,980
And at the same time as the IRA Act, which is this, you know, huge amount of money basically going into reshore lots of manufacturing in the UK, but also it's ostensibly about a decarbonisation agenda.

578
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,780
At the same time, you have, obviously, Russia, Ukraine.

579
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,460
And what you're seeing right now is that sort of amazing statistic in the FT recently.

580
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:00,620
I think it's like 45% of German manufacturing companies are looking at setting up shop in the U.S.

581
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:07,340
Because energy in Germany compared to the U.S. is six times more expensive, six times more.

582
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,300
Wow, I hadn't seen that statistic.

583
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,060
Yeah, industrial energy, I think it was five to six times more.

584
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,380
Wow.

585
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,420
But then on top of that, you have the IRA, you know, subsidies or whatever, tax, you know, breaks and what not.

586
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,140
All of a sudden, you know, these industrial firms that have been in Germany for like 800 years thinking, am I going to Texas?

587
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,900
Germany really isn't heading in a good direction in any sense, in any shape or form right now, is it?

588
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,060
So, yeah, okay, so explain that.

589
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,780
So what, and where does U.S. policies fit on this?

590
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:41,900
So is that, is that, is that an intentional effort by the United States government to basically say, you know what, we're going to reindustrialise on the back of deindustrialisation in Germany?

591
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,140
Or is it not that deep?

592
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,780
Am I being too conspiratorial?

593
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:57,980
I'm not sure it's that deep, but certainly on the manufacturing side, U.S. policymakers have been, have been making an active effort to woo European companies, for sure.

594
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,940
And not just on the manufacturing side, but also on the renewable energy development side.

595
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:14,660
They've, you know, they've been trying to get the Iberdrohlers and the Orstedts and so on, much more interested in the U.S. as a place for investment in new, in new wind and solar power, as well as the manufacturing side of the business.

596
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,700
But I'm not sure it's, I'm not sure it's that deep.

597
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:28,740
But, you know, the EU, sorry, has been through, you know, a very difficult few years on the energy front in a way that the U.S. largely avoided.

598
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,660
And I think there are, there are still lingering effects from that.

599
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:41,860
And it's important to think about what's going on in Germany in relation to what happened in 2021 to 2022, which, which didn't really happen in the U.S.

600
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:58,500
The energy crisis was a, was a phenomenon that was, it wasn't limited to the EU, but to the extent that it was significant outside the EU, it was, it was significant more to the East, not least in China than it was in the U.S.

601
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:09,500
So the, the EU occupies this kind of strange sort of third provisional position in the kind of game between China and the U.S.

602
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:17,500
The EU is in this uncertain position where it seems to be neither one thing or the other.

603
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:27,500
It doesn't seem to be in a position to be calling any shots, but it's also not reacting as far as I can tell in the kind of deeply protectionist way that the U.S. has reacted.

604
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Yeah. So it's interesting.

605
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:39,500
There was a great quote a year or two ago, basically saying that the energy crisis of, you know, 2022-2023, was it 2022-2022?

606
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
21-22.

607
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
21-22.

608
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Yeah.

609
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,500
It's, you know, post-Covid, but also, you know, in relation to Germany in particular, post-Ukraine war.

610
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,500
And they said, look, the last several years have basically brought into focus that there are two kinds of countries.

611
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
Those with energy and those without.

612
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Yeah.

613
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,500
You know, go massive on nuclear renewables, coal.

614
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,500
The U.S. is where we have tons of energy anyway.

615
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,500
And Europe doesn't have any energy, but it's not adopted a sort of a strategy like you say.

616
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:15,500
No. I mean, Germany was the most extreme example of sort of essentially relying on Russia for energy.

617
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:24,500
And that was true to a lesser extent, but also not to an insignificant extent in other parts of Europe as well.

618
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:36,500
I mean, it just, I mean, it's, in that context, it is worth going back to China and the question of trying to understand its investment,

619
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:44,500
that kind of hybrid state capitalist investment that it's been undertaking in its renewables industry,

620
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,500
both the manufacturing side and the deployment side in the last couple of decades,

621
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,500
and to think, well, what kind of strategy is that?

622
00:41:51,500 --> 00:42:03,500
And it's kind of a three-fold strategy by which I mean it's been partly a strategy that is about environmentalism.

623
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:10,500
It's been partly a strategy which is an industrial strategy, trying to build global champions,

624
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,500
global leadership in a particular sector, but it's also been a strategy about energy security.

625
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:24,500
And by my understanding, it's the reverse order, actually, that the energy security was the kind of the main strategy

626
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:31,500
and arguably still is the main strategy, then industrial strategy, and that the environmental part of it, I mean, it's become more important.

627
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,500
20 years ago, it wasn't a significant part of the strategy.

628
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:40,500
But even today, my suspicion is it's still not the first of those three and maybe not even the second of those three.

629
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,500
And it's been about energy security.

630
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,500
And so what happened in Europe, I mean, it's a different slant on the same question,

631
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:53,500
but what happened in 2022 was there was a bit of a fillip in renewables investment in Europe.

632
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:59,500
And a lot of people were saying, oh, this is further evidence of the fact that renewables are forging ahead

633
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,500
because they're very, very cheap and they're economically competitive.

634
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,500
And no, that wasn't really what happened.

635
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
It was about energy security, right?

636
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:11,500
If you have renewable and solar power, you're not reliant on importing fuel from overseas.

637
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,500
You're not reliant on a rush or whoever else it might be.

638
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,500
So I think it was an energy security issue that was driving that investment.

639
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,500
What you just said is the crux of the book.

640
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
And we'll get to that in a moment about the price.

641
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,500
Yeah, we haven't really got to the book yet.

642
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,500
No, it's critical because it's not about prices.

643
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,500
We're getting to a point of price parity with regards to fossil fuels and renewables, but that's not the point.

644
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,500
But particularly on Europe.

645
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Yes.

646
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:43,500
I mean, that was the, you know, what we saw in 2022, 2023 was 101 think pieces about finally Europe is on the stage.

647
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Not only was it meant to remilitarize.

648
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,500
Okay, what's happening there?

649
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
It was meant to be rebuilding its domestic industry.

650
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
It's doing the opposite, actually.

651
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,500
It was also meant to be getting serious about renewals and nuclear energy.

652
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Yes.

653
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Not just upticks.

654
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,500
And there has been much progress made and there is progress is being made.

655
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,500
But it's not decarbonizing as quickly as we were told.

656
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,500
No.

657
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,500
Why is that?

658
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Russia?

659
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,500
Russia's gone.

660
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Yeah.

661
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,500
For the near future.

662
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:15,500
And Germany's industrial prowess is literally, well, not entirely based on, but it was significantly based on cheap Russian energy.

663
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:23,500
That's now gone, but there doesn't seem to be the political leadership in places like Germany to say, you know what, we now need to build a ton of wind, solar, nuclear.

664
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,500
And you've got a green-red coalition there.

665
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,500
You think, well, this should be the perfect set of circumstances for Germany to become a world leader in renewable energy.

666
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,500
Yeah.

667
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,500
So it's not happening.

668
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,500
No, it's not.

669
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Why?

670
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:58,500
So the narrative that you will typically hear about this, across the board actually politically and almost analytically as well, but certainly from both left and right, is that the problem is found in the realm of, for want of a better kind of label, politics and planning and bureaucracy.

671
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:12,500
You'll have seen a thousand think pieces saying, look, the problem is that there's all this money waiting to go into renewables, but it's being held up by, you know, obstructionist local planning authorities.

672
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,500
It's being held up by slow processes to get planning permission.

673
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,500
It's being held up by long queues to get grid connections.

674
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
It's being held up by nimbyism.

675
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,500
And you know what?

676
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,500
It is held up by all of those things.

677
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,500
Absolutely.

678
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:35,500
However, the other crucial part of that key of that main dominant narrative about this says what it's not being held up by is the economics.

679
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:46,500
The economics has been solved because the price of generating electricity from solar and wind has come down sharply historically.

680
00:45:47,500 --> 00:46:01,500
And it has, over time, to a point of where, as you said, it's as cheap or often in many places even cheaper to generate solar and wind power than it is by burning natural gas or coal.

681
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,500
So that's the key narrative is that it's all these other things.

682
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,500
It's not the economics.

683
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,500
My argument in the book is that, yes, it's all those other things, but it's also the economics.

684
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:29,500
And the argument there is that the thinking specifically on the question of generating price, which is what all those think pieces do, and they reproduce the same charts showing the same cost curves coming down over time, is the wrong prism through which to think about it.

685
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:37,500
And that we can understand much more about the industry and about why things are going too slowly if we focus on the question of profitability rather than price.

686
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,500
So that's the argument I made.

687
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,500
And so it's a complex, as you said, right at the outset.

688
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,500
There's a lot of detail in it.

689
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,500
It's quite wonky.

690
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,500
It's quite complex.

691
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:50,500
But the actual main argument is really straightforward, which is this.

692
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:57,500
It's like, in profitability terms, renewables deployment is actually quite a problematic proposition.

693
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,500
And I'll explain what I mean by that in a second.

694
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:09,500
And that's a problem because we're relying on the private sector and the private sector is driven above all else by profitability expectations.

695
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:17,500
If its expectations are on profitability are not adequate, it will not invest or it will not invest on the sufficient sale.

696
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:23,500
So my argument is like, you need to understand that, A, we are relying mainly on solar and wind.

697
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:31,500
So yes, there are countries in which there's much more of a role being given to nuclear and even in some countries, geothermal and hydro and so on.

698
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:37,500
But for the most part, the world is kind of betting the house on solar and wind to a significant extent.

699
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:45,500
And second, the world is banking on the private sector, not China, but elsewhere in the world, government policy is not to do it itself.

700
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,500
It's to say, we expect you, the private sector, to do it.

701
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:55,500
We will nudge you in the right direction through various incentives and subsidy mechanisms on where you're not doing it quickly enough.

702
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,500
We'll provide you that help, but we're not going to do it.

703
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
You're going to do it. We're expecting you to do it.

704
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:08,500
That's fine if the private sector consistently sees sufficient profitability in that proposition to do it quickly and at scale.

705
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,500
But it doesn't.

706
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,500
And you talk to people in the industry and they're like, no, of course not.

707
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,500
But policymakers are completely deaf to this.

708
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:22,500
And I think for all sorts of reasons, but partly because they've been persuaded by those simplistic arguments about falling prices.

709
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,500
And to them, it's like, well, surely if the prices have fallen, the profits must be there.

710
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,500
The profits must be going up.

711
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
But it's just not true.

712
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,500
It's a problematic industry in terms of profitability expectations.

713
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,500
And that's the kind of core of the book as to why that is.

714
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
And it is a bit of a wonky book.

715
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,500
We like wonky books.

716
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Oh, yeah.

717
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,500
Well, yeah, I hope so.

718
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,500
We love wonky books.

719
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
I mean, don't let that put you off.

720
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,500
I think particularly, look, for anybody who wants to know the subject well.

721
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,500
And the point is, like you say, the core proposition at the heart of the book is a very important one.

722
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,500
And, you know, it's like...

723
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,500
I think it's really important.

724
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,500
Yeah.

725
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,500
It's like the arrow that goes through, you know, Harold Goodwin's Anziah Hastings.

726
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,500
You know, it's...

727
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,500
That's it.

728
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,500
It's game over for that worldview of...

729
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Well, actually, private firms, the private sector with the profit motive can solve the climate crisis.

730
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,500
Exactly.

731
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,500
They can't.

732
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,500
It's not about costs.

733
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,500
It's about...

734
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,500
It's not about prices or other.

735
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,500
It's about profit.

736
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,500
Yeah.

737
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,500
And obviously, profitability is shaped by generating prices.

738
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,500
That's part of the equation, but it's not the totality.

739
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,500
That's the issue.

740
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,500
Yeah.

741
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:29,500
And I actually feel like there are some similarities here with the debates I've had recently with

742
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,500
people in regards to, you know, privatised utilities of things like mail, rail, water.

743
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,500
And they're arguing for, you know, the private sector should control these.

744
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:42,500
And I go, look, best-case scenario, best-case scenario, they're very low margin.

745
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,500
You want it to be very competitive.

746
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
They're very physically hard to administer.

747
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,500
They're not very exciting.

748
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,500
No.

749
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,500
Like, why do you want the private sector here?

750
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,500
And they're also very important.

751
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,500
Go...

752
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,500
100%.

753
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
Go make, like, shirts.

754
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,500
I mean, it's true, right?

755
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,500
No.

756
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,500
Or glasses or mobile phones or...

757
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,500
Come up with a coffee machine.

758
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,500
Exactly.

759
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,500
Or like a scalable social network where you can 10X your...

760
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Knock yourself out.

761
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,500
Do you see something different and better?

762
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Yeah.

763
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,500
Yes.

764
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,500
Water can't do that.

765
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,500
No.

766
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,500
And I feel like renewables are in a similar situation.

767
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,500
100%.

768
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,500
It's just a low margin thing.

769
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,500
It's just electrons.

770
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
Yeah.

771
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,500
Just leave it alone.

772
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,500
I know.

773
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
I know.

774
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,500
Yeah.

775
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,500
It's bizarre.

776
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,500
And the thing is, right...

777
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,500
I think the other thing to...

778
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:29,500
You know, one of the ways I think it's useful to think about this is that governments,

779
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,500
for very understandable reasons, going back to what we were talking about inflation, they

780
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,500
want electricity to be affordable.

781
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,500
They want to be cheap.

782
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Rightly so.

783
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:47,380
Well, in general, doing stuff at rock bottom prices to consumers isn't normally a recipe

784
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,500
for massive profitability.

785
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,100
I mean, I know that's a generalization, but it's worth keeping in mind.

786
00:50:53,100 --> 00:51:00,540
And so what's happened is that governments have designed electricity markets and they

787
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,540
have designed the support mechanisms that they provide to renewables operators precisely

788
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:13,900
in such a way as to maximize the likelihood that the economic gains associated with kind

789
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:19,460
of falling production costs thanks to China are not captured by nasty capitalist firms,

790
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,740
but they're passed on to consumers.

791
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:26,380
So what does that mean in terms of capitalist incentives to invest in those things?

792
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,780
Well, if they're not able to capture it, then of course they're not going to do it at the

793
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,940
scale we want because they're being passed on to consumers, which is what we want.

794
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:39,460
But I mean, there's politicians that don't stay honestly, and it's something I just,

795
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,300
my mind is blown every time I think about it, but it's particularly a problem on the

796
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,300
center left.

797
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,140
But a problem in the center is they genuinely seem to think that private enterprises do

798
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:48,660
things out of the goodness of their heart.

799
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,660
Yeah.

800
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,660
I mean, it's...

801
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,660
It's just wild.

802
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,140
They want to make lots of money and they want to make as much money as possible.

803
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,140
And here's the other thing, right?

804
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,140
As quickly as possible.

805
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,180
And the other point I would make before we get, before if we want to get into the meat

806
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:07,580
of it is this, which is that profitability, economic returns are always a relative phenomenon

807
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,860
rather than an absolute phenomenon.

808
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:15,580
And what I mean by that is that for any capitalist actor, there is always a kind of palette of

809
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,060
different investment opportunities available to them.

810
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:25,180
And so it's much more, so I give some figures in the book around kind of the average profitability

811
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:30,540
of renewables deployment, which of course varies across time and space, but most studies

812
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:34,140
point to somewhere in a region of kind of five to 8% returns.

813
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:38,380
Now, in isolation, that number doesn't really mean anything.

814
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,380
It only really means anything if you think about the alternative returns that are available

815
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,540
to the relevant actors from doing different things.

816
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:49,820
Now, and I want to just give two sort of comparators that I think are really valuable

817
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,060
to think about.

818
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:55,700
The first of those is this, which is to say that five to 8% look pretty good when interest

819
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,980
rates were zero.

820
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:03,820
But when interest rates are like 5%, and you can get five, six, even 7% returns from sticking

821
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:11,020
your money in the bank or investing it in US risk-free US government bonds, why on earth

822
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:19,180
would you go to the hassle of building a wind farm with the major risk that investment entails

823
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:23,700
when there are risk-free opportunities available to make essentially the same returns?

824
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,700
That's the first comparator.

825
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,020
Really important to think about.

826
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:31,380
And that's one of the reasons why the industry is really struggling right now is because

827
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:34,980
of the macroeconomic environment has changed fundamentally in the last couple of years

828
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,980
with the uptick in inflation and interest rates.

829
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,580
So that's the first comparison.

830
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:43,980
Second comparison is to focus on, you know, perhaps the key constituency that governments

831
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:51,460
in their wisdom, let me use that word advisedly, have been kind of assuming would take the

832
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,060
lead on the renewable transition, which is the big oil and gas companies.

833
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:00,100
So they've been hoping that the BP's and the Shells and the Exxons would kind of magically

834
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,860
transition away from oil and gas to offshore wind.

835
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:10,180
They know how things work offshore, they'll switch their rigs for offshore wind farms.

836
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:16,300
Well, over the last 10 years or so, those companies have not got out of bed for oil

837
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:20,620
and gas projects that deliver anything less than 15% returns.

838
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,380
That's what they expect and that's what they get.

839
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:28,060
And the idea that companies that are used to 15% plus returns in their core business

840
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:33,620
are somehow going to make the decision to switch to businesses with returns like a third

841
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,420
of that level is absurd.

842
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,500
It's economically madness to think that that's going to happen.

843
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,420
And here's the kicker, as long as they think that those above average returns are going

844
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,540
to continue to be available, right?

845
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:54,420
If they thought that those 15% returns are going to disappear because of, for example,

846
00:54:54,420 --> 00:55:00,100
meaningful government action on things like carbon taxes, then of course they would think

847
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,340
about alternative investment options.

848
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:07,660
But everything that's happened in the last five years or so has shown those companies

849
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:11,940
that governments are not serious about clamping down on their traditional business.

850
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,500
In fact, the opposite.

851
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,060
Governments like the UK's but also elsewhere in the world are granting new oil and gas

852
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,020
exploration licenses willy-nilly.

853
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:24,540
So of course the BP's and the Shells having been talking quite a good game a few years

854
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:28,420
ago about transitioning are now like, why did we bother with that?

855
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,300
Governments aren't serious about this at all.

856
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:34,460
They have no intention of stranding our oil and gas assets any time in the next 20 or

857
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,460
30 years.

858
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,220
So we're just going to carry on as we can because we know those returns are going to

859
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,220
continue to be available.

860
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:43,100
And it's not just why would they adopt a lower rate of return.

861
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,420
It's why would they spend a hell of a lot of money?

862
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:50,700
Why would they invest in a whole different cadre of employee?

863
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:55,220
Why would they dump a whole bunch of human capital value with regards to like engineering

864
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,260
know-how and whatnot, get rid of all that?

865
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,260
So we can earn less money.

866
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,260
Nobody's going to do that.

867
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,260
No, of course not.

868
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:05,460
Again, it goes back to some core ideological presumptions of our political class and our

869
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,980
media class, which is that businesses always write, markets always work, and they literally

870
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,820
cannot get their heads around businesses do things for profit.

871
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,820
It's not profitable.

872
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,820
It's not going to work.

873
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,180
And something that's, it's not there in the book.

874
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,780
It's kind of implicit or maybe it is, maybe I didn't see it.

875
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,780
It's something I thought about a lot.

876
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,780
It's in my book when I talk about for the automated luxury of communism, when I talk

877
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:29,180
about energy is that you have with wind, with solar, with storage, permanent price decline.

878
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,780
So you have deflation.

879
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,100
And again, if you want to make a profit, that's a real problem.

880
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,540
Permanently falling prices is a really bad thing.

881
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:40,540
If you want to make money, it's great for the consumer.

882
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,580
But again, there's this tension isn't really obvious to people who are making the policies.

883
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,580
No, no.

884
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,140
And you listen to, you listen to the, you know, the labor government in waiting talking

885
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,700
about this.

886
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,340
And they're, and it's a really strange thing.

887
00:56:54,340 --> 00:57:01,020
They're kind of like, well, we'll, we'll develop a new renewable energy generator, great British

888
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,260
energy.

889
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:08,100
And, and, and the whole idea behind it as, as they seem to be articulating it is like,

890
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,420
because the renewables business is swimming in profits.

891
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:14,660
And so we'll have this public entity that will capture those profits while delivering

892
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,660
really cheap energy.

893
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,780
And it's like, what are you talking about?

894
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,260
So it's not swimming in profits?

895
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,780
No, no, it's absolutely not.

896
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,820
And that's why the investment isn't happening.

897
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:28,500
And actually one thing, one thing that you, that you mentioned just now is, is, is one

898
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,740
of the important explanations for why that is.

899
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:33,540
And so let's, let's talk about that.

900
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:39,740
So you were, you were saying, look, the prices have been consistently coming down and, and

901
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:44,540
they have the, that, that chart, that chart I talked about in terms of the cost of generating

902
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,580
electricity from wind and solar shows consistent price declines.

903
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:52,860
And so you would think, so let's imagine you are a wind energy generator and you've been

904
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,220
in business for like 20 years.

905
00:57:55,220 --> 00:58:01,780
And as your, as your costs go down, you're generating costs go down over time.

906
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,700
Simple economics would say, well, my costs are going down the cost of genera, of actually

907
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,620
generating the power.

908
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:11,540
So my profits are going to be going up accordingly, fine, you know, lovely jubbly.

909
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:20,300
But that assumes that you have the capacity to capture and privatize those growing economic

910
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,300
efficiencies.

911
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:28,020
The reality of the, of the electricity sector is that you now in many, in many, if not most

912
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:32,820
parts of the world, but certainly in the UK, the electricity generation sector, which is

913
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:36,740
largely a self-standing sector, it's been cleaved off from transmission and distribution

914
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,060
and retail.

915
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:44,380
And in particular, the renewable energy generation sector is incredibly competitive.

916
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,540
There are thousands of entities in that market.

917
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:52,660
They compete purely on price, selling into really, really competitive wholesale markets.

918
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:59,340
So what happens when price, when, when costs decline, well, they compete those cost gains

919
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:05,260
away and those cost gains get passed downstream to transmission and distribution entities

920
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:10,780
and retailers and in large part all the way to consumers, precisely in the way governments

921
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,380
hope they do.

922
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:18,580
But if generators can't capture and privatize the upsides of those growing cost efficiencies,

923
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:22,180
why would they invest in their technologies in the first place?

924
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,820
Because they know that because of that competition, I mean, Mark's called it the coercive law

925
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,740
of competition, right?

926
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:33,140
They're coerced to engage in this activity, but competition forces them to pass those

927
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:35,100
things downstream.

928
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,500
And we have, you know, in the UK, many people will have heard of the subsidy scheme that

929
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:46,140
exists for, for wind, for offshore wind, in particular in the UK, which is the contracts

930
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,980
for different scheme.

931
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:52,180
And as I said earlier, you have this kind of, you have this intensification of competition

932
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,740
which is built into that system.

933
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:57,700
So it's worth just talking a little bit about how that happens.

934
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,100
So if the government says, okay, we're going to award these new offshore wind licenses

935
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:06,900
off for new renewables development, what happens is that different generating companies will,

936
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:11,660
there's an auction process where effectively what happened is they bid against each other

937
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:16,060
for this contract where the government will say, the government or a government backed

938
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:21,940
entity says, we will, we, we enter this contract to buy the electricity that you generate at

939
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:26,260
a fixed price, essentially a fixed price for the next 12 years or so.

940
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:31,820
And so one company will bid for, will bid and say, well, we'll bid, we'll, we'll enter

941
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:35,500
that contract with you at 50 pounds per megawatt hour for the next 12 years.

942
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,300
Another company will say 49, the next one will say 48.

943
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,620
And essentially what happens is they bid it down until it gets to the point where no one

944
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:45,420
can bid any lower because they won't make any money out of it.

945
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:50,500
So that's what I mean is that this price based competition is baked into the, is baked into

946
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:56,420
the process for good reasons on the consumer side, because that's what you want as a government

947
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:01,980
is keeping electricity prices down, but the profit, the potential profitability for generators

948
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:03,580
just gets, gets competed away.

949
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,220
I mean, what you're talking about there with regards to the auctions as well, I mean, it

950
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,860
applies to outsourcing companies too.

951
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:11,820
I mean, the reason why Carillion blasts from the past, you know, they collapse because

952
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:16,180
they kept on basically taking contracts, they couldn't make money because they were taking

953
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,180
all these jobs.

954
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,180
Everybody else was like,

955
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:21,340
I wouldn't touch them with a barge, but you're going to, you're going to bust if you carry

956
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:22,340
on like that.

957
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,340
And guess what happens?

958
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:26,380
They go bust and the, the people that are on the hook with a taxpayer and you don't have

959
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:31,380
to go bust for that to be a problem, whether it's Sodexo, Circa, Capita, whatever, G4S,

960
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:35,420
they get in these outsourced contracts with local councils and the price is so low.

961
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,660
They can only make money if they do an absolutely, guess what, shit job.

962
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:39,660
Exactly.

963
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:42,860
And if they destroy people's labor conditions, that's the only way they're going to make

964
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:43,860
money.

965
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,620
But you have the political class going, this is how we get value for money for the taxpayer.

966
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,500
No, it means they do a crap job.

967
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,500
People are laid off.

968
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,820
The firm might even go bankrupt and you socialise the risk anyway.

969
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:52,820
Yeah.

970
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:58,380
And in the renewable sector, again, you have to do something kind of clever to make profits

971
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:02,060
and so it becomes a question of like financial engineering, you know, what can you do with

972
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,660
on the debt side in terms of securitising it and that sort of thing.

973
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,940
And they kind of get forced into that because you can't make money just out of the, you

974
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,660
can't make good money out of the contract because the competition is so intense.

975
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,660
It was so interesting.

976
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,820
It was massively interesting.

977
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:19,300
Just how neoliberalism with regards to these low margin industries is just so stupid, so

978
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,260
destructive, so deeply destructive.

979
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:22,260
Yeah.

980
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,740
I mean, the other way I like to put it, that I like to put it is that, and it's like in

981
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,940
a one sentence is like, there's no OPEC in the electricity sector.

982
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:38,540
So I mean, OPEC in oil and gas exists in significant part to have price control, to keep prices

983
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:44,900
and profitability up, so if there's the danger of a kind of supply glut, they tell the members

984
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:50,420
of OPEC, you know, close the taps for a bit to keep prices and therefore profits up.

985
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:54,180
Well, there's nothing like that in the electricity sector.

986
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:59,660
Which is, again, kind of good from a consumer perspective, but in terms of incentivising

987
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:02,580
investment is a different question entirely.

988
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:07,380
The thing about, we were talking with regards to the falling costs of solar, I think it's

989
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,020
called Swanson's Law, isn't it?

990
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,020
Something like that.

991
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,020
Something like that, yeah.

992
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,420
And this is an all outgrowth of what's called the experience curve.

993
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,780
If you double the production of something, then the price of manufacturing falls by like

994
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,780
15.

995
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:20,300
Yeah, and solar has come down a huge amount, massive amount.

996
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:24,620
And so that trend is going to carry on, I mean, that's kind of inarguable, it might

997
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:26,140
slow down, but it's going to get cheaper.

998
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,740
I think it has slowed down a lot, but it should continue.

999
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,740
Yeah.

1000
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:33,140
And just for people watching, it's not the same as Moore's Law, which is, you know,

1001
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,140
exponential.

1002
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,940
We're not talking about exponential price falls, we're talking about, you know, dramatic

1003
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:43,420
falls, but not as dramatic as something like Moore's Law, you know, the halving or the

1004
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:47,740
halving of costs every 18 months or the doubling of processing speed per dollar every 18 months.

1005
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,740
No.

1006
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:54,900
So, we've talked about Europe, we've talked about the US, we've talked about the failure

1007
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,460
of markets to deliver with this stuff.

1008
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:01,620
So what is the proposal then?

1009
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:07,820
Because you've argued that competition makes sense from the perspective of the consumer,

1010
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:11,860
but then you've also said that competition and falling prices are at odds with profitability.

1011
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:15,820
And if we're having a private market system for this, then you need to have profits.

1012
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:19,140
So, how do we administer electricity or energy, which is cheap?

1013
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,140
Yeah, it's a great question.

1014
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:21,620
But from renewable sources too.

1015
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,540
Yeah, it's a great question.

1016
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:28,820
And I think that, you know, I'll be completely honest about this and say that I don't have

1017
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:29,820
the answer.

1018
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:37,140
I think I have a perspective on the range of answers that exists, if that makes sense.

1019
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:42,060
And so, I think what's useful potentially for viewers is to understand the kind of range

1020
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:48,780
of main answers that are out there and then to judge for themselves based on some commentary

1021
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,980
that I make on each of those answers.

1022
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:59,100
And so, there are essentially three main answers out there.

1023
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:07,420
But I'll caveat this or preface it by saying all of what I'm going to talk about here are

1024
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,660
answers that are kind of on the supply side, by which I mean, they're all answers that

1025
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:21,060
are oriented towards boosting investment in solar and wind capacity.

1026
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:28,060
On the assumption that you continue to need to do that because there are those existing

1027
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,860
profitability constraints.

1028
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:34,340
And of course, there are other answers out there, you know, people who are of a kind

1029
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:38,140
of degrowth persuasion would say, actually, we need to be thinking about the demand side

1030
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:41,580
as well and curbing energy consumption.

1031
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:46,220
And I think that there's a lot of truth in that argument as well.

1032
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:51,100
But I'm not going to go there today, but clearly any answer that is going to be even close

1033
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:55,260
to sufficient is going to have to address the supply side and the demand side.

1034
01:05:55,260 --> 01:06:02,140
Also, you know, the other argument will be, hang on a second, we historically globally,

1035
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:08,580
not just in the West, but globally, in order to try to make renewables more competitive,

1036
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:15,780
the way we have typically done that is by working on the renewable side, offering subsidy

1037
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:21,860
mechanisms, support mechanisms on, rather than taxing the dirty side.

1038
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,620
You know, that's essentially what we've done.

1039
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:26,580
We've thought, OK, we'll do that.

1040
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:30,500
And so economists, mainstream economists will say, well, actually, the answer is that,

1041
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:34,260
you know, the externalities associated with fossil fuels are not being properly priced.

1042
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:39,380
And so the answer is to price those externalities properly.

1043
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:44,060
And again, I think that I understand that argument, but obviously that's a politically

1044
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:47,580
very difficult argument because we live such carbon intensive lifestyle.

1045
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:54,340
So if you start taxing that, it really hurts consumers in terms of inflation.

1046
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:59,340
And I think that's the main reason why we haven't gone there is that politicians are

1047
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,540
very, very, very concerned about that.

1048
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:06,740
They don't want consumers to be hurt through higher inflation because of the carnivorous

1049
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:11,180
nature of the consumer baskets that we all have in our lifestyles.

1050
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:16,580
So with that said, the three main solutions that are out there in terms of boosting the

1051
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:22,420
support, you know, boosting the speed of the energy transition on the renewable side are

1052
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:25,340
and not surprisingly, they're associated with three different kind of interest groups

1053
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:27,100
for want of a better term.

1054
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:31,700
And they're all interesting and they all have their merits as well as their drawbacks,

1055
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,700
I think.

1056
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:37,580
So the first answer is the one that you hear from sort of mainstream energy economists.

1057
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:43,180
So economists who are trained in orthodox economics and they're focused on energy markets.

1058
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:47,420
Great people to talk to you because they at least, unlike a lot of my colleagues on the

1059
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:53,140
left know the energy markets, they really know what they're talking about there, although

1060
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:57,220
they look at them through certain in certain blinked ways, I would argue.

1061
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:02,500
So what they argue is, look, the problem is not that we're relying on the private sector

1062
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,780
and the profit motive and markets to do this, of course, they wouldn't, they don't say that.

1063
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:07,780
That's fine.

1064
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:12,180
What they argue is that the problem is that the market design is not right.

1065
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:17,580
So what they would say is that, is that, and I have some sympathy with this argument because

1066
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:24,420
they're right when they say that electricity markets as they exist worldwide today are market

1067
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:29,860
mechanisms that were designed essentially in a fossil fuel world and they haven't really

1068
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:32,660
been changed in the last 20, 30, and that's true.

1069
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,660
They haven't.

1070
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:36,380
They're pretty much the way they've always been.

1071
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:41,420
And they argue and it's understandable, they say, look, we just need to redesign those

1072
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:46,380
market mechanisms, rethink the way we price electricity and wholesale and retail markets,

1073
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:49,180
and then everything will fall magically into place.

1074
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:53,260
But of course, economists always say that, that's the answer to every problem, which

1075
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:57,420
is that the problem with markets is not that we have markets, the problem is that we haven't

1076
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:58,420
got them right yet.

1077
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,420
We haven't perfected them.

1078
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:02,340
We haven't optimised them.

1079
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:06,540
And also there are lots of recommendations out there circulating in different forums

1080
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:08,740
for how you might do that.

1081
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:14,300
But all of them have distinctive drawbacks as well as potential advantages associated

1082
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,300
with them.

1083
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,700
That's that answer.

1084
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,940
And as I said, I have some sympathy with that argument, but I'm definitely not convinced

1085
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:20,940
by it.

1086
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:23,220
The second answer is, again, is very, very interesting.

1087
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:28,940
And that's the answer you typically hear from the energy industry itself.

1088
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:33,140
And so what they say, obviously they agree with economists that the problem is not that

1089
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:37,420
we're relying on the private sector markets, but where they disagree largely with economists

1090
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:40,460
is they don't think the problem is in market design.

1091
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:42,060
They say, no, that's fine as well.

1092
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,980
Just keep existing markets as they are.

1093
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:48,100
The problem is that the subsidies to renewables aren't big enough.

1094
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:53,740
So they basically say, look, keep everything as it is, but just like double the support

1095
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:57,980
mechanisms may provide more of it and make them more attractive.

1096
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:02,700
And that's what the Inflation Reduction Act was in the renewable sector.

1097
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:09,900
Industry had been saying to the US government, you have been attenuating the subsidies you

1098
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,540
provide us with lowering the level of tax credit.

1099
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:14,700
And it's stagnating.

1100
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,260
That's what you get if you do that.

1101
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:18,260
Lift it back up.

1102
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,860
And so that's what the government did.

1103
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:21,980
We get to see whether that will have the desired impact.

1104
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:28,420
But that was, in my view, was all about re-inflating profitability in the renewables industry to

1105
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:33,980
re-attract investment into that sector, very, very straightforward actually.

1106
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:42,300
And I have some sympathy with that as well, because if the totality of our options is the

1107
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:46,900
private sector, what else are you going to do?

1108
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,100
That would work, is what you're saying, in your opinion.

1109
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,460
I think it probably would.

1110
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:57,100
If you essentially guarantee profits, and if those profits are attractive in relative

1111
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:02,060
terms according to the different alternatives that are out there, then, yeah, money will

1112
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,060
flow in.

1113
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,060
Absolutely.

1114
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:11,420
I mean, it would be really costly for the consumer and or the taxpayer in some combination.

1115
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:14,140
But I think it would work if the government did that enough.

1116
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:18,020
But obviously, there's huge reluctance to do that for all sorts of reasons.

1117
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:21,180
Not just the cost to the consumer, you don't want to see it be seen to be lining the pockets

1118
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,740
of nasty big capital.

1119
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:24,740
That's the second option.

1120
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:31,140
The third option is the one that those on the left will typically say, which is to say,

1121
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:34,260
the problem is that we're relying on the private sector and markets to do this.

1122
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:35,740
It doesn't work.

1123
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:41,140
We've been doing it for 30 years, still isn't working, still going much too slowly.

1124
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:47,180
Let's try something different by which they normally mean, or we, if I count myself in

1125
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:57,260
this group, normally mean mass public sector ownership and investment in renewable energy.

1126
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:00,700
The argument being that the private sector and markets isn't working, isn't being shown

1127
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:07,820
not to be working, even though that all these subsidies continue to be available worldwide.

1128
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:15,700
That's a really, in many ways, at least on the face of things, a very attractive option.

1129
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:19,700
If you think about it like this, so go back to what I was saying earlier about five to

1130
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:25,220
eight percent returns, well, if five percent, eight percent returns are not sufficiently

1131
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:30,940
attractive to draw in mass private sector investment on a significant scale, you would

1132
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:35,060
imagine that returns of five to eight percent would be perfectly attractive for the public

1133
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:36,060
sector.

1134
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:41,940
Presumably, if you are a government, you would just be happy with an investment that kind

1135
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:47,740
of covers the cost of capital, and if it doesn't do any more than fine, why would you need

1136
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:49,500
any more than that?

1137
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:58,540
In principle, I think that that is a very attractive option, but of course, there are

1138
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:05,300
obstacles of all sorts of different nature, of an ideological nature, clearly.

1139
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:12,740
The fact that the idea that the private sector can't or shouldn't do this is anathema to

1140
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:22,140
the political class in large parts, not just of the West, but of the world more generally.

1141
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:29,460
Governments around the world, including in what, by global standards, are rich countries,

1142
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:34,140
have persuaded themselves or allowed themselves to be persuaded that they don't have the fiscal

1143
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:38,820
capacity to carry out that type of investment, they need to be fiscally conservative, it's

1144
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:43,580
all about tightening belts, you can't grow the public balance sheet, even if it is to

1145
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:47,900
invest in revenue-generating assets, and I don't really buy those arguments, but those

1146
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:54,980
arguments are very, very powerful, and it seems right now, at least, that very few mainstream

1147
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:59,700
parties at least are even willing to count on any departure from that kind of economic

1148
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:00,700
orthodoxy.

1149
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:08,540
So, while I think that it's a credible proposition for rich countries, it doesn't seem very likely

1150
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:10,220
that it's going to be happening any time soon.

1151
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:15,540
Any talk of public sector ownership of energy in places like the UK is, any propositions

1152
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:18,660
along those lines are very, very limited, very, very small scale.

1153
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,220
Stam has killed it, right?

1154
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,220
Basically, yeah.

1155
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:26,700
It means overtly saying, this will be the market, we're not the Tories, but it will be the market.

1156
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:31,500
Which means that, as we were talking about earlier, great British energy such as it is,

1157
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,060
or such as it might be, what's the point?

1158
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:40,300
It's going to be a bit-part player in a private market that is completely unchanged, so it

1159
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,220
will just be like another private sector player, basically, and it probably won't even do it

1160
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,620
as well as those in the private sector.

1161
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:49,460
What's the point of doing it on a small scale if you're not doing something fundamentally

1162
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:50,460
different?

1163
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:54,940
There's no point, in my view, there's literally no point in public sector ownership unless

1164
01:14:55,180 --> 01:15:00,660
you are enabling and incentivising that actor to do something fundamentally differently

1165
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:01,660
from a private sector.

1166
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:03,860
Otherwise, there's no point, just let the private sector do it.

1167
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:06,860
It's going to be a private sector actor which pays shit wages to people.

1168
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:07,860
Probably.

1169
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,860
And does a shit job.

1170
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,860
Yeah, that's what's going to happen.

1171
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:10,860
Yeah, of course.

1172
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:13,980
Best case scenario, it will be mediocre market actor and it will be privatised by the Tories

1173
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:14,980
in 15 years.

1174
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:15,980
That's what's going to happen.

1175
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:16,980
Best case scenario.

1176
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:17,980
100%.

1177
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:18,980
Yeah.

1178
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:19,980
There's no point.

1179
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:24,420
Unless you're going to do it on a large scale with the ambition to do something fundamentally

1180
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:27,420
differently, there's no point in doing it in my view.

1181
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:31,300
The only argument for doing it would be that it's like a wedge in the door and that then

1182
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,620
you can build on it potentially.

1183
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:39,940
Maybe that's the grand plan that's not being talked about, but I'm doubtful anyway.

1184
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:42,580
But the other thing about public sector ownership, I think, the only other thing I would like

1185
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:52,620
to say about that is that even if it is theoretically, to my mind, quite credible and possible in

1186
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:56,540
the relatively rich parts of the world, it's a different matter entirely in going back to

1187
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,460
where we started our conversation.

1188
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:04,980
In those parts of the world where investment is most vital, if you're talking about those

1189
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:10,100
countries in the global south that we were talking about, the idea that governments in

1190
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:18,900
those parts of the world, which are struggling under infinitely more severe fiscal constraints

1191
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:24,780
than the governments of the US or Germany or the UK, are going to kind of borrow cheaply

1192
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:31,420
on the capital markets for investment in public ownership of renewables, ain't going to happen.

1193
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:36,340
You could say we're going to recalibrate the provider of the World Bank and so it's not

1194
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:39,260
like implausible, but it's not going to happen right now.

1195
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,260
No.

1196
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:41,260
It's definitely not going to happen right now.

1197
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:47,100
But you would need to give it insofar as the fact that, for example, many of those

1198
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:55,580
countries are kind of staggering under huge existing debt servicing obligations from the

1199
01:16:55,580 --> 01:17:02,300
past, those would have to just be written off essentially in order to enable that kind

1200
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:04,300
of new investment to take place.

1201
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:08,300
So it's a big ask politically as well as economically.

1202
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,860
Speaking of the kind of austerity arrangements, and I find this quite funny, it's a bit of

1203
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:18,260
a tangent, but you have in Europe with the Eurozone and European monetary integration,

1204
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:22,820
you've had since 1999, since there's been the Euro as a currency, the stability and

1205
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:27,540
growth pact, which all the members of the European Union actually, I think, have to

1206
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:32,420
adhere to, one of the major parts of that is to not run deficits of more than 3%.

1207
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:35,660
Now of course, if your economy is growing at 3%, 4% and you've got inflation of 3%,

1208
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:40,980
4%, a deficit of 3% forever is absolutely fine actually.

1209
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:44,940
But what's really interesting is they suspended it in 2020, I don't know if you saw the story,

1210
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:50,780
they suspended it in 2020, and it's only going to come back now, I think it was 2020 to 2023.

1211
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:56,980
And over that time frame, Italy's GDP per capita grows quickly as the United States,

1212
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:00,460
because there was loads of public sector investment in really important infrastructure.

1213
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:05,620
And now the European Union is saying to Italy, you can't run deficits anymore, and if you

1214
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:09,100
don't, we'll sanction you, and you think, fuck, they've just literally been growing

1215
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:14,100
at their best clip in 25 years, but their stupid little brains can't get around it.

1216
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:20,060
On the point you said about public ownership, and again, it's like an ideological default

1217
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,740
now, which people do not understand.

1218
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,540
The idea of public ownership making money.

1219
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:25,540
Absolutely.

1220
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:29,580
It's only going to be us sinking money, losing money.

1221
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,380
You're talking about investing in revenue generating assets.

1222
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:33,380
What's the problem with that?

1223
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:36,460
I mean, if you look at, for instance, where I live, Portsmouth, I did an article about

1224
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:41,220
this recently, you've got Portsmouth International Port, which was built in the early 1970s.

1225
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:47,540
The idea of a city, a medium sized city like Portsmouth, building infrastructure like that

1226
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:51,620
today in partnership with the private sector is just like implausible.

1227
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:55,260
So they built Portsmouth International Port, I think it adds a couple of hundred million

1228
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:58,420
to the national economy, it employs 5,000 people.

1229
01:18:58,420 --> 01:19:00,500
Last year it made eight million pound profit.

1230
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,780
It's publicly owned, right?

1231
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:07,800
And basically, since it's been built and it's not been privatized, that has basically

1232
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,460
meant hundreds of millions of pounds going to local people in Portsmouth.

1233
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,660
It means lower council tax and it's paid for a ton of services.

1234
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:20,220
Up there in Southampton, where the airport's privatized, guess what, the city's busts.

1235
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:25,940
But people were spending too much, or maybe actually it's about ownership and you're

1236
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:27,740
not owning the things that make cash.

1237
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:28,740
100%.

1238
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:31,820
And there are two things I would add to that.

1239
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:38,580
One of them is, you mentioned parenthetically, which is, you said it's built by the public

1240
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,700
sector in collaboration with the private sector.

1241
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,540
So lots of people, when you talk about public sector ownership of energy, they say, well,

1242
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:46,500
the public sector can't do that, public sector doesn't have the capacity and the expertise.

1243
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,900
You don't have to build it yourself, you just give a contract to someone to the private

1244
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:50,900
sector to build it.

1245
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,660
It's the ownership that matters, you don't have to build it, it's the capacity.

1246
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:58,460
And then the second thing is, they're like, well, then the public sector will fuck up

1247
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,460
the operation.

1248
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:02,340
Or a wind and solar farm doesn't take much operation.

1249
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:05,140
Once they're built, you don't have to do anything.

1250
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:09,060
Occasionally a rotor will stop turning and you have to send an engineer out with a screwdriver

1251
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:10,220
to get it going again.

1252
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:11,580
But that's about it.

1253
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:14,380
It doesn't take like a rocket scientist to run a wind or solar farm.

1254
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:18,380
So the idea that the public sector can't do this is preposterous.

1255
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,740
And I think about Southampton up the road.

1256
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:27,020
Like I say, their bust, they're dimmed street lights in Southampton, like 20%.

1257
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:32,580
They're going off an hour earlier and you think you've got the country's second biggest

1258
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:37,900
commercial port after Felix, though, and it's in private hands and you're turning off the

1259
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,300
fucking lights an hour earlier.

1260
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,660
Like this is a madhouse.

1261
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:45,500
Many people in Pompey would say Southampton's a madhouse, but for very different reasons.

1262
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,860
They probably lose to their football team next year as well.

1263
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,700
Well, Southampton might get promoted.

1264
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,700
Oh yeah, they're in the final.

1265
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:51,700
Good point.

1266
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:52,700
They might get promoted.

1267
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:55,540
I don't want them to get promoted for people who aren't aware, but Portsmouth has just been

1268
01:20:55,580 --> 01:21:00,300
promoted to the championship and thanks to our in that league as well.

1269
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,700
So I mean, that to me is interesting, the idea of public ownership or something, which

1270
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:07,260
is going to make money, which, you know, again, a lot of the public doesn't understand that.

1271
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,980
It's not because the public are daft, it's because literally no politician other than

1272
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:15,300
Jeremy Corbyn has actually even made tried to make the argument for 30 years, but it seems

1273
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,580
to me like you're saying...

1274
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,140
And Bernie Sanders in the US made the exact same argument.

1275
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:24,820
We can have public ownership with a decent rate of return, really good social externalities

1276
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:25,820
as they be called.

1277
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:26,820
Yeah.

1278
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:27,820
Yeah.

1279
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:28,820
Decarbonizing.

1280
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:29,820
What's the problem?

1281
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:30,820
So what is the problem?

1282
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:31,820
Well, I think it's ideological.

1283
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:34,100
I mean, I think, I think that's, that's what it is.

1284
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,900
But there's no special interest groups stopping them from doing that.

1285
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:37,900
In the globe.

1286
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:42,060
No, no, I don't think, I mean, except for the fact that, of course, behind the scenes,

1287
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:48,020
the energy sector, the asset managers and so on, are telling them that they can't do

1288
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:51,940
it for all those reasons that we've, that we've touched on already.

1289
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:56,860
So it's not just, I mean, ideology is kind of created by interest groups to a significant

1290
01:21:56,860 --> 01:22:02,780
extent, but I don't think they, I don't think there are substantive economic arguments against

1291
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:05,140
it in, in certain countries of the world.

1292
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:11,180
And I think that it's much more challenging in parts of the world where, you know, absent

1293
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:19,060
really significant transformations, but certainly in a place like the UK, it's completely, completely

1294
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:20,060
credible.

1295
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:21,180
Okay.

1296
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:23,260
So it's public ownership, but it's public ownership without conflict.

1297
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:26,540
It's not like you're saying, right, we're going to bring this stuff into public ownership.

1298
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:28,700
It's literally saying, okay, well, we're going to build new capacity in the state.

1299
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:29,700
It's going to do it in the state.

1300
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:30,700
We'll own it.

1301
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:31,700
Yeah.

1302
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:33,940
You're not saying, okay, well, these water companies, they're, they're screwing up, they've

1303
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:36,820
failed, screw them, because of course, their counter-argument is where your bills are going

1304
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:37,820
to go up.

1305
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:38,820
Right.

1306
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,100
So it's, it's, it seems like a very low cost form of public ownership.

1307
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,100
I think so.

1308
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,100
Yeah.

1309
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,100
No, I think so.

1310
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:51,580
I think that, that's, that's where the kind of really interesting arguments are coming

1311
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:52,580
from.

1312
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:57,220
And, and, and there are some, some initiatives in that direction, not in the UK, but in, in,

1313
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:01,020
in New York state, many people might have heard the, there's, there was a build public

1314
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:07,100
renewables act that was passed last year, I think it was, which at least on paper looks

1315
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:12,420
like it could be quite significant in terms of public ownership of electricity generation,

1316
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:18,860
in New York state remains to be seen whether it will actually be actioned in significant

1317
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:19,860
part.

1318
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:25,340
You know, the, the, the, the degree to, you know, just because it's there on paper doesn't

1319
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:29,020
necessarily mean it's actually going to, going to happen on the ground.

1320
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:34,220
There are, there are lots of potential obstacles in the way of a political nature, but things

1321
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,580
are happening on that front.

1322
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:39,220
So there is reason, there is reason for hope, I think, on that front.

1323
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:44,940
But I, you know, I think that of, of the three kind of options I outlined, that seems to

1324
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:52,540
me at least, to be the one with the most potential, to get things, to get things going more quickly

1325
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:53,660
than they currently are.

1326
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:59,940
And that's the thing, that's the thing right is like every year matters on this, because

1327
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:04,620
you know, every, every year with emissions that are higher than they need to be means

1328
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:08,700
that extra little bit of carbon in the atmosphere or extra large bit of carbon in the atmosphere.

1329
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:11,340
I just want to go back to something we were talking about earlier on.

1330
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:15,380
I mentioned Scotland, which actually in terms of the percentage of electricity coming from

1331
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:17,420
renewables is really impressive.

1332
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:18,420
Yes.

1333
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:19,660
And you said you want to talk about Scotland more.

1334
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:20,660
Yes.

1335
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:21,660
Please go ahead.

1336
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,660
Good point.

1337
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:23,900
I'd forgotten about that, but very, very good point.

1338
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:28,460
So here's the interesting, here's the interesting thing and this, this, this point about the

1339
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:32,940
geography of renewables, which is what I'm going to talk about, bears directly on that

1340
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:33,940
question of profitability.

1341
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:38,420
We were talking about earlier this, this kind of paradox of why renewables deployment

1342
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:41,580
is not as profitable as people think it might be.

1343
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,820
And part of the answer is the geography of this.

1344
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:50,460
So in the UK, but not just in the UK, pretty much anywhere in the world you look, it's

1345
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:53,780
the same in Sweden where I live, it's the same in China, it's the same in India and

1346
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:59,900
also in Germany and the US, the, the, the recurring geographical feature that you see

1347
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:07,260
about renewables is that wind and solar facilities tend to be located at the opposite ends of

1348
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:10,740
the country to where most people live and most industry is located.

1349
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:15,020
So in the, in, in Sweden, for example, the population is disproportionately located

1350
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:21,220
in the south and all the wind power is up in the north, exactly the same in the UK.

1351
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:24,860
Now there are two important things to, to understand about that.

1352
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:28,020
Firstly is, is, is why that happens.

1353
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:34,140
And then the second thing is what the implications are there, are there of that for the profitability

1354
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:36,100
of renewables generators.

1355
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:39,460
So why it happens, it happens for all sorts of different reasons.

1356
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:44,500
And in the UK case, there are certain physical reasons about wind speeds and stuff like that.

1357
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:49,340
But the main reason that happens everywhere is, is, is precisely because that's where

1358
01:25:49,340 --> 01:25:51,040
people don't live.

1359
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:56,220
And if you are developing a wind or solar farm, one of your biggest costs is likely

1360
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:59,500
to be land, is likely to be land costs, right?

1361
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:03,520
Unlike conventional power plants, wind and solar facilities take up a huge amount of

1362
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,520
land.

1363
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,400
If you're going to be generating a lot of power, it's a huge amount of land.

1364
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:12,160
And so all other things being equal, developers of renewables projects always will try to

1365
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:16,280
cite their facilities where land is cheapest.

1366
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:21,960
So take the, take the US case, for example, you know, the cost of land in, in, you know,

1367
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:28,160
the northwest in, in, in, in Montana or something like that is like 1% of the cost in the east

1368
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:29,160
coast.

1369
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:33,360
So of course you're going to put your facility there because your land cost is cheaper.

1370
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:38,440
And land costs, the cost of leasing or buy it, a part of that generating costs we talked

1371
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,360
about earlier, that's, that's factored into that generating costs.

1372
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,440
So the fact, those generating costs that come down so much, that includes land costs.

1373
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,960
So that's why you get this geographical pattern.

1374
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,200
Now what does that mean in terms of profitability?

1375
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:58,200
Well, the thing is, is that if, if your facilities are located a very, very far away on average

1376
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:05,480
from where the demand for that electricity is concentrated, then your facility is, is,

1377
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:11,600
is, is, is exerting a disproportionate burden on the grid, on the, on the transmission and

1378
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:19,800
distribution grid, because it's much more, you are, you are basically, it's much more

1379
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:24,960
expensive to maintain a grid over long distances, obviously, than over short distances.

1380
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,800
And the way that this works is that, is that grid operators, those that run the grid in

1381
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:34,480
any case of the national grid in the UK, it, for the cost, that for all the costs of maintaining

1382
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:39,400
that grid and upgrading it and improving it and adding to it, those costs are borne by

1383
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:44,880
everyone who's part of, of the system, both on the consumption side and on the demand

1384
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:45,880
side.

1385
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:49,840
So on the consumption side, you at home and you pay your electricity bill, you are paying

1386
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:54,000
for electricity to be generated, but you're also paying for it to be transported.

1387
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,320
So your share of the grid costs, essentially, to where you live.

1388
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,840
But generators are also charged for that.

1389
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:06,760
And while they're not necessarily charged perfectly based on where they, where they

1390
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:13,680
are based, but in general, they are charged much more the further they are away from where

1391
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,640
demand for electricity is located.

1392
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:21,240
So, renewables developers are essentially, because they're much more further away on

1393
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,560
average in conventional power plants from where their electricity demand is located,

1394
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,840
they have much higher transportation costs.

1395
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,640
So the thing is, right, when, when those, those people focus on, when, when the analysts

1396
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:37,920
focus on generating costs, low cost of renewables, it's actually a completely artificial cost

1397
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,320
because it excludes those transportation costs.

1398
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:42,440
And you can even say it better than that.

1399
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:47,840
You can say the generating costs are only low because the transportation costs are high.

1400
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,200
Do you see what I mean?

1401
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:53,800
It's like you only have low generating costs because you have low land costs and you only

1402
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:58,800
have low land costs because you're a million miles away from where the demand is located.

1403
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,320
So you're going to have a huge burden on their transmission system and high transmission

1404
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,520
charges.

1405
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,880
So you may think that you're going to be really profitable because you're, because you're

1406
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:12,080
generating costs are very low, but your transportation costs, which no one ever talks about, are

1407
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,080
really, really high.

1408
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:18,080
So the geography of this, the economic geography of electricity is unbelievably important.

1409
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:22,000
That seems to have big implications for things like municipally owned renewable capacity.

1410
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:27,040
So if I'm Andy Burnham and I'm the mayor of, you know, Greater Manchester, you know, great

1411
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:31,480
Andy Burnham, great guy, he loves public ownership, you know, he's, well, he does now anyway.

1412
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:35,200
He's all in favor of it, but obviously the land values of Manchester are relatively

1413
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,200
high.

1414
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,200
They're going up.

1415
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,200
Yes.

1416
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,720
And so all of a sudden, actually, it doesn't really make sense for him to be saying, I'm

1417
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,160
going to use X amount of square kilometers to build.

1418
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,160
Yeah.

1419
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,160
Solar or wind.

1420
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,880
No, two, two things to say about that.

1421
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:54,200
So one is, and so a lot of the kind of hope that people have is for, is for kind of distributed

1422
01:29:54,200 --> 01:30:01,280
renewable energy generation that is not sort of one large scale facility that requires

1423
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:05,880
lots of land, but is kind of rooftop solar, things like that, that is attached to households

1424
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,760
because it doesn't have those land costs associated.

1425
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:13,920
And so, and so, and so I, and I think that that, as I was mentioning earlier, like 30%

1426
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:19,080
of the Chinese additions in 2023 were rooftop solar that don't have those land implications

1427
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,080
attached in.

1428
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:24,960
But in so far as you do need those large scale renewables facilities to kind of really bend

1429
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:29,600
the curve on emissions, land is obviously a big issue precisely, as you say.

1430
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:35,000
And so there are, there are countries in the world where precisely one of the things that

1431
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,720
state authorities are doing in terms of enabling renew, private sector renewables development

1432
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:47,360
is exactly on the land question is, is, for example, aggregating land ownership through

1433
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:53,800
powers of expropriation, for example, to enable renewables developers to get their hands on

1434
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,440
the land more readily and more cheaply than might otherwise be possible.

1435
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:02,480
So I think that that's the way to think about it in the UK context would be that that's

1436
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:05,720
the sort of thing that municipal authorities would have to be thinking about.

1437
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:09,680
And of course, 40 years ago, it would have been much easier because the state owned much

1438
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:12,160
more land than but it's privatized all of it.

1439
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:16,920
But also suppose if you're if you're a big manufacturing region, so if you're, you know,

1440
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:21,440
that belt in in Germany where you've got so much heavy industry or historically in this

1441
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:26,680
country, you might say the West Midlands, you want, you've got these big factories,

1442
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:30,080
you want to make lots of stuff and you want really cheap energy inputs, you're not going

1443
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:36,840
to want, you know, a wind turbine next to Birmingham, or a or a or a set of solar cells

1444
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:41,280
in Solihull, you're going to want the wind coming from the outer Hebrides, maybe the

1445
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,360
sun coming from further to your south.

1446
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:46,200
So that kind of quite progressive.

1447
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,200
It sounds lovely.

1448
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:51,120
We all love community ownership and, you know, small scale distributed fine.

1449
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,960
And sometimes it's great, you know, my mother-in-law shares solar cells on her house that their

1450
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:55,960
energy bills have collapsed.

1451
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:56,960
Yeah.

1452
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,360
But actually in terms of if you want to have a vibrant industrial sector, we want to manufacture

1453
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,360
stuff.

1454
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,680
So that's a big deal.

1455
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:03,680
It is.

1456
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:04,680
Yeah, absolutely.

1457
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:05,960
No, you're absolutely right.

1458
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:17,680
And I think that and I think that, you know, where where big commercial consumers of electricity,

1459
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:23,280
the Amazons and the Microsofts and so on are investing in supporting the development

1460
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,280
of large, large renewable facilities.

1461
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,000
It tends to be a long, long way away from where people are living.

1462
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,200
So they're building data centers in nor in parts of Norway, for example, where you can

1463
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:39,120
have these huge server farms because land is precisely because land is relatively cheap

1464
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:44,920
and they can build these huge renewables facilities that can be built at a relatively low cost.

1465
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,720
And that's obviously very, very different in manufacturing regions of the world.

1466
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:49,720
You mentioned Amazon.

1467
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,720
Yes.

1468
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:51,720
Microsoft.

1469
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:52,720
Yes.

1470
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:57,600
We're seeing apparently something of a revival of nuclear in the United States.

1471
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,320
Yeah, I've been reading about that.

1472
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:04,280
Obviously because Big Tech, Amazon, Meta as well, potentially, if they go into AI are

1473
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:07,960
saying, look, we need lots of cheap energy and we've done the numbers and we think nuclear

1474
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:08,960
makes the most of it.

1475
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:09,960
Yeah.

1476
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,360
And I think part and exactly part of that is the land cost.

1477
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:17,040
You know, nuclear takes much less land than wind than wind and solar.

1478
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:22,240
And again, it says partly it's the land cost issue, partly it's the nature of the energy

1479
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:23,240
resources they want.

1480
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:24,240
Right.

1481
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:30,720
Wind and solar are intermittent renewable sources and so they can do certain things,

1482
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:36,880
but you also, whether you are a company or a country, you also want a source of kind

1483
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,520
of what's often called base load power, which is the source of power that you can always

1484
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,520
turn on when you need to.

1485
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:49,440
And nuclear is a very, very consistent, reliable, carbon-free source of base load power.

1486
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,720
Should we have a nuclear in the UK?

1487
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:54,080
I mean, it's kind of implicit at the start of the book because you talk about the percentage

1488
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:59,240
of energy globally, which is coming from carbon and non-carbon sources, energy coming

1489
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:03,320
from non-carbon sources when solar has gone up, but at the same time it's gone down from

1490
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:06,400
nuclear and hydro-hydroelectricity, so actually the shares about the same.

1491
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,400
Yeah.

1492
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,320
I mean, I think that, I think that, you know, my view, I don't have a very strong view on

1493
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:16,720
nuclear one way or another, you know, I think that, what do I think?

1494
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:22,480
I think that governments, unless they're going to build this, all of this stuff themselves,

1495
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,520
which I think they should be, to a significant extent.

1496
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,320
But if they're not, they should be doing everything they can to incentivize the private

1497
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:33,960
sector development of as much carbon-free stuff as possible.

1498
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:38,720
And I think nuclear should absolutely be a significant part of that, as well as solar

1499
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,080
wind, not instead of it, but as well as it.

1500
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:44,480
Brett, such an informative conversation.

1501
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,960
As ever, our first conversation was brilliant.

1502
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:47,960
So was this.

1503
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:50,720
Maybe we'll get you back on again sometime soon.

1504
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:51,720
I hope so.

1505
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:52,720
We'll do that.

1506
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:53,720
Thanks for having me again.

1507
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:54,720
Hugely enlightening.

1508
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,720
Thank you.

1509
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:56,720
Awesome.

1510
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:56,740
Thanks for having me.
