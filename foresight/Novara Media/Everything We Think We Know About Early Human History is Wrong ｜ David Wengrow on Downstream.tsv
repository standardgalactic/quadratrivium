0	6560	the dawn of everything is is trying to undo just to write about even very remote periods of history
6560	12400	that we have evidence for as if there were real people in them which sounds like a ridiculous
12400	16800	thing to say but it's very rarely done you know prehistoric people are more likely to be compared
16800	20480	to non-human primates than they are to people like you or I.
20880	29440	What if everything we knew about human history was wrong?
30400	34880	Received wisdom is that humans have been around for two maybe 300,000 years
34880	40000	but that we only start agriculture in the last 10 to 12,000 after that we have cities,
40000	48480	astronomy, numbers, civilization as we know it but according to a book by David Wengrow and the
48480	55360	recently deceased David Graber that's not quite accurate they say that cities and what we judge as
55920	62480	advanced human culture actually precedes agriculture the story of prehistory is far more
62480	70080	complex and interesting than we thought and that this has quite remarkable political implications.
70960	74320	David Wengrow, welcome to Downstream. Thanks for having me on.
75040	79440	You're an archaeologist you teach archaeology at University College London
80000	82240	is that a job you always wanted to do when you were a child?
82880	89920	No it isn't when I left school I wanted to be in the theatre and I'd already done a fair bit
89920	96560	of that I think from the age of about 14 I fell in love with acting in the stage and I joined up
96560	101120	with the National Youth Theatre which was a wonderful time because it was the first time
101200	106080	Londoner was the first time I actually met people from all over the country all over the UK
107200	115920	and I did it I left school and got an agent and did that for a while then did various other things
115920	119200	and then I fell into archaeology more or less by accident.
120080	123840	So how was that? Wow child actor becomes archaeo that sounds like a great story.
123840	128240	Yeah I think it was more of a sort of young adult actor I mean I've met child actors and
128240	132800	they're a very specific kind of person but there's never quite one of those but
134480	139360	what happened basically after trying various other things including a little
140080	147200	flotation with journalism at the BBC Arabic service and various other things I wasn't
147200	155040	really finding a direction so I had good grades from school and I decided to apply to Oxford
155760	160400	well that's when I want to go to the best university I can get into I want to go to Oxford
161280	165760	and I wrote to all these Oxford colleges saying can I come and do English literature
165760	173680	and they all ignored me and a friend of mine who it was told me it's easier to get into places
173680	178720	like that if you apply for a subject that's a bit off the beaten track and they had just
178800	185440	started a new programme new degree called Archaeology and Anthropology which is actually
185440	191520	the name of the degree that I teach and coordinate now at UCL. So I wrote to one college in Hughes
191520	197840	College asking if I could do that and I got an interview and I went into this interview with
198960	204400	a very formidable woman called Barbara Kennedy she was a geographer because they didn't have any
204400	210160	archaeologists at that particular college and she grilled me for a while and I sort of spouted on
210160	217120	about how archaeology was my great passion and so on and then she reached down and produced from
217120	223280	under her chair all these letters that I'd written to other colleges saying can I come and do English
223280	229920	literature I thought well I'll bolt that up but then she admitted me and I was technically a mature
229920	235840	student although it was probably anything but in terms of everything else but I think it was
235840	242320	classified as a mature student when I started and I nearly made a complete mess of that actually
242320	249200	and nearly got slung out after about six months but I had one teacher it was one of those things
249200	254560	where it's just one person actually gets you hooked and gives you the confidence to think you
254560	258640	know yes you know you have a place in this you can contribute and that was a guy called Andrew
259440	266720	Sherrod who passed away very young actually same age as David 59 and just had a massive
266720	274880	heart attack one day but really sort of got me to pull my finger out and got me addicted to this
274880	279840	stuff and I didn't really look back after that because there's something here all the time I'm
279840	286960	sure that at some point most people when they're children want to be archaeologists yeah I did
287040	292160	I mean there's obviously something there I can remember a school trip to Old Serum
292160	298720	St Salisbury Plain one of these great Iron Age hill forts and I came back from that and went back
298720	302480	I used to live with my grandparents a lot in North London I remember going back to their
302480	307600	place after that and my head was just full of images you know I could see all the different
307600	314640	sort of waves of migrations and invasions and I produced this this sort of tone this is all
314640	319920	pre-computers I think I got like a calligraphy pen or something and sort of tried to create a
320480	325200	I remember my grand helping me with coffee grinds to sort of age the paper so you know
325200	330000	there was something there which is completely irrational where you just feel an attachment
330000	336480	to some era and I don't have any family roots in the British Isles so you know it's not like a
336480	342960	local attachment but you just identify for some reason with a place or an era of history
343840	347360	and I don't know why that happens but clearly people who choose
348080	352960	to pursue archaeology they have they have that in an unusually high dosage
353920	357600	just against the meat of your book the dawn of everything
359520	366400	the conventional view is humans have been around for 200 300 000 years you can give the specific
366400	372400	numbers in the answer but we've only engaged in agriculture for 12 000 years 11 000 years
372400	377760	12 000 years and that with the advent of agriculture we then get all the things that we associate
377760	385920	with with modern humans cities numbers numeracy literacy astronomy civilization your book
385920	393280	co-written with the recently departed David Graber says that's completely wrong or it's
393280	401280	it's significantly wrong um well we'd have to pick apart what you said there uh a bit
401360	408240	Aaron you know um when you say we we started having agriculture 12 000 years ago
409120	415120	only a very tiny number of people on the planet started doing that in very specific locations
415120	420640	specifically the Middle East or they sometimes call the fertile crescent most of the world at that
420640	426960	time was still hunter-gatherers and fishes so um you know actually what you've presented as a
426960	431440	summary is a classic example of what we would call a kind of stage theory where you've got these
431440	436240	long periods when sort of nothing happens then everything changes you get the agricultural
436240	443120	revolution populations expand then you get cities and everything changes again then you get civilization
444400	451760	and one of the things we try to show in the book is that actually the process is much more
451760	457920	interesting than that and you've got people at what are supposed to be different phases or stages
457920	463200	of history actually living cheek by jowl sort of feeding off each other reacting against each other
463760	469680	and also consciously planning and designing societies according to different sets of values
469680	476400	which you know when we talk about civilization and modernity there's this deeply ingrained assumption
476400	482640	to think that it's only us moderns or supposedly moderns you know us post enlightenment folk
483280	488400	who've been able to do that to actually make a decision about the kinds of societies we wish to
488400	494800	live in and then consciously try to make that happen um and I think that's that's a deeply
494800	502320	rooted idea both in the intellectual philosophical and political traditions of the left and of the
502320	510320	right in Europe in the european tradition let's say and we think that's wrong and as you say humans
511520	517920	have been around as far as we know humans who are cognitively just like you and I
518480	523360	same kinds of brains perfectly capable of having a conversation just like the one that we're having
523360	532240	for something in the order of 200 to 300 thousand years and what we know about most of that
532240	541440	time is vanishingly little um but if you think about it that's extraordinary I mean the number
541440	546800	of things that could have happened the number of different kinds of conversations and experiments
546800	553120	that could have taken place and yet the way we tend to write about and characterize those
553120	559360	early periods is the opposite it's as if people were existing in some sort of strange haze just
559360	568240	kind of you know following patterns or routines until one day somebody invents agriculture and
568240	576240	everything changes and that's the kind of I guess conceptual damage that we do to our own past
576880	583520	the the dawn of everything is is trying to undo just to write about even very remote periods of
583520	589200	history that we have evidence for as if there were real people in them which sounds like a
589200	593520	ridiculous thing to say but it's very rarely done you know prehistoric people are more likely to be
593520	600000	compared to non-human primates than they are to people like you or I and I love this insert which
600000	607520	you have which I'd never ever thought of before maybe we can go into a little bit about foragers
607520	614800	hunter-gatherers being less parochial basically than modern humans I mean maybe not today in the
614800	619760	age of the internet but until relatively recently yeah can you talk about Alice this is this is
619760	626640	one of the great revelations of modern archaeology is you know this whole idea that humans before
626640	635040	agriculture lived in these tiny bands sort of isolated isolated pockets of humanity nomadic
635040	640240	roaming around the landscape not having much contact is completely wrong like we can trace back
640240	646240	now in concrete terms evidence going back tens and tens of thousands of years before agriculture
646960	653680	to show that human societies you know way even beyond the last ice age were already highly
653680	661120	structured over very large areas interacting moving things around the landscape we've got
661200	666080	scientific techniques these days which are pretty good I mean you can actually trace
667120	671760	people's diets tens of thousands of years ago you can say whether they moved from a
671760	677440	coastal environment to a terrestrial environment you can trace movements of plants animals raw
677440	684480	materials we have ancient DNA so there are many methods by which we can reconstruct a picture of
684480	690960	early human societies and it turns out that the world was highly connected and if you think about
690960	694880	it this shouldn't be surprising because of course one of the first things that that humans do
697120	703600	is actually move and actually the word that's usually used is that we colonize the globe
704240	707440	which is a strange term to think of in a way because there's nobody out there
708480	716640	to be colonized but we move and we we we somehow find our way everywhere from Africa down to
716640	722560	South America and eventually Australia so you actually start off with a highly
723200	729760	integrated and connected social universe which may not demographically involve that many people
729760	738160	but they're finding ways to maintain connections and transfer ideas over extraordinary distances
738160	742080	in a way that in say the middle ages in Europe certainly wasn't the case the average
742160	746880	yeah rural peasant wouldn't leave there that's right and this is very interesting because it
746880	751600	means you have to rethink scale like the whole scalar factor in human history in a way I think
751600	756800	the sort of stereotypical picture that most people have is kind of back to from where you
756800	761760	know you think you start off with these small isolated groups and then human populations expand
761760	766560	and we end up with globalization it's almost the opposite actually if you look at the history of
766560	772560	the Middle East for example you go from having these big kind of regional systems to a situation
772560	778480	where today you know if you want to move from Cairo to Damascus you've either got to work for the
778480	786000	CIA or go through you know about 50 different border checks so in a way actually you know the
786000	793520	history of nation states and hard borders we've become much more enclosed over time one thing
793520	799120	about megalithic sites which again I've only really discovered in the last several years your book
799120	807280	is a part of that is the role of astronomy and obviously there's the equinoxes and the solstices
807280	813520	but more besides that too often certain constellations of constellations of stars being sort of aligned
813520	822720	and recognised and whatnot so are we looking then at many many societies which didn't have agriculture
822720	827360	yet engaged in really advanced astronomy because again that's something people don't really
827360	833040	and navigation you know we're talking about human populations finding their way through
833680	839760	island landscapes to remote places out in the middle of the pacific of course you know they've
839760	846640	got to have a superb grasp practically and intellectually of topography and the behaviour of
847600	856560	of the seas and yes I mean there's no question and you see it reflected in monumental architecture
856560	863360	from very early periods which is often laid out in very precise alignments in relation to other
863360	869600	monuments in relation to the solstices here in the UK obviously you have famously Stonehenge
870000	877840	that's right I mean people were were clearly more than capable of developing very sophisticated
878400	883680	mathematical geometrical understandings in different ways to the way we do it now
884720	890080	and the most famous I guess sort of discussion of this was the book in the 1960s by Claude
890080	894720	Livestrasse where he tried to suggest that there are basically two different forms of science
895520	900800	there's our notion of science which begins in the laboratory so you carve out an artificial
900800	907360	environment and you have many codes or whatever you know trying to generate new ideas and theories
907360	912000	which are then applied to the world and he contrasted that with the way that most human
912000	917840	discovery throughout the history of our species has actually taken place which is a world of
917840	924560	discovery in which there are no laboratories discovery is part and parcel of social life it's
924560	930080	out there in the landscape in people's interactions with plants and animals it's applied from the
930080	937760	beginning and that presumably is how all those early systems of navigation monumental construction
938720	944240	metallurgy all of these things were discovered and generated through other systems of knowledge
944240	947920	than the one that we're familiar with which is kind of intriguing in itself
948560	953600	was Stonehenge built by people that engage in agriculture do we know that for a fact for instance
954320	959360	that was the consensus until very recently but actually what we found out in
960880	966800	in just the last sort of a couple of decades is that the picture is more interesting so Stonehenge
966800	973200	by the time it's constructed about 5 000 years ago farming has already been adopted in the British
973200	980480	Isles as an import from the European continent but then as in many other places of the world and
980480	984480	again you know this goes back to your initial characterization of human history where you
984480	989600	get agriculture and then everything changes the British Isles are one of many examples of where
989600	996080	people adopt agriculture and then basically change their minds so the period when Stonehenge and
996080	1002640	many other great monuments constructed is actually one in which the populations of this island
1003680	1011120	more or less give up the habit of cereal farming and they go back to foraging wild nuts and acorns
1011120	1015600	and things as their staple plant food they decide to keep they hold on to other things so they hold
1015600	1023280	on to the farming of animals pigs and cattle in particular there's a site close to Stonehenge
1023280	1030000	called Durrington walls where they've actually found the place where people congregated for seasonal
1030560	1037120	festivals and feasted on huge amounts of meat it must have been a hell of a party and this presumably
1037120	1043520	was at the times when they were also engaging in these big coordinated construction activities
1043520	1048720	that we see there so it's a more complex picture they're not farmers or hunter-gatherers they're
1048720	1057600	some hybrid of like farmer forager herders or something so you're saying essentially it's a
1057600	1062560	social choice that's being made it must have been i mean i can't imagine any other way in which people
1062560	1071120	from you know one end of the country to the other turn their backs on a practice like cereal i mean
1071120	1075680	how could that happen unconsciously there's no evidence of any sort of massive climatic
1076480	1082240	rupture or depopulation it just seems to be people deciding that that's not actually what
1082240	1086720	they want to do anymore that's quite that's quite an extraordinary political choice isn't i mean
1086720	1090880	it is you know sort of analog to stonehenge is quite extraordinary i mean there must have
1090880	1095760	been pretty extraordinary things going on for people to even engage in those kind of you know
1095760	1100080	feats of construction but for a contemporary audience i mean the equivalent would be us
1101440	1105120	deciding that the industrial revolution wasn't a good idea or just you know to stop using fossil
1105120	1111600	fuels wouldn't it i mean yeah in terms of social implications obviously they weren't thinking in
1111600	1118960	those terms but it's actually yeah and and it raises a question right which is if people have
1118960	1126640	been able to make decisions on that scale in what we are taught to think of as primitive societies
1127840	1131520	why do we struggle so much with those kinds of structural changes now
1132320	1137920	which leads me on to i suppose the central question in the book for our audience which is a
1137920	1142160	political audience there are obviously extraordinary political implications if
1143520	1148960	the generic what you call stagest view of history is incorrect or inaccurate
1150800	1158000	because this is the bedrock of most modern political theory from in different ways lock
1158000	1162480	russo hobs we can talk about that in a second but also more contemporary people you know
1162480	1168640	the steven pinkers the u val horaries because their essential formulation is
1170320	1175440	the more complex society becomes the more unequal the more unjust but it creates it
1175440	1179680	creates more abundance therefore there's a kind of utilitarian argument for it you know it's
1180560	1186000	well you're talking you're talking about authors and books who sometimes explicitly model what
1186080	1192960	they're doing on those philosophers of two or three hundred years ago you know people actually
1192960	1201360	say i am a neo-hobsian nor a kind of neo-russoian take on human history which is interesting and
1201360	1206160	it's something david and i noticed around the time when we decided to start thinking about
1206160	1211680	these kinds of issues was pretty much exactly the time of the last big financial crash about
1211680	1217200	two thousand and eight nine and you know there was a slew of literature as you might expect on
1217200	1222880	inequality and the roots of inequality and suddenly a lot of those very old ideas you
1222880	1229280	know going all the way back to the 17th 18th centuries really coming back in quite a surprisingly
1229280	1234560	aggressive way you know let's think again about the deep roots of inequality let's go back to
1234560	1240880	harps let's go back to russo which as you say you know we're talking about the the foundational
1240960	1246160	texts of modern political theory but it's important to remember that they were completely
1246160	1253680	speculative i mean they were conjured out of the imaginations of those people with no evidence
1254400	1260240	tangibly whatsoever for the nature of human societies hundreds thousands of years ago
1260880	1268880	so it's these are kind of imaginary worlds of prehistory which is quite a sobering thought
1268880	1272640	you know the idea that modern political thought actually comes out of imagination
1273280	1278080	and its imagination rooted in very specific political contexts you know leviathan was written
1278080	1283920	what 1651 middle of the english civil war and it's partly about what is the nature of society
1283920	1290480	without government and why is government necessary russo died what 10 years before the french
1290480	1295280	revolution you know when he's addressing the question what are the origins of inequality it is
1295280	1301280	the burning question of his time so these are entirely political you know they're exercises
1301280	1307680	in political imagination which are obviously radical and generative at their time but why
1307680	1322800	should we be still asking questions that were pertinent in 1754 in 2022 is i think an interesting
1322800	1327600	question in itself when we've got all this other information all this other evidence you know why
1327600	1332880	are we still asking the same questions in this slightly sort of sclerotic manner you are an
1332880	1337680	academic you're at ucl i was at ucl as an undergraduate oh yeah i did some modules in
1337680	1345520	political theories it goes and what are you taught you know introduction to political theory
1345600	1352480	hobs lock playto robert not sick it's more contemporary political theorists
1352480	1359040	generals but who these effectively are building their thinking on the early liberal tradition
1359040	1368480	of lock on hobs and it's basically 101 why you should obey the state and like you say it's it's
1369600	1375200	it's based on conjecture speculation which is several hundred years old and this is a modern
1375200	1381200	institution in a very advanced western capitalist market economy where apparently we believe so
1381200	1387200	deeply and passionately in empiricism and yet the very basis upon which we say political sort of
1387200	1395360	political status quo is legitimate is nonsense frankly it's a good example of i think what is
1395920	1402800	wrong with universities quite often because you know around the corner from where you were doing
1402800	1408960	that would have been the place where i worked so we're talking about what the 19 i can't place you
1408960	1416080	here and you're very ageless no no 2003 okay so around the corner from where you were learning
1416080	1420880	about lock and rules and all the rest of it would have been the place where i work the
1420880	1424880	institute of archaeology actually i think i probably was already just about teaching there
1425600	1430400	around that time no sorry 2003 no god no thank god no i wasn't
1433440	1438480	and yeah um you know just up the road from there you would have had all these people
1438480	1445360	actually studying uh human prehistory but you know it's i guess it's unfortunately in the
1445360	1451600	nature of universities to carve these things up into separate departments which don't actually
1451600	1458640	generate that kind of learning where knowledge moves in what should be very obvious directions
1458640	1463600	so well how does this stuff look now in light of what we actually know and what are the implications
1463600	1468000	of that so i think it's highly unlikely that archaeology students would have been thinking about
1468720	1473520	those philosophers whereas the students learning about those philosophers almost certainly wouldn't
1473520	1479840	have been thinking about the evidence of deep human history and i think that is a that is a
1479840	1484800	that is a problem i mean it's a lost learning opportunity effectively but isn't it a failure
1484800	1490080	also the academics yeah totally absolutely 100 percent i mean it just strikes me as completely
1490080	1496480	crazy that you know you have talented professionals treating teaching this frankly nonsense to young
1496480	1500240	people but a really important subject you could teach you don't have to teach it as nonsense i mean
1500240	1506800	you could see it as part of a tradition you know it is it is it is it is important to to study it
1506800	1511680	but you know within the confines of what it is and actually you know when you look closely at these
1511680	1516640	texts they're very openly speculative you know rousseau i think sort of spells it out somewhere
1516640	1522640	when he's describing a story very similar to the one you started with about you know how agriculture
1522640	1527920	trapped us in certain new ways of life and he mentioned a private property he says do not take
1527920	1534400	this as history this is effectively a thought experiment and you know it's it's meant to make
1534400	1541120	you reflect on what private property is and its place in the world and its effect on us as human
1541120	1548480	beings the distinction of mine and vine if you like it's not meant to be a reconstruction so actually
1548480	1554080	what's happened with some of the other modern authors you mentioned is also rather strange
1554080	1559760	where you've got what began as sort of radical speculation is now presented as objective truth
1560560	1567120	or even a sort of laws of history and that's what i think sort of provoked us you know david as an
1567120	1572400	anthropologist me as an archaeologist to think hold on this isn't okay you know we should try
1572400	1578240	and do something about this basically and that you know that kind of motivated us to um to start
1578240	1586480	trying to liberate um some of this extraordinary body of knowledge from from these rather siloed
1587040	1593360	context you know get it out from behind the paywall journals and start piecing together a puzzle which
1593440	1598800	is still very incomplete of human history but there's already enough pieces there to say that
1598800	1604640	it looks nothing like the stories that we've inherited from the Enlightenment. Let's talk
1604640	1610560	about um indigenous american society um again there's a few more questions particularly around this
1610560	1617680	which i i think are so impressive just the the source material that you cover in the book and
1617680	1623120	things that i've just also learned in recent years again let's go back to um stereotypes
1623120	1628800	and received wisdom the idea is that europeans discover the western hemisphere in 1492 will
1628800	1635760	leave um leaf ericsson to one side and just came back from sweden actually more keen they
1635760	1638720	they haven't forgotten they have no they haven't that's it's interesting it's interesting how they
1638720	1644720	do really emphasize that isn't it the nordics um we discover effectively a backward civilization
1644800	1650080	which we then broadly exterminate through a combination of guns germs and and steel um
1651440	1657520	that's not quite right though is it no and i mean i've been very fortunate in the last
1657520	1664640	year to be able once travel became possible again after the pandemic to spend some time
1664640	1671360	in canada and in the u.s including talking with indigenous scholars and historians on various
1671360	1680160	campuses um about this um and it's not there is a lot in the book i wrote with david about the
1680160	1688320	pre-columbian americas um and about early colonial contacts between european colonizers
1688320	1695840	and uh native peoples and um it's not an area that is actually you know particularly within
1695840	1701280	either of our wheel houses you know david's field work as an anthropologist was in madagascar
1702400	1709280	my uh phd and most of my field experiences in north africa in the middle east so this was a
1709280	1716720	steep learning curve for us which i'm still very much on uh but it was necessary in order to answer
1716720	1722800	the questions we were asking particularly about the origins of inequality which is how the the
1722880	1728880	project started uh if you look at the literature around the middle of the 18th century take a
1728880	1735200	figure like rousseau and the intellectual milieu in which they're debating the ideas they're thinking
1735200	1740560	through you cannot avoid the americas and particularly that part of north america that's
1740560	1746160	now split between canada and upstate new york basically the the great lakes region and what
1746160	1752720	sometimes called the eastern woodlands which is where europeans uh encountered societies that were
1752720	1760240	organized on radically different lines uh much more democratic lines uh with uh levels of freedom
1760240	1766240	particularly for women which were unheard of in european societies at the time and which clearly
1766240	1772960	had an enormous impact on the european imagination including on the political imagination and we
1773040	1779280	found it was impossible really to understand what was going on you know when we were once we decided
1779280	1786080	that we didn't want to uh fall into that trap of just recapitulating these questions and stories
1786080	1792640	from hundreds of years ago we started asking well how did they come about in the first place and
1793200	1798960	that does lead you down a certain line of questioning which leads to the americas and
1798960	1805680	that's why the book ended up with such a strong focus there let's talk about candieronk a candieronk
1805680	1809360	and maybe you've got a really good french accent i've no section some videos i'll watch for this
1809360	1818800	um he is an actually existing figure it seems i definitely i mean you can if you want to google
1818800	1827440	it you can see an image from 1701 of a treaty called the great piece of montreal and you can
1827440	1834880	see candieronk's signature his mark on it so what's candieronk's importance who is he candieronk was
1837920	1848400	very well known figure person of the here on wendat nation which is is very much still
1849680	1855600	a thing it has its administrative center which i was lucky enough to be invited to
1855600	1861120	on the outskirts of quebec city where they have a small street called candieronk
1861120	1867440	arm celebre um so we were joking that maybe should extend it a bit now because he's he's um
1868240	1877920	he is um a key sort of um individual in in our book um because we have various independent
1877920	1886240	accounts of this person which tell us that uh in that time so we're talking about the the end of
1886240	1896240	the 17th century this is someone who's playing a pivotal role um in diplomacy warfare and in
1897040	1904240	trying to negotiate a better future for for his own people in the midst of a highly complex
1904240	1910400	colonial situation with french english dutch colonizers and so on in the mix someone who was
1910400	1915280	multilingual and who in addition to all of those qualities was clearly an extraordinary intellect
1915920	1924560	and a brilliant speaker um and we have various independent accounts of this um but for reasons
1924560	1933360	which are very contingent um some of those kinds of conversations and ideas that would have been
1933440	1938880	exchanged between candieronk and european interlocutors at the time found their way
1939600	1949440	to a much larger audience in europe we know that around that time the governor of what europeans
1949440	1955120	then referred to as part of new france that part of the colonies would actually invite candieronk
1955840	1961360	to his table to engage in debates purely for pleasure he says you know i did it to entertain
1961360	1969040	my offices because this guy was just so funny and witty and they would debate many of the topics
1969040	1973440	that would later become central to what we think of as enlightenment thought you know
1974080	1981520	rationality versus revealed religion sexual habits marriage customs questions of freedom
1982960	1990560	the role of money in society and in the mix of people who witnessed those conversations
1990560	1997360	was a a minor french nobleman who went by the name la honte the baron la honte
1998240	2003600	who is a person who went over to the colonies in his youth i think at the age of 17
2004960	2013680	lived there for a decade spoke at least two uh indigenous languages um and was deeply embroiled
2013680	2019280	in the goings on uh of of those tumultuous times it also seems to have been a bit of a
2019280	2024400	troublemaker didn't get on with authority ended up getting kicked out of the colonies and found
2024400	2029520	himself uh more or less penniless on the streets of amsterdam and he writes these books these sort
2029520	2039040	of travel logs and finds his way back into favor at court um and one of those books is the one
2039040	2045840	called curious dialogues with a savage of good sense who has traveled and it features these
2045840	2054560	conversations between la honte playing himself and a character called adario who everyone
2054560	2063680	accepts is based on kandirong and in these dialogues adario slash kandirong gives the most brilliant
2063680	2070560	sort of scathing withering analysis of european civilization and this is the book that takes
2070560	2076560	off like wildfire and inspires countless imitations it's it's a bestseller it's translated into
2076560	2084480	multiple european languages uh stage plays which run for years are based on it and uh it becomes
2084480	2089840	the foundation of a whole genre of such dialogues that almost every major enlightenment thinker
2090560	2095120	had to go at so they will take the substance of the dialogues and put them in the mouth of some
2095120	2101760	completely imaginary exotic you know other person maybe a tahitian or chinese or you know
2101760	2109040	there are many different examples but the the context that it comes out of is is a real one
2109040	2116400	of culture contact and exchange and the effects on european thought we would argue were explosive
2117200	2122800	so kandirong in other words ought to be considered part of the story of what we call the enlightenment
2122800	2128800	in the same way as voltaire dida and all the rest i mean importantly it proceeds all of them so
2128800	2132480	and it proceeds them all by some decades so you have what you might call a sort of proto
2132480	2138880	enlightenment salon before the appearance of the the famous salons in europe you call this the
2138880	2148240	indigenous critique um which again reading it i was like it seems obvious in in in retrospect so
2148240	2152400	for instance you know you have engagement between the americas and europe between 1500 and let's say
2152400	2160960	you know the early 18th century 200 years there of of of cultural to and throw and clearly there
2160960	2164480	would have been these kinds of dialogues and there would have been some transmission back to
2164480	2169200	europe it may not have been as much as one would have hoped or have liked but it would have been
2169200	2176480	significant we're talking about 200 years and yet that barely figures in our in our understanding of
2177280	2182000	the exploitation and the colonization of the americas it's seen as purely one way in terms of ideas
2182000	2188000	in terms of capital and humans um but what you say which i think is actually very empowering for
2188800	2193680	for for peoples and ideas which aren't in the global north the most powerful countries is actually
2193680	2199520	it went both ways and that you can actually situate an indigenous american or you know a whole
2200400	2206240	sort of school of thought which is you know coming out of the americas within that european
2206240	2210560	enlightenment which is just i think really powerful well isn't it isn't it actually earth
2210560	2217200	shattered isn't it isn't it odd that we even have to make that point i mean you know what
2217200	2223360	what's the other implication that these people were you know either living in in some utterly
2223360	2231600	different uh sort of mode of reality um which cannot be entirely true given that we're talking
2231600	2239120	about a period of trade and military alliances and you know very intense interaction um it's not
2239120	2244080	controversial to point to the fact that europeans adopted a lot of material habits from the americas
2244080	2248800	at that time many of which are actually linked to the habits of sitting around having those kind
2248800	2254880	of intellectual conversations you know smoking tobacco from pipes drinking caffeinated beverages
2255680	2260800	and yet there is a great resistance to the idea that along with those substances and material
2260800	2267600	habits came ideas you know then you get real kickback and that's kind of interesting in itself
2267600	2274000	because all we're trying to argue in a way is that ideas particularly about democracy and freedom
2274000	2281360	which european enlightenment philosophers themselves attributed to the americas were actually
2281360	2288240	theirs and i think there is something disempowering about the idea that notions of freedom
2288400	2295360	um do not come from the oppressed or do not come from the colonized but there's something to do
2296240	2300240	with ancient greece or you know somehow sort of rooted in europe actually in the soil of the
2300240	2308160	colonizer i think that is disempowering um and there is something uh uh for those who haven't
2308160	2313040	already realized this there is something emancipatory in understanding what perhaps should be obvious
2313040	2320080	that actually ideas about um how to free oneself from oppression come from the oppressed
2320640	2325920	let's talk about some particular places in the americas there's one place called cahokia
2325920	2330560	yeah it was there not long ago about eight months ago so around a thousand years ago this place is
2330560	2335360	the same size as as london so about a thousand ad it's got population in the tens of thousands
2335360	2342640	you know ballpark it's a it gets up uh estimates are uh something like around perhaps 40 000 people
2342960	2348320	at its height um around the 14th century yeah so maybe norwich or something you know it's a
2348320	2356400	largest european city what happens to it um this is very interesting and a little bit controversial
2356400	2362160	but what is clear is that having grown and extended i say i was walking around in this place with
2362160	2366800	colleagues of mine including an archaeologist who's worked there all his life like about 30 years
2366800	2372640	which was great because when you go there um there isn't a lot to explain to you what you're
2373440	2378880	walking around there's this enormous mound called the monks mound there are many different
2378880	2384480	earthworks and mounds there and this thing is huge um and it's in the middle of what is now
2385280	2390480	a kind of national park that has a road running through the middle of it and you know this
2390480	2397280	unfortunately has been the fate of many important uh indigenous heritage sites um in north america
2398240	2403440	you may have a road running through it um you get very good mexican food and those little
2403440	2409760	restaurants and things and you're actually standing in the middle of the largest uh pre-columbian
2410320	2417440	city the largest uh indigenous settlement um in north america and it has these great monuments
2417440	2425840	archaeologists have worked there over the years um it becomes uh uh the center of a whole regional
2425840	2432080	system not probably an empire uh in the sense that we think about it but the influence culturally
2432080	2437680	and politically of cahokia spreads on a really extraordinary scale throughout the mississippi
2437920	2447680	base and um it's clear that certain things are going on there um which are predicated on
2450400	2455600	various forms of hierarchy or inequality there's a mound which is is actually full of the bodies of
2455600	2460640	young women who seem to have been ritually killed in in some kind of horrible ceremony
2461520	2468240	um on the monks mound itself there there's an incredible uh ability to have surveillance over
2468240	2472880	the whole settlement and we know that when the site centralizes the surrounding countryside sort of
2472880	2478400	empties out you get these housing districts which would have all been visible from up there
2478400	2485200	you get fortifications forming and it seems to be going in that kind of direction and then
2485200	2493280	everything changes uh and the area is abandoned depopulated archaeologists for generations have
2493280	2502160	referred to the whole region around cahokia as a sort of vacant quarter um and it appears to have been
2506480	2513040	almost forgotten i guess to the extent that um we don't even know you know the name of this place
2513040	2519360	the genuine name of this place it doesn't really feature in any clear way in later oral histories
2520080	2525520	so people in some way or other turn their back on cahokia and there are various theories about
2525520	2533440	this to do with environmental collapse um which are in my opinion not entirely compelling um
2534400	2538960	and uh increasingly i think people are looking at this situation in the same way that they're
2538960	2545840	beginning to look at the uh the so-called uh Puebla civilizations of the american southwest
2546720	2552400	where again you have these um you know quite big centralized sites which are subsequently
2552400	2559040	abandoned is that well why shouldn't we at least consider the possibility that people are genuinely
2560800	2566880	walking away and deciding to create a different uh a different kind of social order different
2566880	2572480	kind of social arrangements and actually when you start looking at it that way it enables you to
2573440	2579600	join the dots or make a bit more sense of the kinds of societies that europeans did eventually
2579600	2587120	encounter few centuries later in the same regions some of which were still very hierarchical like
2587120	2594560	little mini cahokias but others had developed uh this highly egalitarian uh way of living
2594560	2598960	which you know the natural assumption for europeans to make is that they just always been that way
2601360	2606160	but of course we're talking about people with fully developed historical consciousness
2606160	2611680	who do have in their own histories the history of cahokia and the whole regional system that
2611680	2616880	it generated which goes almost as far north as the great lakes so there is a hierarchical past
2616880	2621520	there that people have for one reason or another turned their backs on and created a different
2621520	2630720	form of society um and uh that's something that we um we dwell on a bit in the book because it just
2630720	2636320	you know it enables you to get past this idea um that we're talking about people who are somehow
2636320	2642160	you know frozen in one pattern of culture uh or sort of have no history there's also this other
2642160	2648080	great example of i'll get this right tia ti huakan which is i think that's very good but i'm told by
2648080	2655520	my mexican colleague that um even mexican scholars don't always pronounce it quite there's
2655520	2663120	teotihuacan which she tells me is better but you hear teotihuacan anyway i think we're okay i think
2663120	2669120	we're fine yeah it's possible um so this is a city that in terms of its size scale magnificence at
2669120	2676240	rivals rome um very centralized very authoritarian then then something changes and you sort of imply
2676240	2681200	it's almost like a you know this is the paris commune in the sort of western hemisphere but
2681200	2687200	potentially there's a big sort of political shift well the archaeologist who guy called rene milan
2687200	2694720	who produced this extraordinary map of teotihuacan which we um were very fortunate to get permission
2694720	2702000	to reproduce the map so you can see it in the dawn of everything and he um directed one of the most
2702080	2707280	incredible ground surveys ever undertaken in the history of archaeology because we're talking about
2708160	2714720	absolutely vast settlement which at its height uh around 300 ad would have had
2715680	2720240	well conservative estimates say a hundred thousand people i've seen estimates that go up to double
2720240	2729920	that big place and uh milan himself and some later scholars argued that there was a a turn
2729920	2736240	around like a complete reversal of of fortunes for that population where it begins uh on a very
2736240	2741040	hierarchical path you know if you go there today as a tourist or just google some pictures of the site
2741040	2745520	you'll see the two great pyramids pyramid of the sun pyramid of the moon this other great
2745520	2751040	structure called the temple of the feathered serpent um these are all later names that the
2751040	2756640	aztec actually invented for teotihuacan we don't know what they were originally called so it begins
2756640	2761040	in this very hierarchical way and again you've even got evidence for ritual killing and human
2761040	2766000	sacrifice they buried the bodies of captives under the foundations of the pyramids it's quite
2766000	2770560	disturbing the hands type behind their backs and they built these structures on top of them
2771760	2780400	but then something changes uh around 300 ad 250 300 ad there is no more monumental construction on
2780400	2787280	bat scale and all of the labor and resources that presumably went into building great temples
2787280	2793760	and pyramids go into something else and that's something else is housing and they cover the
2793760	2805360	entire settlement on a grid uh formation with beautiful housing apartments these are uh uh
2805360	2810240	apartments which are low rise so we're going to go about apartment compounds we're not talking
2810240	2814960	high rise we're talking something more like a villa with a number of a small number of
2814960	2820800	nuclear families big central courtyard subfloor drainage gorgeous murals on the walls actually
2820800	2825360	when archaeologists first started investigating those housing complexes they thought there were
2825360	2834080	palaces then they realized that everybody in the city was living in a palace um now how we to
2834080	2842560	conceptualize this we don't have any detailed written sources from the time archaeologists
2842560	2848000	have tried in various ingenious ways to sort of reconstruct what was going on but what you can say
2848800	2855840	is that people in that city from that point onwards had a really good standard of living
2855840	2862000	and that it was generalized to you know the whole urban population which is pretty extraordinary
2862960	2867920	and we know uh you know you talk about guns germs and steel if we skip ahead
2868560	2874960	some centuries to the the beginning of the the spanish conquest when we do have
2875760	2884320	eyewitness chronicles and accounts of the kind of cities that existed in that region
2884720	2892960	uh from say um the 16th century onwards um there are a whole different range of them you know we
2892960	2898720	tend to think about tenosh titlan and montezuma and sort of aztec empire and that it's all very
2898720	2905840	hierarchical actually and we we go into this in the book the city where hernan courtes and the
2905840	2913040	conquistadors make alliances that enable them to go and challenge the the might of the aztec empire
2913760	2922560	is a city uh by the name of claskala which had a relationship to the aztec capital that was a
2922560	2926960	bit like athens and sparta there's one's very hierarchical the other one's very democratic
2927520	2932880	claskala clearly was a republic of some sort with its own parliament and we even have records
2934000	2940480	in spanish um of the kind of debates uh that went on there and this just doesn't
2940480	2946240	feature in our world histories you know we're quite rightly taught that the fall of tenosh titlan
2946240	2954560	was uh in in a sense you know the beginning of um western global domination what we're not taught
2954560	2959360	is that one of the things you know one of the steps on that pathway was this extraordinary
2959360	2966960	encounter between uh european conquerors and an indigenous urban democracy of sorts and i've
2966960	2974720	got no hesitation in calling it a democracy um at a time when uh you know cities run on that kind of
2974720	2982880	basis were extremely unusual in europe itself and you know none of this is terribly sort of secret
2982880	2988400	you don't have to delve very deep into the sources we've got the letters that courtes himself wrote
2988400	2993680	back to the king of spain saying i found this place it's it's weird you know there's no king
2993680	2997840	it's it's maybe a little bit like some of our florentine or venice you know it's run on some
2997840	3007680	other principles all this stuff is out there um but um it really isn't given the prominence that
3007680	3012960	you know you think it it probably ought to have i mean that sounds what you're describing in um
3012960	3017280	and you know these are obviously people who have no connection whatsoever to the mediterranean
3017280	3023760	you know ancient greece road yeah nothing to do with it there's an indigenous form of urban
3023760	3032240	government what you're describing in teotihuacan um sounds like a revolution potentially or a
3032240	3040000	social revolution yeah there are yeah absolutely and and there are um experts uh on on that site uh
3040000	3045120	who have suggested that that may have been the kind of thing that took place there's no absolute
3045120	3050240	consensus on it in the way that there's generally very little consensus in archaeology but i think
3051120	3056160	everyone would accept that there is a profound transformation that takes place there and that's
3056160	3060800	kind of fascinating because you know one of the things that we're told in the traditional narrative
3060800	3066800	of human history is that once you have very large dense human populations and once hierarchy sets
3066800	3071600	in in those kind of settings it is irreversible whereas here we seem to have a situation where
3071680	3078480	there is a reversal yeah like you say in um in in in western political history people say though
3078480	3083520	isn't a successful slave revolt until haiti for instance which is you know as far as we know is
3083520	3088160	broadly correct but that may have not been the case in the america you make this great sort of
3088160	3093520	rhetorical question in the book which is what we talk about the abolition of slavery um and of course
3093520	3098400	we talk about the story of simonda bolivar and tucilla mature and the abolitionists and whatnot
3099280	3105200	but perhaps it was abolished numerous times many times in history yeah i mean i think this is just
3105200	3111200	sort of classic eurocentrism you know the idea that yeah maybe these things were happening elsewhere
3111200	3116320	but they don't really happen until they happen in a european context i mean it's just a kind of
3116320	3122560	sorting and filtering mechanism um which allows you to say that europe has some kind of monopoly
3122560	3128720	on progressive politics which you know even if taken to an extreme length can become a justification
3128720	3136080	for colonialism genocide and all the rest of it is say well at least we were bringing this kind of
3136880	3143040	you know these sort of progressive concepts of democracy um which were completely lacking
3143040	3148800	in all these other places so you know despite the fact that we decimated them ruined their
3148800	3154080	landscapes and killed most of the people at least you know we sort of again you're back to stage
3154080	3158880	theory at least we moved them on at least we got them out of that that that that kind of malaise
3158880	3163200	that they were clearly stuck in will know you know one of the things we show in the book is that
3163200	3169280	far from it you know there's a huge array of conscious political experimentation going on
3169280	3176320	outside european contexts and we have evidence for your area of expertise is west asia northeast
3176320	3181920	africa um although you're very lucid on the americas and elsewhere you had to research it for
3181920	3189120	this ginormous 700 page book um what i want to talk about is you've got sites like gobekli tepe
3189120	3197120	in um eastern turkey you've got these incredible megalithic sites in in malta this might sound
3197120	3202560	strange questions it's not in the book is it possible that if cities precede agriculture
3203120	3209360	that you have homo sapiens living alongside archaic humans potentially in urban environments
3209360	3213040	because you know neanderthals are around until relatively recently in europe
3215600	3219760	is it is it plausible that there were i mean permanent settlements that sort of see them
3219760	3223440	featured together or is that just something that we can never even speculate on i wouldn't
3223440	3228640	personally refer to gobekli tepe which is much later i mean there's no neanderthals around at
3228640	3239360	that point so we're going back about to about 9 000 bc here in in the middle east and i wouldn't
3239360	3248800	personally characterize gobekli tepe as a city i think we're dealing with a site which is clearly
3248800	3254880	permanently settled but where you have periods when people are coming together and aggregating
3255440	3261280	and coordinating their activities in very large numbers okay so i'll rephrase it yeah
3262880	3266720	it's a built environment which is a permanent built environment yeah plausible that you had
3266720	3271440	humans operating alongside archaic humans in those in those kinds of places well if we go back
3271440	3279040	let's say a bit further a lot further like 50 000 years ago um we know at that point there are at
3279040	3285920	least four probably five different species of humans around the planet there's us there's the
3285920	3291840	neanderthals there's the denisovans there's home of floriansis in indonesia which are the little
3291840	3297520	people sometimes playfully called hobbits um and there's also some more recent discoveries from
3297520	3302560	luzon island in the philippines so this is a situation with no modern parallel when you've
3302560	3308080	actually got different varieties of the human species interacting we know genetically that there
3308080	3313680	was interaction of the closest possible kind there was reproduction across those species
3313680	3320880	some of them um so yeah i mean and actually when you go back even further to the origins of our
3320880	3327360	species the picture now looks rather like that so we're going back now to africa to the african
3327360	3332400	continent where you know there used to be this idea of sort of mitochondrial eve and that there
3332400	3338160	was one ancestral savannah environment where suddenly we became humans actually the modern
3339040	3344480	fossil evidence and genetic evidence suggests that that's wrong and that actually we evolved
3344480	3351360	on the african continent but in multiple different environments between about 500 000 200 000 years
3351360	3358480	ago coastal environments forest environments and savannah environments and there were periods of
3358480	3364560	isolation and periods of contact between ancestral human populations which could be very long so you
3364560	3369680	actually get a huge amount of physical variation you see it in the fossil evidence and if you think
3369680	3376080	about physical variation imagine what was going on with language or child rearing habits or social
3376080	3383440	customs so again you know it flies in the face of this very entrenched philosophical habit of trying
3383440	3390400	to reconstruct the original form of human society there wasn't one and just the panoply of experimentation
3390400	3394640	and social forms which is kind of inconceivable to us but actually that's where we that's where
3394640	3401120	we come from yeah we're a product of this um this kind of composite uh composite of different
3401120	3407040	subspecies and different traditions and let's talk about pseudo archaeology if that's the right word
3407120	3413040	there is such a word pseudo archaeology pseudo archaeology um and i i feel like particularly
3413040	3418800	with the rise of the internet youtube it's probably increasingly something of an entry point for people
3418800	3424320	who eventually end up in sort of more formal archaeology is not the right word archaeology
3424320	3428160	proper i suppose there might that might be the gateway that then sends them to somebody like
3428160	3435200	yourself maybe yeah it could well be why do you think pseudo archaeology is increasingly popular
3435200	3440400	why isn't there there's clearly a there's clearly a desire for it in the cultural zeitgeist well
3440400	3444720	let's be clear what we're talking about because i don't think it's immediately obvious to a lot of
3444720	3450480	people what the difference would be between what you're calling pseudo archaeology and what people
3450480	3458960	like me do and teach for a profession um pseudo archaeology i guess or at least my mental picture
3458960	3463200	of what you're talking about is probably largely written by people who've never actually taken
3463200	3468880	part in an archaeological field project or you know aren't actually engaged in producing any of
3468880	3478560	the evidence that you and i have been talking about today but who for other reasons choose to present
3478560	3486320	a reconstruction of the past which is often presented as rather mysterious or even conspiratorial
3486320	3493680	as the people like me uh you know the reason we devote our adult lives to learning all these skills
3493680	3503280	and teaching archaeology is because we want to cover up the truth okay um and that the truth
3503280	3509600	is actually available to people who don't do that right who may have had entirely different
3509600	3514160	career paths and you know i don't want to come off snobbish you know there's nothing wrong with
3514160	3519760	people speculating and reaching their own conclusions but actually what is often presented
3519760	3527280	as some great new revelation is actually just a very old rehashed obsolete theory that comes out
3527280	3532560	of what was probably mainstream archaeology you know sometime in the early 19th century like you
3532560	3538880	know lost city of atlantis that kind of thing there's nothing new about those ideas and you know as
3538880	3546800	i hope comes across in our book and in our conversation the real evidence is fascinating
3546800	3552880	and it's puzzling and it's challenging on its own terms you don't need to you know
3555680	3561440	come up with confections and elaborations to make it interesting just try and get to grips
3561440	3567520	with it is already challenging and stimulating enough without you know it's trying to surround it with
3567520	3574800	some fabricated area of mystery it's always the way with conspiracy theories because you you you
3574800	3579280	talk to somebody and they'll say oh this person is controlling this and it's this secret cabal of
3579280	3584880	these people and look that there's a great deal of exploitation um in the world and yes the powerful
3584880	3588960	regular system and in extraordinary ways which actually we can discern and understand you don't
3588960	3594480	need to you don't need to be talking about the bilderberg group or i god knows what no but you
3594480	3600080	know it's really important and i i do get a little bit irritated sometimes with colleagues of mine
3600080	3606160	in the way that they respond to what you've called pseudo archaeology um which is to say um you know
3606160	3611840	we're the scientists we know best and um if you believe any of that stuff you're just a lunatic
3611840	3617280	well i think i think that's um you know it's obviously true in a sense but you have to look
3617280	3623360	also at the history of our own disciplines um which again as we've been talking about are very
3623360	3629680	strange in the way that they will deny humanity and consciousness to whole populations and whole
3629680	3635440	groups of people you know when when europeans first saw those monuments at places like kahokia
3635440	3640000	they couldn't fathom you know the idea that native people would have constructed these things they
3640000	3645440	came up with all kinds of wacky theories about laferics or you know vikings coming over or or
3645440	3652000	you know whatever it may be lost tribes of the israelites and those sort of ideas were coming
3652080	3658720	out of what was then mainstream european scholarship you know in egypt where i've
3658720	3666000	done a lot of work on the the origins of ancient egyptian civilization the period before all of
3666000	3671920	that you know the pyramids and mummification all the famous stuff is what archaeologists call the
3671920	3676240	pre-dynastic i mean it's almost if you don't want people to be interested if you go to a
3676240	3681440	conference on the pre-dynastic they'll be talking about like you know we measure this kind of pottery
3681440	3685840	and it's slightly different from that kind of pottery and you know it's all a huge turnoff for
3685840	3691520	anyone who's trying to figure out what's actually going on and if you go even deeper you know where
3691520	3696800	i work at ucl where you studied you have the petri petri museum if you ever stuck your head in there
3697840	3704320	wonderful place which is now very openly engaged in looking at its own history and flinders petri
3704320	3712320	the archaeologist who it's named after was a eugenicist he believed that non europeans were
3712320	3718080	intellectually inferior and he was very into this whole business of phrenology and measuring people's
3718080	3725280	skulls and that sort of thing and he actually had a theory in the late 19th century that ancient
3725280	3731760	egyptian civilization could not have been created by africans and that there had been an invasion
3731760	3738160	of what he called the new race okay so we're talking about theories which are at least as wacky
3738160	3743520	there's the kind of stuff that you'll see on netflix now but they're coming from within our
3743520	3751200	disciplines and it's easy frankly to you know empirically refute those kinds of theories about
3751200	3756640	some lost race of people from atlantis or whatever but i think that's only half the battle we also
3756640	3765280	have to introspect a bit and ask the more difficult questions about how did those spaces open up in
3765280	3772560	the first place in which that kind of theory is able to gain traction and i do think a lot of that
3772560	3779680	does have to do basically with racism and the idea that people long ago on different continents
3780400	3786880	could possibly have been as intelligent and creative as us albeit in different ways you know if you
3786880	3792320	have a mental block with that i think you have to ask yourself but there are more ambiguous
3792320	3796480	examples of this aren't there so you know there's there's people out there who say that the sphinx
3796480	3803040	is significantly older than the pyramids it's still constructed by people in egypt you know not by a
3803040	3808720	sort of race of aliens and that actually we're really wrong and it's thousands of years older
3808720	3814160	than we presently think would you call that a conspiracy theory no it's a completely legitimate
3814160	3819920	line of questioning um it just happens i think not to really lead anywhere terribly interesting i
3819920	3824160	mean there are ways of investigating that sort of thing and you would also have to put it in the
3824160	3828960	context of what we do know about what was going on before the pyramids and the construction of the
3828960	3836000	sphinx in the fourth dynasty which is fascinating in its own right you know i mean i've been to
3836000	3842640	a place called umel kab which is in the south of egypt which is where you have the earliest royal
3842640	3848880	cemetery what's sometimes called egypt's first dynasty and it is fascinating and you've actually
3848880	3853840	got a very disturbing phenomenon there that we talk about in the dawn of everything which is the
3853840	3860720	burials of the earliest egyptian kings and queens there's these great sort of holes in the ground
3860800	3867280	with all these elaborate staircases and furnishings completely surrounded by smaller
3867280	3873200	sort of cubicles where other people were buried and i'm talking about hundreds maybe even thousands
3873200	3880480	of other people who it is generally thought by archaeologists were ritually killed in order
3880480	3887520	to be buried around the tombs and it's not just people actually one of the earliest egyptian kings
3887520	3897280	goes by the name which we can read in early hieroglyphs amusingly his name is aha and it's
3897280	3905760	transcribed into english as aha and aha's tomb actually has not only human beings in pits
3905760	3910960	there's also like three lions buried in it nothing to do with the england football team
3911680	3916160	and you know that isn't that fascinating enough you know let's try and get our heads around what's
3916160	3921280	going on there which we do in chapter 10 or something of the dawn of everything let's talk
3921280	3926000	about that that's kind of intriguing you know why does the beginning of what we call the ancient
3926000	3933680	state involve this extraordinary carefully orchestrated violence against people and
3934320	3939280	you know the sphinx has no place in that context let's but we can reconstruct something of what
3939280	3944960	was going on and it's perfectly interesting in its own right but i suppose a pseudo archaeologist
3944960	3951600	respond to you they'd say well this civilization is older than the first dynasty perhaps they could
3951600	3957120	say that it's a lost civilization again we know actually quite a lot about what's going on it's
3957120	3962960	actually one of the things i wrote my phd about is it's the fourth millennium bc so that long
3962960	3967920	period that's referred to as pre-dynastic because if all they were trying to do was build dynasties
3968960	3974240	we actually know quite a lot about what was going on in those periods and you can go and see it i mean
3974240	3980080	go to a museum go to the the british museum go to the ashmolean museum in oxford it's fascinating
3980080	3984960	stuff you know they had these beautiful artistic styles this is one of the things i wrote about in
3984960	3990960	my phd actually you know we all get obsessed with the monuments the sphinx the pyramids what you see
3990960	3996960	if you focus on ordinary people and particularly their burials because we have a lot of evidence for
3996960	4002720	how people were treated in funerary rituals egypt is incredible in that sense that you can trace the
4002720	4008960	evolution of a ritual it's a funerary ritual you can trace its evolution over thousands of years
4008960	4014720	we know how people were buried and what you see is kind of fascinating in the build-up to the time of
4014720	4021440	the the first dynasties and the first pharaohs and pyramids people lose a lot of the capacity to
4021440	4026320	conduct their own rituals so you start off with a situation where almost anyone can be buried like
4026320	4031600	a prince or a princess with sort of gorgeous elaborate ornamentation and very individualized
4031600	4040880	pottery and beautiful cosmetic articles and with the rise of the kingship and the pharaonic state
4040880	4047520	people seem to lose a lot of that kind of aesthetic control over their own lives and no longer able
4047520	4051840	to conduct their own rituals which is kind of fascinating you see something similar with the
4051840	4058080	rise of the inca empire where we do again have you know spanish colonial accounts and descriptions
4058080	4065520	of what's going on where in order to perform an important ritual like a marriage or a funeral
4065520	4074080	or to honor your ancestors you need certain resources you need bread and beer what's called
4074080	4081040	chicha in order to just perform the ritual and do the right thing but of course not everyone
4081040	4085840	can get their hands on those resources in the same way that in egyptian funerary rituals at a
4085840	4091840	certain point you have to have bread and beer but to have bread and beer you know you have to have
4091840	4099760	access to estates where cereals are farmed and you have plough agriculture so people who can't
4099760	4106400	actually look after their families in a cultural sense i'm not talking about biological survival
4106400	4113840	but you know who can't actually complete their their necessary social rituals begin falling into
4113840	4121040	debt uh relations of debt um or we'll go and we'll have to go to extraordinary lengths and make
4121040	4127920	sacrifices just to be able to do that and that seems to be a big part of what creates hierarchies
4127920	4135840	and systems of dependencies is people either abdicating or somehow losing control um over
4135840	4142640	over their own um yeah their own sort of basic uh basic kind of life rituals or life cycles
4142640	4148960	what future projects do you have lined up i'm involved with various um sort of side projects
4148960	4157520	at the moment i don't find the time right now to do uh much research in depth so i'm actually
4157520	4162800	involved with projects which are not strictly writing projects but just trying to keep myself
4162800	4170640	you know moving on a bit so i'm involved with a new collaboration with a group that you might
4170640	4176560	have heard of called forensic architecture based at goldsmith's college that's an interesting one
4176560	4183600	because they do mostly human rights work um and they use architectural theory and principles
4183600	4190400	modeling to go to court over a whole range of different issues from uh deforestation in the
4190400	4196160	amazon they did the mark dougin case and top them uh extrajudicial killings those archaeologists
4196160	4201200	architects architects architects forensic architects now i have that forensic architecture
4201840	4212000	eyal weizmann his amazing team um so he came to uh an event a big event in germany in berlin
4212000	4218480	about the dawn of everything which was called uh the civilizations frage the civilization
4218480	4226000	questions big three-day event and the the curator of that invited eyal who gave a presentation
4226000	4231040	that just sort of blew me away and when we got back to london he's based here you know we just
4231040	4236400	sort of went out for coffee and we had the most incredible conversation of you know his take on
4236400	4240720	the book it's all very much through the lens of what they do and at first i couldn't really see
4240720	4245680	the connection because the scales are obviously radical different but he read our book as a kind
4245680	4251120	of extended case study in forensic architecture in the sense that it's an anti-state narrative
4251920	4257840	where as in some of the cases i've mentioned you know you can't always prove definitively
4257840	4263040	the other version of events like the non-police version or the non-official version but you
4263040	4268880	can just poke enough holes and cast enough doubts on the official narrative so that it
4268880	4276240	starts to wobble doesn't stand up in court in the court of judgment in our case um and in the
4276240	4282160	process of making it wobble you open up other possibilities for speculation and i thought
4282160	4286240	well this is intriguing you know it's right i mean what it's describing is a very similar kind of
4286240	4294720	logic to our book um so we decided to collaborate on something so we're trying an experiment i can't
4294720	4299360	say too much about it right now but i'll be able to say more about it early in the new year and it's
4299360	4307200	going to focus on these incredible archaeological sites in ukraine in ukraine you have cities going
4307200	4313680	back as early as the earliest ones that we know of in mesopotamia in what's now iraq and parts of
4313680	4320480	syria so we're going back around six thousand years ago you have these huge cities that present no
4320480	4328960	evidence of centralization not in political or economic terms and there is a big debate about
4328960	4334400	whether they should or should not be referred to as cities or rather as something else like
4334400	4340800	overgrown villages or megasites you know you get lots of sort of euphemistic terms being used and
4340800	4349280	essentially what it makes you do is reflect on what we mean by a city um and what are the assumptions
4349280	4356640	that are baked into that so we're going to produce a kind of installation which models these rival
4356640	4362560	accounts and debates doesn't necessarily try to prove one version but which visually kind
4362560	4368240	of immerses you in the questions if that makes sense so that's one project i'm doing uh i've
4368240	4374240	also been talking i mean one of the things that's really um just been kind of overwhelming about
4374240	4379760	the the response to the dawn of everything is the creative response and i'm not talking particularly
4379760	4387680	about um people writing or you know academic writing or even essays but musicians uh artists
4387680	4396160	filmmakers i was just the other week with a uh a fantastic singer and artist she's based in Paris
4396160	4404640	Yasmine Dubois her stage name is La Fonda and um she wrote a song called the dawn of everything
4404640	4409840	and she came here to London and performed it uh you know a few weeks back at the uh the festival
4409840	4415680	hall they had the women life freedom event for human rights in Iran and she performed it there
4415680	4421280	and i was very upset actually i was just getting back from Chicago and couldn't quite get through
4421280	4427920	my jet lag to actually physically make it but we met up afterwards and um you know that kind of thing
4427920	4439600	is um it's incredible you know to me and i think it's a huge tribute to David you know to my late
4439600	4447360	co-author uh i think he had that incredible capacity to take some of these rather obscure
4447360	4453360	topics and concepts and write about them in a way that touched people and made it personal
4454320	4460160	and made them want to engage and and create and in a way i see it all as a kind of extended
4460160	4467280	tribute to him which i've just been a lucky sort of passenger final question just on David if that's
4467280	4476080	possible um David Graeber was your co-author on this book he tweeted in 2020 i believe how
4476080	4482320	he'd finished the manuscript that's right yeah he put out a sort of faux jim Morrison quote yeah
4482320	4487520	my brain is bruised with no surprise we finished something like that yeah and then he passed away
4487520	4492880	a month later yeah about three weeks three weeks after we finished the manuscript so what's it been
4492880	4498560	like to publish a globally best-selling book i mean it's been it's been translated into multiple
4498560	4504160	languages you've worked on it for a decade alongside somebody yeah and then they're not there to share
4504160	4514160	in the success yeah um well you know you have to kind of i have to sort of pinch myself in two
4514160	4519840	senses there's there's the kind of good pinching yourself that the the reception is so extraordinary
4519840	4525440	and you know suggested to me recently by someone who's apparently got some figures that we're you
4525440	4530480	know getting up to a million copies worldwide which is just can't really get your head around it
4531200	4535360	but then there's also the other kind of pinching yourself which is very painful which is you know
4535360	4541200	just constantly having to accept that david's not around to witness any of it um and he was
4541200	4547280	really looking forward to it i mean this book he couldn't wait to get out there and have these kinds
4547280	4552560	of conversations should have been the two of us really sitting here having fun with with you shooting
4552560	4558720	the breeze about all this stuff so it's very painful and very paradoxical and the only thing
4558720	4564160	that i can really hold on to in the middle of it all is that he would definitely want me to be out
4564160	4569760	there working hard talking about the book telling people about the book and just trying to get the
4569760	4576880	work across uh as well as i'm capable of so you're doing it partly for him as well when you go that
4576880	4585680	extra mile yeah yeah 100 yeah david wengrow thanks for joining us my pleasure thank you
