0	3200	Why do we only take things seriously when it's about war?
3200	7520	And this is an important question today given that we have a terrible tragic war happening.
7520	9520	But look what happened even in Germany.
9520	12720	After months saying there was no money and there was a lot of pressure in government
12720	18240	having to cut its budget, 100 billion was found overnight for the war effort.
18240	20800	That happens all the time with war because we take it seriously.
26240	28640	What do management consultants do?
29600	35520	I think it's an important question because this is a global industry worth as much as a trillion
36080	39520	dollars. And yet if you ask somebody like my dad, he drives a taxi for a living,
39520	43520	or as a management consultant, he wouldn't have the faintest idea.
44240	48400	Yet they play an increasingly prominent role in the public sector with extraordinarily large
48400	53360	public contracts, whether it's test and trace or delivering healthcare websites to the United States.
53360	55280	And of course, they're in business too.
56240	62160	A new book by Mariana Matzikato, The Big Con, makes some pretty provocative statements.
62160	66000	It says that actually, consultants don't just undermine democracy,
66000	72160	they lead to less effective government. Mariana Matzikato, welcome to Downstream.
72160	73920	Thank you. I'm very happy to be here.
73920	75200	How are you doing more generally at the moment?
75760	77120	Oh god, you really want to know?
77840	83200	Oh my god, actually fine. I'm thrilled because this week I got to speak a lot with the Prime
83200	87120	Minister of Barbados, Mia Motley, who I think is the hero of the 21st century.
87120	88800	That's true. She's in the UK at the moment, right?
88800	92960	Well, actually, so I was just in Barbados. I was in Barbados two weeks ago working with her,
92960	97680	but she was supposed to be in London this week, but we ended up having her virtually.
97680	101840	She was at the first event we had for this book, the launch event at the RSA.
101840	106000	She was in dialogue with me about why we need not only financial space,
106000	110560	which is what her big global mission is about, but also the kind of fiscal space and state
110560	115680	capacity, which our new book kind of looks at why we don't have that. It was a great conversation.
115680	119520	So your new book, you have many books. They're all very good. I have to say,
119520	123040	actually, this is one of my favourites, the big con.
123040	124560	But you're only halfway through, I can tell.
124560	127920	No, no, no. I've made notes. No, no, no. I finished this last night.
130000	134240	And it's going to sound strange how a book about the consulting industry is quite riveting.
134240	136960	I think pretty people watching this probably won't believe me.
136960	140720	They think I might be trying to flatter you, but it is because there are so many amazing stories.
141520	144960	But let's start from the top. So what are consultants and what do they do?
145920	149680	So first of all, there's different types of consultants. Some are more on the counting side,
149680	153680	some are more on the strategy side. So Deloitte versus McKinsey.
154400	158480	But there's also other types of consultants, which we talk about in the book,
158480	163120	even though we don't focus on them, which have been organizations like Circo and G4S,
163120	167440	where the government has actually decided to outsource a lot of its activities to those
167440	172320	companies. We kind of treat them differently, but they're all part of the same phenomena of
172320	177360	basically the decapacitation, if that's a word. I don't know if that sounds more Italian than
177360	181520	English of government. So what do they do? They consult, they advise.
183040	187680	But we look at it as an industry. This is a very important point. So there's many different types
187680	192720	of consultants. You might have a head teacher of a school who might consult. A nurse could
192720	197600	consult. A doctor could consult. Academics, myself, we could consult. But that's based on
197600	205200	our expertise. It's not actually core to our lives. I might consult based on 20 years of research
205200	209760	in an area. Again, a head teacher might have great knowledge about the schooling system.
209760	216880	We look at a business model of the consulting industry as a sector, which is making lots of
216880	221600	money consulting and where that business model has lots of different problems. It has conflicts of
221600	226720	interest. It has lack of transparency and kind of a veil of secrecy. And especially we look at
227520	232400	its role in, even though it's not its fault, because we look also at governments and we ask,
232400	238560	why do you allow yourself to get captured in some ways by consultants? So easily we look at
238560	243360	the co-evolution between consulting and some of modern problems in capitalism today from
243360	247520	financialization to outsourcing. So you said there's a big sector. Some people watching this
247520	251600	will be familiar with the names, McKinsey, Deloitte, et cetera. How big is it? What kind of numbers
251600	258320	are we talking about? Close to a trillion per year. Wow. Yeah. And also it's rising. So the
258320	263040	subtitle here, turn it around so I can remember what our subtitle is. The big con, how the consulting
263040	267680	industry weakens our businesses and infantilizes our governments and warps our economies. The
267680	275360	infantilizes our governments, but came from a quote by a Tory, so conservative Lord, Lord Agnew,
275360	280720	who during COVID on the back of all the contracts that he was witnessing that the government was
280720	285760	using to bring in consultants, you might remember that Deloitte was charged with the test and trace
285760	292880	system, but also with Brexit, lots of money went to consultants. He said, oh my God, we are infantilizing
293440	301280	Whitehall. In other words, if we keep outsourcing the role of government, we will stop learning.
301280	305760	We will actually become like babies who haven't learned yet. We won't be doing,
305760	309680	so we're not learning by doing. And this is actually something I've been talking about for
309680	314880	decades. So it was very, not surprised, but it was very interesting that it was actually coming
314880	319760	from the conservative side of government because it's not necessarily intuitive that that's where
319760	324000	it would have come from. The numbers here are really impressive in terms of the growth. And
324000	328080	it's something I'm pulling out of the book. This isn't my own personal research. This is so memorable.
328080	332560	It's a fact. When Margaret Thatcher becomes Prime Minister in 1979, the British state is spending
332560	338720	£6 million a year on consultants. When she leaves in 1990, so we're talking 30 years plus,
339280	344880	£246 million. So it's gone up more than 40 times. And it's obviously gone up considerably more than
344880	349680	then. This is hardly shrinking the state, is it? Well, that's what's so interesting. First of all,
350560	355760	you mentioned Thatcher. So that's the bit that might be intuitive. You might think, okay,
355840	360560	a government, a Reaganite government, a Thatcherite government, which is, I don't want to say
360560	365440	anti-state because actually both of them spent a lot on things like war, right? I mean, actually
365440	369920	what Reagan shrunk was the welfare state. My first book, The Entrepreneurial State, I actually looked
369920	376000	at state investment in the US also during the Reagan years actually rising around whether it's
376000	380160	the military industrial complex, but even the National Institutes of Health, which in the
380240	386160	United States spent billions just last year, £42 billion on drug innovation, that happened also
386160	390960	under Ronald Reagan. So we should also just remember that that's sort of been a propaganda
391760	396240	that they put out, but didn't necessarily believe themselves. There was lots of state
396240	400480	investment in both of those governments. It was actually more a war on the welfare state
400480	405120	and really taking away a lot of the social fabric of society, which we've also seen recently in
405120	411280	the UK with austerity for the last 10 years, all the cuts to very, very concrete areas,
411280	415920	whether it's after school clubs, youth centers, mental health, I'm talking about what I just
415920	422560	noticed in my community, let alone the kind of more macroeconomic figures, that's very different
423120	426480	from just saying anti-state, right? Because there was actually lots of investment that
426480	432320	went elsewhere. Anyway, so what's interesting is if you look at kind of a more conservative,
432320	436800	in quotes, neoliberal government, you might intuitively think they want to reduce state
436800	441760	investment and bring in the private sector, both through privatization, but also consultification
441760	447440	of government. So that figure you just mentioned from £6 to £246 million is part of that. But then
447440	452480	there's two questions. One, the one you just said that cost a lot of money. So in terms of actual
452480	457360	expenditure by the state, it didn't necessarily reduce it, but was that really the point of
457360	462640	Thatcher's government? I would argue no. It was actually to dismantle in some ways the ambition
462640	467040	of the state or the structures of the state. And by bringing in consultants, regardless of how
467040	474320	much it costs, and it costs a lot, you are helping to render the state actually in some ways weaker,
474320	478720	at least the structures you might not necessarily care about, you know, health, education, public
478720	484960	transport, again, very different on the military. And yet, one of the things we talk about in the
484960	490560	book is how the real door opened to the consultants actually under new labor. So if you don't really
490560	495760	have a strong idea of what the state is for, you want the state, so it's not the neoliberal idea
495760	501440	of no state, you want the state, but you want it to look efficient and responsible and business
501440	507520	friendly, then ultimately, you bring in business sector metrics into the state apparatus. So
507520	513120	cost-benefit analysis, net present value in the whole idea in economics, which is that at best
513120	518560	the state should fix market failures. So all my work has been saying that that's actually not very
518560	523520	smart. What we actually need for all the problems we have, whether it's climate, health, digital,
523520	529520	is co-creating and co-shaping not just the market, but the economy. Economic growth has not just a
529520	535040	rate, but a direction. The sustainable development goals are 17 of them. That's about directionality,
535040	538240	whether it's about hunger, poverty, climate, the digital divide, health.
538240	539840	Is the UN sustainable development goals?
539840	543440	Yeah, sorry, I always forget that not everyone knows about the SDGs. My kids actually went to
543440	546480	state schools here in London where they sung about the SDGs. Oh, wow, that's progress.
546480	550160	So I think, actually, interestingly, young kids probably know more about the sustainable
550160	555920	development goals than you and me. But yeah, anyway, so the 17 sustainable development goals,
555920	561760	very important, we've had them since 2015, not that long. They require huge ambition,
561760	565520	they require mission, they require collaboration, collective intelligence,
565520	571200	co-investment, so on and so forth. And what my work has been looking at since the entrepreneurial
571200	578480	state is how if we don't have a proper understanding of the state as anything more than fixing
578480	583440	market failures, we will always be too little, too late. We will always be just reacting.
583440	588960	We will at best be filling the gap so that literally even public space will be just the
588960	593920	space that you're allowed to fill up when private space is not there. Think of it even
594000	599040	architecturally in some ways, but really in terms of even public goods and economics,
599040	603360	the word public good sounds good. There's two words, one is good. If you actually look at the
603360	608480	framing of it in economics, it's fixing a market failure problem that occurs when we have positive
608480	613680	externalities. The new labor thing is really interesting for me because obviously they spent
613680	618720	a great deal of money on things like the NHS compared to the Tories, historic amounts of money,
618720	623280	they reduced child poverty, pensioner poverty, so people say, how could you say this? But actually,
623280	627280	when you go into the nuts and bolts of how they did government, so for instance, I find this
627280	632880	fascinating, you talk about this new delivery unit which is created under Tony Blair, which basically
632880	639920	seems to me to be saying tacitly that government should just be done by management consultancy,
639920	643760	or it should be a major part of the state's capacity, and it's not something which is just
643760	648560	bolted on or an afterthought, it's central to how new labor wants to run things.
648560	653840	Yeah, so one of the things I was just talking to Rosie about, she's my co-author, she's actually
653840	658240	one of my PhD students at the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, is that in some
658240	663040	ways you could sum up what you've just said as the fact that new labor had an idea of
663040	668160	private public partnerships, not public private partnerships, right? So a public private partnerships,
668160	672480	I would argue, is what we had with the moon landing. It was a public idea, there was strong
672560	678480	public directionality, but ultimately there was 400,000 people involved, so many different
678480	683920	private sector industries from nutrition, materials, electronics, software, it wasn't just aerospace,
684720	690320	and what government had to do was to redesign all its different tools at the time, especially not
690320	695760	only procurement, so government as purchaser, to catalyze as much bottom-up experimentation
695760	700240	towards that goal, and the goal was getting to the moon and back in a short amount of time.
700240	704240	I would argue that what new labor did was kind of forget, you know, what's the actual mission,
704240	708480	the moonshot around health, around public education, around public transport. If you're
708480	713840	going to bring in the private sector, you better make sure you're very clear what the public goal
713840	718800	is, so you're working together to actually deliver on the moonshot, as opposed to just what we end
718800	724640	up having, which is a lot of private activity in areas that used to be publicly run, and it's not
724640	729040	about saying that's wrong, I think it's actually wrong to say it's about private or nationalization,
729760	733600	kind of in a Corbynite kind of way, I think that's where Corbyn went wrong, it's about
734160	739600	how do you actually organize that partnership, so it's truly about actually doing something
739600	746160	good, purpose-oriented for people. Let's fast forward to Keir Starmer, because this morning
746160	753200	he's talked about missions rather than pledges, now a cynic would say well he's exhausted the
753200	756640	rhetoric of pledges, because of course he's broken so many from his leadership election,
756640	761680	but for somebody like yourself, actually no this is substantially different, this means
761680	768560	something quite different, but reading his missions, crime, decarbonization, they seem quite
768560	773520	sort of ambiguous, is the point of a mission that's actually quite specific and measurable?
773520	778720	So I mean I've had the honor to, I don't want to say be responsible, but for having written
778720	783440	about missions and having actually seen it put into policy, so I first wrote about it,
783440	787440	actually for a long time, but when I first wrote about it where it became policy was 2017
787440	792080	for the European Commission, I said look guys, you're just talking all this talk about climate,
792080	796480	about inclusion, it's not getting us any more inclusive or sustainable, they said what would
796480	800240	a mission-oriented approach look like, and I wrote two reports on the back of which the
800240	806400	European Union now has five missions and a large chunk of the horizon program, which was 90 billion
806400	811040	euros, is now targeted through these missions instrument, so what's a mission at least in
811040	814800	my approach, as you begin with the challenge, we talked about the sustainable development goals,
814800	820560	but they're very broad, right, turning them into moonshots, so SDG Sustainable Development Goal
820560	825440	13, you can turn it into something much more clear that you can actually answer yes or no,
825440	829520	did you achieve it, similar to going to the moon and back in a short amount of time, very clear,
829520	835440	you can answer yes or no, so whether it's net zero in a particular region, whether it's getting all
835440	839920	the plastic out of the ocean if we're looking at SDG 14, but the main thing is to frame it,
839920	845360	so it actually requires investment and innovation across multiple sectors of the economy, because
845360	850560	the old industrial strategy in the UK was very similar to what we've seen globally, which is it
850560	855600	was just a list of sectors, so in the UK under Vince Cable, it was aerospace, automobiles,
855600	859760	the financial sector, the creative industry and finance, don't ask me how I remember that because
859760	863920	I don't remember what I did yesterday, anyway, so the idea of a mission-oriented approach
863920	868560	for industrial strategy would be to say why did you just make up those random five sectors,
868640	873520	did they just lobby their way up, why not think of actually challenges like clean growth,
873520	879360	healthy aging, sustainable mobility and so on, and they get all your different sectors to work
879360	884160	together towards particular missions underneath that, and then again change those tools on the
884160	890640	ground to foster that investment towards that, but that requires knowledge, capacity, implementation
891280	896240	ability to actually then change the current status of like procurement, which is just money
896240	900080	being given from the public sector, the private sector, to be outcomes-oriented,
900080	905040	something by the way that many countries rediscovered with COVID, outcomes-oriented procurement,
905040	909680	it's often a wartime tool, which is interesting, right, wars, people want to win wars, so they
909680	915520	take them seriously, if you look at the public-private partnership in a war, when I've learned this in
915520	919840	the US, when the Ministry of Defense, the Department of Defense funds health, sometimes they do,
919840	924400	because soldiers get sick in the war, they don't get messed about by the pharmaceutical industry
924400	927600	because they want to win the war, they want the soldiers to have access
927600	932160	to medicines that the Ministry of Defense funded. When it's the Ministry of Health,
932160	937200	in normal times, somehow we forget that the prices of the drugs should reflect that public
937200	941600	contribution, that the intellectual property rights should not be abused to just become
941600	946800	extraction tools by the sector and so on, so a missions approach has to lead to change,
946800	951120	it should be a source of discomfort, I often tell ministers and policy makers, if you're
951120	955120	getting really cozy with this idea, and it's just kind of a blah, blah, blah, you obviously don't
955920	959840	understand it, because it should actually create change in how you work with the private sector,
959840	965840	you need conditions attached, for example. In France under COVID, the Finance Minister Bruno
965840	971440	Lemaire put strong conditions on Renault and Air France to get access to the COVID-19
971440	976880	bailout program. Why? Because they had a very clear mission around, or challenge, actually around
976880	982000	clean growth, they had to commit to lowering their carbon emissions to get any public money.
982000	986560	In this country, where we're not used to having that conditionality, EZJet got $600 million,
986560	991520	no conditions attached. So Keir Starmer, if he's interested in missions, has to then immediately
991520	996640	talk about a new social contract with business. Let me stick a pin in this, I actually got a
996640	1000000	question if you're about China now you've said all that, but these are the missions from Keir Starmer.
1000640	1004560	Secure the highest sustained growth in the G7, I mean at least that's measurable, right?
1004560	1010000	But then build an NHS fit for the future, make Britain's streets safe, break down the barriers
1010000	1016480	to opportunity at every stage, make Britain a clean energy superpower. Those last four just seem
1017840	1023440	so ambiguous and the line, you can only manage what you measure. How do you measure progress in
1023440	1027920	any of those things? Or am I being unfair? Are those the kinds of things that you would call
1027920	1031920	missions? I would call those mission areas. So I think it's actually, well, first of all,
1032640	1037680	we should congratulate him for actually even having a strategy for basically looking at those
1037680	1043680	areas as ways that we would redirect an economy. Because now we have a problem with growth, but
1043680	1048480	in general, the problem in the UK was not lack of growth, it was a problematic form of growth.
1048480	1054880	It's a form of growth that is led by consumption, not investment. That consumption is led by private
1054880	1061120	debt, not real incomes have not been rising very much in this country. So there's a lot of
1061200	1066160	credit and private debt in the system to the point that private debt to disposable income
1066160	1070480	in the UK is close to what it was just before the financial crisis. And that's what caused the
1070480	1075280	financial crisis. So you'd think people would be like, oh, problems. Very few people are talking
1075280	1080960	about this. Labor is not talking about it. Neither are the Tories. So the unsustainable level of
1080960	1084480	private debt, which is interesting if you think about it, because we always talk about public debt.
1085840	1090880	So it's very important, I think, to have those mission areas as a way to talk about
1090880	1095680	the need to have investment-led growth, because all those areas are going to require investment.
1095680	1100880	We've also had financialized growth in this country, where a lot of companies are making
1100880	1105040	profits, but not necessarily reinvesting those profits into the economy. So anyway,
1105040	1110640	so as soon as you talk about those bold areas, the question is, what does that then mean for
1110640	1114240	the design of policy? What does it mean for an industrial strategy? What does it mean for
1114240	1119200	procurement strategy? And I think the challenge is, so the first one I would say is not even a
1119200	1124080	mission area. That's just economic growth. And that's going to happen as a result if you get the
1124080	1128720	other stuff right. If you have an innovation policy and industrial strategy that catalyze and
1128720	1133440	excite a lot of different actors, that then invest, collaborate, do those moonshots across
1133440	1138880	different spaces, growth will hopefully result from that, because they all require investment
1138880	1144160	and innovation, which can lead to productivity increases, for example. But the other ones could
1144160	1149520	be mission areas. But the question is, what are they? So keeping streets safe. I mean,
1149520	1153440	this is something that I think is incredibly important, because I've seen how in London,
1153440	1159120	and I just happen to live in London, on the back of all the austerity that we had in this country,
1159120	1165200	the social fabric at the community level was really broken. And so the rise in knife crime,
1165200	1170160	for example. So you could have a mission at the city level, because a lot of these missions might be
1170880	1174960	talked about nationally, but then they have to resonate with communities, where you might have
1176400	1179840	citizen assemblies, you might have different types of democratic for also where
1180640	1184880	people think about those missions. I only say that because I've worked on missions also in Camden,
1184880	1188720	where I live, and we have the Camden Renewal Commission that I co-chair with Georgia Gould,
1188720	1193440	and one of our missions that we thought about for Camden actually did have to do with use safety.
1193440	1197680	And the idea there would be, how do we look at, for example, knife crime, not just from policing,
1198240	1202640	right? So that's the kind of result. But if knife crime is actually the symptom
1203200	1207280	of lots of other problems, think of all the social and economic determinants of crime,
1207280	1212000	where a lot of the both victims, but also the perpetrators often come from broken homes,
1212000	1216320	homes where there's a lot of problems, how can you really think of that problem in a way that
1216320	1221600	bring lots of different branches of government together to think holistically with an all-of-
1221600	1226560	government approach? That's a key factor in a mission-oriented approach. As I just mentioned
1226560	1232080	before, going to the moon was not just aerospace. Solving climate is surely not just for the department
1232080	1237040	of energy. Solving issues around well-being is definitely not just for the Department of Health.
1237040	1240880	So it's not just about intersectoral that I talked about before. It's really that
1240880	1244960	all-of-government approach. And that really then helps government become more dynamic,
1244960	1248480	and that comes back to the book, because what we say in the book is that we don't have dynamic
1248480	1252880	governments. We often have rigid, siloed governments, governments that have stopped
1252880	1258080	in sourcing the capacity and capability they need to govern modern-day complex challenges with
1258080	1263200	other actors. And if you have consulted that capacity, if you're asking Deloitte to do your
1263200	1268800	test and trace, where Deloitte had no expertise whatsoever on test and trace, so it's not surprising
1268800	1273280	it went belly up, then you have a problem, because you stop learning by doing. You've stopped the
1273280	1277760	doing. How do they get these jobs? Because like you say, Deloitte had no, I mean nobody had any
1277760	1282320	expertise in test and trace. Maybe a few countries in East Asia after the SARS epidemic.
1282320	1290080	But so they've got no technical expertise in whole swathes of what they make money from.
1290080	1294160	So what's their pitch? We've got no experience. Give us a multi-billion-pound contract.
1294160	1299200	Well, I mean it just, I'm going to answer that question, but just to almost play,
1299200	1303280	not devil's advocate, but just to put another thing on the table. At the same time that Deloitte
1303280	1311280	did test and trace, which went very badly in the UK, the NHS did the vaccine roll out through a
1311280	1316480	decentralized network of GP practices, and not only went well, it also became something
1316480	1321200	we talked about. The politicians talked about it successful. So then the real question is,
1321200	1326960	why didn't they invest more in this decentralized network of GP practices? Why did we not actually
1326960	1332400	wake up and say, wow, what a great success story, and let's actually increase the investments
1332400	1337040	within the NHS instead of doing what we're seeing today, which is that the real investments
1338000	1342800	are not only not increasing, but there's a lot of stress within the system. We have junior doctors
1342800	1348480	on strike, nurses on strike all over the UK. So this is also a very interesting question,
1349120	1355360	because it's the parallel of the question you've asked. Now, what we look at is, why are we hiring?
1355360	1360240	It's your question. Consultants in areas that they have no expertise in. We saw this also in
1360240	1366160	Australia, where they spent over six million on McKinsey to do their climate strategy, and it was
1366160	1370800	then reported to be a very faulty, problematic climate strategy. And the question there that we
1370800	1374480	posed in the book is, well, there was also expertise within the government. It wasn't
1374480	1380000	perfect expertise, but they have this organization called CSIRO, which actually has a lot of climate
1380000	1385840	capabilities. So what is this kind of almost allergy to using not only your internal expertise,
1385840	1390480	but not to actually invest in that expertise and just need that rubber stamp? Because that's what
1391360	1396960	ultimately it is, a rubber stamp of McKinsey or Deloitte that makes both governments and businesses,
1397600	1403680	one of the subtitles is weakens our businesses. Why is that? And we look at two different issues.
1403680	1411120	One is that this dismantling of state capacity has also led to gaps where sometimes literally
1411120	1415840	even just numbers of people don't exist. I experienced this with the COVID-19 recovery in
1415840	1422000	Italy, where the Treasury basically outsourced the recovery to, I keep talking about McKinsey,
1422000	1425920	but there's lots of these consulting companies. It's BCG, Bain, Pricewaterhouse, Cooper's and
1425920	1431440	so on. BCG's Boston Consulting Group. Yeah, Boston Consulting Group. And so one thing is that as a
1431440	1436000	consequence of not just the austerity, but the dismantling of state capacity, there often is
1436000	1440800	the need to bring in others to help you out. But when those others don't have the expertise,
1440800	1444080	that's the real kind of interesting challenge. Because of course, there's lots of expertise
1444080	1447760	in universities, for example. And I'm not just saying this because I'm an academic, but I know
1447760	1452320	some top climate experts around the world, like at the Potsdam Institute in Germany,
1452320	1457360	they have amazing climate science. That would be a more natural place to go to for climate
1457360	1463280	expertise. But the rubber stamp of the consulting companies is something that is looked upon as
1463280	1470640	justifying as making good a government that is fearful, especially on the back of so much
1470640	1475040	kind of government bashing, that somehow there isn't that expertise inside government.
1477040	1482400	And also sometimes to make uncomfortable decisions. So this is also something that we don't blame
1482400	1487120	consultants. We say that both with businesses and government, sometimes letting someone else,
1487120	1492000	not so much take the blame, but have their kind of brand on it, allows you to maybe do some
1492000	1496880	controversial activities in the private sector. We look, for example, at the downsizing trend,
1496880	1503920	the financialization trend, by saying, oh, it was recommended by or rubber stamped by a consulting
1503920	1510640	company, it might go down the throat easier. And so in that case, we say government, sorry,
1510640	1514480	businesses should actually own up to the decisions they're made, as opposed to just
1514480	1519120	requiring that rubber stamp of the consulting company. But also there's a risk averseness,
1519120	1523360	there's a fear of making mistakes. And what's interesting, I've talked about this in other
1523360	1528320	books, that whereas we celebrate risk taking and making mistakes in the private sector,
1528320	1532960	as soon as a civil servant makes a mistake, bang front page of the Daily Mail, in this country,
1532960	1536640	there's other, actually, there's not that many tabloids around the world, this country has a
1537920	1543600	tabloid industry. That's about it, right? Sorry? Built in Germany. Exactly. New York Posts.
1543600	1548800	Yeah, I mean, there are, but it's just incredible here, just the power they have. We've learned it
1548800	1556320	in the recent Harry and Meghan discussions. But it's not just the tabloids, it's public
1556320	1562080	servants, civil servants are not allowed to make mistakes, which is a problem. This is something
1562080	1567440	we talk about. Trial and error and error, you would not learn how to ride a bike if you did not
1567440	1574480	fall off. So the fact that governments, part of the consequence of outsourcing, privatizing,
1574480	1580880	of consultifying is, in fact, what Lord Agnew, the conservative Lord who made this accusation,
1580880	1586080	you know, that Whitehall was getting infantilized. Infantilized means you're kind of becoming a
1586080	1592160	baby, you're not learning, you're not growing up, you're still an infant. And this was a Tory Lord
1592160	1598160	saying Whitehall was being infantilized. And so, you know, this is one of the biggest problems that
1598160	1602880	even though you might be doing it out of fear, because you'd prefer someone else to be taking
1602880	1607360	the risk so you don't get blamed when things go wrong, you ultimately will get addicted.
1607360	1612960	You will require that help constantly, right? Because you're not growing up,
1612960	1617520	you're not building that capacity. And this is one of the things we talk about. We say that,
1617520	1621520	you know, the reason, the sector, because it's the consulting industry that we
1621520	1626720	kind of focus on, not just consultants, it's problematic is that the business model itself
1626720	1632880	kind of relies on that next contract following. Whereas if you're a really good therapist,
1632880	1636000	for example, you don't want your client to be in therapy their whole life, that probably means
1636000	1640080	you're a bad therapist. The principal agent problem. Exactly. Exactly. Could you explain
1640080	1644160	this quickly, the principal agent problem? Well, it's just about incentives. I mean,
1644160	1647600	if, you know, I mean, the principal agent problem can be applied to different types of
1647600	1654080	problems. But in this case, it's that if there is, we would call it asymmetric information in
1654080	1660160	terms of a market failure, then the agent that you are, if you want, you know, consulting for
1660160	1665040	doesn't necessarily have knowledge about, you know, the contract in this case. And in fact,
1665040	1668720	this is one of the things we talk about, which is that there is a veil of secrecy and lack of
1668720	1674240	transparency in the contract. So in South Africa, for example, you might have, what we have had,
1674240	1679600	consultants who the same consultant is advising SCOM, which is a state-owned energy company.
1679600	1683360	And it's also advising the Ministry of Finance, which in theory is regulating
1684080	1688640	SCOM, right? So you can't be on both sides of the street. And if you are, that better be very
1688640	1693600	transparent and known to the government. And so one of the, you know, this kind of conflict of
1693600	1699440	interest. Was that legal? Well, that's what's really striking, actually, that it's legal.
1699440	1704720	And we talk about all the different consultants who are both advising the fossil fuel industry,
1704720	1709920	while at the same time advising on ESG metrics, right? As though it's all fine and the same.
1709920	1714800	Of course, it's not. You can't be helping and actually in some ways fostering a fossil fuel
1714800	1720560	industry to be increasingly successful in making record-level profits today, while, you know,
1720560	1725040	on the other side of the street pretending that you're an expert around environmental and social
1725040	1730320	governance metrics, which is all about companies actually becoming greener or societal, you know,
1730800	1735120	more good for society. There's lots of amazing stories in the book. And like I said at the
1735120	1741680	top, that's why it's really riveting these case studies of failure. But one of the more dazzling
1741680	1747120	ones is the story of healthcare.gov, of course tied up with ObamaCare. Can you tell us a little
1747120	1752640	bit about healthcare.gov, why it failed, and what that has to do with consultants?
1752640	1756880	Sure. I mean, it's actually part of a much bigger problem because one of the capabilities we say
1756880	1761360	that has been decimated within governments is actually their ability to govern digital platforms.
1762560	1768400	And one of the areas by consequence that is increasingly consultified, so consultants are
1768400	1773600	being brought into, has to do with precisely that area, the kind of, let's just call it,
1773600	1781840	the digital area of government. Now, this is not a small problem in 21st century, 22nd century
1781840	1787200	soon. Capitalism, if you don't know how to govern digital platforms, you won't be able to have a
1787200	1792240	climate strategy, a health strategy. Think of the infodemic side of COVID-19. In fact, I did a
1792240	1796800	report on which countries globally did better in COVID-19. It actually was countries that actually
1796800	1801920	had invested in areas including digital platforms because of that very important information,
1802480	1806320	processing side of things, including by the way, Test and Trace, which we touched on before.
1806320	1812400	So healthcare.gov, of course, is famous because the U.S. government, as we know, doesn't really
1812400	1817520	have a public health program. A lot of people in the U.S. die actually not because they're sick,
1817520	1822080	but because they can't afford healthcare. This is one of the reasons I'm very proud to live in
1822080	1829200	Europe. The NHS in the U.K. is very important in terms of giving everyone access to healthcare.
1829920	1837360	Now, the problem is that what was also called Obamacare, so Obama finally gets through a program
1837360	1843520	which, by the way, Hillary Clinton had tried to get through when her husband was president,
1843520	1853760	it had a web site where people could access in order to sign up for healthcare in the U.S. from
1853760	1861440	the Obamacare program, and as soon as it opened up, it basically crashed and government was blamed,
1861440	1867920	but actually it wasn't government that had governed it, it had been outsourced, it had been
1867920	1874720	outsourced to private actors, and this is a huge problem, first of all, because it's central,
1874720	1879680	like how you actually govern the digital side of a program, whether it's health or climate,
1880640	1885760	so if you are outsourcing your core, that's a problem. If you're outsourcing something that's
1885760	1894640	peripheral, perhaps it doesn't matter, catering or something. This is actually not just around
1894640	1900560	health, as I just mentioned. If you look at the weakening of government, it's precisely around
1900560	1904320	those kind of areas, and so unless they're investing in their own digital capacity,
1904320	1909280	they won't be stronger and they will become increasingly needing to have others to come
1909600	1913520	in, but in that particular case, also, those that had been brought in to do the digital side
1913520	1919680	weren't very capable. It costs $1.7 billion. $1.7 billion for a website is just extraordinary,
1919680	1924960	and on the first day of opening, six people could use it. People, like you say, blamed the state,
1925600	1927520	but they should have been blaming management consultancies.
1929600	1935200	Yeah, I mean, that's again the irony, because I just mentioned before that part of the answer to why
1935200	1941360	governments are allowing consultants to have so much power is the risk, the kind of worry
1941360	1946720	of getting things wrong and thinking that somehow management consultant will not only bring in maybe
1946720	1951200	some expertise, which as I just mentioned often, we don't have, but also get the blame if things
1951200	1955200	go wrong, and yet things continue to go wrong and they're not actually held accountable.
1955200	1961360	So even how those contracts are designed, they've actually kind of become almost risk-free for the
1961360	1966400	consultants, and so it's not only costing government a lot of money. In theory, they're
1966400	1972480	sometimes pitching it as though it's going to help them cost less, so reduce deficits by letting
1972480	1978000	others undertake public programs. So we have kind of three different problems. It's costing a lot
1978000	1982000	of money. It's actually not delivering, and when things go belly up, the blame comes back to
1982000	1988960	government. So it's actually a toxic cocktail, and you'd think that it would be better known how
1988960	1993280	problematic this is. And I think one of the things we were kind of pleasantly surprised,
1993280	1999120	but not so surprised, is just how much the book has spoken to people both in the business community
1999120	2005520	and government communities at different level, city, local, regional, national, global, precisely
2005520	2011520	because it's almost scandalous at every level. I must say though that we're not there to blame
2011520	2016320	consultants. In fact, we spoke to many different consultants, especially young kind of 30-year-old
2016320	2022000	consultants who go into the industry also wanting to do good. This isn't a book about the bad guys
2022000	2030720	trying to do terrible things around the world, and they are disillusioned when you see that kind
2030720	2036720	of operating on both sides of the street or the not hypocrisy, but that kind of treating any of
2036720	2042160	the latest trends, whether it's ESG and climate or shareholder value maximization on kind of the
2042160	2047200	other extreme in terms of problematic tendencies and modern-day corporate governance is almost
2047920	2052800	equally available places to kind of leech onto to provide your consulting services,
2052800	2057040	you start to lose faith that this is actually really about making the world a better place.
2057840	2064400	We do make some specific recommendations at the end because it's not enough just to complain and
2064400	2070000	to kind of denounce, and we talk about the need to make contracts much more transparent, precisely
2070000	2074160	on all the different types of areas that you're consulting in so you can see those conflicts of
2074160	2079280	interest, making contracts so they actually embed learning precisely so you don't have those kind
2079280	2084080	of repeat contracts so that you actually show that you're cumulatively adding value so the
2084080	2089760	organization in question ultimately shouldn't need you. That example I gave from therapy before,
2089760	2093120	if you have someone in therapy their entire life, you're probably not doing your job very well,
2094880	2099920	and I think if you look at all the different problems we have globally, they do require
2099920	2104240	lots of different actors where the consultants might have a role, but first of all we need to
2104240	2108480	make sure they actually have expertise in that area so we should definitely become much more aware
2109120	2114080	where those areas of expertise lie, but also how do we make sure the ecosystem between these
2114080	2118000	different actors is truly kind of a symbiotic mutualistic one and not a parasitic one?
2118640	2122960	Consultancy is one of those things where I mean I I'd obviously heard of it before I graduated,
2123680	2127520	I'll start that again. Consultancy is a strange one because I'd heard of the term before I
2127520	2133040	graduated, I graduated in 2007, bad luck, so it was a really interesting year because at the
2133040	2136960	start of the year as an undergraduate everybody you know all you could hear at University College
2136960	2143840	London where you teach, McKinsey, Deloitte, Macquarie, HSBC, Banco Santander, everybody had an internship
2143840	2148320	with a bank or a consultancy and then within a year it dropped like a lead balloon so it was
2148320	2154560	really fascinating to see that, but if I said to my dad as a graduate, oh I've got a job as a
2154560	2159760	consultant, he would say what the hell is that? What do you do? I mean he thinks that anyway
2159760	2165120	actually with Navarra Media, but it's one of those things where I had a pet theory which is
2166320	2173520	particularly in Anglo-America since the late 1990s we have a massive overproduction of very clever
2173520	2178320	generalist graduate students, humanities in particular but also you know in the sciences
2178320	2181600	and they don't really know what they're going to do, they're sort of aimless, very ambitious,
2182160	2187520	very conscientious people and it seems to me lots of those people gravitated towards
2188080	2192560	consultancy as a job and it almost seems to me and obviously I don't think you've written that
2192560	2198080	in the book, it almost strikes me as a shame because having this concentration of people that
2198080	2203440	want to do problem solving, highly competent, it seems like a massive misallocation of human
2203440	2207760	resources basically. But we do talk about that in the book, we say wouldn't it be great if all this
2208640	2212720	desire to do good in the world actually also resulted in more of these young
2212720	2216880	people going into government and we also talk about this self-fulfilling prophecy that the
2216880	2221840	more we've had this kind of backlash against government, what Tony Jutt in his book, Ill
2221840	2227040	Ferris the Land, calls a discursive battle like literally just talking about administration instead
2227040	2231520	of kind of like a ministry out there trying to do really difficult things or what I've talked about
2231680	2238480	market fixing, not market shaping, de-risking, not taking risks, simply enabling, redistributing
2238480	2242560	and regulating instead of being a true value creator. It's not actually a coincidence that it
2242560	2247360	becomes much more sexy to go into the McKinsey's, the Macquarie's even though I have a whole
2247360	2252240	theory about Macquarie anyway, but the Goldman Sachs isn't the Googles, right? So there is that
2252240	2256080	self-fulfilling prophecy and it's not a surprise I've actually taken the time to set up a whole
2256080	2260720	institute for innovation and public purpose at UCL which is all about rethinking the state,
2261360	2267200	bringing purpose to the center of policy making, but also really having a theory of value creation
2267200	2271280	with the state at the center, not to say the state is more important than any other actor,
2271280	2275680	but it's very, it's important in terms of leading at least in democratically elected
2275680	2280160	societies and then using all the tools that has to bring together that kind of stakeholder value,
2280160	2285360	lots of different actors to solve really complex problems, drive collective intelligence,
2285360	2289200	the sexy word, but that needs to be embedded in the contracts. You can't have collective
2289200	2293360	intelligence if again intellectual property rights are abused. They're currently too wide,
2293360	2299440	too strong, too upstream and yet an intellectual property right is a contract that for 17 years,
2299440	2304240	the state has given to the private sector. So you need to govern that in the public interest
2305280	2309600	and the capacity to do so I think has withered away to govern those particular contracts,
2309600	2314160	but any contract whether it's a procurement contract or an intellectual property right
2314160	2318400	should have the public interest at the center because that's the point of government. It's not
2318400	2322480	just to help companies make profits. Do you think there's been a cultural shift as well,
2322480	2326960	which is the fault here? So I'm a materialist, you have a materialist explanation for all this
2326960	2333360	happening, but as an ancillary point, if you're an ambitious young person in the 50s, 60s and you
2333360	2336960	want to change the world, you'd go work for a big government ministry and you would say,
2336960	2344240	I want to go work for the department of X or I want to go work for NASA. And after the 60s,
2344560	2349040	there's this idea that actually particularly progressives thought, oh, if you want to change
2349040	2353760	the world, you need to be like Jane Jacobs or you need to be like Ralph Nader. You need to be on the
2353760	2358560	outside, right? You need to be lobbying. You need to be lobbying and you need to be this active
2358560	2362960	interest representation, but not institutional power. Do you think there was a kind of
2364640	2369920	a big social error? Actually, all of a sudden, tons of talented people stopped going into
2369920	2373520	precisely institutions when we need them to be? I don't know. I mean, first of all,
2373520	2377280	I don't want to exaggerate the point about the people who are working in government. I mean,
2377280	2381360	I work with governments globally, including in the UK, and it's full of incredibly,
2381360	2385440	not only smart, but people really with ethics at the center, they go into government because
2385440	2389600	they're interested in, you know, to put it simply, making the world a better place.
2389600	2395520	I think what's happened though is that there's so much backlash on government. There's such a
2395520	2399440	cartoon image, you know, I talk about this in the entrepreneurial state, like the kind of
2399440	2405280	Kafkaian bureaucrat and then the cool, you know, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk today, that actually,
2405280	2409360	what we've seen is also a hemorrhaging of that talent. I mean, so in other words, it's been a
2409360	2416960	much more explicit, intentional problem than sort of what you just described. Also, in the 1960s,
2416960	2421040	I learned this when I was running Mission Economy, the average age in the mission control room for
2421040	2428160	Apollo was 26. So crazy. Very, very young, average age. There was younger people. And yet,
2428160	2432400	at that time already, a lot of this outsourcing was happening to the consultants, literally,
2432400	2437360	actually to McKinsey. In that particular case, McKinsey began in the mid-20s. And the head of
2437360	2442800	procurement for NASA, this guy, Ernest Brackett, said, if we continue this, we won't even, you know,
2442800	2446400	not only won't we know how to get to the moon, but we won't even know how to write
2446400	2449920	the contracts with the private sector because they were working with lots of private sector
2449920	2456560	companies. And his quote was, we will get captured by brochuremanship. It's endearing because they
2456560	2460480	didn't really have PowerPoints at the time that these consultants have today. They had
2460480	2466400	sexy brochures. So the idea that you would get captured by the brochure was not to say, oh,
2466400	2469440	we don't want to work at the private sector. It was more like, we won't know which private
2469440	2472400	sector companies to work with. And I would actually argue that's what we have today.
2472960	2480000	We have, definitely, if you look at the contracts, we have a very unbalanced power in terms of even
2480000	2485040	the legal expertise. But the problem is not that there's not enough public or private investment,
2485040	2490000	is that partnership is not, it's not a dynamic one. It's not purpose-oriented. It's not fair.
2490000	2495200	It's not just. There's often, again, socialization of risk, privatization of rewards. And you can
2495200	2500880	fix that in the contracts. NASA actually had a clause in its contracts, no excess profits.
2500880	2505200	It's great. Not no profits. You don't get to the moon with philanthropy, charity. Of course,
2505200	2510400	you can make profits, but not excess. In excess of what? Of what you've done. So as soon as you
2510400	2515280	have a whole kind of narrative and discourse that all the value is getting created in the private
2515280	2520640	sector and the state is just there to facilitate, enable, work on the sides, then it's much easier
2520640	2525440	to get these very problematic contracts that socialize risks and privatize rewards and allow
2525440	2529920	excess profits to be earned by some who are doing good stuff, but not everything.
2530720	2535680	So somebody watching this from the left might think, oh, this is just social democracy, very
2535680	2540480	vanilla. I actually think you understate your radicalism. I think it's very radical.
2540480	2543440	Well, no, because that's why people don't like this, by the way. I got a lot of hate.
2544320	2547840	The whole thing about not private-public partnership, but public-private partnership,
2547840	2552880	and you might not agree with this, I think in some ways is reminiscent of the better
2552880	2557680	features of the Chinese system, because there was a great talk by Eric X. Lee, who talks about
2557680	2564240	the Chinese Communist Party. And he made a point on a separate interview, and he said,
2564240	2569760	China has a market economy. We have private firms that try and make profit. He says the
2569760	2574560	point is the interest of those firms, the interest of capital more generally to make profits,
2574560	2579120	does not supersede political authority. Political authority always supersede, and obviously that
2579120	2583760	has bad expressions of manifestations. But the point is political authority always supersedes
2583760	2589200	the private interests of businesses or capital. And that's basically what you're saying, isn't
2589200	2592400	it? This idea that political authority, democratically accountable.
2592400	2597200	Yeah, because it's a democratically accountable thing in terms of not being a China fan.
2597200	2602320	But the same theme is there, right? That political authority, with that accountability
2602320	2607280	from people and the mandate from people, sets the agenda around, like you say, particular missions.
2608160	2611520	And that supersedes the interest of capital. That's hugely radical, isn't it?
2611520	2615120	So I once gave an interview, actually. I can't remember. I think it was to the Financial Times
2615120	2618880	where I said that China is learning from the United States at the same time that the United
2618880	2624480	States is unlearning from itself. So again, everything that's smart in our smartphones
2624480	2628080	and not stupid was actually invested in by government, mission-oriented government,
2628080	2632880	the internet, GPS, touchscreen, and Siri, all fruits of government investments.
2633600	2638800	In some cases with private sector collaboration, but it was actually through a public sector
2638800	2643520	problem that was required. So the internet came about because we needed the satellites to communicate,
2644880	2650560	GPS, the Navy invested in it to know where all the ships were in the seas. So it's not actually,
2650560	2655600	I mean, today it feels more like maybe a Chinese or kind of a top-down planning system. But that's
2655600	2661280	actually how the United States developed. They talk Jefferson, but act Hamilton. People should
2661280	2666080	only understand that because now the Hamilton musical. But basically, Hamilton was a very
2666080	2670800	important US politician who at the time advocated for an industrial strategy whereas Jefferson was
2670800	2676320	more free marketeer. The US has always talked the talk of the free market, but acted actually on a
2676320	2683440	much more visible hand, not the invisible hand. Where I think, so the work on missions coming back
2683440	2689360	to here is a speech this morning is all about that. In other words, or it should be about that.
2689360	2693840	I mean, he's using the word. I'm very curious to know and perhaps work with them on actually
2693840	2700720	making this real, the how. The how is harder than just the word. It's all about actually having a
2700720	2705040	plan that's really difficult. Remember Kennedy said, we're going to the moon because it's hard,
2705040	2709920	not because it's easy. So this isn't about one side facilitating. I'm Italian, facilitating
2709920	2714320	means making something easier for someone else, like the word de-risking. So it's not about making
2714320	2718960	it easier de-risking someone else. It's about tackling those really difficult challenges
2718960	2724960	together. Now that requires a goal. That's going to be the end goal, but the how along the way
2724960	2729600	really matters. How you design the financial institution with conditionality. You're not just
2729600	2734080	giving out money. It's conditional on change happening within different sectors. You don't do
2734080	2738000	it top down and tell them what to do because that could hurt innovation, but you do it with a strong
2738000	2742800	direction. That's that public-private versus private-public bit that we talked about before.
2742800	2747040	It means learning how to do, again, outcomes-oriented budgeting. So you're not just giving a bit of
2747040	2751280	money here and there, but you actually have a goal where the budget itself, even at the city
2751280	2755440	level, zero knife crime requires its own budget. You can't just give a bit of money here, a bit of
2755440	2762320	money there, and then stir the soup and hope for the best. So I think what's interesting in China,
2762320	2767120	though, is that they obviously have very clear targets. They had such high poverty that they
2767120	2772000	really alleviated a lot of people out of poverty. They also are spending a huge amount on greening
2772000	2776720	their entire manufacturing base because they have a huge pollution problem. So they don't
2776720	2781040	have that myth of, oh, this is just going to happen through the free market. One of their
2781040	2784640	problems, though, is they don't really have what I talk about in the entrepreneurial state,
2784640	2789200	a decentralized network of different types of public actors. They have very large, for example,
2789200	2794400	the Chinese Development Bank, which gave huge amounts of money to Huawei. Huawei would not exist
2794400	2799680	without a guaranteed loan that was over $5 billion from the Chinese Development Bank.
2799680	2804880	By the way, Elon Musk got over $5 billion from the US government for his different companies,
2804880	2809120	including in the early stage of Tesla. It was a guaranteed loan from government.
2810640	2816640	But in China, you have just these big chunks of money from institutions like the Chinese
2816640	2821440	Development Bank. In the US, they had DARPA, the National Science Foundation, the Small
2821440	2828080	Business Innovation Research Program, the Venture Capital Arm of the CIA, Incutel. But it has,
2828080	2831760	at least in the US, been more around their military industrial complex. And what I've been arguing
2831760	2836240	for is, why do we only take things seriously when it's about war? And this is an important
2836240	2840320	question today, given that we have a terrible tragic war happening. But look what happened
2840320	2844720	even in Germany. After months saying there was no money and there was a lot of pressure in government
2844720	2850800	having to cut its budget, $100 billion was found overnight for the war effort. That happens all
2850800	2856960	the time with war, because we take it seriously. And I'm very anti-war, at any war, but isn't it
2856960	2860720	interesting that for war money comes out of the woodwork? Why doesn't it come out of the woodwork
2860720	2865280	when we have war on poverty, when we want to strengthen our health systems, when we want net
2865280	2870880	zero targets, when we have these social problems in our streets? So really, what I've been talking
2870880	2875760	about for a long time is the need to create a mission-oriented economy around our social
2875760	2880480	challenges, starting with the SDGs that we talked about. And with this book, the big con
2880480	2886160	talks about is that that requires capacity. And if we continue to consultify that capacity,
2886160	2891040	you won't know how to implement. You won't know how to work with others. And that's important,
2891040	2895760	because I sometimes get accused as being just kind of folklorically loving the state. I'm like,
2895760	2899840	no, I'm the state's kind of, I don't want to say biggest enemy, but biggest provocateur saying,
2899840	2906800	what are you doing? You can't become agile, flexible, capable, and creative unless you
2906800	2910640	actually invest internally in becoming a learning organization.
2911200	2912240	You said you have haters.
2912880	2914000	Well, who are they?
2914000	2916560	Oh, God. I find them very hard to believe.
2916560	2923360	If you're a woman, if you are progressive, if you're lucky enough to actually get media attention,
2923360	2930240	but especially, this is the big bit, have impact. So different governments or even businesses
2930240	2935840	start to implement some of your ideas. Are you dangerous? If you're just ranting and no one's
2935840	2941360	listening, you're less dangerous. So I think when your ideas start to have impact, and I feel very
2941360	2945680	honored because I'm not the only one who has some good ideas, I feel honored that I've had the
2945680	2950000	opportunity to work with governments carefully, because it's not just about going to lecture,
2950000	2954640	doing a TED Talk, and then leaving. Again, that's why I set up a whole institute to take care,
2954640	2959760	have teams that help governments implement new policies, but also train, because that's the
2959760	2965120	main thing we do. We have an educational program. You are much more dangerous to those who
2965680	2971040	would love to see the state less able, less, not so much large, because I've never been about large
2971040	2978480	versus small state, but a more capable state, a state that is truly purpose-oriented,
2978480	2984800	a state that knows how to get a good deal in a contract is not great news for those who are
2984800	2988400	making either a lot of money or having a lot of power by having a weak state.
2988400	2992320	So do you think that some of the people you take target on this book, and I know you've said
2992320	2997680	already, many good consultants, and you can see the role for certain services not being
2997680	3002880	within a firm or inside a public agency, Navarra Media has an accountant. We don't have an accountant
3002880	3005600	inside the organization. That's something that somebody else does, for instance.
3006880	3008480	Is accounting your core business?
3008480	3010400	Precisely, right. That's exactly why I would.
3010400	3011360	Yeah, exactly.
3011360	3016400	Is governing a digital platform, a core business of a government in order to make sure that the
3016400	3020400	next pandemic, it can actually deal with the infodemic side of the crisis, of course.
3021120	3024880	This is a trillion-dollar industry, though. So, like you say, you putting this in the
3024880	3029760	crosshairs, and you are an influential person, that must put a mark on your back a little bit
3029760	3033600	with some of these people. I mean, I've read the write-up in the Financial Times, for instance,
3033600	3037440	perfectly civilized and polite, but there was clearly an undercurrent, which is,
3037440	3039280	don't make too much noise about this industry.
3039280	3041360	Oh, really? I haven't read that. Have you not read it?
3041360	3043760	Have they made threats? They're going to come and knock on the door?
3043760	3047760	Not threats. Not threats, but there's huge vested interest, basically.
3047760	3048400	Of course.
3048480	3048960	Oh, no, of course.
3048960	3049760	Not having this conversation.
3049760	3052000	Yeah, I thought that was actually quite funny, to be honest. I mean,
3052000	3056880	the comments that were so defensive, and then all you had to read was the comments that came
3056880	3062480	afterwards by others. I mean, I almost didn't have to reply. I think the fact that we purposefully,
3062480	3068560	we say this several times in the book, that this is just as much a challenge to those that are
3068560	3074720	hiring and that have stopped investing within their own capacity as it is to those that are
3074720	3079040	making a lot of money by profiting from those that don't have that capacity.
3079040	3082320	It's really a wake-up call to everyone, because I truly believe that in the long run,
3082880	3087520	we all will benefit. The planet will benefit, the sustainability of the planet,
3087520	3091680	but also all these problems we have around inequality will benefit if we actually have
3091680	3093440	more capable actors all around.
3094320	3097200	Mariana, thank you so much for joining us this evening.
3097200	3097600	Thank you.
3098400	3099520	It's a great book.
3099520	3100000	Thanks so much.
3100000	3102640	Congratulations.
3104720	3106640	Thank you.
