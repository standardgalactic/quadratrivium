0	5200	Governments like the UK's but also elsewhere in the world are granting new oil and gas
5200	7200	exploration licenses willy-nilly.
7200	11680	So of course the BP's and the Shell's having been talking quite a good game a few years
11680	15560	ago about transitioning and now are like, why did we bother with that?
15560	18440	Governments aren't serious about this at all.
18440	28200	Over recent decades, the price of energy coming from wind or solar has collapsed.
28200	32800	The same is also true by the way for energy storage with lithium batteries, that's why
32800	37400	increasingly we see things like electric vehicles because the economics of these things add
37400	38400	up.
38400	44080	Now for the optimists out there, they say that these falls in price for renewable technologies
44080	49800	are brilliant, they're all we need and they are the panacea in terms of addressing the
49800	57080	climate crisis and yet at the very same time we have seen the percentage of energy coming
57080	62480	from non-fossil fuel sources remaining broadly the same.
62480	68240	So what explains this strange contradiction, falling prices and yet we're not decarbonising
68240	70560	particularly quickly?
70560	76200	Today's guest has a pretty interesting hypothesis regarding all of that, he says we should not
76200	85240	be focusing on prices but profits and simply put renewable energy isn't that profitable.
86240	87400	Welcome to Downstream.
87400	89440	Thanks for having me or thanks for having me back.
89440	94520	Well I'm glad you said that because I had a few colleagues in video, they were a bit
94520	98560	suspicious when I said we're going to talk to somebody about asset management, it's
98560	102920	going to do really well, everybody wants to hear about it and they just didn't believe
102920	106000	me but it ended up getting a quarter of a million views and counting.
106000	107240	Amazing, amazing.
107240	108240	Great book.
108240	109240	Thank you.
109240	111480	Asset management is also just something that I think people are picking up on.
111480	113040	They are, absolutely they are.
113120	115960	Yeah it's more and more in the news and it's not going to go away.
115960	116960	Sadly.
116960	118960	No, exactly.
118960	120520	But we're talking about a different book today.
120520	122520	We are but it's not unrelated.
122520	123520	It's not unrelated.
123520	124520	That's good.
124520	129520	It's a very technical book, don't know if I'll put you off.
129520	134400	The price is wrong why capitalism won't save the planet.
134400	137760	I find it interesting because there's a bit of a distance between like I said very technical
137760	141000	book which is very good because you're really getting to the heart of really important arguments
141080	143280	as we will over the next hour as well.
143280	149120	But then that is like a very populist broad statement why capitalism won't save the planet.
149120	154160	We will get onto that in a moment because lots of people say it can but I want to start
154160	155160	with the basics.
155160	156160	Yes.
156160	157720	Is net zero bullshit?
157720	162720	Wow, what a question to start with.
162720	163720	I don't know.
163720	172240	I think that we are heading in our kind of muddled, convoluted, messy, insufficient way
172240	180120	in that direction globally albeit at very, very different rates in different places and
180120	188200	with varying degrees of likelihood of getting somewhere close to it eventually but we'll
188200	192320	get close to it if not there eventually.
192320	195840	Of course the question is what is net zero?
195840	201920	What is because net zero is not absolute zero it means you reduce carbon and other greenhouse
201920	210920	gas emissions but you do other stuff to compensate for that in various ways and I think the best
210920	217120	answer I have to that question is that to me the most interesting thing about net zero
217120	226920	is how we are consistently moving away from aspirations of real zero and so if you look
226920	227920	for example-
227920	229680	So real zero and net zero not the same?
229680	233360	No, because real zero is no emissions essentially.
233360	237880	Net zero is you still have emissions but you do other things like sucking carbon out of
237880	243160	the atmosphere or whatever else it might be to offset that and the thing is if you look
243160	251880	at the reports that get produced by the IPCC the international panel on climate change
251880	258720	over time the reports that they produce on kind of their kind of core scenarios of where
258720	265560	they think we are heading and kind of hopefully should be heading they have gradually gravitated
265560	274280	away from essentially real zero aspirations and so with each iteration they basically
274280	281520	say if we are going to get to whatever is plus two degrees or whatever it is 1.5, 2.5
281520	287640	15 years ago they were saying we will get there just by through wind and solar for example
287640	293320	just by mitigating emissions with each new iteration they said we will get there mainly
293320	297560	with solar and wind but also we will have a bit of carbon capture and storage.
297560	301760	Next iteration we will have a bit more carbon capture and storage so I think the really
301760	304880	important criticism is the criticism that comes from people like Kevin Anderson who
304880	312720	are very outspoken on this, the climate scientist who say we are increasingly banking on the
312720	318360	efficacy of technologies which do not yet exist at any significant scale rather than
318360	324000	banking on technologies which we have and we know that they work we are increasing the
324000	330240	degree of our bet on technologies that we do not yet have in any meaningful shape or
330240	336080	form at scale and affordability and so on and obviously the next step will be geoengineering
336080	340760	and as I understand it that is the kind of that as many viewers will know the work of
340760	345200	Andreas Maum and I think that is what his next book with Wim Carton is going to be
345240	351520	focusing on is how we are heading towards a position of where we are essentially at
351520	355000	default position is going to be relying on geoengineering to get us out of the hole we
355000	359880	are increasingly digging. So fossil fuel combustion stays with us, the emissions stay
359880	364520	with us but there is how Mary do other shit to help us out of the hole. And we are doing
364520	369200	that already to an extent in so much as not geoengineering but the carbon sequestration
369200	372440	does not need to be technology that is not already here because of course you have this
372480	377440	ridiculous phrase I think of quote unquote nature based solutions which is basically
377440	378440	planting trees.
378440	379440	Essentially yeah.
379440	384440	Often it is trees that are not actually designed for the habitats where you are planting them
384440	390560	there is not the kind of biodiverse you would associate with wild habitats, it is the kind
390560	393960	of trees you would plant for timber and what not, they are effectively ecological dead
393960	394960	zones.
394960	395960	Exactly.
395960	399680	But you have had a load of money flood into this, people think they can make money off
399680	403160	of it so of course the good and the great are very enthusiastic about it.
403160	404160	Love it.
404160	405160	They do love it.
405160	406160	Yeah of course they do.
406160	407160	But you are not optimistic about nature based solutions?
407160	414120	Well I mean I think that the reality is that I am totally in agreement with the likes of
414120	419240	Kevin Anderson that just say you know minimize emissions, just focus on minimizing emissions.
419240	423640	You don't want the shit in the atmosphere, that is what you just don't want and anything
423640	432200	that provides you with the kind of cover to think that you can continue happily in that
432200	434920	merry way with emissions is not a good thing.
434920	440480	So yes we should be exploring those types of things and yes we should be exploring carbon
440480	447120	capture type technologies but we shouldn't be allowing that to serve as cover for not
447120	449520	doing the things that we should be doing.
449520	456800	And then there of course is the concern which kind of fits in with the Jevons paradox about
456800	460400	you know the more efficient you are at doing something the more you do it rather than the
460400	461400	less you do it.
461400	465200	So for instance Jevons notices this in the 19th century as an economist.
465200	468280	With regards to coal you know the more efficient steam engines became the more coal you use.
468280	469280	Yep.
469280	473920	Now that is a point we can put a pin in and that is very relevant for energy.
473920	474920	It is.
474920	477560	But also with regards to carbon sequestration obviously if that becomes incredibly efficient
477600	480280	then people will say well you know we can burn this shit forever.
480280	481280	It doesn't matter.
481280	482280	Yeah.
482280	486200	And you know and people living in people living here in the UK lovely we can just carry on
486200	490600	flying going out and fantastic we'll offset that and we can do it and we can bomb our
490600	492160	conscience and we don't have to worry about it.
492160	493160	So what's wrong with that?
493160	494480	Because I mean that will sound very appealing.
494480	499320	Oh nothing can change but we can bring down CO2 levels of CO2 in the atmosphere what's
499320	500320	wrong with that?
500320	509960	Well my understanding is that simply those technologies are very very limited in their
509960	516480	capacity to do what we hope they can do at scale and in an affordable way.
516480	524320	And so we are and when I say we I mean including here the IPCC forecast that I refer to we
524320	530600	are trusting that they are going to be able to do much more for us than we know that they
530600	531600	can do.
531600	536880	Essentially we are we're betting on something being able to happen and we have no proof
536880	543000	of the fact that it will be able to whereas we do have technologies that we know work
543000	546140	but we're just not doing enough of them and things like wind and so will be the classic
546140	547640	examples of that.
547640	552320	I suppose there's also the argument that you know nature is a good in itself and if you
552320	555920	look at things like biodiversity and the destruction of wild habitats to go you mentioned
555920	561320	Andres Malm you know his his perspective on COVID is amazing which is that actually this
561320	564160	is an outgrowth of our change relationship to the other species.
564160	565400	Yeah a great book that one.
565400	566400	Great book.
566400	567400	Yeah.
567400	568400	What's it?
568400	570400	War Communism and the Corona.
570400	571400	Yeah.
571400	572400	What was it?
572400	575080	Coronavirus, climate emergence or something like that.
575080	576080	It's a good book.
576080	580960	Which is to say that you know look all the pathogens that we presume as being here you know in perpetuity
581000	585280	you're actually not they're all quite recent humans are 300,000 years old we've had agriculture
585280	591920	for 12,000 years and it's in that phase that we've had all of these pathogens that we think
591920	595920	has never brought measles you know that's that's all stuff that's a result of species
595920	596920	crossover and.
596920	597920	Exactly.
597920	602840	Andres his point is that the more we destroy the natural world the more of these pathogens
602840	605320	are going to spill over into humans.
605320	609120	So there's a sort of holistic approach that I think underpins all that stuff anyway.
609160	613040	So let's just let's say that's right and let's say that like you say the technologies are
613040	615960	hail marrying it's a bad bet.
615960	621880	You would say let's electrify as much as possible now and let's get that from renewable energy.
621880	624760	So why is electrification so critical here?
624760	627400	Why do we want to electrify as much as we can?
627400	628400	Yeah.
628400	635240	So that's the way you put it I think I think I would phrase it differently.
635240	647320	I would say that the electrification is is is a if not the principal strategy that the
647320	653760	world currently has for climate mitigation to the extent that it's not relying on those
653760	654760	other things.
654760	659800	So to the extent that that we are attempting to mitigate existing emissions electrification
659800	664400	is at the heart of it and and it's really important to understand why electrification
664400	667760	and why electricity are so and why electricity are so important.
667760	671320	So if we step back a set because I think this is really useful for people to understand
671320	674480	and some of this is going to be really obvious to people but they'll some of it won't be
674480	676800	obvious at least not to everyone.
676800	682280	So if we think about just greenhouse gas emissions in general think about that.
682280	687360	The totality of greenhouse gas emissions about 75% of that is carbon dioxide.
687360	694280	If you then focus just on carbon dioxide about 75% of that again of that 75% is from the
694280	698920	combustion of fossil fuels so oil natural gas and coal.
698920	703160	And so as everyone knows the combustion of fossil fuels that's why that we talk about
703160	708040	that because it's the heart of the problem of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions
708040	713440	focus in on that 75% of 75% and the biggest part of it is the electricity sector.
713440	718360	So electricity generation is the biggest source of emissions from the burning of fossil fuels
718360	720800	principally natural gas and coal.
720800	726280	So that's why decarbonizing the power sector is so important.
726280	732080	That's why everyone talks about solar and wind and nuclear which we can talk about because
732080	735000	that's how you decarbonize the power sector is really important.
735000	739080	However it's because of what you refer to as electrification the electricity sector
739080	745880	is actually even more important than that and because the way the world is principally
745880	750360	approaching this is to say look we have those electricity sector emissions.
750360	757760	We also have emissions from things like transportation and industrial processes and things like that.
757760	760320	How are we going to decarbonize them?
760320	764760	And the way that we are typically thinking about doing that is to say so take vehicle
764760	771280	transportation as an example so cars and trucks which run on which historically run on internal
771280	774600	combustion engines by burning gasoline.
774600	776960	So in theory you could do two different things.
776960	784200	You could either switch to a different non-carboniferous fuel like a biofuel of something, ethanol
784200	791680	something like that or you switch to a motor which is basically a charged battery and charge
791680	797440	it through electricity and that's kind of what we're doing and it's the same thing with
797440	800820	industrial processes and buildings as much as possible.
800820	806420	The strategy is basically run as much as we can off electricity and then generate that
806420	811900	electricity through low carbon or zero carbon sources.
811900	817740	So that makes the electricity sector even more important to the climate problem than
817740	822780	it already is because it's going to get much bigger because we're electrifying everything
822780	829260	so electricity consumption is going to go to much higher levels than we currently have
829380	833140	which makes it doubly important that we decarbonize it.
833140	837260	So electricity really is the kind of the heart of the problem because if we don't decarbonize
837260	841020	it we're in even more trouble than we already are.
841020	849900	And I think the point here that I would make is that we're not doing anything, people will
849900	855700	look at charts for renewable energy growth worldwide and they'll think this looks awesome.
855700	862780	The charts are sharply upwards both in terms of the amount of new renewables capacity that's
862780	869660	being installed and the amount of electricity that we are generating from renewable sources.
869660	877900	However, the problem is that because overall electricity consumption is going up so sharply
877900	880020	that renewables growth is not proving enough.
880020	884940	So fossil fuel electricity generation is also still growing every year.
884940	887340	What I've been saying for a number of years now it's going to peak this year, it's going
887340	890260	to peak this year but it still hasn't peaked, it's still going up.
890260	896460	So our emissions from electricity generation are still going up despite the fact that we're
896460	900820	two or three decades into the so-called renewables revolution.
900820	905540	So that's kind of a snapshot of why electricity is so important I think.
905540	908300	I'm going to interrupt this interview with Brett Christopher's for just one moment.
908300	911020	I do hope you're enjoying it.
911020	915700	As you may know right now we are in the middle of a general election here in the UK.
915700	921460	That will happen on July 4th but of course there is a campaign before then.
921460	927180	My view is that Navarro Media is without peer when it comes to covering that election,
927180	930580	the policies, the personalities, the politics.
930580	934540	We have no equivalent in my view.
934540	939260	That is from our daily coverage on Navarro Live, that's weekdays, it's 6pm, it's our
939260	946100	articles, our podcasts, our social first content, our news and comment, it's all there and
946100	949980	my goodness for this general election we're really ramping things up.
949980	956580	Imagine if you will a Lamborghini Contash, the light is red, Ash Sarkar is at the wheel,
956580	961420	she's got her foot to the pedal, really getting it going and that's what we need to do.
961420	966380	We need our supporters to help us get our acceleration right up, come right out of the
966380	971020	blocks because as we've said since this project first started, you cannot have a different
971020	975660	kind of politics without a different kind of media, new media for a different politics.
975660	980940	Now that won't arrive on July 5th but we certainly think we're moving the dial left on a tonne
980940	984900	of issues and in elections that is especially true.
984900	987940	If you want to be a part of that, you know what to do.
987940	993380	Go to navarromedia.com forward slash support, the link is in the description below.
993380	1000060	This is a momentous set of elections and I think it's a huge opportunity to shift the
1000060	1004460	political conversation in this country into a much better direction.
1004460	1005460	Be a part of it.
1005460	1009020	Go to navarromedia.com forward slash support.
1009020	1015980	You've got a statistic in the book which basically says, you know, global consumption of fossil
1015980	1021820	fuels for electricity is actually quite stagnant over the last 10 years, primarily because
1021820	1026340	of India, China and obviously demand going up and obviously, and it's something we don't
1026340	1029340	talk about enough, is Africa.
1029340	1033220	You know, Africa's population is set to double between 9 and 2050.
1033220	1037220	That's going to have extraordinary consequences to the rest of the world, particularly because
1037220	1040460	the rest of the world is getting older and looking at population decline.
1040460	1045020	It's going to change our fundamental notion of humanity and the global community in really
1045020	1051380	powerful ways but in terms of energy, obviously you're going to have more people in sub-Saharan
1051460	1054500	Africa and more people consuming more energy than they're presently do.
1054500	1061420	So we could be looking at maybe a doubling, or maybe just under, of energy globally between
1061420	1063900	now and say the mid 2050s, 2060.
1063900	1064900	Yeah.
1064900	1067420	I think the International Energy Agency, if I recall correctly, is somewhere between
1067420	1070100	two to three times where we are at at 2020 globally.
1070100	1071100	Yeah.
1071100	1073100	I mean, two times is the optimistic.
1073100	1074100	Yeah.
1074100	1075100	Exactly.
1075100	1076100	Let's try and be optimistic.
1076100	1077100	There's not much to be optimistic about.
1077220	1082860	And in that context, basically, I presume you would say, well, look the next two decades,
1082860	1086140	it's going to look like the last two decades, which is we'll decarbonise a ton of stuff
1086140	1087620	that will still be burning more fossil fuels.
1087620	1088620	Yeah.
1088620	1092220	I think that's, if I had to guess, that that would be where we're going.
1092220	1095940	And we can talk more about this because I think it's really, really important.
1095940	1103500	And the reason I'm, one of the main reasons I'm relatively pessimistic about this is that
1103500	1108460	it is simply stated, but it's quite complex to get one's head around.
1108460	1114380	And it's this, which is that the parts of the world, which is essentially the parts
1114380	1118980	of the world you've just been talking about, the parts of the world where the challenge
1118980	1125220	of decarbonising the electricity sector is economically greatest, are precisely the parts
1125220	1132500	of the world where it's most urgent, that decarbonisation proceeds rapidly.
1133500	1140620	Which is to say that it's those parts of the world where investment will have a disproportionately
1140620	1141620	important effect.
1141620	1146740	So, and what I mean by that, and it's important to spell this out, is that the reality is that
1146740	1153060	kind of what happens in Europe and North America is obviously important, but in terms of future
1153060	1159380	global greenhouse gas emissions trajectories, it's way more important what happens in China
1159380	1164260	and India and Africa and Vietnam than what happens here.
1164260	1165460	And that's for two reasons.
1165460	1170060	One of which you said is because that's where energy demand growth is concentrated.
1170060	1176060	So if you've got energy demand growing, then obviously if you're still fossil fuel intensive,
1176060	1180500	that's much more damaging than if your fossil fuel intensive in energy demand is not growing.
1180500	1182420	So that's one thing.
1182420	1187220	And then the other thing is that for very understandable reasons, it tends to be in those
1187220	1192100	parts of the world that the electricity sectors are still most fossil fuels intensive.
1192100	1198140	So here are some figures that just put a complexion on this that I think is important.
1198140	1202780	So I live in Sweden, it's almost fully decarbonised, it's power sector.
1202780	1207220	Something like 90% of electricity now is generated from non-carbon sources.
1207220	1213660	I think it's like roughly 30, 30, 30 nuclear wind hydro, about 10% is natural gas.
1213700	1218100	So Sweden's almost there on the power sector, at least.
1218100	1221420	UK, Germany, US, quite a way behind that.
1221420	1224820	Germany's pretty awful, lots of coal burning still.
1224820	1227140	US, lots of coal and natural gas.
1227140	1228340	UK, lots of natural gas.
1228340	1229700	Scotland very good though.
1229700	1233340	Yeah, we'll talk about Scotland because it's a big part of the story.
1233340	1238780	So they're a way behind, but they're still a long way ahead of other parts of the world.
1238780	1241900	China, 65% of electricity generation is coal.
1241900	1249340	India, 75%, South Africa, 90%, other countries 95% to 98%.
1249340	1255980	And so it's most urgent that investment in decarbonisation happens there.
1255980	1258940	A, because their fossil fuel intent, very fossil fuel intensive.
1258940	1261700	B, that's where energy demand growth is going to be concentrated.
1261700	1265700	But that's where the challenge is greatest economically for reasons that we can talk about.
1265700	1268140	And that's the real problem as I see it.
1268180	1270780	So let's take an, again, an optimistic slant on this.
1270780	1274340	Firstly, on China, I mean, China, again, we've got some great statistics.
1274340	1277180	I'm sure you can bring it off the top of your head.
1277180	1283460	For most of the last six, seven years, about 50% of sort of additional solar capacity
1283460	1286580	being added worldwide is in China.
1286580	1288980	It's a similar story with wind.
1288980	1289300	Yep.
1289300	1291060	It's blowing the United States out of the water.
1291060	1292340	100%.
1292340	1294220	Blowing the EU as well, but not quite as much.
1294220	1297660	I mean, it's making it, you know, the US is a clown show compared to China.
1297660	1304340	But obviously you have increasing demand, CO2 emissions per person still going up.
1304340	1311660	But the optimistic story is this, CO2 emissions per person in China may reach a peak.
1311660	1315620	Well, the plan was for 2030, but it's looking actually like the next couple of years,
1315620	1319100	potentially, according to Xi.
1319100	1321460	So that's one positive thing.
1321460	1322140	Absolutely.
1322140	1327020	Secondly, and this is probably where you're going to say that's completely wrong,
1327060	1330700	there's this optimistic account of Africa, which is like,
1330700	1334140	well, they didn't have landline connections, but they just, they skipped that bit
1334140	1338020	and they did the mobile telephony and they're going to do the same with energy.
1338020	1340460	They're going to skip, you know, national grids with fossil fuels.
1340460	1343540	They're going to go straight to distributed solar.
1343540	1344900	And on the one hand, that sounds absurd.
1344900	1347620	But on the other hand, actually within the tropics,
1347620	1349540	you do have an extraordinary amount of exposure to solar energy.
1349540	1350100	Absolutely.
1350100	1352260	It's a brilliant place to have it.
1352260	1354340	So what's wrong with that account?
1354340	1358660	An optimistic account of actually things are far better than the picture you're painting.
1358660	1359060	Yeah.
1359060	1366620	I mean, I think that both of those parts of the story have a strong degree of truth, actually.
1366620	1374100	I think that China is a, you know, China's hugely paradoxical and for all sorts of different reasons.
1374100	1381580	And right now, it's obviously the good news story on renewables,
1381580	1385660	but it's also the bad news story on kind of new coal-fired plants as well,
1385660	1389620	which is simply due to the fact, simply is probably the wrong word,
1389620	1394060	but it's due to the fact that energy demand is growing still so strongly there,
1394060	1399020	both from, you know, residential, commercial, industrial and so on.
1399020	1402740	And so renewables in and of themselves are not proving sufficient for that,
1402740	1409380	which is partly just a scale issue, but it's also partly about the different nature of the energy source.
1409420	1411140	But China's important to talk about.
1411140	1419580	And what I think is important is to understand the political economy of how it's doing things very differently to how we're doing it in the West.
1419580	1423220	There's some commonalities, but there's some big important differences as well.
1423220	1427500	I think on Africa, I think that is the big hope, actually.
1427500	1437900	And, you know, I see conflicting accounts about how credible that story is about
1437900	1446220	the extent to which it will be possible to build out a clean energy future there
1446220	1450580	that does kind of leapfrog the kind of historical problems that we've,
1450580	1455300	that are kind of almost a sunk cost here in the West,
1455300	1461060	where we have a very kind of centralized grid-based energy system,
1461060	1466380	which locks us into a certain kind of future that may not be necessary in Africa, as you say.
1466380	1472380	If it moves towards more distributed energy resources, then maybe it's possible to do that.
1472380	1478740	I mean, I think there are reasons to think both positively and negatively about that story.
1478740	1484740	I think right now it's too early to tell which direction it's going.
1484740	1492540	But possibly that's true, and I think that will be very, very important.
1492540	1498140	And let's not forget that, you know, just, I mean, I think there's a connection between those two stories, right, that we just talked about.
1498140	1505820	So if you look at what China did in 2023, when it was, you know, set all kinds of records for new renewable installation,
1505820	1510940	something like 30% of that renewable installation in China was rooftop solar.
1510940	1517620	So it wasn't commercial, large-scale, industrial power plants, wind and solar farms.
1517620	1520500	It was rooftop domestic solar, 30%.
1520540	1526340	Huge. All sorts of state subsidy necessary for that, but that's fine.
1526340	1530980	So part of the China story is precisely that distributed energy story,
1530980	1534820	which one would hope would be replicated in Africa as well.
1534820	1536100	And Vietnam as well, right?
1536100	1539780	Again, it's one of these stories in Europe and the West we don't really hear.
1539780	1543660	Like, there is a heroic effort going into solar right now in Vietnam.
1543660	1544100	There is.
1544100	1547820	And it's not on our radar, and we think in Europe we're doing everything.
1547820	1552580	You know, we've got, you go in Germany or Italy, you might see some solar cells.
1552580	1553140	Great.
1553140	1556580	But in Vietnam, they're doing what those countries did in 20 years.
1556580	1558260	They're doing it in three or four years.
1558260	1559180	Yeah, absolutely.
1559180	1564500	And obviously, I mean, to take, I mean, China is the best example of this.
1564500	1572460	But the reason that China can and is doing things at a much more rapid clip
1572500	1577580	and on a much, much greater scale than is happening in the West
1577580	1581140	is simply because it's essentially a state project, right?
1581140	1588420	I mean, to take wind, something like 95% of the wind deployment sector,
1588420	1593260	by which I mean the entities that are involved, not on the manufacturing side,
1593260	1596620	building the turbines and building the cells and modules,
1596620	1599900	although it's not hugely dissimilar there, but on the deployment side,
1599900	1602860	by which I mean developing the wind and solar farms,
1602860	1606140	owning and operating them and selling the electricity that they generate,
1606140	1610460	something like 95% of that is state-owned enterprises.
1610460	1614820	They are being financed by state-owned banks
1614820	1620460	who are themselves having their debts subsidized by the state-owned central bank.
1620460	1625060	And all of these entities are, at least if my understanding of this is correct,
1625060	1628820	and it's a second-hand understanding based on kind of the work of China experts,
1628860	1631260	you know, heck of a lot more about it than I do,
1631260	1636260	all of these entities are only, what's the best word to you,
1636260	1641180	modestly being driven by profit motives of one kind or another.
1641180	1648300	They are, to one degree or another, working at the behest of provincial
1648300	1651620	and or central government in China.
1651620	1656100	They are being directed very substantially in terms of what they're doing now.
1656100	1659100	And if you have the willpower and if you have the resources
1659100	1663100	and you have the determination and the political intent
1663100	1667140	to do that sort of thing on a huge scale and quickly,
1667140	1668860	well, you can do that.
1668860	1674940	But in the West, where we are essentially relying on the private sector to do this
1674940	1677620	and we are relying on the kind of quote-unquote
1677620	1681540	coordinating mechanisms of markets to do this,
1681540	1683460	it's an entirely different project.
1683460	1689300	You're expecting, you know, the independent decisions of thousands of different entities
1689300	1694740	to kind of add up to this very complicated thing that we call a transition.
1694740	1698420	And not surprisingly, it's not really happening in the same way
1698420	1701380	that it is where you have a top-down approach to this
1701380	1705860	that can be very, very coordinated and very, very joined up
1705860	1709180	because you have one entity that is overseeing all of it.
1709180	1712860	I mean, we had this debate recently on the Var Alive, Michael and I,
1712900	1715500	and he was saying China is a capitalist society.
1715500	1717260	And I said, it's not a capitalist society.
1717260	1719660	It's a market society.
1719660	1721780	But there's a huge difference in that in a capitalist society.
1721780	1722540	I mean, I totally agree.
1722540	1724340	And even then, is it a market society?
1724340	1725460	I mean, even this is the debate.
1725460	1728580	I mean, if you look at what's going on in the energy sector,
1728580	1732860	I would be quite reticent to call the mechanisms
1732860	1738100	whereby and the context within which electricity is bought and sold,
1738100	1740580	markets in anything like the shape of which we're used to.
1740700	1744260	The firms that are building, you know, the firms that are making the PV cells,
1744260	1747460	which would take over the world if we weren't imposing tariffs on them.
1747460	1750180	That is all being done by private actors in competition.
1750180	1752740	And I think this is something that Michael and I really discredent.
1752740	1755060	And I said, it's a market society.
1755060	1757420	But the point is, it's not capitalist because Eric E. Lee,
1757420	1759180	who's a political scientist, Chinese political scientist,
1759180	1762580	he said, we're not a capitalist society because, yes, we have markets,
1762580	1767020	but capital does not determine how our society allocates resources.
1767020	1768700	The interests of capital are not so enormous
1768740	1770620	with the interests of the ruling class.
1770620	1773820	Our ruling class has national political priorities, which sometimes...
1773820	1774820	100%.
1774820	1776260	Which is odds with capital.
1776260	1778620	And I think for people in the West, that's a really hard thing to engage with.
1778620	1779620	It is.
1779620	1782900	You have markets, but you don't allow capital to determine political priorities.
1782900	1786740	So I was on a panel recently and there was a sociologist,
1786740	1790460	a Chinese sociologist who works in the US called Karl Chan,
1790460	1792740	who's been doing a lot of really interesting research
1792740	1794860	about Chinese state-owned enterprises.
1794860	1798220	And I think the concept he uses to try to capture what it is they do,
1798220	1800340	I think he calls it managed competition.
1800340	1801180	What's the chap's name?
1801180	1803340	Kyle Chan, C-H-A-N.
1803340	1808260	And it's a really evocative and useful way of thinking about this,
1808260	1811740	that it's just not competition in the way we think about it.
1811740	1816380	It's a managed process towards a particular end
1816380	1820460	to which competition is being mobilized in some way,
1820460	1824500	but only in a very limited capacity to make sure that these things are happening.
1825340	1829980	It was quite interesting hearing basically Chinese automotive manufacturers,
1829980	1832220	they were being asked, are you gunning for the US?
1832220	1833140	Are you gunning for Tesla?
1833140	1836260	And they're like, we have enough problems with our own people back home,
1836260	1840660	like BYD are terrified of the next four or five companies beneath them.
1840660	1843260	And of course, if you look at that from a sort of classical,
1843260	1846700	a neoclassical sort of political economy perspective,
1846700	1848660	you'd be like, well, those are exactly the sorts of incentives
1848660	1851860	which are meant to be driving firms and industrialists.
1852260	1856780	And it's so strange that China and its firms are talking in that language.
1856780	1859500	And yet, the US is talking in a very protectionist language,
1859500	1861100	he's talking about national champions.
1861100	1862900	China is not talking about national champions.
1862900	1864620	No, no, no, no, no.
1864620	1866860	No, because they've already, they're already the champions.
1866860	1869620	They're the international champions.
1869620	1871660	Yeah, this is another one, this is a bit of an aside,
1871660	1874860	but again, you're going to be a lot more familiar with the reality of this
1874860	1876540	because you do all these academic panels and whatnot.
1876540	1879380	But we have a friend here at Navarro who sometimes works with us
1879380	1883660	on sort of helping us out, kind of like a consultant guy.
1883660	1886660	And they were recently in, I think, Vietnam.
1886660	1890140	And they kept on seeing all these brands they just never heard of.
1890140	1892740	And then they were like, what's that? Google that, Google that, Google that.
1892740	1896060	And then they said, look, after a while, I realized that like the world's number one,
1896060	1901220	two, three producer for dozens of, you know, commodities, which I've granted,
1901220	1902940	they're all East Asian, right?
1902940	1904860	You know, they're Chinese or if they're not Chinese,
1904860	1907940	they'll be Japanese or Taiwanese or and I was like, yeah.
1907940	1910180	We do live in a little closeted world in some respects.
1910180	1911900	But I think Europeans don't realize.
1911900	1913860	No, of course they don't. No, absolutely not.
1913860	1915100	Very stretch.
1915100	1918420	So you're optimistic, but also in a way pessimistic about China.
1918420	1921260	I suppose one good way of looking at China is
1921260	1923660	we would be really screwed if they weren't doing all the things.
1923660	1928300	They would be. I mean, the way, I mean, not least in terms of, I mean,
1928300	1931260	there's for one thing, there's the fact that they are making progress
1931260	1932580	domestically on renewables, right?
1932580	1933380	Fantastic.
1933380	1937460	But there's also the fact that let's not forget that it's unimaginable
1937460	1942820	that in places like Europe, that to the extent that it's happened so far,
1942820	1946180	that the energy transition, the decarbonization of power sector
1946180	1953540	would have gone as far, as fast and at such a low, relatively low cost as it has.
1953540	1958020	Were it not from the fact that it's China that drove down the cost of the technologies, right?
1958020	1962340	I mean, there's no, there's no way it would have gone as far as fast or at such low cost
1962340	1964100	without China doing what it's done.
1964180	1969780	We've, we collectively have been benefiting environmentally and economically
1969780	1972180	from what China's been doing for the last 15 to 20 years.
1972180	1973540	That is such a good point.
1973540	1977100	So people are saying, and we'll talk about obviously that the fallen price for renewables,
1977100	1979500	how it's competitive with fossil fuels, and a big part of that,
1979500	1983460	that disinflationary pressure is the fact that stuff is being manufactured in China.
1983460	1984860	Almost all about China.
1984860	1986180	And that's very rarely in the conversation.
1986180	1987100	No, no, no, no.
1987100	1990060	Because we talk about energy security, but we can have, we can have our cake and eat it.
1990060	1992220	It can be cheap and it can be energy secure.
1992220	1992940	Hold on a second.
1992940	1995180	It's cheap because it's not made here.
1995180	1996940	It's actually made outside of the planet.
1996940	1997740	Yeah, absolutely.
1997740	2000500	And obviously what's going on in the U.S. right now, and again,
2000500	2004780	there's a bit of a tangent, but it's important, is that the Biden administration
2004780	2019060	is trying to thread the needle between not wanting to entirely give up those economic gains
2019060	2021980	that have been delivered and continued to be delivered by China.
2021980	2024460	While at the same time benefiting domestic industry.
2024460	2028900	So they're trying to play this delicate game where they're like saying to the renewable energy developers,
2028900	2034580	look, if you, if you source your technology locally, rather than from China,
2034580	2042180	from local manufacturers, you get an extra 10% credit on your, on your renewables development.
2042180	2046260	And, but I, you know, based on the conversations I've had with people in the U.S.,
2046260	2050980	it's still entirely unclear whether that incremental benefit is proving sufficient
2050980	2056580	to persuade them to source locally or whether it still makes economic sense for them to source from China.
2056580	2057500	Yeah, they don't know yet.
2057500	2059620	Well, because you have these recent tariffs announced by Biden, right?
2059620	2060780	Yeah, that was, that was a lot.
2060780	2061500	They've changed it.
2061500	2063300	They've introduced some new tariffs last week.
2063300	2067540	So 100% on automotive, you know, so electric vehicles will have 100% tariffs.
2067540	2072380	So if I'm buying a BYD car and it's $30,000 in China, I'm going to have to pay $30,000 tariff on it.
2072380	2073580	Yep, exactly.
2073580	2075500	And I still think that car might be competitive.
2075500	2076460	Yeah, it could well be.
2076460	2078340	Which is the terrifying thing for the U.S. car industry.
2078340	2079420	Yeah, no, absolutely.
2079460	2085540	Yeah, so they're, they're playing a very challenging game over there, which, which, which, I mean, I understand that game politically.
2086380	2089940	I mean, it makes, it makes it's easy to understand where they're coming from.
2090780	2091580	Politically, yes.
2091580	2092860	But then you can't say climate change...
2092860	2094780	Oh, not necessarily economically, environmentally, no.
2094780	2098420	You can't say climate change is existential, but then put 50% tariffs on PV cells.
2098420	2098860	No.
2098860	2100180	Well, you don't believe that then, do you?
2100180	2109380	But then, but then the whole, I mean, let's be honest about this, but the whole, the whole climate policy,
2109620	2121020	thing in the U.S. perspective is entirely contradictory, by which I mean, you know, I think the Inflation Reduction Act is actually pretty good policy for the, for the most part.
2122060	2132100	And I think that given the, given the political conditions under which Biden has been operating, it was probably about as good as, as he could have got through at the time.
2133100	2137980	And yet, you know, one day Biden will be extolling the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act.
2137980	2157380	And yet the very next day, he'll be like calling out OPEC for introducing new production quotas to dampen oil and gas production, because Biden is concerned that that, that constraint in global oil and gas supply will have, you know, will put the price of gasoline up 3 cents.
2157380	2159700	And it means that he won't, he won't get voted into power.
2159700	2161660	So he's telling OPEC to open the pumps.
2161980	2165740	So it's just like, it's the most contradictory thing imaginable.
2166100	2177980	And, and, and that's the thing I think we have to grapple with, is that the whole kind of U.S. political, economic, ecological complex is fundamentally driven with contradiction.
2179100	2182340	And you compare that to Europe, which for the most part has proportional representation.
2182980	2186140	At least you can build in a consensus around a certain policy direction.
2186540	2187060	That's true.
2187100	2191020	Whereas in the U.S., you have like, I mean, it's crazy, you have Biden saying, I'm a green champion.
2191020	2197580	And then, and then, but then, and it's, and you understand why they'll be saying, look, if inflation is 5% in November, we're out, we're gone.
2197620	2198220	100%.
2198340	2198620	Right.
2198620	2199380	And they know that.
2200260	2204660	And so you have these wildly diverging policies, messages.
2204700	2210820	And we, we in the West, but especially in America, live very carbon intensive lifestyles.
2210980	2215900	And so inflation is, is a carboniferous phenomenon in the U.S.
2215940	2217620	more than anywhere else.
2217900	2219460	And it's really important to remember that.
2219740	2224540	So the inflation discussion is a significant part of carbon discussion in the U.S.
2224620	2227500	And it's very, very important to remember that politically as well as economically.
2228220	2235260	Going back to Europe, you mentioned the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA Act, IRA Act.
2235260	2240500	I can't say that without, yeah, having memories of growing up in Croydon in the 1970s.
2240620	2250860	And, you know, Biden's, Biden's famous Irish heritage, I do find it, I'm sure he probably finds it quite, you know, you know, interesting.
2250900	2251300	Yes.
2253300	2255860	You got the IRA Act, you got the CHIPS Act, that's not really related.
2255860	2268980	And at the same time as the IRA Act, which is this, you know, huge amount of money basically going into reshore lots of manufacturing in the UK, but also it's ostensibly about a decarbonisation agenda.
2269420	2271780	At the same time, you have, obviously, Russia, Ukraine.
2272340	2275460	And what you're seeing right now is that sort of amazing statistic in the FT recently.
2275460	2280620	I think it's like 45% of German manufacturing companies are looking at setting up shop in the U.S.
2281180	2287340	Because energy in Germany compared to the U.S. is six times more expensive, six times more.
2287340	2288300	Wow, I hadn't seen that statistic.
2288300	2291060	Yeah, industrial energy, I think it was five to six times more.
2291100	2291380	Wow.
2291420	2296420	But then on top of that, you have the IRA, you know, subsidies or whatever, tax, you know, breaks and what not.
2296740	2303140	All of a sudden, you know, these industrial firms that have been in Germany for like 800 years thinking, am I going to Texas?
2303580	2307900	Germany really isn't heading in a good direction in any sense, in any shape or form right now, is it?
2307900	2310060	So, yeah, okay, so explain that.
2310060	2313780	So what, and where does U.S. policies fit on this?
2313780	2321900	So is that, is that, is that an intentional effort by the United States government to basically say, you know what, we're going to reindustrialise on the back of deindustrialisation in Germany?
2322060	2323140	Or is it not that deep?
2323380	2324780	Am I being too conspiratorial?
2324780	2337980	I'm not sure it's that deep, but certainly on the manufacturing side, U.S. policymakers have been, have been making an active effort to woo European companies, for sure.
2338140	2341940	And not just on the manufacturing side, but also on the renewable energy development side.
2342020	2354660	They've, you know, they've been trying to get the Iberdrohlers and the Orstedts and so on, much more interested in the U.S. as a place for investment in new, in new wind and solar power, as well as the manufacturing side of the business.
2354860	2356700	But I'm not sure it's, I'm not sure it's that deep.
2357860	2368740	But, you know, the EU, sorry, has been through, you know, a very difficult few years on the energy front in a way that the U.S. largely avoided.
2369980	2372660	And I think there are, there are still lingering effects from that.
2372660	2381860	And it's important to think about what's going on in Germany in relation to what happened in 2021 to 2022, which, which didn't really happen in the U.S.
2382860	2398500	The energy crisis was a, was a phenomenon that was, it wasn't limited to the EU, but to the extent that it was significant outside the EU, it was, it was significant more to the East, not least in China than it was in the U.S.
2399500	2409500	So the, the EU occupies this kind of strange sort of third provisional position in the kind of game between China and the U.S.
2409500	2417500	The EU is in this uncertain position where it seems to be neither one thing or the other.
2417500	2427500	It doesn't seem to be in a position to be calling any shots, but it's also not reacting as far as I can tell in the kind of deeply protectionist way that the U.S. has reacted.
2429500	2430500	Yeah. So it's interesting.
2430500	2439500	There was a great quote a year or two ago, basically saying that the energy crisis of, you know, 2022-2023, was it 2022-2022?
2439500	2440500	21-22.
2440500	2441500	21-22.
2441500	2442500	Yeah.
2442500	2447500	It's, you know, post-Covid, but also, you know, in relation to Germany in particular, post-Ukraine war.
2447500	2452500	And they said, look, the last several years have basically brought into focus that there are two kinds of countries.
2452500	2454500	Those with energy and those without.
2454500	2455500	Yeah.
2456500	2459500	You know, go massive on nuclear renewables, coal.
2459500	2462500	The U.S. is where we have tons of energy anyway.
2462500	2467500	And Europe doesn't have any energy, but it's not adopted a sort of a strategy like you say.
2467500	2475500	No. I mean, Germany was the most extreme example of sort of essentially relying on Russia for energy.
2475500	2484500	And that was true to a lesser extent, but also not to an insignificant extent in other parts of Europe as well.
2484500	2496500	I mean, it just, I mean, it's, in that context, it is worth going back to China and the question of trying to understand its investment,
2496500	2504500	that kind of hybrid state capitalist investment that it's been undertaking in its renewables industry,
2504500	2508500	both the manufacturing side and the deployment side in the last couple of decades,
2508500	2511500	and to think, well, what kind of strategy is that?
2511500	2523500	And it's kind of a three-fold strategy by which I mean it's been partly a strategy that is about environmentalism.
2523500	2530500	It's been partly a strategy which is an industrial strategy, trying to build global champions,
2530500	2535500	global leadership in a particular sector, but it's also been a strategy about energy security.
2535500	2544500	And by my understanding, it's the reverse order, actually, that the energy security was the kind of the main strategy
2544500	2551500	and arguably still is the main strategy, then industrial strategy, and that the environmental part of it, I mean, it's become more important.
2551500	2554500	20 years ago, it wasn't a significant part of the strategy.
2554500	2560500	But even today, my suspicion is it's still not the first of those three and maybe not even the second of those three.
2560500	2562500	And it's been about energy security.
2562500	2568500	And so what happened in Europe, I mean, it's a different slant on the same question,
2568500	2573500	but what happened in 2022 was there was a bit of a fillip in renewables investment in Europe.
2573500	2579500	And a lot of people were saying, oh, this is further evidence of the fact that renewables are forging ahead
2579500	2582500	because they're very, very cheap and they're economically competitive.
2582500	2584500	And no, that wasn't really what happened.
2584500	2585500	It was about energy security, right?
2585500	2591500	If you have renewable and solar power, you're not reliant on importing fuel from overseas.
2591500	2594500	You're not reliant on a rush or whoever else it might be.
2594500	2597500	So I think it was an energy security issue that was driving that investment.
2597500	2600500	What you just said is the crux of the book.
2600500	2602500	And we'll get to that in a moment about the price.
2602500	2604500	Yeah, we haven't really got to the book yet.
2604500	2607500	No, it's critical because it's not about prices.
2607500	2612500	We're getting to a point of price parity with regards to fossil fuels and renewables, but that's not the point.
2612500	2614500	But particularly on Europe.
2614500	2615500	Yes.
2615500	2623500	I mean, that was the, you know, what we saw in 2022, 2023 was 101 think pieces about finally Europe is on the stage.
2623500	2625500	Not only was it meant to remilitarize.
2625500	2626500	Okay, what's happening there?
2626500	2628500	It was meant to be rebuilding its domestic industry.
2628500	2630500	It's doing the opposite, actually.
2630500	2634500	It was also meant to be getting serious about renewals and nuclear energy.
2634500	2635500	Yes.
2635500	2636500	Not just upticks.
2636500	2639500	And there has been much progress made and there is progress is being made.
2639500	2642500	But it's not decarbonizing as quickly as we were told.
2642500	2643500	No.
2643500	2644500	Why is that?
2644500	2645500	Russia?
2645500	2646500	Russia's gone.
2646500	2647500	Yeah.
2647500	2648500	For the near future.
2648500	2655500	And Germany's industrial prowess is literally, well, not entirely based on, but it was significantly based on cheap Russian energy.
2655500	2663500	That's now gone, but there doesn't seem to be the political leadership in places like Germany to say, you know what, we now need to build a ton of wind, solar, nuclear.
2663500	2665500	And you've got a green-red coalition there.
2665500	2670500	You think, well, this should be the perfect set of circumstances for Germany to become a world leader in renewable energy.
2670500	2671500	Yeah.
2671500	2672500	So it's not happening.
2672500	2673500	No, it's not.
2673500	2674500	Why?
2674500	2698500	So the narrative that you will typically hear about this, across the board actually politically and almost analytically as well, but certainly from both left and right, is that the problem is found in the realm of, for want of a better kind of label, politics and planning and bureaucracy.
2698500	2712500	You'll have seen a thousand think pieces saying, look, the problem is that there's all this money waiting to go into renewables, but it's being held up by, you know, obstructionist local planning authorities.
2712500	2716500	It's being held up by slow processes to get planning permission.
2716500	2719500	It's being held up by long queues to get grid connections.
2719500	2721500	It's being held up by nimbyism.
2721500	2722500	And you know what?
2722500	2724500	It is held up by all of those things.
2724500	2725500	Absolutely.
2725500	2735500	However, the other crucial part of that key of that main dominant narrative about this says what it's not being held up by is the economics.
2735500	2746500	The economics has been solved because the price of generating electricity from solar and wind has come down sharply historically.
2747500	2761500	And it has, over time, to a point of where, as you said, it's as cheap or often in many places even cheaper to generate solar and wind power than it is by burning natural gas or coal.
2761500	2765500	So that's the key narrative is that it's all these other things.
2765500	2766500	It's not the economics.
2766500	2770500	My argument in the book is that, yes, it's all those other things, but it's also the economics.
2770500	2789500	And the argument there is that the thinking specifically on the question of generating price, which is what all those think pieces do, and they reproduce the same charts showing the same cost curves coming down over time, is the wrong prism through which to think about it.
2789500	2797500	And that we can understand much more about the industry and about why things are going too slowly if we focus on the question of profitability rather than price.
2797500	2799500	So that's the argument I made.
2799500	2802500	And so it's a complex, as you said, right at the outset.
2802500	2803500	There's a lot of detail in it.
2803500	2804500	It's quite wonky.
2804500	2805500	It's quite complex.
2805500	2810500	But the actual main argument is really straightforward, which is this.
2810500	2817500	It's like, in profitability terms, renewables deployment is actually quite a problematic proposition.
2817500	2820500	And I'll explain what I mean by that in a second.
2821500	2829500	And that's a problem because we're relying on the private sector and the private sector is driven above all else by profitability expectations.
2829500	2837500	If its expectations are on profitability are not adequate, it will not invest or it will not invest on the sufficient sale.
2837500	2843500	So my argument is like, you need to understand that, A, we are relying mainly on solar and wind.
2843500	2851500	So yes, there are countries in which there's much more of a role being given to nuclear and even in some countries, geothermal and hydro and so on.
2851500	2857500	But for the most part, the world is kind of betting the house on solar and wind to a significant extent.
2857500	2865500	And second, the world is banking on the private sector, not China, but elsewhere in the world, government policy is not to do it itself.
2865500	2868500	It's to say, we expect you, the private sector, to do it.
2868500	2875500	We will nudge you in the right direction through various incentives and subsidy mechanisms on where you're not doing it quickly enough.
2875500	2878500	We'll provide you that help, but we're not going to do it.
2878500	2880500	You're going to do it. We're expecting you to do it.
2880500	2888500	That's fine if the private sector consistently sees sufficient profitability in that proposition to do it quickly and at scale.
2888500	2889500	But it doesn't.
2889500	2892500	And you talk to people in the industry and they're like, no, of course not.
2893500	2895500	But policymakers are completely deaf to this.
2895500	2902500	And I think for all sorts of reasons, but partly because they've been persuaded by those simplistic arguments about falling prices.
2902500	2907500	And to them, it's like, well, surely if the prices have fallen, the profits must be there.
2907500	2908500	The profits must be going up.
2908500	2910500	But it's just not true.
2910500	2913500	It's a problematic industry in terms of profitability expectations.
2913500	2916500	And that's the kind of core of the book as to why that is.
2916500	2918500	And it is a bit of a wonky book.
2918500	2919500	We like wonky books.
2919500	2920500	Oh, yeah.
2920500	2921500	Well, yeah, I hope so.
2921500	2922500	We love wonky books.
2922500	2924500	I mean, don't let that put you off.
2924500	2927500	I think particularly, look, for anybody who wants to know the subject well.
2927500	2931500	And the point is, like you say, the core proposition at the heart of the book is a very important one.
2931500	2933500	And, you know, it's like...
2933500	2935500	I think it's really important.
2935500	2936500	Yeah.
2936500	2941500	It's like the arrow that goes through, you know, Harold Goodwin's Anziah Hastings.
2941500	2942500	You know, it's...
2942500	2943500	That's it.
2943500	2945500	It's game over for that worldview of...
2945500	2950500	Well, actually, private firms, the private sector with the profit motive can solve the climate crisis.
2950500	2951500	Exactly.
2951500	2952500	They can't.
2952500	2953500	It's not about costs.
2953500	2954500	It's about...
2954500	2955500	It's not about prices or other.
2955500	2956500	It's about profit.
2956500	2957500	Yeah.
2957500	2960500	And obviously, profitability is shaped by generating prices.
2960500	2962500	That's part of the equation, but it's not the totality.
2962500	2963500	That's the issue.
2963500	2964500	Yeah.
2964500	2969500	And I actually feel like there are some similarities here with the debates I've had recently with
2969500	2974500	people in regards to, you know, privatised utilities of things like mail, rail, water.
2974500	2977500	And they're arguing for, you know, the private sector should control these.
2977500	2982500	And I go, look, best-case scenario, best-case scenario, they're very low margin.
2982500	2984500	You want it to be very competitive.
2984500	2986500	They're very physically hard to administer.
2986500	2987500	They're not very exciting.
2987500	2988500	No.
2988500	2991500	Like, why do you want the private sector here?
2991500	2993500	And they're also very important.
2993500	2994500	Go...
2994500	2995500	100%.
2995500	2997500	Go make, like, shirts.
2997500	2998500	I mean, it's true, right?
2998500	2999500	No.
2999500	3000500	Or glasses or mobile phones or...
3000500	3001500	Come up with a coffee machine.
3001500	3002500	Exactly.
3002500	3005500	Or like a scalable social network where you can 10X your...
3005500	3006500	Knock yourself out.
3006500	3007500	Do you see something different and better?
3007500	3008500	Yeah.
3008500	3009500	Yes.
3009500	3010500	Water can't do that.
3010500	3011500	No.
3011500	3012500	And I feel like renewables are in a similar situation.
3012500	3013500	100%.
3013500	3014500	It's just a low margin thing.
3014500	3015500	It's just electrons.
3015500	3016500	Yeah.
3016500	3017500	Just leave it alone.
3017500	3018500	I know.
3018500	3019500	I know.
3019500	3020500	Yeah.
3020500	3021500	It's bizarre.
3021500	3022500	And the thing is, right...
3022500	3023500	I think the other thing to...
3023500	3029500	You know, one of the ways I think it's useful to think about this is that governments,
3029500	3034500	for very understandable reasons, going back to what we were talking about inflation, they
3034500	3037500	want electricity to be affordable.
3037500	3038500	They want to be cheap.
3038500	3039500	Rightly so.
3039500	3047380	Well, in general, doing stuff at rock bottom prices to consumers isn't normally a recipe
3047380	3048500	for massive profitability.
3048500	3053100	I mean, I know that's a generalization, but it's worth keeping in mind.
3053100	3060540	And so what's happened is that governments have designed electricity markets and they
3060540	3065540	have designed the support mechanisms that they provide to renewables operators precisely
3065540	3073900	in such a way as to maximize the likelihood that the economic gains associated with kind
3073900	3079460	of falling production costs thanks to China are not captured by nasty capitalist firms,
3079460	3082740	but they're passed on to consumers.
3082740	3086380	So what does that mean in terms of capitalist incentives to invest in those things?
3086380	3089780	Well, if they're not able to capture it, then of course they're not going to do it at the
3089780	3094940	scale we want because they're being passed on to consumers, which is what we want.
3094940	3099460	But I mean, there's politicians that don't stay honestly, and it's something I just,
3099460	3102300	my mind is blown every time I think about it, but it's particularly a problem on the
3102300	3103300	center left.
3103300	3107140	But a problem in the center is they genuinely seem to think that private enterprises do
3107140	3108660	things out of the goodness of their heart.
3108660	3109660	Yeah.
3109660	3110660	I mean, it's...
3110660	3111660	It's just wild.
3111660	3114140	They want to make lots of money and they want to make as much money as possible.
3114140	3115140	And here's the other thing, right?
3115140	3116140	As quickly as possible.
3117140	3121180	And the other point I would make before we get, before if we want to get into the meat
3121180	3127580	of it is this, which is that profitability, economic returns are always a relative phenomenon
3127580	3128860	rather than an absolute phenomenon.
3128860	3135580	And what I mean by that is that for any capitalist actor, there is always a kind of palette of
3135580	3139060	different investment opportunities available to them.
3139060	3145180	And so it's much more, so I give some figures in the book around kind of the average profitability
3145220	3150540	of renewables deployment, which of course varies across time and space, but most studies
3150540	3154140	point to somewhere in a region of kind of five to 8% returns.
3154140	3158380	Now, in isolation, that number doesn't really mean anything.
3158380	3162380	It only really means anything if you think about the alternative returns that are available
3162380	3164540	to the relevant actors from doing different things.
3164540	3169820	Now, and I want to just give two sort of comparators that I think are really valuable
3169820	3171060	to think about.
3171060	3175700	The first of those is this, which is to say that five to 8% look pretty good when interest
3175700	3176980	rates were zero.
3176980	3183820	But when interest rates are like 5%, and you can get five, six, even 7% returns from sticking
3183820	3191020	your money in the bank or investing it in US risk-free US government bonds, why on earth
3191020	3199180	would you go to the hassle of building a wind farm with the major risk that investment entails
3199180	3203700	when there are risk-free opportunities available to make essentially the same returns?
3203700	3204700	That's the first comparator.
3204700	3206020	Really important to think about.
3206020	3211380	And that's one of the reasons why the industry is really struggling right now is because
3211380	3214980	of the macroeconomic environment has changed fundamentally in the last couple of years
3214980	3216980	with the uptick in inflation and interest rates.
3216980	3218580	So that's the first comparison.
3218580	3223980	Second comparison is to focus on, you know, perhaps the key constituency that governments
3223980	3231460	in their wisdom, let me use that word advisedly, have been kind of assuming would take the
3231460	3235060	lead on the renewable transition, which is the big oil and gas companies.
3235060	3240100	So they've been hoping that the BP's and the Shells and the Exxons would kind of magically
3240100	3243860	transition away from oil and gas to offshore wind.
3243860	3250180	They know how things work offshore, they'll switch their rigs for offshore wind farms.
3250180	3256300	Well, over the last 10 years or so, those companies have not got out of bed for oil
3256300	3260620	and gas projects that deliver anything less than 15% returns.
3260620	3263380	That's what they expect and that's what they get.
3263380	3268060	And the idea that companies that are used to 15% plus returns in their core business
3268060	3273620	are somehow going to make the decision to switch to businesses with returns like a third
3273620	3276420	of that level is absurd.
3276420	3280500	It's economically madness to think that that's going to happen.
3280500	3285420	And here's the kicker, as long as they think that those above average returns are going
3285420	3287540	to continue to be available, right?
3287540	3294420	If they thought that those 15% returns are going to disappear because of, for example,
3294420	3300100	meaningful government action on things like carbon taxes, then of course they would think
3300100	3302340	about alternative investment options.
3302340	3307660	But everything that's happened in the last five years or so has shown those companies
3307660	3311940	that governments are not serious about clamping down on their traditional business.
3311940	3313500	In fact, the opposite.
3313500	3318060	Governments like the UK's but also elsewhere in the world are granting new oil and gas
3318060	3320020	exploration licenses willy-nilly.
3320020	3324540	So of course the BP's and the Shells having been talking quite a good game a few years
3324540	3328420	ago about transitioning are now like, why did we bother with that?
3328420	3330300	Governments aren't serious about this at all.
3330300	3334460	They have no intention of stranding our oil and gas assets any time in the next 20 or
3334460	3335460	30 years.
3335460	3338220	So we're just going to carry on as we can because we know those returns are going to
3338220	3339220	continue to be available.
3339220	3343100	And it's not just why would they adopt a lower rate of return.
3343100	3346420	It's why would they spend a hell of a lot of money?
3346420	3350700	Why would they invest in a whole different cadre of employee?
3350700	3355220	Why would they dump a whole bunch of human capital value with regards to like engineering
3355220	3357260	know-how and whatnot, get rid of all that?
3357260	3358260	So we can earn less money.
3358260	3359260	Nobody's going to do that.
3359260	3360260	No, of course not.
3361220	3365460	Again, it goes back to some core ideological presumptions of our political class and our
3365460	3369980	media class, which is that businesses always write, markets always work, and they literally
3369980	3372820	cannot get their heads around businesses do things for profit.
3372820	3373820	It's not profitable.
3373820	3374820	It's not going to work.
3374820	3376180	And something that's, it's not there in the book.
3376180	3378780	It's kind of implicit or maybe it is, maybe I didn't see it.
3378780	3379780	It's something I thought about a lot.
3379780	3382780	It's in my book when I talk about for the automated luxury of communism, when I talk
3382780	3389180	about energy is that you have with wind, with solar, with storage, permanent price decline.
3389220	3390780	So you have deflation.
3390780	3393100	And again, if you want to make a profit, that's a real problem.
3393100	3396540	Permanently falling prices is a really bad thing.
3396540	3400540	If you want to make money, it's great for the consumer.
3400540	3404580	But again, there's this tension isn't really obvious to people who are making the policies.
3404580	3405580	No, no.
3405580	3409140	And you listen to, you listen to the, you know, the labor government in waiting talking
3409140	3410700	about this.
3410700	3414340	And they're, and it's a really strange thing.
3414340	3421020	They're kind of like, well, we'll, we'll develop a new renewable energy generator, great British
3421020	3422260	energy.
3422260	3428100	And, and, and the whole idea behind it as, as they seem to be articulating it is like,
3428100	3430420	because the renewables business is swimming in profits.
3430420	3434660	And so we'll have this public entity that will capture those profits while delivering
3434660	3435660	really cheap energy.
3435660	3437780	And it's like, what are you talking about?
3437780	3439260	So it's not swimming in profits?
3439260	3440780	No, no, it's absolutely not.
3440780	3443820	And that's why the investment isn't happening.
3443820	3448500	And actually one thing, one thing that you, that you mentioned just now is, is, is one
3448500	3450740	of the important explanations for why that is.
3450740	3453540	And so let's, let's talk about that.
3453540	3459740	So you were, you were saying, look, the prices have been consistently coming down and, and
3459740	3464540	they have the, that, that chart, that chart I talked about in terms of the cost of generating
3464540	3468580	electricity from wind and solar shows consistent price declines.
3468580	3472860	And so you would think, so let's imagine you are a wind energy generator and you've been
3472900	3475220	in business for like 20 years.
3475220	3481780	And as your, as your costs go down, you're generating costs go down over time.
3481780	3485700	Simple economics would say, well, my costs are going down the cost of genera, of actually
3485700	3487620	generating the power.
3487620	3491540	So my profits are going to be going up accordingly, fine, you know, lovely jubbly.
3491540	3500300	But that assumes that you have the capacity to capture and privatize those growing economic
3500300	3501300	efficiencies.
3502300	3508020	The reality of the, of the electricity sector is that you now in many, in many, if not most
3508020	3512820	parts of the world, but certainly in the UK, the electricity generation sector, which is
3512820	3516740	largely a self-standing sector, it's been cleaved off from transmission and distribution
3516740	3518060	and retail.
3518060	3524380	And in particular, the renewable energy generation sector is incredibly competitive.
3524380	3527540	There are thousands of entities in that market.
3527540	3532660	They compete purely on price, selling into really, really competitive wholesale markets.
3532660	3539340	So what happens when price, when, when costs decline, well, they compete those cost gains
3539340	3545260	away and those cost gains get passed downstream to transmission and distribution entities
3545260	3550780	and retailers and in large part all the way to consumers, precisely in the way governments
3550780	3552380	hope they do.
3552380	3558580	But if generators can't capture and privatize the upsides of those growing cost efficiencies,
3558580	3562180	why would they invest in their technologies in the first place?
3562180	3565820	Because they know that because of that competition, I mean, Mark's called it the coercive law
3565820	3567740	of competition, right?
3567740	3573140	They're coerced to engage in this activity, but competition forces them to pass those
3573140	3575100	things downstream.
3575100	3579500	And we have, you know, in the UK, many people will have heard of the subsidy scheme that
3579500	3586140	exists for, for wind, for offshore wind, in particular in the UK, which is the contracts
3586140	3587980	for different scheme.
3587980	3592180	And as I said earlier, you have this kind of, you have this intensification of competition
3592180	3593740	which is built into that system.
3593740	3597700	So it's worth just talking a little bit about how that happens.
3597700	3601100	So if the government says, okay, we're going to award these new offshore wind licenses
3601100	3606900	off for new renewables development, what happens is that different generating companies will,
3607420	3611660	there's an auction process where effectively what happened is they bid against each other
3611660	3616060	for this contract where the government will say, the government or a government backed
3616060	3621940	entity says, we will, we, we enter this contract to buy the electricity that you generate at
3621940	3626260	a fixed price, essentially a fixed price for the next 12 years or so.
3626260	3631820	And so one company will bid for, will bid and say, well, we'll bid, we'll, we'll enter
3631820	3635500	that contract with you at 50 pounds per megawatt hour for the next 12 years.
3635500	3638300	Another company will say 49, the next one will say 48.
3638300	3642620	And essentially what happens is they bid it down until it gets to the point where no one
3642620	3645420	can bid any lower because they won't make any money out of it.
3645420	3650500	So that's what I mean is that this price based competition is baked into the, is baked into
3650500	3656420	the process for good reasons on the consumer side, because that's what you want as a government
3656420	3661980	is keeping electricity prices down, but the profit, the potential profitability for generators
3661980	3663580	just gets, gets competed away.
3663660	3666220	I mean, what you're talking about there with regards to the auctions as well, I mean, it
3666220	3667860	applies to outsourcing companies too.
3667860	3671820	I mean, the reason why Carillion blasts from the past, you know, they collapse because
3671820	3676180	they kept on basically taking contracts, they couldn't make money because they were taking
3676180	3677180	all these jobs.
3677180	3678180	Everybody else was like,
3678180	3681340	I wouldn't touch them with a barge, but you're going to, you're going to bust if you carry
3681340	3682340	on like that.
3682340	3683340	And guess what happens?
3683340	3686380	They go bust and the, the people that are on the hook with a taxpayer and you don't have
3686380	3691380	to go bust for that to be a problem, whether it's Sodexo, Circa, Capita, whatever, G4S,
3691380	3695420	they get in these outsourced contracts with local councils and the price is so low.
3695420	3698660	They can only make money if they do an absolutely, guess what, shit job.
3698660	3699660	Exactly.
3699660	3702860	And if they destroy people's labor conditions, that's the only way they're going to make
3702860	3703860	money.
3703860	3706620	But you have the political class going, this is how we get value for money for the taxpayer.
3706620	3708500	No, it means they do a crap job.
3708500	3709500	People are laid off.
3709500	3711820	The firm might even go bankrupt and you socialise the risk anyway.
3711820	3712820	Yeah.
3712820	3718380	And in the renewable sector, again, you have to do something kind of clever to make profits
3718380	3722060	and so it becomes a question of like financial engineering, you know, what can you do with
3722060	3725660	on the debt side in terms of securitising it and that sort of thing.
3725660	3728940	And they kind of get forced into that because you can't make money just out of the, you
3728940	3731660	can't make good money out of the contract because the competition is so intense.
3731660	3732660	It was so interesting.
3732660	3734820	It was massively interesting.
3734820	3739300	Just how neoliberalism with regards to these low margin industries is just so stupid, so
3739300	3741260	destructive, so deeply destructive.
3741260	3742260	Yeah.
3742260	3745740	I mean, the other way I like to put it, that I like to put it is that, and it's like in
3745740	3748940	a one sentence is like, there's no OPEC in the electricity sector.
3748940	3758540	So I mean, OPEC in oil and gas exists in significant part to have price control, to keep prices
3758540	3764900	and profitability up, so if there's the danger of a kind of supply glut, they tell the members
3764900	3770420	of OPEC, you know, close the taps for a bit to keep prices and therefore profits up.
3770420	3774180	Well, there's nothing like that in the electricity sector.
3774180	3779660	Which is, again, kind of good from a consumer perspective, but in terms of incentivising
3779660	3782580	investment is a different question entirely.
3782580	3787380	The thing about, we were talking with regards to the falling costs of solar, I think it's
3787380	3789020	called Swanson's Law, isn't it?
3789020	3790020	Something like that.
3790020	3791020	Something like that, yeah.
3791020	3793420	And this is an all outgrowth of what's called the experience curve.
3793420	3796780	If you double the production of something, then the price of manufacturing falls by like
3796780	3797780	15.
3797780	3800300	Yeah, and solar has come down a huge amount, massive amount.
3800300	3804620	And so that trend is going to carry on, I mean, that's kind of inarguable, it might
3804620	3806140	slow down, but it's going to get cheaper.
3806140	3808740	I think it has slowed down a lot, but it should continue.
3808740	3809740	Yeah.
3809740	3813140	And just for people watching, it's not the same as Moore's Law, which is, you know,
3813140	3814140	exponential.
3814140	3817940	We're not talking about exponential price falls, we're talking about, you know, dramatic
3817940	3823420	falls, but not as dramatic as something like Moore's Law, you know, the halving or the
3823420	3827740	halving of costs every 18 months or the doubling of processing speed per dollar every 18 months.
3827740	3828740	No.
3829180	3834900	So, we've talked about Europe, we've talked about the US, we've talked about the failure
3834900	3837460	of markets to deliver with this stuff.
3837460	3841620	So what is the proposal then?
3841620	3847820	Because you've argued that competition makes sense from the perspective of the consumer,
3847820	3851860	but then you've also said that competition and falling prices are at odds with profitability.
3851860	3855820	And if we're having a private market system for this, then you need to have profits.
3855900	3859140	So, how do we administer electricity or energy, which is cheap?
3859140	3860140	Yeah, it's a great question.
3860140	3861620	But from renewable sources too.
3861620	3863540	Yeah, it's a great question.
3863540	3868820	And I think that, you know, I'll be completely honest about this and say that I don't have
3868820	3869820	the answer.
3869820	3877140	I think I have a perspective on the range of answers that exists, if that makes sense.
3877140	3882060	And so, I think what's useful potentially for viewers is to understand the kind of range
3882180	3888780	of main answers that are out there and then to judge for themselves based on some commentary
3888780	3892980	that I make on each of those answers.
3892980	3899100	And so, there are essentially three main answers out there.
3899100	3907420	But I'll caveat this or preface it by saying all of what I'm going to talk about here are
3907500	3911660	answers that are kind of on the supply side, by which I mean, they're all answers that
3911660	3921060	are oriented towards boosting investment in solar and wind capacity.
3921060	3928060	On the assumption that you continue to need to do that because there are those existing
3928060	3929860	profitability constraints.
3929860	3934340	And of course, there are other answers out there, you know, people who are of a kind
3934380	3938140	of degrowth persuasion would say, actually, we need to be thinking about the demand side
3938140	3941580	as well and curbing energy consumption.
3941580	3946220	And I think that there's a lot of truth in that argument as well.
3946220	3951100	But I'm not going to go there today, but clearly any answer that is going to be even close
3951100	3955260	to sufficient is going to have to address the supply side and the demand side.
3955260	3962140	Also, you know, the other argument will be, hang on a second, we historically globally,
3962140	3968580	not just in the West, but globally, in order to try to make renewables more competitive,
3968580	3975780	the way we have typically done that is by working on the renewable side, offering subsidy
3975780	3981860	mechanisms, support mechanisms on, rather than taxing the dirty side.
3981860	3983620	You know, that's essentially what we've done.
3983620	3986580	We've thought, OK, we'll do that.
3986580	3990500	And so economists, mainstream economists will say, well, actually, the answer is that,
3990500	3994260	you know, the externalities associated with fossil fuels are not being properly priced.
3994260	3999380	And so the answer is to price those externalities properly.
3999380	4004060	And again, I think that I understand that argument, but obviously that's a politically
4004060	4007580	very difficult argument because we live such carbon intensive lifestyle.
4007580	4014340	So if you start taxing that, it really hurts consumers in terms of inflation.
4014340	4019340	And I think that's the main reason why we haven't gone there is that politicians are
4019340	4021540	very, very, very concerned about that.
4021540	4026740	They don't want consumers to be hurt through higher inflation because of the carnivorous
4026740	4031180	nature of the consumer baskets that we all have in our lifestyles.
4031180	4036580	So with that said, the three main solutions that are out there in terms of boosting the
4036580	4042420	support, you know, boosting the speed of the energy transition on the renewable side are
4042420	4045340	and not surprisingly, they're associated with three different kind of interest groups
4045340	4047100	for want of a better term.
4047740	4051700	And they're all interesting and they all have their merits as well as their drawbacks,
4051700	4052700	I think.
4052700	4057580	So the first answer is the one that you hear from sort of mainstream energy economists.
4057580	4063180	So economists who are trained in orthodox economics and they're focused on energy markets.
4063180	4067420	Great people to talk to you because they at least, unlike a lot of my colleagues on the
4067420	4073140	left know the energy markets, they really know what they're talking about there, although
4073140	4077220	they look at them through certain in certain blinked ways, I would argue.
4077220	4082500	So what they argue is, look, the problem is not that we're relying on the private sector
4082500	4086780	and the profit motive and markets to do this, of course, they wouldn't, they don't say that.
4086780	4087780	That's fine.
4087780	4092180	What they argue is that the problem is that the market design is not right.
4092180	4097580	So what they would say is that, is that, and I have some sympathy with this argument because
4097620	4104420	they're right when they say that electricity markets as they exist worldwide today are market
4104420	4109860	mechanisms that were designed essentially in a fossil fuel world and they haven't really
4109860	4112660	been changed in the last 20, 30, and that's true.
4112660	4113660	They haven't.
4113660	4116380	They're pretty much the way they've always been.
4116380	4121420	And they argue and it's understandable, they say, look, we just need to redesign those
4121420	4126380	market mechanisms, rethink the way we price electricity and wholesale and retail markets,
4126380	4129180	and then everything will fall magically into place.
4129180	4133260	But of course, economists always say that, that's the answer to every problem, which
4133260	4137420	is that the problem with markets is not that we have markets, the problem is that we haven't
4137420	4138420	got them right yet.
4138420	4139420	We haven't perfected them.
4139420	4142340	We haven't optimised them.
4142340	4146540	And also there are lots of recommendations out there circulating in different forums
4146540	4148740	for how you might do that.
4148740	4154300	But all of them have distinctive drawbacks as well as potential advantages associated
4154300	4155300	with them.
4155700	4156700	That's that answer.
4156700	4159940	And as I said, I have some sympathy with that argument, but I'm definitely not convinced
4159940	4160940	by it.
4160940	4163220	The second answer is, again, is very, very interesting.
4163220	4168940	And that's the answer you typically hear from the energy industry itself.
4168940	4173140	And so what they say, obviously they agree with economists that the problem is not that
4173140	4177420	we're relying on the private sector markets, but where they disagree largely with economists
4177420	4180460	is they don't think the problem is in market design.
4180460	4182060	They say, no, that's fine as well.
4182060	4184980	Just keep existing markets as they are.
4184980	4188100	The problem is that the subsidies to renewables aren't big enough.
4188100	4193740	So they basically say, look, keep everything as it is, but just like double the support
4193740	4197980	mechanisms may provide more of it and make them more attractive.
4197980	4202700	And that's what the Inflation Reduction Act was in the renewable sector.
4202700	4209900	Industry had been saying to the US government, you have been attenuating the subsidies you
4209900	4213540	provide us with lowering the level of tax credit.
4213540	4214700	And it's stagnating.
4214700	4217260	That's what you get if you do that.
4217260	4218260	Lift it back up.
4218260	4219860	And so that's what the government did.
4219860	4221980	We get to see whether that will have the desired impact.
4221980	4228420	But that was, in my view, was all about re-inflating profitability in the renewables industry to
4228420	4233980	re-attract investment into that sector, very, very straightforward actually.
4233980	4242300	And I have some sympathy with that as well, because if the totality of our options is the
4242300	4246900	private sector, what else are you going to do?
4246900	4249100	That would work, is what you're saying, in your opinion.
4249100	4250460	I think it probably would.
4250460	4257100	If you essentially guarantee profits, and if those profits are attractive in relative
4257100	4262060	terms according to the different alternatives that are out there, then, yeah, money will
4262060	4263060	flow in.
4263060	4264060	Absolutely.
4264060	4271420	I mean, it would be really costly for the consumer and or the taxpayer in some combination.
4271420	4274140	But I think it would work if the government did that enough.
4274140	4278020	But obviously, there's huge reluctance to do that for all sorts of reasons.
4278020	4281180	Not just the cost to the consumer, you don't want to see it be seen to be lining the pockets
4281180	4283740	of nasty big capital.
4283740	4284740	That's the second option.
4284740	4291140	The third option is the one that those on the left will typically say, which is to say,
4291140	4294260	the problem is that we're relying on the private sector and markets to do this.
4294260	4295740	It doesn't work.
4295740	4301140	We've been doing it for 30 years, still isn't working, still going much too slowly.
4301180	4307180	Let's try something different by which they normally mean, or we, if I count myself in
4307180	4317260	this group, normally mean mass public sector ownership and investment in renewable energy.
4317260	4320700	The argument being that the private sector and markets isn't working, isn't being shown
4320700	4327820	not to be working, even though that all these subsidies continue to be available worldwide.
4327900	4335700	That's a really, in many ways, at least on the face of things, a very attractive option.
4335700	4339700	If you think about it like this, so go back to what I was saying earlier about five to
4339700	4345220	eight percent returns, well, if five percent, eight percent returns are not sufficiently
4345220	4350940	attractive to draw in mass private sector investment on a significant scale, you would
4350940	4355060	imagine that returns of five to eight percent would be perfectly attractive for the public
4355060	4356060	sector.
4356820	4361940	Presumably, if you are a government, you would just be happy with an investment that kind
4361940	4367740	of covers the cost of capital, and if it doesn't do any more than fine, why would you need
4367740	4369500	any more than that?
4369500	4378540	In principle, I think that that is a very attractive option, but of course, there are
4378540	4385300	obstacles of all sorts of different nature, of an ideological nature, clearly.
4385300	4392740	The fact that the idea that the private sector can't or shouldn't do this is anathema to
4392740	4402140	the political class in large parts, not just of the West, but of the world more generally.
4402140	4409460	Governments around the world, including in what, by global standards, are rich countries,
4409460	4414140	have persuaded themselves or allowed themselves to be persuaded that they don't have the fiscal
4414180	4418820	capacity to carry out that type of investment, they need to be fiscally conservative, it's
4418820	4423580	all about tightening belts, you can't grow the public balance sheet, even if it is to
4423580	4427900	invest in revenue-generating assets, and I don't really buy those arguments, but those
4427900	4434980	arguments are very, very powerful, and it seems right now, at least, that very few mainstream
4434980	4439700	parties at least are even willing to count on any departure from that kind of economic
4439700	4440700	orthodoxy.
4441260	4448540	So, while I think that it's a credible proposition for rich countries, it doesn't seem very likely
4448540	4450220	that it's going to be happening any time soon.
4450220	4455540	Any talk of public sector ownership of energy in places like the UK is, any propositions
4455540	4458660	along those lines are very, very limited, very, very small scale.
4458660	4460220	Stam has killed it, right?
4460220	4461220	Basically, yeah.
4461220	4466700	It means overtly saying, this will be the market, we're not the Tories, but it will be the market.
4467420	4471500	Which means that, as we were talking about earlier, great British energy such as it is,
4471500	4475060	or such as it might be, what's the point?
4475060	4480300	It's going to be a bit-part player in a private market that is completely unchanged, so it
4480300	4483220	will just be like another private sector player, basically, and it probably won't even do it
4483220	4485620	as well as those in the private sector.
4485620	4489460	What's the point of doing it on a small scale if you're not doing something fundamentally
4489460	4490460	different?
4490460	4494940	There's no point, in my view, there's literally no point in public sector ownership unless
4495180	4500660	you are enabling and incentivising that actor to do something fundamentally differently
4500660	4501660	from a private sector.
4501660	4503860	Otherwise, there's no point, just let the private sector do it.
4503860	4506860	It's going to be a private sector actor which pays shit wages to people.
4506860	4507860	Probably.
4507860	4508860	And does a shit job.
4508860	4509860	Yeah, that's what's going to happen.
4509860	4510860	Yeah, of course.
4510860	4513980	Best case scenario, it will be mediocre market actor and it will be privatised by the Tories
4513980	4514980	in 15 years.
4514980	4515980	That's what's going to happen.
4515980	4516980	Best case scenario.
4516980	4517980	100%.
4517980	4518980	Yeah.
4518980	4519980	There's no point.
4519980	4524420	Unless you're going to do it on a large scale with the ambition to do something fundamentally
4524420	4527420	differently, there's no point in doing it in my view.
4527420	4531300	The only argument for doing it would be that it's like a wedge in the door and that then
4531300	4534620	you can build on it potentially.
4534620	4539940	Maybe that's the grand plan that's not being talked about, but I'm doubtful anyway.
4539940	4542580	But the other thing about public sector ownership, I think, the only other thing I would like
4542580	4552620	to say about that is that even if it is theoretically, to my mind, quite credible and possible in
4552620	4556540	the relatively rich parts of the world, it's a different matter entirely in going back to
4556540	4558460	where we started our conversation.
4558460	4564980	In those parts of the world where investment is most vital, if you're talking about those
4564980	4570100	countries in the global south that we were talking about, the idea that governments in
4570100	4578900	those parts of the world, which are struggling under infinitely more severe fiscal constraints
4578900	4584780	than the governments of the US or Germany or the UK, are going to kind of borrow cheaply
4584780	4591420	on the capital markets for investment in public ownership of renewables, ain't going to happen.
4591420	4596340	You could say we're going to recalibrate the provider of the World Bank and so it's not
4596340	4599260	like implausible, but it's not going to happen right now.
4599260	4600260	No.
4600260	4601260	It's definitely not going to happen right now.
4601260	4607100	But you would need to give it insofar as the fact that, for example, many of those
4607100	4615580	countries are kind of staggering under huge existing debt servicing obligations from the
4615580	4622300	past, those would have to just be written off essentially in order to enable that kind
4622300	4624300	of new investment to take place.
4624300	4628300	So it's a big ask politically as well as economically.
4628300	4630860	Speaking of the kind of austerity arrangements, and I find this quite funny, it's a bit of
4630860	4638260	a tangent, but you have in Europe with the Eurozone and European monetary integration,
4638260	4642820	you've had since 1999, since there's been the Euro as a currency, the stability and
4642820	4647540	growth pact, which all the members of the European Union actually, I think, have to
4647540	4652420	adhere to, one of the major parts of that is to not run deficits of more than 3%.
4652420	4655660	Now of course, if your economy is growing at 3%, 4% and you've got inflation of 3%,
4655660	4660980	4%, a deficit of 3% forever is absolutely fine actually.
4660980	4664940	But what's really interesting is they suspended it in 2020, I don't know if you saw the story,
4664940	4670780	they suspended it in 2020, and it's only going to come back now, I think it was 2020 to 2023.
4670780	4676980	And over that time frame, Italy's GDP per capita grows quickly as the United States,
4676980	4680460	because there was loads of public sector investment in really important infrastructure.
4680460	4685620	And now the European Union is saying to Italy, you can't run deficits anymore, and if you
4685620	4689100	don't, we'll sanction you, and you think, fuck, they've just literally been growing
4689100	4694100	at their best clip in 25 years, but their stupid little brains can't get around it.
4694100	4700060	On the point you said about public ownership, and again, it's like an ideological default
4700060	4702740	now, which people do not understand.
4702740	4704540	The idea of public ownership making money.
4704540	4705540	Absolutely.
4705540	4709580	It's only going to be us sinking money, losing money.
4709580	4712380	You're talking about investing in revenue generating assets.
4712380	4713380	What's the problem with that?
4713380	4716460	I mean, if you look at, for instance, where I live, Portsmouth, I did an article about
4716460	4721220	this recently, you've got Portsmouth International Port, which was built in the early 1970s.
4721220	4727540	The idea of a city, a medium sized city like Portsmouth, building infrastructure like that
4727540	4731620	today in partnership with the private sector is just like implausible.
4731620	4735260	So they built Portsmouth International Port, I think it adds a couple of hundred million
4735260	4738420	to the national economy, it employs 5,000 people.
4738420	4740500	Last year it made eight million pound profit.
4740500	4742780	It's publicly owned, right?
4742780	4747800	And basically, since it's been built and it's not been privatized, that has basically
4747800	4751460	meant hundreds of millions of pounds going to local people in Portsmouth.
4751460	4754660	It means lower council tax and it's paid for a ton of services.
4754660	4760220	Up there in Southampton, where the airport's privatized, guess what, the city's busts.
4760220	4765940	But people were spending too much, or maybe actually it's about ownership and you're
4765940	4767740	not owning the things that make cash.
4767740	4768740	100%.
4768740	4771820	And there are two things I would add to that.
4771820	4778580	One of them is, you mentioned parenthetically, which is, you said it's built by the public
4778580	4780700	sector in collaboration with the private sector.
4780700	4783540	So lots of people, when you talk about public sector ownership of energy, they say, well,
4783540	4786500	the public sector can't do that, public sector doesn't have the capacity and the expertise.
4786500	4789900	You don't have to build it yourself, you just give a contract to someone to the private
4789900	4790900	sector to build it.
4790900	4794660	It's the ownership that matters, you don't have to build it, it's the capacity.
4794660	4798460	And then the second thing is, they're like, well, then the public sector will fuck up
4798460	4799460	the operation.
4799460	4802340	Or a wind and solar farm doesn't take much operation.
4802340	4805140	Once they're built, you don't have to do anything.
4805140	4809060	Occasionally a rotor will stop turning and you have to send an engineer out with a screwdriver
4809060	4810220	to get it going again.
4810220	4811580	But that's about it.
4811580	4814380	It doesn't take like a rocket scientist to run a wind or solar farm.
4814380	4818380	So the idea that the public sector can't do this is preposterous.
4818380	4821740	And I think about Southampton up the road.
4821740	4827020	Like I say, their bust, they're dimmed street lights in Southampton, like 20%.
4827020	4832580	They're going off an hour earlier and you think you've got the country's second biggest
4832580	4837900	commercial port after Felix, though, and it's in private hands and you're turning off the
4837900	4839300	fucking lights an hour earlier.
4839300	4841660	Like this is a madhouse.
4841660	4845500	Many people in Pompey would say Southampton's a madhouse, but for very different reasons.
4845500	4847860	They probably lose to their football team next year as well.
4847860	4849700	Well, Southampton might get promoted.
4849700	4850700	Oh yeah, they're in the final.
4850700	4851700	Good point.
4851700	4852700	They might get promoted.
4852700	4855540	I don't want them to get promoted for people who aren't aware, but Portsmouth has just been
4855580	4860300	promoted to the championship and thanks to our in that league as well.
4860300	4863700	So I mean, that to me is interesting, the idea of public ownership or something, which
4863700	4867260	is going to make money, which, you know, again, a lot of the public doesn't understand that.
4867260	4869980	It's not because the public are daft, it's because literally no politician other than
4869980	4875300	Jeremy Corbyn has actually even made tried to make the argument for 30 years, but it seems
4875300	4876580	to me like you're saying...
4876580	4879140	And Bernie Sanders in the US made the exact same argument.
4879140	4884820	We can have public ownership with a decent rate of return, really good social externalities
4884900	4885820	as they be called.
4885820	4886820	Yeah.
4886820	4887820	Yeah.
4887820	4888820	Decarbonizing.
4888820	4889820	What's the problem?
4889820	4890820	So what is the problem?
4890820	4891820	Well, I think it's ideological.
4891820	4894100	I mean, I think, I think that's, that's what it is.
4894100	4896900	But there's no special interest groups stopping them from doing that.
4896900	4897900	In the globe.
4897900	4902060	No, no, I don't think, I mean, except for the fact that, of course, behind the scenes,
4902060	4908020	the energy sector, the asset managers and so on, are telling them that they can't do
4908020	4911940	it for all those reasons that we've, that we've touched on already.
4912060	4916860	So it's not just, I mean, ideology is kind of created by interest groups to a significant
4916860	4922780	extent, but I don't think they, I don't think there are substantive economic arguments against
4922780	4925140	it in, in certain countries of the world.
4925140	4931180	And I think that it's much more challenging in parts of the world where, you know, absent
4931180	4939060	really significant transformations, but certainly in a place like the UK, it's completely, completely
4939060	4940060	credible.
4940180	4941180	Okay.
4941180	4943260	So it's public ownership, but it's public ownership without conflict.
4943260	4946540	It's not like you're saying, right, we're going to bring this stuff into public ownership.
4946540	4948700	It's literally saying, okay, well, we're going to build new capacity in the state.
4948700	4949700	It's going to do it in the state.
4949700	4950700	We'll own it.
4950700	4951700	Yeah.
4951700	4953940	You're not saying, okay, well, these water companies, they're, they're screwing up, they've
4953940	4956820	failed, screw them, because of course, their counter-argument is where your bills are going
4956820	4957820	to go up.
4957820	4958820	Right.
4958820	4961100	So it's, it's, it seems like a very low cost form of public ownership.
4961100	4962100	I think so.
4962100	4963100	Yeah.
4963100	4964100	No, I think so.
4964140	4971580	I think that, that's, that's where the kind of really interesting arguments are coming
4971580	4972580	from.
4972580	4977220	And, and, and there are some, some initiatives in that direction, not in the UK, but in, in,
4977220	4981020	in New York state, many people might have heard the, there's, there was a build public
4981020	4987100	renewables act that was passed last year, I think it was, which at least on paper looks
4987100	4992420	like it could be quite significant in terms of public ownership of electricity generation,
4993420	4998860	in New York state remains to be seen whether it will actually be actioned in significant
4998860	4999860	part.
4999860	5005340	You know, the, the, the, the degree to, you know, just because it's there on paper doesn't
5005340	5009020	necessarily mean it's actually going to, going to happen on the ground.
5009020	5014220	There are, there are lots of potential obstacles in the way of a political nature, but things
5014220	5015580	are happening on that front.
5015580	5019220	So there is reason, there is reason for hope, I think, on that front.
5019220	5024940	But I, you know, I think that of, of the three kind of options I outlined, that seems to
5024940	5032540	me at least, to be the one with the most potential, to get things, to get things going more quickly
5032540	5033660	than they currently are.
5033660	5039940	And that's the thing, that's the thing right is like every year matters on this, because
5039940	5044620	you know, every, every year with emissions that are higher than they need to be means
5044620	5048700	that extra little bit of carbon in the atmosphere or extra large bit of carbon in the atmosphere.
5049260	5051340	I just want to go back to something we were talking about earlier on.
5051340	5055380	I mentioned Scotland, which actually in terms of the percentage of electricity coming from
5055380	5057420	renewables is really impressive.
5057420	5058420	Yes.
5058420	5059660	And you said you want to talk about Scotland more.
5059660	5060660	Yes.
5060660	5061660	Please go ahead.
5061660	5062660	Good point.
5062660	5063900	I'd forgotten about that, but very, very good point.
5063900	5068460	So here's the interesting, here's the interesting thing and this, this, this point about the
5068460	5072940	geography of renewables, which is what I'm going to talk about, bears directly on that
5072940	5073940	question of profitability.
5073940	5078420	We were talking about earlier this, this kind of paradox of why renewables deployment
5078420	5081580	is not as profitable as people think it might be.
5081580	5083820	And part of the answer is the geography of this.
5083820	5090460	So in the UK, but not just in the UK, pretty much anywhere in the world you look, it's
5090460	5093780	the same in Sweden where I live, it's the same in China, it's the same in India and
5093780	5099900	also in Germany and the US, the, the, the recurring geographical feature that you see
5099900	5107260	about renewables is that wind and solar facilities tend to be located at the opposite ends of
5107260	5110740	the country to where most people live and most industry is located.
5110740	5115020	So in the, in, in Sweden, for example, the population is disproportionately located
5115020	5121220	in the south and all the wind power is up in the north, exactly the same in the UK.
5121220	5124860	Now there are two important things to, to understand about that.
5124860	5128020	Firstly is, is, is why that happens.
5128020	5134140	And then the second thing is what the implications are there, are there of that for the profitability
5134140	5136100	of renewables generators.
5136100	5139460	So why it happens, it happens for all sorts of different reasons.
5139460	5144500	And in the UK case, there are certain physical reasons about wind speeds and stuff like that.
5144500	5149340	But the main reason that happens everywhere is, is, is precisely because that's where
5149340	5151040	people don't live.
5151040	5156220	And if you are developing a wind or solar farm, one of your biggest costs is likely
5156220	5159500	to be land, is likely to be land costs, right?
5159500	5163520	Unlike conventional power plants, wind and solar facilities take up a huge amount of
5163520	5164520	land.
5164520	5167400	If you're going to be generating a lot of power, it's a huge amount of land.
5167400	5172160	And so all other things being equal, developers of renewables projects always will try to
5172160	5176280	cite their facilities where land is cheapest.
5176280	5181960	So take the, take the US case, for example, you know, the cost of land in, in, you know,
5181960	5188160	the northwest in, in, in, in Montana or something like that is like 1% of the cost in the east
5188160	5189160	coast.
5189160	5193360	So of course you're going to put your facility there because your land cost is cheaper.
5193360	5198440	And land costs, the cost of leasing or buy it, a part of that generating costs we talked
5198440	5201360	about earlier, that's, that's factored into that generating costs.
5201360	5205440	So the fact, those generating costs that come down so much, that includes land costs.
5205440	5208960	So that's why you get this geographical pattern.
5208960	5211200	Now what does that mean in terms of profitability?
5211200	5218200	Well, the thing is, is that if, if your facilities are located a very, very far away on average
5218200	5225480	from where the demand for that electricity is concentrated, then your facility is, is,
5225480	5231600	is, is, is exerting a disproportionate burden on the grid, on the, on the transmission and
5231600	5239800	distribution grid, because it's much more, you are, you are basically, it's much more
5239800	5244960	expensive to maintain a grid over long distances, obviously, than over short distances.
5244960	5248800	And the way that this works is that, is that grid operators, those that run the grid in
5248800	5254480	any case of the national grid in the UK, it, for the cost, that for all the costs of maintaining
5254480	5259400	that grid and upgrading it and improving it and adding to it, those costs are borne by
5259400	5264880	everyone who's part of, of the system, both on the consumption side and on the demand
5264880	5265880	side.
5265880	5269840	So on the consumption side, you at home and you pay your electricity bill, you are paying
5269840	5274000	for electricity to be generated, but you're also paying for it to be transported.
5274000	5277320	So your share of the grid costs, essentially, to where you live.
5277320	5279840	But generators are also charged for that.
5279840	5286760	And while they're not necessarily charged perfectly based on where they, where they
5286760	5293680	are based, but in general, they are charged much more the further they are away from where
5293680	5295640	demand for electricity is located.
5295640	5301240	So, renewables developers are essentially, because they're much more further away on
5301240	5304560	average in conventional power plants from where their electricity demand is located,
5304560	5307840	they have much higher transportation costs.
5307840	5311640	So the thing is, right, when, when those, those people focus on, when, when the analysts
5311640	5317920	focus on generating costs, low cost of renewables, it's actually a completely artificial cost
5317920	5321320	because it excludes those transportation costs.
5321320	5322440	And you can even say it better than that.
5322440	5327840	You can say the generating costs are only low because the transportation costs are high.
5327840	5329200	Do you see what I mean?
5329240	5333800	It's like you only have low generating costs because you have low land costs and you only
5333800	5338800	have low land costs because you're a million miles away from where the demand is located.
5338800	5342320	So you're going to have a huge burden on their transmission system and high transmission
5342320	5343520	charges.
5343520	5346880	So you may think that you're going to be really profitable because you're, because you're
5346880	5352080	generating costs are very low, but your transportation costs, which no one ever talks about, are
5352080	5353080	really, really high.
5353080	5358080	So the geography of this, the economic geography of electricity is unbelievably important.
5358080	5362000	That seems to have big implications for things like municipally owned renewable capacity.
5362000	5367040	So if I'm Andy Burnham and I'm the mayor of, you know, Greater Manchester, you know, great
5367040	5371480	Andy Burnham, great guy, he loves public ownership, you know, he's, well, he does now anyway.
5371480	5375200	He's all in favor of it, but obviously the land values of Manchester are relatively
5375200	5376200	high.
5376200	5377200	They're going up.
5377200	5378200	Yes.
5378200	5379720	And so all of a sudden, actually, it doesn't really make sense for him to be saying, I'm
5379720	5382160	going to use X amount of square kilometers to build.
5382160	5383160	Yeah.
5383160	5384160	Solar or wind.
5384160	5385880	No, two, two things to say about that.
5385880	5394200	So one is, and so a lot of the kind of hope that people have is for, is for kind of distributed
5394200	5401280	renewable energy generation that is not sort of one large scale facility that requires
5401280	5405880	lots of land, but is kind of rooftop solar, things like that, that is attached to households
5405880	5408760	because it doesn't have those land costs associated.
5408760	5413920	And so, and so, and so I, and I think that that, as I was mentioning earlier, like 30%
5413920	5419080	of the Chinese additions in 2023 were rooftop solar that don't have those land implications
5419080	5420080	attached in.
5420080	5424960	But in so far as you do need those large scale renewables facilities to kind of really bend
5424960	5429600	the curve on emissions, land is obviously a big issue precisely, as you say.
5429600	5435000	And so there are, there are countries in the world where precisely one of the things that
5435000	5440720	state authorities are doing in terms of enabling renew, private sector renewables development
5440720	5447360	is exactly on the land question is, is, for example, aggregating land ownership through
5447360	5453800	powers of expropriation, for example, to enable renewables developers to get their hands on
5453800	5457440	the land more readily and more cheaply than might otherwise be possible.
5457440	5462480	So I think that that's the way to think about it in the UK context would be that that's
5462480	5465720	the sort of thing that municipal authorities would have to be thinking about.
5465720	5469680	And of course, 40 years ago, it would have been much easier because the state owned much
5469680	5472160	more land than but it's privatized all of it.
5472160	5476920	But also suppose if you're if you're a big manufacturing region, so if you're, you know,
5476920	5481440	that belt in in Germany where you've got so much heavy industry or historically in this
5481440	5486680	country, you might say the West Midlands, you want, you've got these big factories,
5486680	5490080	you want to make lots of stuff and you want really cheap energy inputs, you're not going
5490080	5496840	to want, you know, a wind turbine next to Birmingham, or a or a or a set of solar cells
5496840	5501280	in Solihull, you're going to want the wind coming from the outer Hebrides, maybe the
5501280	5503360	sun coming from further to your south.
5503360	5506200	So that kind of quite progressive.
5506200	5507200	It sounds lovely.
5507200	5511120	We all love community ownership and, you know, small scale distributed fine.
5511120	5514960	And sometimes it's great, you know, my mother-in-law shares solar cells on her house that their
5514960	5515960	energy bills have collapsed.
5515960	5516960	Yeah.
5516960	5520360	But actually in terms of if you want to have a vibrant industrial sector, we want to manufacture
5520360	5521360	stuff.
5521360	5522680	So that's a big deal.
5522680	5523680	It is.
5523680	5524680	Yeah, absolutely.
5524680	5525960	No, you're absolutely right.
5525960	5537680	And I think that and I think that, you know, where where big commercial consumers of electricity,
5537680	5543280	the Amazons and the Microsofts and so on are investing in supporting the development
5543280	5546280	of large, large renewable facilities.
5546280	5549000	It tends to be a long, long way away from where people are living.
5549000	5553200	So they're building data centers in nor in parts of Norway, for example, where you can
5553200	5559120	have these huge server farms because land is precisely because land is relatively cheap
5559120	5564920	and they can build these huge renewables facilities that can be built at a relatively low cost.
5564920	5568720	And that's obviously very, very different in manufacturing regions of the world.
5568720	5569720	You mentioned Amazon.
5569720	5570720	Yes.
5570720	5571720	Microsoft.
5571720	5572720	Yes.
5572720	5577600	We're seeing apparently something of a revival of nuclear in the United States.
5577600	5579320	Yeah, I've been reading about that.
5579320	5584280	Obviously because Big Tech, Amazon, Meta as well, potentially, if they go into AI are
5584280	5587960	saying, look, we need lots of cheap energy and we've done the numbers and we think nuclear
5587960	5588960	makes the most of it.
5588960	5589960	Yeah.
5589960	5592360	And I think part and exactly part of that is the land cost.
5592360	5597040	You know, nuclear takes much less land than wind than wind and solar.
5597040	5602240	And again, it says partly it's the land cost issue, partly it's the nature of the energy
5602240	5603240	resources they want.
5603240	5604240	Right.
5604240	5610720	Wind and solar are intermittent renewable sources and so they can do certain things,
5610720	5616880	but you also, whether you are a company or a country, you also want a source of kind
5616880	5620520	of what's often called base load power, which is the source of power that you can always
5620520	5622520	turn on when you need to.
5622520	5629440	And nuclear is a very, very consistent, reliable, carbon-free source of base load power.
5629440	5630720	Should we have a nuclear in the UK?
5630720	5634080	I mean, it's kind of implicit at the start of the book because you talk about the percentage
5634080	5639240	of energy globally, which is coming from carbon and non-carbon sources, energy coming
5639240	5643320	from non-carbon sources when solar has gone up, but at the same time it's gone down from
5643320	5646400	nuclear and hydro-hydroelectricity, so actually the shares about the same.
5646400	5647400	Yeah.
5647400	5650320	I mean, I think that, I think that, you know, my view, I don't have a very strong view on
5650320	5656720	nuclear one way or another, you know, I think that, what do I think?
5656720	5662480	I think that governments, unless they're going to build this, all of this stuff themselves,
5662480	5664520	which I think they should be, to a significant extent.
5664520	5669320	But if they're not, they should be doing everything they can to incentivize the private
5669320	5673960	sector development of as much carbon-free stuff as possible.
5673960	5678720	And I think nuclear should absolutely be a significant part of that, as well as solar
5678720	5681080	wind, not instead of it, but as well as it.
5681080	5684480	Brett, such an informative conversation.
5684480	5686960	As ever, our first conversation was brilliant.
5686960	5687960	So was this.
5687960	5690720	Maybe we'll get you back on again sometime soon.
5690720	5691720	I hope so.
5691720	5692720	We'll do that.
5692720	5693720	Thanks for having me again.
5693720	5694720	Hugely enlightening.
5694720	5695720	Thank you.
5695720	5696720	Awesome.
5696720	5696740	Thanks for having me.
