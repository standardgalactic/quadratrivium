WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
what they cannot and will never understand is that what they and other liberals call populism

00:07.760 --> 00:13.920
is the political blowback, is political blowback against the social disruption that their policies

00:13.920 --> 00:18.800
have produced. They can't understand the connection between what they've done and populism.

00:23.440 --> 00:28.880
Today's guest is very much an original thinker. He's independently minded. Of course,

00:28.880 --> 00:33.040
everyone likes to think they're independently minded, but over the course of his career,

00:33.040 --> 00:38.880
he's pissed off just about everyone. He first shot to the forefront of the national conversation

00:38.880 --> 00:45.680
about 25 years ago, writing a trenchant critique of globalization and being entirely skeptical,

00:45.680 --> 00:50.400
pessimistic even, about the possibility of a successful war of occupation in either

00:50.400 --> 00:54.640
Afghanistan or Iraq. On both counts, he was proven right.

00:54.800 --> 01:01.600
Now he's turned his attention to the West. He says that the parties of recent decades,

01:01.600 --> 01:07.360
cultural, social and economic, are over that the status quo can't carry on that we're very much

01:07.360 --> 01:14.480
at a crossroads. So what next? He thinks the future will in many ways resemble the past.

01:15.280 --> 01:21.120
Perhaps things like religion, ultranationalism, maybe even feudalism might be on their way back.

01:22.080 --> 01:26.080
Big questions and different answers to what you'd hear elsewhere,

01:26.720 --> 01:30.960
but that's what we like here on Downstream. John Gray, thanks for joining us.

01:30.960 --> 01:34.240
Very pleased to be here, Erin. Very pleased to be talking to you today.

01:34.240 --> 01:40.240
We're very happy to have you. I just wanted to start by saying I first read you around 2001,

01:41.680 --> 01:47.520
Fullstone and thereafter Straw Dogs, but Fullstone I think was the first time I'd read you. I was 17.

01:48.320 --> 01:52.000
For me, that put you on the map. Obviously, you existed well before then and we'll talk about

01:52.000 --> 01:57.120
that as well. What was the response to that book? Because it was a very provocative thesis at the

01:57.120 --> 02:04.720
time, namely that globalization, ever larger swathes of the planet falling under the guise of

02:04.720 --> 02:10.960
liberal market capitalism isn't necessarily going to happen and maybe it has some big downsides and

02:10.960 --> 02:13.600
some people didn't quite agree with your conclusions, did they?

02:13.600 --> 02:20.000
Well, it was considered off the wall because it was published at a time

02:21.920 --> 02:30.080
when globalization as a mood and an idea and a profitable project was at a tight.

02:30.880 --> 02:34.560
So if I'd been calculating the time to do it, I wouldn't have done it then.

02:35.360 --> 02:43.680
And the reviews it got were without exception, with one exception, I think a friend took pity

02:43.680 --> 02:50.640
on me halfway through the process, but were all extremely negative. I mean, normally my books

02:51.520 --> 02:58.720
polarize people in a Marmite-like way. This didn't. Everyone hated it. And I thought at the time

02:58.800 --> 03:04.400
that, and I think I still think this, it simply went against the mood. The Cold War had ended,

03:04.400 --> 03:09.760
it was supposed to have ended in victory. Although even 10 years before I published

03:11.520 --> 03:19.200
False Dawn, I'd written in a conservative magazine a piece on Fukuyama's essay before he

03:19.200 --> 03:24.720
wrote the book. The essay came out in the fall of 1989 before the world came down,

03:25.680 --> 03:31.920
but very close to the time when it came down. I had written then that the coming collapse of

03:31.920 --> 03:37.440
communism, which I thought was going to happen, would be the resumption of history on very

03:37.440 --> 03:43.120
traditional lines. It would not be the end of history at all. I mean, I think I later joked it was

03:43.920 --> 03:48.560
rather like one of Beckett's stories where he, which contains the line, the end again.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.160
It wasn't the end of anything. It was the resumption of history because the Cold War was a rather

03:55.520 --> 04:02.400
anomalous period in which global politics, not completely because there were the non-aligned

04:02.400 --> 04:08.000
movements and so on and so forth, but was organized in a binary opposition between two

04:08.000 --> 04:12.160
Enlightenment ideologies. And that was very liberalism and communism. They both spring from

04:12.160 --> 04:17.840
the Enlightenment as a broad family of ideas. And liberalism appeared two of one, but I never

04:17.840 --> 04:26.560
thought that it had one because it was liberal. I'd knew some of the people in Poland who were

04:27.520 --> 04:35.280
and other East European countries who were working against the Soviet control of their

04:35.280 --> 04:41.600
countries. And some were intellectuals, but many were religious intellectuals. Some were Catholics.

04:41.600 --> 04:46.800
Many were nationalists. I mean, what brought down communism was not intellectual dissenting.

04:46.800 --> 04:52.960
It wasn't economic inefficiency. It was solidarity, the Roman Catholic Church and Baltic nationalism.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.920
Now, they were, so even before it happened, my interpretation of the weakness, the fragility

04:59.920 --> 05:06.400
and the ultimate collapse of the Soviet project was completely different from that of Western

05:06.400 --> 05:12.160
liberals. My interpretation of it was that what was happening, it was that these regimes were

05:12.160 --> 05:18.960
becoming illegitimate, even in Russia, ultimately. But before that, in communist Europe and in the

05:18.960 --> 05:25.440
Baltic states, they were becoming more and more illegitimate and hollow, even among their servants,

05:25.440 --> 05:32.240
even the elites were less and less willing to use force to rule. And that this was not because

05:32.240 --> 05:39.440
liberalism was spreading as a universal ideology. It was because in nationalist and religious and

05:39.440 --> 05:44.400
other traditions, particular traditions and particular forms of life and thinking in these

05:44.400 --> 05:49.920
different countries were reasserting themselves. So I never expected that it would turn into a

05:49.920 --> 05:57.280
universal liberal hegemony, not for a single moment. So when I 10 years later published

05:58.880 --> 06:04.000
False Dawn, I wasn't surprised either. I was surprised by the intensity and the

06:04.960 --> 06:11.040
consistency and the near uniformity of the negative reaction. But then I reasoned.

06:12.960 --> 06:18.080
That's because we're at the height of this project now. It'll take a while. And it took a long time,

06:18.080 --> 06:25.920
actually, it took almost till now, that the globalizing project would fragment partly for the

06:25.920 --> 06:33.200
it partly fragmented because of things I didn't anticipate, like the pandemic. Although I do say

06:33.200 --> 06:38.400
in Straw Dog, someone reminded me, I'd forgotten that if you have long term plans, don't ask your

06:39.040 --> 06:46.560
financial advisor, ask an epidemiologist. Because even then, 2001 or 2002, when it appeared,

06:48.640 --> 06:56.880
I'd been reading about the way plagues had had an impact on various junctures in history.

06:57.680 --> 07:04.720
So I hope it's a rather digressive answer to your question. But I think these thoughts then were so

07:05.360 --> 07:12.400
antagonistic to the ruling worldview at the time, and the ruling mood at the time,

07:12.400 --> 07:17.280
which is one of boosterism. Remember, one thing I've learned is this, is that if you have a

07:18.240 --> 07:28.720
a view which everyone accepts as being the truth, and it promises good things and is also profitable,

07:29.520 --> 07:35.520
which so if you if you talk to banks on those days, which I did a bit and you say to them,

07:35.520 --> 07:43.680
as I did, China will not become a liberal state will not happen. Why will it not happen? Because

07:43.680 --> 07:47.200
first of all, this is in the 90s, they looked at what happened in the Soviet Union, they're not

07:47.200 --> 07:56.160
going to repeat it. Secondly, it's a Leninist state and the judicial system and the courts are all

07:56.960 --> 08:02.400
subject to the party. It's not going to change. Thirdly, every enterprise that have any significance

08:02.400 --> 08:07.600
and generally big enterprise has party categories implanted in which we have to be consulted at

08:07.600 --> 08:11.920
every point. They're not going to permit a revolution and a liberal state could only come

08:11.920 --> 08:16.480
about in China by a revolution. So it's not going to happen. No one believed me. First of all,

08:16.480 --> 08:24.080
because it meant that the ruling worldview was false, which while worldviews last, which is

08:24.080 --> 08:30.880
sometimes not very long, they're very contagious. Group think heard thinking comes in. And secondly,

08:30.880 --> 08:34.960
it would have made them doubtful about the profits they were going to make. So when you have a

08:34.960 --> 08:41.840
conjunction of group think with the prospect of serious money being made, it's irresistible.

08:42.560 --> 08:50.000
So it goes on for as long as the profits seem to come in or as long as the underlying geopolitical

08:50.000 --> 08:55.680
tensions don't become too obvious, which they now have. So now we're almost into a position where

08:55.680 --> 09:01.440
de-globalization has become a cliche. We're almost in a position in which everybody accepts

09:01.520 --> 09:06.080
that globalization role, which it is in many important respects, but not all. Does that answer

09:06.080 --> 09:11.760
your question? It answers my question very well. I think for younger listeners and viewers,

09:11.760 --> 09:19.920
people younger than, say, 25, they will find it almost impossible to believe quite how distinctive

09:19.920 --> 09:25.360
and sincerely held the ideology you just said was. If you said to somebody,

09:26.080 --> 09:29.200
no, I don't think China will actually get more liberal. They would say, well, of course,

09:29.280 --> 09:33.200
they will have rising GDP, they'll be falling birthright. The bourgeoisie will emerge.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.440
And the bourgeoisie, they would say, they could do with a bit of Marxism on this,

09:37.440 --> 09:41.120
has always been liberal. It hasn't always been liberal. The bourgeoisie in Europe in the

09:41.120 --> 09:45.920
mid-20th century backed fascism, not liberalism. It's a complete historical myth.

09:45.920 --> 09:52.160
Well, yeah. Or you look at the rise of anarchism at the turn of the 20th century, late 19th century,

09:52.160 --> 09:55.840
the guy that killed McKinley. These were basically small business owners. They were radicalized members

09:55.840 --> 10:00.000
of the petty bourgeois. They were attracted to anarchism. The idea that they would fall

10:00.000 --> 10:06.240
in behind some sort of stolid progressive bourgeois ideology. Anyway, the funniest point

10:06.960 --> 10:12.000
for me was in about 1989, 1990, when I would say, what's going to happen

10:13.520 --> 10:18.160
is that history will go on as usual. And people said, you're an apocalyptic pessimist.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.480
So if you say things are going to go on as normal as they've always done,

10:23.440 --> 10:27.200
you're an apocalyptic pessimist. If you say they're going to change completely from what they've

10:27.200 --> 10:35.520
ever been, you're a realist. Now, when I was in Washington in the 89, 90, one of the things

10:35.520 --> 10:41.760
that happened then is that some of the big foundations that were backing foreign policy

10:41.760 --> 10:46.400
programs, these ones I knew were mostly on the right, pulled most or all of their money out.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.120
So was this like the Atlantic Council people? I can't remember now.

10:49.600 --> 10:54.080
Heritage, all of those people were getting them. They either cut it down or cut it off

10:54.800 --> 10:59.760
because they said it's not needed. We won. And we haven't just won for five years or 10 years

10:59.760 --> 11:05.120
or even a generation. We've won forever. So the idea that, I mean, this was what Fukuyama

11:05.120 --> 11:11.760
calls capital letter history, capital letter history, Hegelian history, Koyevian history.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.960
These were, that's to say, a certain idea, a certain conception of what it means to be recognized,

11:16.960 --> 11:25.120
to be seen as a human being had become universal, always in the process of becoming universal

11:26.400 --> 11:32.080
or near universal. And nothing could stop that. But it could be accelerated so that

11:32.080 --> 11:38.880
what I didn't anticipate until it began to be clear around about 2001, 2002, I suppose,

11:39.680 --> 11:43.520
is that the people who believed this would want to accelerate this inevitable process

11:43.520 --> 11:50.320
by regime change. That's to say, you could say the whole world is changing on these lines.

11:50.320 --> 11:53.680
There might be a few holdouts. There might be a few Taliban. There might be a few

11:53.680 --> 11:57.280
nationalists here and there. But basically, the whole world is accepting this idea,

11:57.280 --> 12:02.240
this big capital letter. But that's the way it's going to be. But if it's somewhat slower

12:02.800 --> 12:08.720
than we imagined, by then, more than 10 years after the fall of the wall, it was become,

12:08.720 --> 12:14.960
we can accelerate it by not just one, but a succession of wars of choice. Now, by the way,

12:14.960 --> 12:20.640
I don't say they were the only reasons or the only people who were pushing for these wars. There were

12:21.280 --> 12:26.640
military bureaucrats in the Pentagon, some of them. There were supposedly hard

12:28.560 --> 12:34.000
men and women thinkers and so on and tough guys of various kinds who, for their own reasons,

12:34.320 --> 12:39.840
wanted the war. But I don't think it would have happened. I was there a lot in those days.

12:39.840 --> 12:44.160
I don't think it would have happened without the new conservatives. They created the background.

12:44.160 --> 12:48.400
There were other people who supported it. It was a coalition of supporters of the war with

12:48.400 --> 12:53.120
different views. What changed, though, with all this? Because are you a fan of science fiction?

12:53.120 --> 12:57.200
Yes. Yeah. So you look at people like the Foundation series, or you look at Duke

12:57.200 --> 13:00.720
publishing the 50s and the United States. Now a movie. Yeah, two movies.

13:00.720 --> 13:07.520
Yeah, great. It was just a great book, and it has such a firm grasp on what the long span of

13:07.520 --> 13:14.640
history, how empires and enmity and all these primal things you're talking about, nations,

13:14.640 --> 13:20.400
religion. Not only that, but Dune is much more interesting to me than Asimov or Star Wars,

13:20.400 --> 13:24.320
because it's neo-feudal. Well, precisely. But it's in the distant, distant, distant future.

13:24.320 --> 13:28.320
But it's the feudal future. And one of the things about this...

13:28.560 --> 13:35.680
It's a very modern book, right? Yes. Well, a very 21st century or late 21st century book,

13:35.680 --> 13:39.840
because one of the things about one of the features of the worldview, and this was common,

13:39.840 --> 13:44.640
I think, to Marxism as well as liberalism, but certainly of that worldview was the idea of

13:44.640 --> 13:50.400
irreversible phases in history. If you'd gone through feudalism and into liberal capitalism,

13:50.400 --> 13:55.280
you could never go back. You can go back. Not exactly to feudalism, because that was, of course,

13:56.240 --> 14:00.400
an agrarian economy based on land, but you can go back to a set of social relations

14:01.040 --> 14:05.520
and political structures, which are very like feudalism. They're not quite feudalism. As you

14:05.520 --> 14:09.280
know, in my book, I discussed the arguments of some people in America who say, we've got feudalism.

14:09.280 --> 14:14.960
It's not quite feudalism. In some ways, it's worse than feudalism, because in feudalism,

14:15.840 --> 14:20.480
tremendous corruption, wars of religion, so on and so forth, power of the church,

14:20.560 --> 14:27.600
censoring ideas, and so on. They're all those kind of features, but you couldn't actually easily,

14:27.600 --> 14:33.040
not many people until the early modern period when feudalism began to fray. Not large numbers of

14:33.040 --> 14:37.760
people didn't fall out of the system altogether into freefall, which has happened in America.

14:37.760 --> 14:41.520
That's to say, you've got large numbers of people, hundreds of thousands or even millions,

14:42.080 --> 14:52.240
who are basically, apart from some bits of public welfare and charity and crime,

14:53.600 --> 14:59.840
have no position in society at all. That didn't happen. But in other respects,

15:00.880 --> 15:08.640
you can have, and according to some American critics of their own type of society,

15:08.640 --> 15:13.200
you do have a near feudal relation. So I think what's interesting about science fiction or the

15:13.200 --> 15:23.040
science fiction writers who did not accept an Asimov-like or a Star Wars-like view that

15:23.040 --> 15:26.240
these liberal ideas would spread not only all over the world, but all over the galaxy,

15:26.240 --> 15:31.680
all over the world. They thought that previous social forms involving things like, I mean,

15:31.680 --> 15:38.240
loyalties are a big thing in Dune, is it not? Hierarchy. People are told what they can do and

15:38.240 --> 15:46.480
not do. Religion or obligation of and shamanism of various kinds is there. Divination is there.

15:46.480 --> 15:51.920
Roman practice, they've reinvented. Even pre-futile has Roman elements as well in which

15:54.160 --> 16:00.480
divination and other practices were important. So I think there are, I think science fiction,

16:00.480 --> 16:06.000
I mean, I knew J.G. Ballard, who at one point in his life was a science fiction writer,

16:06.000 --> 16:11.200
who wrote other genres as well, of course. But I think science fiction of the best sort is a

16:11.200 --> 16:16.400
good lens to view the present. The great thing with the Foundation series is, and like you say,

16:16.400 --> 16:21.920
there's almost two competing visions of how history works, Foundation and Dune, is that

16:23.040 --> 16:27.760
it offers an amazing snapshot at how people thought, you know, this thing called, we now

16:27.760 --> 16:33.360
call it, in reflection, the great acceleration, permanently rising populations ever greater.

16:33.360 --> 16:39.200
Go on forever. Yeah, you know, because he talks about the, you know, the population of this

16:39.200 --> 16:43.200
ginormous empire. So that would be too big for the plant. You know, in the tens of billions and

16:43.200 --> 16:48.640
billions of billions of people, when in reality, what we know is in the 21st century, this plant's

16:48.640 --> 16:53.520
population, probably about 10 billion, and then start to fall. But like you say, they were making

16:53.520 --> 16:58.640
inferences from the early 1800s. It'll go from 10, 10 billion to 100. Yeah, this will go on forever,

16:58.640 --> 17:01.920
or of course it did. But there were two reasons they were wrong. I mean, the big expansion of

17:01.920 --> 17:09.360
population in human history was over two or 300 years, not two or 3000 years, let alone 30,000

17:09.360 --> 17:16.240
years. It happened as a, as a, as a byproduct, I think, of hydrocarbons of industrialization.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.440
So it was quite, it's quite brief, quite brief 300 years.

17:20.400 --> 17:25.840
Well, you know, my grandmother, my grandmother, she died at 98. She was born in a world where

17:25.840 --> 17:29.440
there were two billion people. She died this year. She died in a world where there are eight

17:29.440 --> 17:34.480
billion people. So that is incredible, right? The planet's population quadruples in the span

17:34.480 --> 17:41.520
of a person's life. Wow. So their idea was that that two or 300 years was a template for universal

17:41.520 --> 17:47.440
history forever after. Now one, back to nature, that things like that never happen in nature.

17:47.440 --> 17:52.720
You never have, in the natural order of things, it all, it all turns on the view that on the

17:52.720 --> 17:58.480
belief which liberals have, but never admit to, I never believe, liberals generally nowadays don't

17:58.480 --> 18:03.440
admit to ever having any of the beliefs they really do have, or that they've, that they've had in the

18:03.440 --> 18:08.640
past. It turns on the idea, which not only liberals, but some Marxists as well, have that

18:09.360 --> 18:16.320
the human animal can do a very con humanized nature or transcend nature. They might say, well,

18:16.320 --> 18:19.520
this might have been true in the days of Malthus. It might have been true in the days of the Roman

18:19.520 --> 18:25.040
Empire. Plagues might have been important in ancient Rome and so on, but why in a completely

18:25.040 --> 18:31.920
different perspective. What they didn't bring out was a feature I'd argued in rather rudimentary form,

18:31.920 --> 18:38.560
perhaps, in false stone, which is that the more integrated a global economy and a global

18:38.560 --> 18:45.520
civilization was, the more fragile it would be. I mean, until, I suppose the start of the 20th

18:45.520 --> 18:53.840
century, when you had a world flu epidemic, plagues weren't global because most of the human

18:53.840 --> 18:58.480
beings in the world lived in economies that were separate from each other. They didn't touch each

18:58.480 --> 19:03.440
other very much, and it's no accident that when you had big plagues in the ancient world, they

19:03.440 --> 19:10.720
were in Rome, which was an early experiment, if you like, in globalization and closely

19:10.720 --> 19:16.720
interconnected by trade. So they didn't take on board that the either in history, in earlier

19:16.720 --> 19:25.040
periods of history, like the Roman period, or in the natural, in the systems of nature,

19:25.040 --> 19:34.080
natural systems, growth of this exponential kind is never full stop, never permanent.

19:34.800 --> 19:39.040
It always comes to some kind of stop. I want to pick up on something that you said,

19:39.040 --> 19:41.840
because this is really fascinating. And it was one of those two or three insights of the book,

19:41.840 --> 19:47.600
which just really hit me. One was this idea that, and we've said it many times on this show,

19:47.600 --> 19:52.640
you know, we're reverting to a genre of capitalism, a kind of political economy,

19:52.640 --> 19:57.760
which in some ways resembles feudalism, gains in productivity only go to the top 1%,

19:58.400 --> 20:04.160
increasingly profits and revenues generated through asset ownership,

20:04.160 --> 20:08.560
renterism, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is not no arbitrage, not production.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.360
Yeah, exactly. Value, capture, not creation, blah, blah, blah. People have been saying this

20:11.360 --> 20:18.000
for like 15 years. What you say is that actually, in some ways, the system we have now is worse

20:18.000 --> 20:23.280
than feudalism. Can you explain why? Because I think obviously most people would disagree with that.

20:23.280 --> 20:31.200
Well, in one reason is the one I've already given you, but it's connected with the one reason is

20:31.200 --> 20:39.920
that large parts of the formerly productive population in Western countries, particularly

20:40.720 --> 20:47.920
United States, have no productive role in the society. And since their identities,

20:47.920 --> 20:57.360
their communities, but also their medical care and their incomes depend on their role in the economy,

20:58.160 --> 21:04.400
they have nothing basically. And one of the things they don't have is what people had in the

21:04.400 --> 21:08.800
feudal period. Of course, if you're a Marxist or a certain kind of liberal rationalist, you say

21:08.800 --> 21:14.000
that this is just an illusion that pacified them. Even though they knew the society around them

21:14.000 --> 21:19.920
was thoroughly corrupt, they still actually, I think, believed, I mean the evidences they believed

21:19.920 --> 21:26.560
that in the rationality of society, which was that it was an afterlife in which injustices

21:26.560 --> 21:30.160
would be corrected. It might also be hierarchical after and after, but it would be much better.

21:30.160 --> 21:34.560
By the way, the reason we know they believed this is that there were also radical and revolutionary

21:34.560 --> 21:39.280
millenarian movements in the Middle Ages, which said we do believe this, but we don't accept the

21:39.280 --> 21:49.600
society. So the millenarians in the proto-communists, if you like, in the late medieval early modern

21:49.600 --> 21:55.600
period were not atheists ever. They were eschatological Christians, that's to say they believed

21:55.600 --> 22:00.000
that they believed these legitimating rules. Now the difference now is that, I think, and this is

22:00.000 --> 22:06.400
new, but something that young people can, I think, understand. No one really expects now.

22:06.400 --> 22:11.280
Certainly no one's confident. Certainly no one thinks it's inevitable, but actually hardly anyone

22:11.280 --> 22:16.480
really expects the rest of their lives or their children's if they have children or their children's

22:16.480 --> 22:21.520
children's lives to be better than theirs. That's a fundamental change. It's a fundamental, a really

22:21.520 --> 22:29.040
profound change because the the militaristic ideology of increasing material well-being

22:29.600 --> 22:35.280
interlocked with the progressive ideology that each stage of emancipation society built on the

22:35.280 --> 22:41.040
previous one. So women get the vote, they're partially emancipated, still very unequal,

22:41.040 --> 22:47.920
but that can be remedied once that's happened. Prisoners can get basic rights, ethnic groups

22:47.920 --> 22:52.560
to struggle against colonialism. It was a kind of, it was a stadial theory, it was a theory of

22:52.560 --> 22:59.120
stages, and the assumption was that each stage that had been reached in the past would remain fixed,

23:00.400 --> 23:06.160
would remain there. Now one of the features of the 20th century, that was disproved in Europe,

23:06.160 --> 23:15.280
because Europe in the interwar period saw tremendous conflicts of ideologies and ethnicities

23:15.280 --> 23:21.200
and so forth. And when the Nazis then came, they swept away, not only, I mean they achieved,

23:21.200 --> 23:29.040
it isn't that they went from some kind of level of staircase three back to staircase two, they went

23:29.040 --> 23:35.440
to minus 20, sweeping away enormous amounts of what had been achieved before, sweeping away even

23:35.440 --> 23:43.120
the good bits of the Bolshevik civilization were swept away. But this is happening now as a

23:43.200 --> 23:48.560
common experience and not in the context of catastrophic wars necessarily. The common experience

23:48.560 --> 23:54.000
now is that there'll be many young people who will say to you, I'll never be able to afford to own

23:54.000 --> 23:59.520
a house. I can't even afford to rent in London. If one room in London is now over a thousand pounds a

23:59.520 --> 24:11.040
month, one room, I just can't do it. And they don't see a point in the future where that will be

24:11.040 --> 24:16.480
different. So it's most acute though, I mean if you have some kind of a job, if you have some kind

24:16.480 --> 24:22.720
of education, if you live in a country where there are, however semi-collapsed till some welfare

24:22.720 --> 24:29.440
institutions and NHS and with all of its problems and others, then people can sink into a mood of

24:29.440 --> 24:37.200
resigned hedonism, which I think is a common response. But if you're in, if you have nothing at all,

24:37.200 --> 24:43.360
if you live in a semi-collapsed of state of nature in a post-industrial

24:45.680 --> 24:52.080
part of the United States where there is epidemic drug use, then you'll have what is now in fact

24:52.080 --> 24:59.840
happening, which is huge levels of early death, falling longevity. I think longevity in Mississippi

24:59.840 --> 25:04.800
is roughly that of Bangladesh. Just building on what you said there, there's a great line in the

25:04.800 --> 25:09.440
book which basically says religion historically was the opium of the masses and now they're just

25:09.440 --> 25:13.440
being offered opium, fentanyl, oxy-concentrate. But before they were offered fentanyl, they were

25:13.440 --> 25:16.880
offered the future. Precisely. So this is the typology I sort of just want to quickly offer. So

25:16.880 --> 25:26.160
like you say, feudalism, you have eschatological afterlife, modernity, you have like you said,

25:26.160 --> 25:30.240
the future, world temporarily embarrassed millionaires, the sort of American ideology.

25:30.240 --> 25:35.200
And now, like you say, we don't even have that. There is no future. So you have high inequality

25:35.200 --> 25:40.800
potentially under all of these scenarios, personal income deprivation, suffering. But like you say,

25:40.800 --> 25:47.040
there are two big amelioratives in those first two categories, feudalism, pre-21st century

25:47.040 --> 25:51.680
capitalism, let's say, mid-20th century capitalism. And then now we have something quite distinct.

25:51.680 --> 25:56.320
And you also see this, I think, in the built environment. The built environment across much

25:56.320 --> 26:01.520
of the UK and the United States is just collapsing. It is collapsing. Literally in many cases.

26:01.520 --> 26:08.000
It's a visible expression of giving up on both faith and the future. We have buildings now

26:08.000 --> 26:12.160
built for 30, 40 years, which look like crap, don't really serve any purpose. And nobody

26:12.160 --> 26:16.160
thinks they'll be there three or four decades from now. And not only that, but they're becoming

26:16.160 --> 26:24.000
either toxic or fragile. With the cladding and the rack concrete. Let's think of a period though

26:24.000 --> 26:29.040
in our history, one which I'm old enough to remember even, in which this was not the case.

26:29.040 --> 26:34.240
There was a period after the Second World War in not just in Britain, but in other Western

26:34.240 --> 26:41.280
countries, European countries in America, when the state assumed certain responsibilities

26:42.080 --> 26:48.960
for moderating inequality, mitigating suffering, and reinforcing social cohesion.

26:48.960 --> 26:54.960
They weren't, in other words, old labor weren't anti-capitalists, but they wanted to

26:54.960 --> 26:59.840
restrain capitalism. And they thought it was necessary to do so. Why did they think that?

26:59.840 --> 27:05.360
Because many of them had lived through the 1930s. They were from a generation that had not only

27:05.360 --> 27:11.440
fought in the Second World War, so they knew what could happen when a social system had

27:11.440 --> 27:16.240
melted down. But even some of them were old enough to remember the tremendous meltdown of

27:16.320 --> 27:20.880
capitalism, which had triggered Nazism, which had triggered various fascist movements, or at

27:20.880 --> 27:27.600
least energised them. And so then in the after the Second World War, for maybe up to a generation,

27:28.960 --> 27:35.840
30 years perhaps, mid-70s, there was a system in many European countries, which was called

27:35.840 --> 27:41.600
Social Democracy, and I think had many achievements to its name. And so that was the kind of,

27:41.600 --> 27:53.360
it depended on an environment which began to change, even as early as the late 70s, I would say,

27:55.040 --> 27:59.040
but an environment in which there were relatively close economies, in which there wasn't much

27:59.040 --> 28:04.080
globalization. It only really began to get going in China and elsewhere, the market

28:04.080 --> 28:10.400
reforms began to get going in late 70s. But for 30 years, there was a more

28:10.400 --> 28:17.200
restrained form of capitalism based on what? Based on the perception, the experience,

28:17.200 --> 28:23.680
not just the theory, that capitalist economies can go badly wrong. When they go badly wrong,

28:23.680 --> 28:28.000
they can be really badly wrong, and that can have terrible political repercussions,

28:28.000 --> 28:32.640
including fascism. That was common sense, and it was well founded common sense among

28:32.640 --> 28:42.960
the old Labour people. That was then, that insight was then lost in the 80s, and after the 80s.

28:42.960 --> 28:48.560
Well, let me give you again, maybe an anecdote. I came from a northeastern working class background,

28:48.560 --> 28:54.800
and in the first part of my life in the 50s, Britain was still poor after the Second World War,

28:55.360 --> 29:01.360
was still a poor country. And yet, NHS doctors came out if you had a cold, a flu.

29:03.120 --> 29:10.480
I remember them coming to my house, unthinkable now, even before the pandemic, that anyone would

29:10.480 --> 29:16.720
come out for anything short of a major emergency. And yet, well, we are richer even now. You might

29:16.720 --> 29:21.840
be getting poorer now, actually, but we have been richer. What changed? What changed was

29:21.840 --> 29:25.680
the global environment of capitalism, and the dominant beliefs about the state, and about what

29:25.680 --> 29:32.960
the state should do and not do. And this is produced in Britain, a tremendous confusion. So,

29:33.760 --> 29:45.120
part of the confusion was that when Brexit became an issue, most of the Brexiters in the run-up to

29:45.680 --> 29:55.680
2016, thought that Brexit was a window to further globalization, to an even smaller state.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.400
Most of the people who voted for it did not share that.

29:58.400 --> 29:59.280
No, of course not.

29:59.280 --> 30:04.640
Yeah. But that's created, I mean, that's one of the reasons why the Brexit project has been

30:04.640 --> 30:06.720
aborted and botched.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.360
Let's return to Brexit in a second, but I just want to stick on this. So, you say that...

30:10.080 --> 30:10.960
There was a period.

30:10.960 --> 30:14.320
There was a period, and these people weren't anti-capitalist. So, what I would say to that is,

30:14.320 --> 30:19.120
and that's obviously correct, is that those people today would be classified as anti-capitalist.

30:19.120 --> 30:23.440
So, if you say... And this is... There's a great talk by Eric X. Lee about the Chinese Communist

30:23.440 --> 30:28.800
Party, and it's a TED talk. And he said elsewhere that we still believe in markets in China.

30:29.440 --> 30:36.240
We still... There's still money making money, ergo capital. The big difference is that those who

30:36.240 --> 30:42.000
make political decisions don't view the interests of capital as superseding the national interest

30:42.000 --> 30:46.160
of the public good. That's what he says. So, the interests of capital aren't the sort of

30:46.160 --> 30:47.920
political sum on bonds.

30:47.920 --> 30:53.040
Although, let's never forget that the power of workers to resist capital in China is even

30:53.040 --> 30:53.920
less than it is in China.

30:53.920 --> 30:54.400
Absolutely, absolutely.

30:54.400 --> 30:54.880
Much less.

30:54.880 --> 30:55.840
Yeah, but it's a really interesting...

30:55.840 --> 30:55.920
Much less.

30:55.920 --> 30:56.400
It's a really interesting insight.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.680
I know trade unions for a while.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.360
No, absolutely. I'm not... I'm not sort of sad.

30:59.360 --> 30:59.760
No, I know.

30:59.760 --> 31:03.360
Yeah. But it's a really interesting insight, which is to say that, okay, well, China has markets,

31:03.360 --> 31:08.080
China is deeply embedded in global sort of production, commodity chains, yada, yada, yada.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.800
What is different? Because clearly, there are differences in terms of the sort of political

31:10.800 --> 31:11.040
decisions.

31:11.040 --> 31:13.840
Well, the difference I say in the book is, and this is maybe...

31:13.840 --> 31:18.000
But let me just talk, because I want to stick with this, because I think what he's saying

31:18.000 --> 31:24.160
about the public good, about certain values taking priority over the interests of capital,

31:24.160 --> 31:28.480
I think that broadly applied to European social democracies from 45 until the late 1970s.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.120
And so, I think...

31:29.120 --> 31:31.840
And even earlier, because in that article you wrote about boots.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.880
Yeah, yeah, exactly. But if you say... But if you said that now...

31:34.880 --> 31:39.440
The capitalists themselves accepted limitations on what they could do.

31:39.440 --> 31:43.680
But if you're a politician now and you say that, you say there should be limits on what

31:43.680 --> 31:48.160
capital can do, where it can go, what it can buy, that is viewed by...

31:48.160 --> 31:48.960
As anti-capitalists.

31:48.960 --> 31:49.920
Yes. Yes.

31:49.920 --> 31:54.640
So Ernest Bevan would be an anti-capitalist for the lobbyists and news people in 2023,

31:54.640 --> 31:55.760
even though he obviously never was.

31:55.760 --> 31:58.320
Yeah, yeah. And Peter Shaw would be anti-capitalist.

31:58.320 --> 31:59.920
And Hugh Gateskill would be anti-capitalist.

31:59.920 --> 32:03.680
Quite. Well, this is one of the absurdities of presentism,

32:04.640 --> 32:10.480
that one of the features of intellectual and public life now is that what went before even

32:11.280 --> 32:14.560
20 years before. Sooner it'll be five years, maybe it'll be five minutes.

32:15.520 --> 32:19.680
It's just vanished. It's just erased. So if you'd say, well, you know, you can go to a

32:19.680 --> 32:24.080
library, there are still libraries, you can look up on the internet, you can buy books on Amazon,

32:24.080 --> 32:31.600
they're still there, and A-books and so on, written by these people, where they criticize

32:31.600 --> 32:39.840
many aspects of capitalism, and that would now lead them to be viewed as almost revolutionaries

32:39.840 --> 32:45.440
anti-capitalists, but were then normal, moderate opinion. So we get all this utter nonsense about

32:45.440 --> 32:57.760
centrism. Centrism means a kind of a collation of policies, none of which are popular, many of which

32:57.760 --> 33:02.720
are radically rejected by most of the population, but they're attenuated and triangulated to the

33:02.720 --> 33:07.440
point in which it's thought that they can be put over on the population. That's what centrism is.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.800
Most of the centrist ideas, most of them are extremely unpopular,

33:13.840 --> 33:17.760
rejected by large parts of the population. Most of the rich population, for example,

33:19.120 --> 33:24.240
favours, as I do, but I think it's not going to happen, it's not possible, favours nationalization,

33:24.960 --> 33:28.080
taking back to some form of public ownership, most of the utilities,

33:30.640 --> 33:37.040
obviously water, large parts of energy, maybe parts of the banks, railways and so on, that would be a

33:37.040 --> 33:44.720
very good move, and if you check even conservative voters, well over half, sometimes 67% here,

33:44.720 --> 33:49.440
very good idea, why don't we do it? It's an extremist idea now, well then you've got to,

33:50.000 --> 33:55.040
it's represented as an extremist idea. Now there are reasons why it might not be possible,

33:55.040 --> 33:59.040
including some I've talked about in some of my recent, it might not be possible because

33:59.040 --> 34:04.800
Britain is very highly exposed to international capital flows. So if these policies were done

34:04.800 --> 34:15.040
in a way which the markets perceived to be dangerous to the financial system, the markets would

34:15.040 --> 34:19.840
veto it, so it might be that it is impossible, but there's nothing extreme about them.

34:20.640 --> 34:26.800
They were the common bread and butter of British politics from, at least from the Second World War

34:26.800 --> 34:34.240
before that of course as well, but from the 45, the government of 1945 up to, even I would say

34:34.240 --> 34:42.080
periods of statureism, because as I mentioned in my book, she had these rather charming inconsistencies,

34:42.880 --> 34:47.920
we can never privatise the post office because the queen's head is on the steps. Now that was

34:47.920 --> 34:55.360
actually a deep thing. She didn't grasp the way in which liberated markets, dissolved the culture

34:55.360 --> 35:02.240
around them, including the national culture. She strongly opposed, I think BA as British

35:02.240 --> 35:06.880
Airways changed the logo on the back of the plane and took the flag off, strongly opposed,

35:06.880 --> 35:10.480
couldn't understand that BA was now a global capitalist entity.

35:10.480 --> 35:15.680
She should have read some marks about how capital, about how markets can dissolve previous

35:15.680 --> 35:19.200
traditions, there's all in the communist manifesto. Absolutely, whether that was where

35:19.200 --> 35:26.160
Marx was right, it was prophetic, but she wouldn't have done that, but in her favour,

35:26.880 --> 35:34.400
she also, and this is in false dawn, she responded to an account of Phukyama's

35:35.360 --> 35:40.640
ideas saying, end of history, beginning of nonsense, didn't believe any of that rubbish.

35:40.640 --> 35:47.600
She saw the kind of bourgeois society, basically an idealised model of the 1950s,

35:47.600 --> 35:52.800
actually, or even the 30s. She saw that as something that required political struggle.

35:53.680 --> 35:58.720
She thought it could be revived. The paradox was, and this is what she was sort of skewered on,

35:58.720 --> 36:03.520
this paradox, and the deepest paradoxes are the ones that the people involved in them never,

36:03.600 --> 36:10.640
never understand, was that what she did in the economy destroyed all possibility and even then

36:10.640 --> 36:16.000
all memory of the society she wanted to rebuild. That's the deep paradox of Thatcherism, which

36:16.000 --> 36:21.680
I began to understand myself, maybe from about 87 to 88 and onwards, and that was when I

36:22.720 --> 36:31.200
became, adopted a slightly bookaridist role of making cryptic criticisms of all this,

36:31.280 --> 36:37.520
very unwelcome criticism. I didn't end up in a camp or something or a cell like

36:37.520 --> 36:44.400
Buchanan, but they were very unwelcome. When she was still in power, although she never embraced

36:46.160 --> 36:51.680
Phukyama's theory, her own view of the world and that of many Thatcherites had become a form of

36:51.680 --> 36:58.000
universal triumphalism, a kind of upside down Marxism. What I'd objected to in Marxism,

36:58.000 --> 37:02.880
you might not take this view, but is what I object to in all radical progressive ideologies,

37:02.880 --> 37:06.720
which is the contempt they display for the casualties of progress. Say, well, but

37:07.440 --> 37:14.800
4 million, 10 million Russian peasants died. Well, they were peasants. People know what

37:14.800 --> 37:20.880
cultivated. Did they have degrees? Were they graduates? The left response would be, well,

37:20.880 --> 37:26.560
precisely all this happens with regards to the formation of markets in the whole world, right?

37:27.280 --> 37:33.040
The Irish famine, for instance, is the exact same phenomenon. I suppose a reasonable, I hope,

37:33.040 --> 37:37.680
left response would be, that's absolutely correct. The point is that market ideologues don't

37:37.680 --> 37:44.640
understand they did the exact same thing. No, they don't. When there had been moderate forms

37:44.640 --> 37:51.120
of capitalism, that was understandable. But when a more radical form of capitalism was reinvented

37:51.120 --> 37:55.760
or invented a new form even, actually, because it was more global than it had ever been before,

37:55.760 --> 38:04.240
even in the colonial period, it was more global than that. There was this, to me, very repellent,

38:05.360 --> 38:12.560
morally repellent, even aesthetically repellent view that if there are groups that can't fit

38:12.560 --> 38:20.400
into this, well, let them go. So they would go by living in broken down cities. They'd

38:20.400 --> 38:26.080
gradually, some would leave, some would die, some would have short lives. And this is on a bigger

38:26.080 --> 38:30.960
scale happening in America, where, of course, as we've discussed earlier in our conversation today

38:30.960 --> 38:38.320
are, and there are these really large numbers of deaths from drugs. I mean, of course, that's,

38:38.320 --> 38:42.720
I mean, you can look at it another way. You could say, you know, drugs are the hyper-capitalist

38:42.800 --> 38:52.400
commodity. It's interesting, but if you, many of the big series in television and series in the

38:52.400 --> 39:00.640
last few years coming out of America have been about ordinary people, middle-class people and

39:00.640 --> 39:06.560
other people entering the drug economy, breaking bad, but lots of them have been like that.

39:07.520 --> 39:16.480
Great TV, but it also tells you something, which is that the only way for many people to either

39:16.480 --> 39:25.120
live a normal life, which in breaking bad men, funding cancer care, or to accumulate substantial

39:25.120 --> 39:35.600
capital is the drug economy. I mean, large parts of America are now such that the living parts of

39:35.600 --> 39:40.880
the economy are the drug economy and its various extensions, because, of course, it then funds

39:40.880 --> 39:46.000
legitimate businesses and gains hold of them. So that's a very interesting feature, I think, of,

39:47.280 --> 39:52.960
and that connects with our earlier discussion of feudalism. I mean, I think, however much one

39:52.960 --> 40:01.120
criticizes the feudal lords and aristocrats, which I would myself in many ways, they weren't as cruel

40:01.120 --> 40:12.480
or as anarchical as Mexican or Colombian or Russian cartels. I mean, they're extraordinarily cruel.

40:12.480 --> 40:19.440
They're extraordinarily violent and kill enormous numbers of people. And yet, there are large parts

40:19.440 --> 40:26.480
of Latin America and other countries that have fallen into that, that condition. And that connects,

40:26.480 --> 40:32.240
by the way, with another feature of my book, which is very much resisted and might even be

40:32.240 --> 40:39.280
resisted by my Hobbes, if he could be brought back, which is that one of the ways in which I

40:39.280 --> 40:46.240
represent Hobbes as a liberal rationalist and a liberal optimist is that he did think that his

40:46.240 --> 40:51.280
ideas were, which he are in some respects universal, but he did think that they could be applied to get

40:52.160 --> 40:56.240
societies that and fall into what he called a state of nature, that's warring groups,

40:56.240 --> 40:59.840
warring over position and power and resources. They could get out of that by

41:01.920 --> 41:06.080
inventing a sovereign by sort of contract. I don't think history supports that. I think there are

41:06.080 --> 41:12.240
lots of periods in history which show that states of nature in society, state of nature is not

41:12.240 --> 41:16.400
something in Hobbes before society is formed. It's something, it's a condition that societies can

41:17.120 --> 41:24.480
fall into it at any time. They last for ages, centuries even. It's very hard to get out of a

41:24.480 --> 41:27.600
situation like that. And that was something also, by the way, which the liberals of the

41:29.200 --> 41:36.160
Iraq war and of the Libyan regime change didn't understand, which is that it's comparatively

41:36.160 --> 41:42.560
easy to destroy a state. It's extremely difficult to recreate it in Libya, for example. I mean,

41:42.560 --> 41:50.240
one of the features of the current life now is that Libya doesn't just have two governments,

41:50.240 --> 41:55.120
which in practice means it hasn't got any government, but it's also one of the really

41:55.920 --> 42:04.640
principal gateways of illegal migration into Europe. So that problem was, or that reality,

42:04.720 --> 42:15.280
that flow was created by or magnified by the regime change that Cameron and

42:17.200 --> 42:22.080
the French imposed on Libya. I mean, when people say you've got to stamp down on the

42:23.440 --> 42:31.120
gangs and you've got to repress the people's traffickers, that might be possible to do in

42:31.760 --> 42:36.880
Europe where there are still relatively strong states. You can't do it in Libya because there

42:36.880 --> 42:43.520
is, in fact, there is no state. So it just can't be done in there. And that's connected. On how

42:43.520 --> 42:50.080
many occasions have you watched reports about Lampedusa or other migration flows, big libations?

42:50.080 --> 42:54.720
How many times when they mentioned that some of them have come from Libya, how often has it been

42:54.720 --> 42:59.360
mentioned that the Libyan state was destroyed by Western intervention? I would say practically

42:59.360 --> 43:03.600
never. And that's not deliberate, by the way. It's not a conspiracy which we're not going to

43:03.600 --> 43:07.920
mention this. First of all, they never heard they're too young or they're too, they don't know

43:07.920 --> 43:12.800
anything about it. They don't care. The business, the rapid business of generating news doesn't

43:12.800 --> 43:19.600
permit that kind of reflection. It just isn't in the range of thoughts and experiences and histories

43:19.600 --> 43:24.720
that people know. I mean, this to me seems like a core small sea conservative insight

43:24.720 --> 43:30.640
as somebody who's a socialist that agrees with this insight, which is, like you say, it's very,

43:30.640 --> 43:36.480
very easy comparatively to destroy a state, state infrastructure. It's very hard to build it.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.800
And Libya is really the great example here because I tweeted this, I think earlier on the week,

43:40.800 --> 43:45.200
with regards to these floods, tens of thousands of people dying, open air slave markets,

43:46.000 --> 43:51.520
like you say, this is absolutely astonishing stuff. And I say clearly Qaddafi was better. Clearly,

43:51.520 --> 43:54.960
human development index, I think in 2010, they were like 55th in the world,

43:54.960 --> 44:00.080
number one in Africa. Now there are 115th, you know, just human development index is literally

44:00.080 --> 44:04.720
and some of this is measurable. A lot of it is exactly. Yeah, exactly. So clearly, clearly,

44:04.720 --> 44:09.760
you know, you'd want to, you'd probably want to go back in time if you could if you were Libyan.

44:09.760 --> 44:14.800
And then some people said, yeah, but he was going to get Benghazi. Benghazi is now right round by

44:15.680 --> 44:19.440
basically a form of the Taliban. I don't think they recognize quite what they've unleashed.

44:19.440 --> 44:22.080
Well, there's a reason for that, though. It's part of the liberal,

44:22.080 --> 44:25.360
a liberal worldview, which is that nothing can be worse than tyranny.

44:26.240 --> 44:32.400
But lots of things are worse than tyranny. I mean, some tyrannies differ. There can be tyrannies

44:32.400 --> 44:40.000
that are limited in their goals to enriching a few people. And though that might be terrible,

44:40.960 --> 44:45.680
it can be less humanly costly than tyrannies which want to change the whole society according

44:45.680 --> 44:52.160
to some model, which could be communist or fascist. So there can be different kinds of tyrannies.

44:52.160 --> 44:59.840
But it simply isn't true that on any reasonable ethical or empirical assessment that tyrannies

44:59.840 --> 45:05.360
are always the worst thing. Where do you think it ends? Because, you know, we've seen so many

45:05.360 --> 45:11.040
of these mistakes, like I say with Libya, Afghanistan. After it was said by nearly everybody,

45:11.040 --> 45:15.120
this will never happen again. Yeah, it did happen. But people still defend it. That's the thing.

45:15.120 --> 45:19.040
That's what I find really, really interesting. Well, they say that it's because they say

45:19.040 --> 45:24.640
tyranny is the worst thing. They still believe that. And they don't see the necessity. Well,

45:24.640 --> 45:29.280
there's maybe an even deeper reason which wouldn't fit in easily the most aspects of

45:30.240 --> 45:36.640
left-wing thought, which is that much of political life as of much of ethical life

45:37.200 --> 45:45.440
is a choice in which involves options and choices in which whatever is done involves irreparable loss

45:46.400 --> 45:54.400
or even wrong, even injustice. In other words, if you think that, then not just a choice between

45:54.400 --> 45:58.720
evils, because you could say, well, choice between evils, we will maximize the good and minimize

45:58.720 --> 46:03.120
the evil, which is a kind of utilitarian way of thinking. So in a sense, the evils don't matter.

46:03.120 --> 46:07.040
If you get the maximum out of it, the evils don't matter. But I don't think that's

46:07.040 --> 46:15.760
true to human experience. Human experience is of choosing between options, recurring options,

46:15.760 --> 46:20.800
options that don't go away. They keep recurring in different forms in which whatever is done involves

46:20.800 --> 46:26.560
what those who have acted or failed to act recognize to be irreparable losses. I'll tell you

46:27.120 --> 46:34.080
an example from that in the Second World War, which was told me by, I thought I have a link,

46:34.080 --> 46:38.080
which was that a government officer, government official, appeared, or a minister,

46:38.080 --> 46:42.400
even I can't remember now, appeared before his typing pool and said, we're going to sack every

46:42.400 --> 46:47.520
single person who's typing, which would be a great injustice to all but one of you,

46:48.160 --> 46:51.360
because not only will you be sacked, you'll never get a job again. There'll be a black

46:51.360 --> 46:54.880
mark over your security, because you're sacked for security reasons. One of you is leaking,

46:55.520 --> 46:59.280
but we don't know who that is, and we haven't got time to find out. And in the meantime,

46:59.280 --> 47:03.120
brave men and women are being dropped into parts of the inventory and dying terrible deaths,

47:04.400 --> 47:10.800
terrible deaths. So we're sacking a lot of you, and you sacked them all.

47:11.600 --> 47:17.120
Now, the interesting thing about that is, to me, is that he recognized that what he was doing

47:17.120 --> 47:22.880
involved injustice and wrong, not just a utilitarian calculation. He didn't turn into

47:22.880 --> 47:27.600
utilities and said, it'll be more utiles, it'll be more pleasure and less pain in the world.

47:28.240 --> 47:33.280
It was a deep injustice to those who suffered it. Their lives were effectively, their productive

47:33.280 --> 47:38.800
lives were ruined, permanently and irreparably ruined. Even after the war, they'd never get a

47:38.800 --> 47:43.840
job in this, again, but for the sake of a goal, winning the war and also

47:45.840 --> 47:50.320
protecting these people who are going out there to be tortured to death and so on and betrayed.

47:50.320 --> 47:56.800
Now, a basic question for ethics and political theories, will there ever be a point in the human

47:56.800 --> 48:00.240
world where this is to be true? Now, if you're a certain kind of progressive, a certain kind of

48:00.240 --> 48:03.760
Marxist and a certain kind of, there will be, there won't be in my view, there won't be, it'll

48:03.760 --> 48:07.200
always be like this. Why it'll be like this? Because that's what human beings are like.

48:07.200 --> 48:13.040
We are conflicting needs, conflicting impulses, conflicting, even if we had material abundance,

48:13.040 --> 48:18.240
it would appear and these kinds of, but that's something which many people are extremely

48:18.320 --> 48:23.600
resistant. It's an idea which to them is deeply pessimistic. Although you can turn it around

48:23.600 --> 48:28.560
and you can say that in times of tragic choices, they also are periods of context where people

48:28.560 --> 48:35.440
can display extraordinary nobility. They can take on the irreparable loss to themselves even.

48:35.440 --> 48:40.320
I agree with what you've just said there. I say this when you wrote a book about moving to society

48:40.320 --> 48:46.000
beyond capitalism and of a kind of abundance, but not really familiar with. I agree with what

48:46.000 --> 48:54.640
you've just said. And I would say in response that human frailties and all the kinds of discontent

48:54.640 --> 48:58.640
you just talked about will never go away. And in fact, some people have already lived under

48:58.640 --> 49:03.920
conditions of comparative posterity and abundance. We call them the aristocracy. And if you read the

49:03.920 --> 49:08.240
sort of novels like La Classe and these kinds of people. How they lived. Yeah, how they live.

49:08.240 --> 49:13.200
They're often very sad, very tragic. So there's big parts of their lives which don't, you know,

49:14.160 --> 49:18.240
of human experience which won't disappear. And competitive. Yeah. Or quite. But then I suppose

49:18.240 --> 49:26.400
the question is, what's a bigger problem? People are getting upset about love affairs or the

49:26.400 --> 49:31.840
paradox of choice or not being able to feed themselves or dying from diphtheria. But I'm

49:31.840 --> 49:36.560
making an extreme comparison there. But I think you're absolutely right about certain aspects of

49:36.560 --> 49:42.080
these things never. But for many people, it's a hard choice to, it's a hard truth, I would say.

49:42.240 --> 49:48.000
It's a fact. It's a fact of ethical life. There are these recurring situations. And

49:49.680 --> 49:55.520
even in, you see, the paradox emerges for revolutionaries in that in an attempt to create

49:55.520 --> 50:04.320
a world in which these tragic choices don't need to be made or they only occur in personal life

50:04.320 --> 50:11.600
with love affairs and friendships and so on. The revolutionaries find themselves with precise

50:11.680 --> 50:16.160
having to make the decisions and the choices that they want to abolish. So one of the things

50:16.160 --> 50:19.760
that's not understood, as you know, a lot of my book is about Russia and I don't deal with this

50:19.760 --> 50:28.240
part in Russia. One of the reasons that a post-star is Russia turned into a Bolshevik state. And one

50:28.240 --> 50:32.960
of the reasons that was highly repressive was partly Western intervention and partly to struggle

50:32.960 --> 50:37.200
with the whites. But one of the things that happens in all revolutionary situations

50:37.200 --> 50:43.760
is that the revolutionaries struggle among themselves. And the ones that are the least

50:43.760 --> 50:50.880
ruthless, like the Russian anarchists, are the ones that are eliminated, exterminated either

50:50.880 --> 50:56.560
physically or politically marginalized. So that the paradox of revolutionary action, and of all

50:56.560 --> 51:02.880
political action in my view, even, you know, conventional political action, is that if it's

51:02.880 --> 51:08.480
motivated by these grandiose ideas of getting to a world in which tragic choices don't exist,

51:08.480 --> 51:17.120
it will find itself making these choices in order to achieve the world in which they don't exist.

51:17.120 --> 51:21.600
So perpetuating the world in which it is. And I think that's, I think that's, you see, this is

51:21.600 --> 51:27.280
maybe an irreconcilable, I mean, left-wing thinkers and conservative thinkers agree on more than real

51:27.280 --> 51:31.920
left-wing thinkers and real conservative thinkers. I don't mean neoliberals on either side agree on

51:31.920 --> 51:38.000
more than either, usually realize. But there's a fundamental difference between the view that I

51:38.000 --> 51:43.600
take and many people on the left take. And even on the right, of course, the neoliberal right,

51:43.600 --> 51:46.960
if you would say to them, they would say exactly in a way what use they say. Well,

51:46.960 --> 51:52.400
we may get it to a world where the people have to make choices among ethnic cuisines. They may get

51:52.400 --> 51:57.600
to a world in which, I don't know how it could be tragic to choose between Indian and Chinese. But

51:57.600 --> 52:02.640
anyway, we may have a world in which people have unhappy love affairs. They do have unhappy love

52:02.640 --> 52:07.360
affairs. And we may have a world in which people suddenly die of new diseases and so on. So that

52:07.360 --> 52:14.160
might be, that might be, but we won't have a world in which the structures of power are such

52:14.960 --> 52:19.840
that they impose these choices, tragic choices on large numbers of people.

52:20.480 --> 52:24.160
So I suppose there's two, there's two, having read your corpus, read this book,

52:24.160 --> 52:31.040
there's pretty two points of disagreement or interesting conflict and tension. So the first

52:31.040 --> 52:40.240
is you've got a quite justified and understandable contempt, critique of utopianism. I would say

52:40.240 --> 52:45.200
the major problem for the West in the 21st century is the lack of utopia, is anti-utopianism.

52:45.200 --> 52:48.000
Because what it does, and you sort of talk about this a little bit in the book, because you don't

52:48.000 --> 52:53.360
say explicitly, you know, is that, well, okay, living standards have been flat for a long time,

52:53.360 --> 52:57.920
productivity flat of 15 years, yet we really can't get a handle on any one of about a dozen

52:57.920 --> 53:02.720
social challenges that working and middle-class people really care about. But you know what,

53:02.720 --> 53:07.600
you're not a peasant living in 15th century France. So stop complaining. So I think,

53:08.320 --> 53:13.280
so I think there is a real, there's a toolkit for intellectuals and politicians, which I think

53:13.280 --> 53:17.920
was very well suited to the problems of the 20th century. But I think this aversion, skepticism,

53:17.920 --> 53:23.360
hostility to utopianism is increasingly constraining the ability of the West to solve

53:23.360 --> 53:29.040
its basic problems. No, I would think it's slightly different than that. I mean, the difference is that

53:30.640 --> 53:36.080
liberal capitalists don't understand the respects in which they view as utopian.

53:37.440 --> 53:42.720
They don't understand the respects in which it can't be made global or universal.

53:43.440 --> 53:50.000
The more it extends itself, the more fragile it becomes. And they think of it as permanent when

53:50.000 --> 53:54.080
there can be a boom, of course, a boom period. There have been many boom periods in history,

53:54.080 --> 53:58.320
that could last for a while, but they have the seeds in them of their own destruction.

53:58.320 --> 54:01.280
So they, when they say, I mean, this is the, if you like the problem with

54:02.000 --> 54:07.520
what's come to be called capitalist realism, which is it assumes the situation, assumes the system

54:07.520 --> 54:14.560
can be indefinitely malleable and indefinitely managed. So this is a form of the end of history.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.960
Capitalism is a form of the end of history. So you could say, well,

54:17.840 --> 54:20.800
what about the Great Wall Street Cash? Well, that will never be allowed to happen again.

54:22.880 --> 54:26.960
What about the rise of fascism in the 30s? Well, that's not going to happen. It is happening,

54:26.960 --> 54:32.560
actually, under various forms now. But so by the way, we can be sure it's possible if it's actually

54:32.560 --> 54:38.880
happening. One little piece of logic you can get out of philosophy is if something's actually

54:38.880 --> 54:42.880
happening, that's definitely possible. But they say, no, we can, we can, we can manage the system,

54:42.880 --> 54:51.120
we can keep it going, we can, now that might not always be a bad position to take if the alternatives

54:52.480 --> 54:59.120
are very much worse. So if you were, if you're saying to me, if supposing I was in,

54:59.120 --> 55:05.520
by my Germany, and before I was born, and there was a program, someone was, came up with a program

55:05.520 --> 55:10.320
that would somehow have stabilized by my Germany, difficult given what was happening in the world

55:10.320 --> 55:14.480
and so on, and given the conflicts in Central Europe and other impossible, probably, actually.

55:14.480 --> 55:20.800
But would I support it? Yes, I would have supported. It could be, it could even be thought of as a

55:20.800 --> 55:24.800
conservative program or a conservative program. I would have because if I'd had any insight at

55:24.800 --> 55:29.280
that time, which some people I think did actually think how bad it could be, they didn't quite

55:29.280 --> 55:33.440
anticipate the full horrors of Nazism, but they thought it could be pretty bad, including people

55:33.440 --> 55:39.200
on the left. If you could say, well, if this, if this is the, if would I support a, so to speak,

55:40.320 --> 55:45.680
a conservative strategy, then yes, definitely. But the argument then would be, no, that's too,

55:46.880 --> 55:50.800
it's too, I mean, if I, maybe I'm putting these arguments into your mouth, but you could say,

55:50.800 --> 55:54.320
but that assumes there's no alternative at all, that all the alternatives are disastrous,

55:54.320 --> 55:58.400
there could be better alternatives. That's what I think. So for instance, you said that you support

55:58.400 --> 56:02.320
public ownership of, let's say something really uncontroversial, rail, because the franchises

56:02.320 --> 56:05.840
and it's very easy to water is even less controversial. Yeah, very, these are all quite

56:05.840 --> 56:11.280
moderately easy to execute, right? And I think for some people that would be viewed as utopian.

56:11.280 --> 56:15.360
And I think what this feeds into is the anti utopianism as the default. It might, I don't think

56:15.360 --> 56:19.280
you see, they don't, they don't recognize the premise of politics. So for instance, they would say,

56:19.280 --> 56:22.880
well, the shareholders or not, no, they won't have that and the banks and there's,

56:22.880 --> 56:26.480
and that's what they didn't get about Brexit is the primacy of politics. If you have a social

56:26.480 --> 56:31.440
majority wanting something very passionately in a system where people in order to be reelected

56:31.440 --> 56:35.520
have to broadly do what people tell them to do, then that's, there's a difference here.

56:35.520 --> 56:38.800
That's the direction in terms of the outcome. There's a difference. Something can be utopian

56:40.240 --> 56:45.600
in the sense that it includes, it involves a system that has never existed or has never

56:45.600 --> 56:49.520
been, never worked. No, we live in a world where people think that public ownership of rail is

56:49.520 --> 56:52.720
utopian. That's what these people think. We're not in a world where it's like

56:52.720 --> 56:57.600
St. Simon and Fourier, the sea, St. Lemonade, they think public ownership of energy is utopian.

56:57.600 --> 57:02.800
Now, yes, but it may be impossible without being utopian. Again, we know it's not utopian

57:02.800 --> 57:06.400
in the sense of being impossible because it did exist. It's a reputation where I say,

57:06.400 --> 57:12.400
if something did exist, it's not impossible. Again, so their argument against it is by

57:12.400 --> 57:16.320
deploying anti utopianism. Well, if we do that, then we don't know where all that any,

57:16.320 --> 57:21.680
any politics, which is... The really hard truth is that what I would prefer in,

57:23.440 --> 57:31.040
in regard to public utilities is desirable and certainly possible because it existed before,

57:32.080 --> 57:37.760
but may well not be possible for any British government of any complexion as long as it

57:37.760 --> 57:42.320
remains as dependent on capital markets as it is. And that's probably right now.

57:42.400 --> 57:47.200
That's the hard truth. In other words, it is desirable, it is possible, it did occur before,

57:47.200 --> 57:51.680
it could in principle occur again, just not utopian in that sense, not utopian,

57:51.680 --> 57:56.880
but it's also impossible for the foreseeable future. As long as we're as exposed, as long as I've

57:56.880 --> 58:02.880
argued, perhaps, it was not entirely frivolous when I compared Britain in a piece I did in my column

58:02.880 --> 58:08.640
for the two Argentina, one of the richest countries in the world, top 10, which countries 100

58:08.640 --> 58:18.400
years ago, went from being in that position in the 30s and then later to becoming a basket case,

58:20.320 --> 58:23.840
such that it's actually very high, such that now the various

58:25.520 --> 58:31.760
products of the Argentine political culture include radical anti-anarcho-capitalists by

58:31.760 --> 58:36.960
their own description who want to burn down the central bank, they want to abolish the

58:36.960 --> 58:44.960
national currency and replace it by a mixture of dollars and crypto. They want free markets in

58:44.960 --> 58:49.840
sex and also human organs, but they're strongly anti-abortion. I haven't quite worked out how

58:49.840 --> 58:59.440
that works, but anyway, that's what some of them are. Millet, the front-runner for the presidency,

58:59.440 --> 59:03.200
who could, by the way, I think there's a non-trivial chance that he could be elected,

59:03.200 --> 59:05.440
could become, what would he do then? That'd be the interesting thing.

59:06.960 --> 59:12.160
But probably, I mean, I have been to Argentina, it was a long time ago, so I don't know what

59:12.160 --> 59:21.440
it's like now, but the hard truth is that certain social and political systems get themselves into

59:21.440 --> 59:27.120
a historical cul-de-sac from which it's very difficult to get out because their own politicians

59:27.120 --> 59:35.200
are thoroughly corrupt, thoroughly irresponsible, and the global capital markets won't, will veto

59:35.200 --> 59:44.640
anything that could be done anyway, probably. So the really bad prospect for Britain, which I think

59:44.640 --> 59:48.240
is not at all unrealistic, I don't say it's inevitable, but it's not at all unrealistic,

59:48.240 --> 59:55.200
is that we're actually either already or entering that position. And this takes us

59:55.200 --> 59:58.400
on to Brexit because, of course, what people say, well, we wouldn't be as isolated if we're in the

59:58.400 --> 01:00:04.240
magnificent colossus of Europe, that eternal thing, by the way. I mean, one of the odd things about

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:11.280
the EU is that it's almost like a line from Eliot, T.S. Eliot, he talks about the still point

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:17.360
of an eternal turning world in one of his mystical poems. That's what the EU is for,

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.320
the remainder of mind. I don't mean all of those people who voted remain, lots of my friends voted

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:29.520
remain. By the way, the best argument against Brexit I've heard was one put to me by a friend who

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.160
said, why are you voting Romain? He said, because the British political class simply isn't up to

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.640
making Brexit, they're just hopeless. It's a very good, very good argument. Very powerful argument.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.920
That's the best, I think, the best argument. And it's proved to be true. They weren't up to it.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:48.320
They didn't want to, and the political class didn't want to do it. It was handed to them,

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.800
and they didn't do it. They thought that they put up, they tried to overturn it for several years,

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.320
then they accepted it, but even now they didn't accept it. Basically, they still want to reverse

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:06.960
it, as has been seen recently in Stammer's revelation of the fact that he does have one belief,

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.280
one feature he has the belief in. Europe, in the EU, the still point in the eternal,

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.840
in the eternal. If we're in there, nothing bad can happen to us. Nothing bad can happen to Europe.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:22.000
One thing's already bad that is Ukraine. That's pretty bad. But also,

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.480
many European countries now, for various reasons, partly connected with immigration, partly connected

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:35.680
with climate policy and other factors, have seen a continuing trend, not just the blip

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:43.040
of the emergence of far-right parties. So we're not that way far off a situation in which

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.080
the EU will be predominantly a far-right bloc. Now, you would think, wouldn't you,

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.200
if the attitude of British Remainers to Europe was empirical and not mystical,

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.440
you would think that they would take note of this and say, well, do we really want to be

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:06.960
part of a, we rejoin or in some looser relationship, but still much closer than we are now,

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.600
to a bloc in which many governments are dependent on far-right support and which

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:18.720
will probably include 20% of the vote in Germany is far-right. Over 40% of,

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:26.160
I think, if I remember my figures right, of the French electorate in the last presidential

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:31.920
election vote for Le Pen. Do we want to be a part of that? No, they don't say that. They never

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:36.320
discussed the matter because, as you and I, I think, they're not really interested in Europe.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:43.760
Brexit, for them, was a fetid intratory dispute where they wanted to, they're not doing nothing

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.760
about Europe and they don't care about Europe, but it does embody a kind of semi-mystical ideal

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.200
for them in which we can escape the problems which are singular to Britain by merging with this other

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.080
entity, which has all the virtues that we lack. And it forms, and this is the crucial thing about

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:03.440
their resistance to empirical thinking, which is that this is part of a worldview of those,

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:10.400
which is that all of the experiences since 2006-16 are departures from the normal course of history.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:17.040
What they cannot and will never understand is that what they and other liberals call populism

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.200
is the political blowback, is political blowback against the social disruption that their policies

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.240
have produced. They can't understand the connection between what they've done and populism.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.640
Populism comes from nowhere or from very evil people. What they come up with in the end is a

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:41.520
theory of evil. Well, there are these evil demagogues who've been lying around for a long time and they

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:47.840
suddenly emerge and they deceive the gullible masses, the uneducated, the uneducated. That's what,

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:52.240
that's what, it's a theory of evil. It's odd from those who say there isn't such a thing as evil,

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:57.040
there's only error, human beings are indefinitely improvable, they're getting better, but they've

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.960
come up with a theory that explains it. But whatever the explanation they might come up with,

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:12.640
2016 onwards, or even before that, is an anomaly in the normal course of human history. The normal

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.960
course of human history would have seen Hillary Clinton re-elected. Why didn't that happen?

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:27.440
The Russians, it's usually something exogenous to society, or some mistake that could easily

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:33.760
have been altered but wasn't. Remember at the time they said, well, Trump hasn't got a majority.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:38.880
They never said that about, but previously, I mean, he had a majority. It's an entire worldview

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.920
which is on the line for them, and it's on the line for them partly of course, because they are

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:50.240
the vanguard of the normal course of history. I mean, the normal course of history was that it

01:04:50.240 --> 01:05:01.440
would be, which was dislocated or derailed from 2016 onwards. It would be that a transnational,

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:06.000
potentially global, but at least European state, which wasn't an empire, but wasn't

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.960
a nation state either. It's not an empire, but it isn't a nation. It's some new, completely new.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:13.520
And it wants to go all the way to Georgia, but it's definitely not an empire.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:19.040
But also, it hasn't got most of the, it's where I disagree with some of the Brexit.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.520
They say it's an incipient super state. It isn't an incipient super state.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:29.440
It hasn't got fiscal union. It hasn't got armed forces. At the moment,

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:36.240
some people on the right of European politics are asking that a naval blockade be put around

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:44.000
a land producer. It hasn't got a navy, small problem. So it isn't a state. It's not going

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.640
to become a state, in my view. There is an argument, I mean, some kind of ultra-sophisticated

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:55.760
ex-Brexiteers now say, well, by leaving it, we've made them more likely. Some Remainers

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.960
say this too. We've made it more likely for Europe to become a dangerous super state.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.840
Absolute nonsense. There are too many conflicts within Europe and too many problems that

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:13.600
Europe can't resolve. There are conflicts between Poland and Hungary on the one hand,

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:19.120
and even between them, but on the one hand, and Germany and France on the other. Then there's

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.280
the Baltic states. Then there's Scandinavia, Sweden. These all have different interests and

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:31.760
different trajectories. But also, in many of the states, as I mentioned earlier,

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:37.440
the far-right which is emerging. It's not a pan-European far-right. These are not the

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.920
fascists and Nazis of the 30s who wanted to abolish nations, actually, some of them did.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:47.840
Some of them were pan-European. They fell up with these small ones, get rid of them, kill them all,

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:54.480
enslave them. They're not, they're nationalists. So actually, the strong, the emerging far-right

01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:02.240
groups, they may or may not be proposing to leave the EU, which Le Pen doesn't anymore,

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.800
and because actually, the obstacles to leaving, if you're in the euro, are huge.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:12.320
We were able to leave, when we did leave, just because we weren't in the euro. But if you're in,

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:17.600
it's a revolutionary act, and a revolution of that kind, which would probably involve in Italy and

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:25.040
in France, for example, a devaluation of savings of those who had them in 20, 30, 40%. You're not

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:29.040
going to get bourgeois support for that. I mean, the only people who will want it will be impoverished

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.960
young people. Another feature, by the way, of this is that these right-wing movements in Europe

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:40.320
are very often youth movements. Very much lost on English speakers. They think that young people

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:46.240
are all liberals and not in Europe and not in America now. I mean, the conversion rate into

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.600
far-right positions is high, very high among young people.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.600
Amongst the one, the cohort below Gen Z is particularly concerning, actually. But what's

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:59.840
interesting is, if you look at, I think, people now entering college, 18 to 21-year-olds,

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:06.160
there is this extraordinary divergence in political sympathies by gender in the US,

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:10.000
which is just, obviously, that's always existed to some extent, but now it's just,

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.560
it's blown up in the last five years. It's partly for a reason, which I read about in the book,

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:22.960
which is back in the early 90s, when I first got the idea that America might come a cropper

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.560
because of its internal divisions. Can we say a cropper? What do you mean, a civil war?

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.880
Not civil war. No, it could be civil warfare, which is chronic sort of low-level violence

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:40.560
and disruption of institutions, but was partly because of abortion. America's different,

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:46.080
not different from everywhere. It's also been conflicts in Poland and some European countries.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.040
But America is, because of its religious composition and others, and that spills

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:57.280
over into a gender politics. And it's one of the reasons that DeSantis, I think, never really had

01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.640
a chance, because unlike Trump, who could flirt with the pro-life wife, who doesn't believe any of

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:09.200
it, and everybody knows he doesn't believe any of it, DeSantis really did. So he really would

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:15.600
have pushed, I think, and I think that would have killed Republican support among many Republican

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:21.280
women, killed at Stone Dead. They don't want to lose this freedom. Why should they? They may not

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.560
find the present situation satisfactory in many ways, and because one of the reasons I

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:36.400
argued this back in the 1890s is that turning values into rights works when the values are

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.960
broadly and generally accepted in society. So you can have a right against torture, you can have a

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:46.640
right, various rights of free speech and so on, though defining them is not always easy.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:54.400
But if a value position is turned into a right, which is deeply controversial in the society,

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.600
which is deeply disputed and conflicted, as abortion always has been in America,

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.920
then in the long run, and it may take, as it did take 30 years for this to happen, back then,

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:11.280
what I wrote was the inevitable result is that the constitutional, the supreme constitutional

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:17.280
authority will become an object of political capture. If it constitutionalizes rights to

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:22.000
activities that a third or a quarter of the population or regard is basically wrong,

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:31.040
in the long run, which has taken a generation, there will be a pushback by the conservatives,

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:37.520
and that was achieved under Trump, that would point these conservative judges, who had various

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.960
complex constitutional arguments why abortion should never have been turned into a right,

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:49.760
but all of those are irrelevant to me, they're just local American fetishes about constitutionalism.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:57.600
The real reason is that rights cannot insulate from politics, culture and other conflicts,

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.720
which are deep-seated. If you try to do that, you eventually threaten the regime.

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.320
But this is very relevant to the UK context, because we, of course, now have a Supreme Court.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:06.960
Yes, we do.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.560
Which is very alien to the...

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.480
Well, it's American in position.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.760
Yeah, and that was Blair.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:15.920
Yeah, well, I love talking to conservatives about this, because I say, look, if we had Lord

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:19.040
Derrierev and the courts wouldn't be in this mess, sentencing wouldn't be like...

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:19.600
Absolutely.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.440
The police, this would not be anything like this, and there's probably something to that.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.880
But what's interesting with Blair is, when he introduces the Supreme Court,

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.080
I don't think he realises the gravity of what he's doing.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:30.720
No, he didn't.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.200
He didn't.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.720
You're changing the complexion of the democracy quite fundamentally.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:35.360
Rightly.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:40.400
Well, I agree with that 100% herein, because what it's done is,

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.080
it's produced a kind of...

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.480
I mean, the American system has produced its pathologies, which is that everything is litigated.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.200
It's part...

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:53.200
And if you capture this one body, you control the...

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:53.680
You know, like...

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:54.880
Controls everything.

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.400
But everything is litigated.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.120
And politics becomes...

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.080
Law becomes a surrogate for politics.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:06.080
But when law becomes a surrogate for politics, law becomes politicised.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:10.960
And eventually, that politics becomes Schmidian politics, the politics of enemies,

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.320
which has happened now in America.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:15.360
That's one end point of that.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.600
Now, we are in a kind of halfway house here, which is that

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:30.960
lawfare was promoted by the Remainers, but it now covers vast swathes of government activity,

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:36.240
to the point at which it's even questionable whether we have a government, actually,

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.800
because you could say, well, we should do this.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.240
You say, well, yes, but you'll have to.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.360
I mean, this would be a good thing to do.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.680
There might even be agreement, but it'll be litigated.

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.880
We stop for years.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.000
We should build more houses.

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.520
I'm not saying whether we should or we shouldn't, but we should build more houses.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.880
We can't do that because it'll be endlessly litigated through the courts by the Nimbis,

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:56.560
which does.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.720
And in that circumstance, what it produces in Britain is not yet,

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.200
or not so much the Schmidian politics of enmity,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:11.600
but paralysis, in which nothing can actually be done on a wide range of issues,

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.400
unless you're ready to get out of the European Convention of Human Rights,

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.240
which a few conservatives and others are.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.560
Anything that's done about immigration will be litigated,

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.600
whether you agree with it or not, anything.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:36.320
And many other issues, I mean, issues of town planning and of building and so it applies to them all.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:42.400
So what we've got in Britain is a kind of paralyzing version of lawfare,

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:48.960
and it does, I think, emerge primarily, well, at least the starting point of it was Blair's creation.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.480
I mean, the very name tells you what he was doing.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:58.480
He was trying to sort of superimpose on a fundamentally different system of parliamentary sovereignty.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.040
Let me go.

01:13:59.040 --> 01:13:59.840
History of ideas.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.560
I used to be a historian of ideas and I spent 20 years

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.320
working and reading about John Stuart Mill.

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:10.800
When John Stuart Mill writes about liberty, his background idea is not a court.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.600
There wasn't a Supreme Court.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.400
There was parliamentary sovereignty, which was pretty well absolute.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.480
By the way, it was absolute, up to and including Thatcher.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.400
She could do whatever she wanted.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.520
I mean, feasibly, it's still here, right?

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:26.400
They could scrap the Supreme Court if there was an act of Parliament to get rid of the Supreme Court.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.200
Legally, it could all still be scrapped, but there's not the political will then.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:29.760
There won't be.

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:33.120
Well, I think I'm sort of surprised the Tories never talk about that.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.840
Oh, they have been talking about the European Convention.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:39.440
I mean, the Supreme Court, because that's lower hanging fruit, right?

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.440
It would be semi-revolutionary.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:46.160
I mean, in a sense, again, look what's happening in Israel.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.600
Similar in some respects to us, that there isn't a fixed constitution.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.800
There isn't a written constitution.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.800
The attempt by Netanyahu to get to limit, even just limit,

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.960
not abolish the Supreme Court produced profound internal divisions.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.680
I also followed and I even went there for on some occasions.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.320
I followed the evolution of political development in New Zealand.

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:11.040
Now, New Zealand was interesting because its original constitution

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.360
was an extreme version of the British constitution,

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.600
which is that there were no set rights.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.960
There was no Supreme Court.

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:23.840
When I went in the early 90s, late 80s, there was no second chamber.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.240
It was a billiard hall, at least when I visited them.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.680
And I think the second chamber was abolished there in the 1950s.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.840
So there was one Parliament which could do anything.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.480
And that was why, by the way, that was the reason,

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.920
the basic fundamental constitutional political reason,

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:47.440
why neoliberalism there was more radical than anywhere else.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:53.840
It's the only country of which I'm aware in which farming was marketized,

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.920
radically marketized.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.240
Usually power, you can do all sorts of things about farm,

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.480
but you actually just defund them completely, which they did, almost unthinkable.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.080
And it all happened rather quickly.

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.800
There were local reasons for that, which is that the

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.840
their Labour Party was taken over by someone with strong neoliberal views,

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.680
but a somewhat left-wing foreign policy.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.360
And that led to the left to think that none of this was going to happen.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.440
Or it was obvious to me that it was going to happen.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.160
But it was also obvious to me that it would melt down for various reasons,

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.400
because they started talking about changing the electoral system,

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:28.880
which they did, and then the party consolation of parties all changed.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.080
So most of what had been done was kept,

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.920
but some of the more extreme entries for their faturism were sort of made.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.760
A bit more bearable.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.840
But you're absolutely right about this.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.760
I think Blair didn't grasp what a fundamental change was.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.040
Or maybe he did, but he thought it would be coherent.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.520
He didn't understand that underneath, there'd still be parliament,

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.120
there'd still be local authorities, and they would be political bodies.

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.160
And then you superimpose this structure of law going up to the Supreme Court.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.480
But the Supreme Court still can't overrule parliament.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:10.480
If parliament comes up with a decision, which is what it wants,

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.040
but the political will is absent.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:16.240
In practice, what that means is my political hope,

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:20.160
insofar as I still have any, is for a hung parliament,

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.840
which may not happen either.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.720
There may not be a hung parliament because of what's happened in Scotland.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.480
The meltdown of the SNP may give Labour a working majority,

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.120
in which case there will not be proportional representation.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.000
I've now come to the view, which I have posed for many, many, many years.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.000
But I pride myself on being something of an empiricist.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.200
So I come to this view from observations and evidence that electoral reform

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:52.640
is a precondition of any kind of emergence of better political ideas

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.440
and better political coalitions in Britain.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:58.240
And the reason I came to that is that the principal argument

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:01.680
against proportional representation is that it doesn't produce strong government,

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:04.320
but we've had governments with massive majorities that have been weak,

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:09.360
very weak, have been locked in internal 80 majority,

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:18.320
produced chaos and anarchy and various kinds of internal party conflict and division,

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.680
and achieved nothing, basically.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:27.040
So having that experience and seeing all the parties converging on the non-existent centre,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.760
that strange confluence of watered down policies,

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.720
all of which are opposed by the British majority.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:40.000
And the only way that can be broken up is by changing the electoral system.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.440
And I think that is possible. There may yet be a hung parliament.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:46.240
And if there isn't a hung parliament this time, there may be after that.

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:52.640
Because one thing I would confidently make a prediction, many other things.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.800
It's not clear who's going to win the American elections,

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.640
not clear whether Biden will be around, not clear what's going to happen.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.080
But in Britain, I'm pretty confident Labour will be overwhelmed quite quickly

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.120
if it becomes a government.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.120
Because it has nothing, essentially.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:14.320
Its only policies are a green agenda, which is not affordable

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.440
and which imposes disproportionate costs on working people.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.800
So we'll be rejected by the trade unions and already is being to some extent.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:25.600
And a pro-European policy, which is anachronistic, a nostalgist,

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.920
and won't occur, probably something like that.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.640
Probably won't occur.

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:34.080
Because it will be difficult to legitimate democratically in Britain,

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.720
any really transformative re-engagement with Europe.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.880
So it's a cul-de-sac that they're moving into.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.040
That will break down and then something else will happen.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:45.680
It's interesting about the parliamentary sovereignty bit,

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.400
because Ramsay McDonald said this in the early 20th century,

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:51.040
which is, we don't need to do what the Bolsheviks have done in Russia.

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:55.840
We have a sovereign parliament, which gives the person with the largest number of seats

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.040
an extraordinary amount of power.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:57.520
I want to finish this.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:59.680
But that's one of my, I'm not a socialist.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.680
It's one of my objections to the EU.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.760
It's constructed to make socialism impossible.

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.440
Yeah, well, moderate social democracy.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.080
No, I mean, it's constructed to make social democracy impossible.

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.960
I mean, if it achieved all its goals, it would have done that.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.760
It would have been a vast neoliberal market of capital and labour.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.600
That's what it explicitly is.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:20.720
So what I find puzzling among on the left, moderate or radical left,

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:25.360
is that they hold out these hopes and illusions about the EU.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.960
It's very explicit what the EU wants.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.120
They want a neoliberal continent.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:29.680
Last question.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.760
You talk about the rise of hyper-liberal ideology

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.400
and the woke religion of surplus elites.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.920
So I'm going to read this quote here.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.840
Hyper-liberal ideology plays a number of roles.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:43.360
It operates as a rationale for a failing variety of capitalism

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.160
in a vehicle through which surplus elites struggle to secure a position

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.360
of power in society.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.320
And so far as it expresses a coherent system of ideas,

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:54.240
it is the anti-Western creed of an antinomian intelligentsia

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.880
that is ineffably Western.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.480
So this is fascinating.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.000
There's a lot of packed into this.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:00.880
Yeah, that's fascinating.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:07.600
So this idea that hyper-liberalism, woke movement, etc.,

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.120
is drawing upon the intellectual reservoirs of Western liberalism

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.760
in order to attack Western liberalism.

01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:17.120
And you see really strong parallels between that

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.200
and sort of late Tsarist Russia.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:20.400
I do see some parallels,

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.400
but the interesting point I would make now,

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:26.160
I mean, there wouldn't have been the Russian Revolution

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.520
if there hadn't been the First World War.

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.440
Of course, there could be a bigger war than we've had so far.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.480
It could be that the United States would get into a war.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.280
I think it's quite unlikely, actually, with China.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.680
And it's very unclear who would prevail

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.440
or who would lose the most from that war.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.840
So there can be more than one comparison.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.680
But the key thing about the hyper-liberals

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:48.640
is I think the key contradiction or paradox in them

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.880
is on the one hand, they're tremendously anti-Western,

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.880
or claim to be the anti-colonial.

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.040
They think Western societies are incurably rotten.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.920
Western civilization was a blot on the planet and on human history.

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:01.760
And on the other hand, their ideological goals

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:04.240
of deconstructing the self of radical autonomy

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.680
are all hyperbolic versions of Western ideals.

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:08.560
And not only that.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.080
They think that all the countries in the world

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.440
will have to go through this process.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.720
They think that the Taliban must become liberal.

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:16.800
I don't know if anything's wrong with the Taliban,

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.080
in my view, at least.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.600
But is there only one alternative?

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.600
Deconstructionist, radical hyperliberalism?

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.880
They're not going to become like that.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.560
Most of the world isn't like that.

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:28.640
Indeed, the hyperliberalism of America

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.920
is strongest in the Anglesphere.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.640
Beyond that, it's weak in Eastern post-communist Europe.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.760
It's very weak in India.

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.520
It's weak in China.

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.480
It's very weak.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:43.520
It's regarded in most of the world with a mixture of

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:48.160
gleeful, chadenoid, and pity and contempt.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.400
Nobody admires it.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.040
And yet, it's very strong in the Anglesphere

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:53.840
in many parts of the world.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:57.120
So America's in this strange paradoxical position now,

01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:58.160
when hyperliberals are that.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:01.760
America has no soft power in the world.

01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.840
I mean, there's no country in the world

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:07.280
and no where there are strong majorities

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.280
which see America as an ideal to be adopted.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.880
There are some people that emigrate to America

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.640
from Latin America, Haiti, China to some extent, India.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.640
But it has no soft power.

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:19.600
And yet, this parochial, peculiar American ideology

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.520
which universalizes certain American dilemmas and problems,

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.640
certain features of racism and colonialism,

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:27.680
some of which are universal.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.600
But the ones out there, what that universe is,

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.920
their own peculiar parochial history

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.320
has spread in many other parts of the world.

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:39.920
So it's a projection of a hyperbolic projection

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.640
of certain Western ideals and forms of thinking,

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:46.000
Christianity to some extent, which is a cult of the victim.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:52.720
The Enlightenment, which is part of a cult of human autonomy,

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:55.280
are radicalized to an extreme point.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.960
And then the idea is the whole world is,

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:58.880
isn't it going to become like that?

01:23:58.880 --> 01:23:59.920
Five or 10 years from now,

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.240
certainly 20 years from now,

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.960
the situation in Britain and Europe and in America

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:08.640
will be unrecognizably different because this is not,

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.880
I don't know what it'll be, it'll be quite different from now.

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.720
But it won't be one in which this is stable,

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.960
hyperliberal elite running everything.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:19.920
So there are huge movements of discontent,

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.760
some of them very unpleasant movements,

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.080
some of them horrifying movements in Europe and elsewhere,

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:25.600
but they're vast movements.

01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:27.440
For example, in their song,

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.240
Rich Men North of Richmond in America,

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:31.040
you heard about that?

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:33.360
How many views did it get?

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.160
Now, the left is furious about that

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.600
and the liberals are furious about this.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:38.800
I'm writing about this shortly,

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.640
I've written about it in the New States,

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.600
but they're furious about it because they say,

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:44.560
well, it's not really a critique of capitalism,

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.160
it's racism.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:50.480
Richmond was the capital of the Confederate regime

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.560
and so on in the Civil War, it's all terrible stuff.

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.760
But why has it got so many listeners?

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.320
One of the reasons is surely that

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.760
the marginalization and the suffering

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.360
and the loss of a productive role

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:08.960
of millions and millions of Americans,

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.560
along with the stagnant incomes

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.160
of millions and millions more,

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.880
in other words, the rise of extreme inequality

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.640
and so on, is being either ignored

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:21.920
or very inadequately treated by the mainstream parties.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:22.880
That's the reason.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.560
So there's no way that,

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.120
there's no way out of this situation

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:29.120
and put it into a very simple thing.

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:32.000
Whoever wins the next presidential election in America

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.520
will not be accepted as legitimate

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:35.040
by at least a third of the population.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.240
So they've entered what Marxists used to call

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.760
a legitimation crisis.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.640
They're already in it

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.360
and it will become acute after the next election.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.440
Whoever wins, because whoever wins

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.520
is not going to win by a sweeping majority.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.000
Worse than that, there'll be a large block,

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.560
20, 30, 40% maybe,

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.040
who regard it as not just of Trumpists.

01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:55.920
What if Trump wins?

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.840
He will regard it as illegitimate

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.600
by liberals and Democrats.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.680
It's entered an irreversible period

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.960
of legitimation crisis.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.320
It doesn't mean the state's going to collapse.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.440
It doesn't mean there's going to be anarchy.

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:08.640
It doesn't mean there's going to be civil war,

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.480
like in the 1860s,

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.560
but it does mean that it'll be a dysfunctional state

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:15.680
which is semi-failed

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.200
and probably will withdraw

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.600
if there isn't an accidental big war before then

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:22.800
probably will withdraw

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.840
for some of its major commitments abroad

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.520
to begin with Ukraine

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.880
and possibly even its support for Taiwan.

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.680
In other words, turn into a more,

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.200
there might be a goal of an autocratic economy

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.560
which America could achieve,

01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:44.000
if anyone can, probably in the United States,

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.240
mixed with a willingness to trade

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.120
on negotiators with anybody, including China.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.120
So it could be that this whole anti-Chinese,

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.200
I mean, it's more deeply rooted than the support for Ukraine,

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.280
but it could be that this whole anti-Chinese,

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.600
by the way, I'm strongly critical

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.960
of many aspects of the Chinese regime

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.400
and I also regard it as a threat.

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.440
Espionage and other things, absolutely real.

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.680
They're not made up by conspiracy theories.

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:10.720
They're real, real threats.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.960
But America's not ready for war.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.720
It's not prepared for war.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.480
I don't convince it will fight a war

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.120
and that it's the economic interests

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.280
of many sectors of American society

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:25.680
wouldn't benefit from because a lot of companies,

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.480
I mean, America, it's unlike the Cold War, fundamental point.

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.800
The relationship between America and China

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.560
is completely unlike the Cold War

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.560
because they co-dependent economically,

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:37.600
which the Soviet Union and the West was not in the course.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:38.960
Fundamentally different situation.

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.800
So it'll be something different will happen out there.

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.080
War could happen by accident,

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.440
but if it doesn't happen by accident,

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.640
I think the most likely outcome

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:48.160
is that America will fall in on itself,

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.560
introvert, become even more introverted

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.640
than it is really actually now.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.960
And that would fundamentally change

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.960
the whole world geopolitical situation,

01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:58.160
including in Europe,

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.640
because America's never been stronger in Europe

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.000
than it is now.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.360
If the rug is pulled on that,

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:05.120
what happens in Europe?

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.040
Not just in Ukraine, but in other parts of it.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:09.520
What happens?

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:12.320
What happens to the EU, for example?

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:14.160
So I think we are approaching

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:19.360
an historical juncture in which

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:21.440
certain options, which have been options,

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.480
will cease to be options.

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.480
And other options will be sort of embedded for some time.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:29.280
And that's not a deterministic or a fatalistic view,

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.240
but it's one which accepts the irreversibility

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.520
of historical changes.

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.560
Even neo feudalism isn't feudalism.

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.920
And also accepts that

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:45.120
the situation that we're in now, politically speaking,

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.880
is in some respects a tragic one.

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:48.960
John Gray, thanks so much for joining us.

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:51.040
No, thank you for your questions.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.040
And thank you for the very interesting conversation

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.400
in which you've put counterarguments

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.080
from which I've learned.

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:57.200
I'm very glad to hear it.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:57.840
My pleasure.

01:28:57.840 --> 01:28:58.400
Thank you.
