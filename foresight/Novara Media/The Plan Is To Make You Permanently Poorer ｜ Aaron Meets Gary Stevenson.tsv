0	5120	I look at economic analysis in the media, that is not analysis, that is an entertainment product.
5120	8960	If you are not taking these guys and rewarding them for being right,
8960	12800	and punishing them for being wrong, then they are not analysing their f***ing dancing.
18160	23760	Everybody knows that inequality is getting worse. Well, almost everybody. Anybody serious? Anyway.
24720	30560	For Gary Stevenson, that is the essential trend, not just the last 15 years, but the next 15 years too.
32000	36000	Not that long ago, Gary was one of the most successful traders on the planet.
36880	42400	Now, he's a campaigner around inequality, though he still does the occasional trade as well.
43040	45120	Gary, it's great to have you joining us on downstream.
45120	45520	Thank you.
46320	49360	We've got a lot to talk about. We'll start right from the beginning.
49440	55360	Age 22 in 2008, you got a job as a trader at Citigroup in Canary Wharf.
55920	57920	Within two years, you made your first million pounds.
58640	60800	And that's a position that a lot of young people aspire to,
60800	65120	but you started from a very humble beginning. So, can you walk us through your story,
65120	70480	where you come from, the Gary Stevenson kind of narrative arc?
70480	74720	Yeah, okay. So, I'm from Ilford, which is a small suburb of East London.
74720	76160	Yeah, I come from a pretty poor background.
77040	80720	A little terrorist house next to the railway. Got one brother, one sister.
81920	85840	I was always very good at maths growing up. So, I think if you grew up in East London,
85840	90560	you know, when I was a kid, we could literally see that the skyscrapers in Canary Wharf going up
90560	94480	when we were kids. You can't ever assume you're just going to go into banking, right?
95120	97920	So, that was sort of the path I thought I'd go on.
98880	103280	I got expelled from school when I was 16 for a, I normally call it a drug-related incident.
104240	105840	What was it?
106560	108320	It was a cannabis, you know.
108320	109040	You were expelled?
109600	110640	Yeah, yeah, 16.
110640	111600	Just for smoking cannabis?
112320	115760	I think I sold about Â£2 worth of cannabis, which I wouldn't call it a sale.
117040	120720	Yeah, I was young and I don't condone such things, but it happened back then.
120720	123920	So, I was sort of stuck at home, gave me a bit of a kick up the arse,
123920	127680	and I was sort of studying for my exams, but I did well in my exams and, you know,
127680	129440	managed to get good A-levels and went to go to LSE.
130160	132480	So, LSE, I don't know if you know people from LSE.
132480	133920	It's a bit of a London School of Economics.
133920	135760	It's a bit of an investment bank in Bootcamp.
136960	139840	And I kind of figured I'd just go there, kill the exams.
139840	142880	I would study maths and economics and get a job as a trader.
144880	146080	That is super hard.
146080	148480	Well, exactly, to get the job.
148480	152240	No, maths for a degree is, because I know people that did maths at LSE,
152240	155200	and they were really good maths students at A-level or whatever,
155200	157360	but university level maths is incredibly demanding.
157360	159120	I mean, you must be really good at maths.
160080	161520	It was my thing as a kid.
161520	161840	Yeah.
161840	163440	Yeah, I won a few competitions.
163440	164640	Math was my thing as a kid.
165200	166640	It's just sort of the way my mind works.
168640	171360	But I thought I could just go and just kill the maths exams and get a job.
172080	175760	But I remember sort of coming back second year, and suddenly,
175760	178960	everyone at LSE is just, they start talking in acronyms,
178960	184160	CDSEs, M&As, MBOs, you know, CDOs, IBD, and I was thinking,
184160	184880	what is going on?
184880	186240	I didn't know anything.
186800	187920	I spoke to a friend and he was like,
188320	190320	you have to apply for 35 internships.
190320	192480	And you hope you get one, and then that's how you get a job.
192480	195760	And all of these guys, LSE,
196560	200160	LSE is literally full of kids of Russian oligarchs
200160	203600	and the Chinese Politburo, this international billionaire
203600	204320	sending the kids to LSE.
204320	206000	And they'd all been prepping from when they were kids.
207200	211520	They'd all started a charity and checked through the Sahara Desert.
211520	213760	How long did it take you to work this out at the LSE?
213760	215040	How long did it take you to work out,
215040	217440	okay, the people I'm now studying with at university,
217440	219920	it's not like the creme de la creme of the kids at school,
219920	222320	which was what you think it is before you go to university,
222320	224080	but it's actually people I've never met before.
224080	225760	I remember I was in the math department,
225760	227680	which is a bit of sort of, you know what math guys are like.
227680	230560	And we went on like this sort of away day, like very early on.
230560	233920	And I brought like a two liter bottle of like white lightning cider
234800	235760	on the coach.
235760	237360	And I was like, I put some cider, everyone was looking at me
237360	238160	like I was insane.
238160	240800	And I remember thinking, this is not like what I saw in the movies.
242160	244480	But I was, to be honest, when I was a kid,
244480	246480	I was like, man on the mission, I'm going to get this job.
246480	247520	Nothing's going to stop me.
247520	250720	And that's why it was quite dispiriting to realize that basically,
250720	252640	you have to send all these CVs and cover letters,
252640	254800	and everyone, you've got to fluff it with all this stuff, right?
254800	257040	Like I played clarinet at the Royal Albert Hall,
257040	258240	you know what I mean, this kind of stuff.
258240	260640	And literally, I was fluffing pillows at DFS.
260640	262960	That's all I had, you know, I tried to be a grime rapper,
262960	264240	you know, you can't put that on your CV.
264960	267920	You know, I had the little jacket with cadaverous crew in on the back of it.
267920	270720	But like, so I was thinking, how am I going to get this job basically?
270720	272240	And I didn't know what to do.
272240	274800	So I just figured like, I didn't make a single application
275440	279360	because I knew I would never beat these guys on CV and cover letter.
279360	282960	Like there's nothing, literally, I'm fluffing pillows at DFS in Bekton.
282960	284400	You know, I'm not going to get a job with that.
284960	287680	So I figured I would just like try and kill these exams
287680	292480	and like be very sort of like loud about it and hope somebody notices.
293280	297280	And basically, somebody did notice because a guy from near above said,
297280	299920	just I never even met the guy, came up to me in the library one day and he said,
300560	302560	Citibank has one trailer you to a card game.
302560	303840	It's a maths game.
303840	305280	You win that game, you can get a job.
305280	309120	And I was sort of my ears pricked up because it's like maths.
309120	310000	I'm good at maths.
310000	310720	I'm good at games.
311360	312160	So let's just do this.
312160	312320	Right.
312320	313840	And he explained like the rules of the game to me.
314480	316160	And then I went to the competition.
316160	317040	I won the LSE round.
317040	318560	And then I basically just stopped going lectures.
318560	320960	And I just, all I did was study this one game,
320960	322800	which was like a stupid little math game.
322800	323680	What was the game?
323680	324480	It's like a card game.
324480	325680	It's like a poker style game.
325680	328000	They make it basically like everyone has a card
328000	329680	and there's another three cards in the middle.
329680	333200	And you just essentially you make bets using a trading style mechanism
333200	334880	of what the sum total of everyone's cards will be.
334880	336240	So it's probabilities basically.
336240	338880	Citibank, well, this is actually interesting.
338880	342320	You say that because the way I won the game was,
342320	345280	I knew that all the mathsy guys would just calculate
345280	348240	the statistical expected value, which meant that
350560	352720	if someone had a high card, they'd quote high prices.
352720	354720	And if someone had a low card, they'd quote low prices.
354720	356800	And you could just buy, sell, buy, sell, buy, sell.
356800	359920	And it's kind of, it's amazing it was that easy.
359920	363840	And other people probably should have realised what I was doing.
363840	366240	But I think this is, I think, another thing
366240	368000	which has sort of benefited me throughout my career.
368640	370240	Because of the way that I look and the way that I sound,
370240	373840	I think people just thought I was fucking an idiot basically doing mad stuff.
373840	376000	Like, but it was easy.
376000	378480	They were playing the numbers and I was playing the game basically.
378480	383600	So I won that competition and the madness of it is what that meant was,
383600	385840	you know, all these other guys who'd be like learning all these acronyms,
386800	389040	you know, and sort of talking to like, you know,
389120	391360	they were in the investment side, in the finance side,
391360	392800	going to all these events.
392800	395200	And here's me turning up on my internship.
395200	396240	I didn't know anything.
396240	397440	I didn't know a single acronym.
397440	398560	I didn't know anything like that.
399920	402640	And the madness thing of it all is, the traders fucking loved it.
402640	405360	They loved me turning up like some kid from down the road.
405360	408960	Like, just like, I don't know anything, but teach me and I'll do it.
408960	409600	You know what I mean?
409600	414400	And I think it kind of, you know, there's this myth of like the Cockney Wideboy Trader.
415120	415840	But I don't exist.
415840	416640	The Barrow Boy.
416640	417440	Exactly, yeah.
417520	421600	You go there nowadays and it's all just, you know,
421600	423200	it's rich guys from rich families.
423200	426320	It's the same sort of international money delete that goes to LSE.
426320	426880	You know what I mean?
426880	430480	It's, you know, there's some sort of blue bloods in Oxford and Cambridge,
430480	433120	but it's, you know, Baconi and MIT.
433120	435600	And it's all these just rich guys from rich families.
435600	437520	So I think they saw me turn up just like a kid.
437520	438560	Baconi just for viewers.
438560	440160	It's a university Milan and...
440160	441440	A finance university, man.
441440	443360	It's like the Italian LSE, essentially, yeah.
444000	447040	Yeah, so they loved it and I turned up and
448720	450720	then the financial crisis happened just after I started.
450720	454000	And then within a few years, I was the most profitable trader in the bank,
454000	456640	which I guess we'll talk about how that happened.
456640	457360	The Citibank.
457360	458720	Yeah, Citibank, yeah.
458720	462560	So you start this great job off the back of winning a card game.
462560	463360	Yeah.
463360	467120	An amazing story and it's like, I'm expecting a Netflix film about this.
467120	467920	Yeah, it will come.
467920	469680	Yeah, I suspect so.
470080	472480	You go to work at Citibank.
472480	474320	You walk in first day.
474320	474880	What's that like?
476560	477680	Trading floor is a big place.
478960	482560	I remember getting the train to Canary Wharf
482560	485600	and the Jubilee line makes this sort of like whooping sound.
485600	487760	It's not like the trains that go past my window.
489600	491120	Yeah, I remember they walked me in.
491120	493520	I remember just seeing like massive, massive floor.
493520	496480	I think the big thing that hits you about the trading floor is all these screens.
496480	499440	It's like every trader has like a wall of like nine screens.
499440	500960	Massive wall of screens like that.
500960	504320	And they walk me around and they sort of sat me down,
505600	509040	introduced me to the boss of the desk.
509040	512080	And the boss is high and then he just ignores you, right?
512080	513520	And you're sort of, you're sitting there.
513520	514400	Nobody says anything to you.
514400	516080	This is a thing that have very common experience
516080	517760	when you start on trading floors is everyone says hi
517760	519040	and then they just totally ignore you.
519040	523120	And it's kind of your job to like get seen basically.
523120	524560	And then you sort of start to poke around.
524560	525520	Like, can I get you a coffee?
525520	526320	Can I get you a tea?
527760	528960	Can I go get your lunch?
528960	532960	And that sort of, that's like, weirdly, like, I think
534160	536880	I sort of just started just getting everyone's lunch for them.
536880	537120	Yeah.
537120	538320	And I remember this one incident.
538320	539840	But you're an interest rate trader.
539840	541600	Well, I mean, at first I was just an intern, right?
541600	542480	So you're just an intern.
542480	543680	So you've got no specific...
544880	545680	You're just an intern.
545680	547680	You need to get them to hire you to the desk basically.
547680	548000	Right.
548000	549760	And I remember I just used to try and get everybody lunch.
549760	552800	I remember sort of one of my first, one of my first days,
552800	554800	I got a load of people lunch and I took a little note
554800	556720	of like how much everybody's lunch cost.
556800	561200	And then I put the change on the table, exact, exact change
561200	562880	next to the trader who paid for the lunches.
563440	565360	And the trader just, he just looked at it.
565360	566880	You know, like when somebody dropped some coins
566880	568160	and people just looked, he looked at the money
568160	569040	and he was like, what's that?
569040	570320	And I was like, it's your change.
570960	573440	And he was like, it just didn't say anything.
573440	576160	And I was like, it's like Â£4.31.
576160	579200	And he just slid it across the desk into his little drawer.
579200	581120	And he looked at me right in the face and he said,
581120	582720	on this desk, we keep the change.
582720	585360	And I was thinking, these guys are fucking mad basically.
586880	588240	But that's how it works basically.
588240	590160	And then, you know, I started getting, you know,
590560	591600	I got a lot of lunches.
592720	594640	Eventually they sent me to get like lunch river on the floor.
594640	597280	I think it was this kind of game dynamic
597280	599520	because they knew that I wasn't from that space
599520	600400	and they kind of loved it.
600400	601760	And they were like, played little games with me.
601760	603200	So like, on end of my internship,
603200	604720	they sent me to buy burgers for everyone
604720	606080	on the whole trading floor,
606080	607920	which is like fucking 500 people or something.
607920	608400	Right?
608400	609360	Just called me over, Gary.
609920	611360	Today I'm buying lunch river on the floor.
611920	613360	And I knew they wanted me to be like,
613360	613840	shitting myself.
613840	614880	I was like, yeah, fine.
614880	615680	So I did it.
615680	617280	You know, I had to like get everyone involved.
617280	618960	And then when I came back, I sat down
618960	620400	after delivering burgers to everyone on the floor
620400	622720	and they called me, Gary, Gary, you got a passport.
623280	625680	And I was like, yeah, go home and get it.
625680	626880	You're getting skiing.
626880	628400	And that was like, honestly,
628400	629920	the funniest thing about that was,
629920	631440	I didn't even realize when you went skiing
631440	632800	that you were in the mountains.
632800	633840	You went to the top of the mountains.
634560	635920	And it was like, fuck, you know, it was mad.
635920	638480	I remember texting my dad, where's my passport on the train?
638480	639760	So what did you think you were going like cross country
639760	640800	skiing or something?
640800	643040	I just, I only knew like Milton Key and Snowcenters
643040	643920	is the only thing I could think of.
643920	645680	I just thought it was like on a field or something.
645680	646880	You know where I'm from.
646880	648080	You don't, people don't go skiing.
648080	648480	You know what I mean?
648480	649280	I didn't know about that.
650640	651840	But then that was how I got the job.
651840	653440	And then 2008, I'll start full time.
653440	655120	That was when I became like a full time trader.
655120	657360	And then as soon as I hit that desk, the crisis happened.
657360	658160	And that was sort of.
658160	658960	So when do you start?
658960	661120	Because obviously it's to the best of my recollection
661120	662560	that it's basically August, September,
662560	664080	things really hot up in 2008.
664080	665680	That's like June 30, 2008.
665680	668960	So it's just a couple of months before things go bang.
669760	670160	Yeah.
670160	670960	Yeah, basically.
670960	674000	And I had no idea what was going on.
674000	676880	But the crazy thing was the desk I worked on,
676880	678240	which was short-term interest rates,
678240	680240	which is basically short-term loans,
680240	682480	was a very unfashionable desk previous.
682480	684400	They literally make loans of like one day,
684400	686480	which is like not a massively profitable business, right?
687920	690640	And in the credit crisis, 2008, it blew up.
690640	692720	It became unbelievably profitable.
692720	695280	So like they had to really attracted all these sort of
696000	698080	new school, like Yale, Harvard types,
698080	700640	you know, with all of these like immaculate,
700640	702960	like shirts with the little monogram on it.
702960	704320	It was all sort of old school traders.
704320	706080	And then suddenly they're making a ton of money.
706080	708480	And I was just thinking,
708480	710320	how do I get me some of this money, basically?
710320	711520	How do I follow these guys?
713440	715040	And just desperately trying to get them to tell me,
715040	715840	like, what are you doing?
715840	716720	How are you making this money?
716720	718400	You're like, what's happening?
718400	719440	And I was trying to figure it out.
720880	724080	And it turned out, so a lot of what they were doing
724080	726400	was basically, it was an American bank
726400	728000	and they were lending out loads and loads of dollars.
728640	729520	And it was super profitable
729520	730640	because everybody needed dollars.
731600	733680	And Citibank at this point is the biggest bank in the world.
733680	734480	Yeah, at that point.
734480	735120	Yeah, yeah.
735120	736400	So they were lending a ton of dollars.
736400	737280	And I remember sort of,
738000	738800	I figured out what they were doing.
738800	740160	I lent a ton of dollars too.
740160	741920	And then I was, there was one guy who I worked with.
742480	743760	He was like, he was a scouser.
743760	744400	He was from Liverpool.
744400	745840	He didn't go to university.
745840	747840	And after I put my first big trade on,
747840	748800	I went home and I thought,
748800	750480	oh fuck, what if this trade goes wrong?
750480	752560	So I went in the next morning, I spoke to this guy,
752560	753360	this scous guy.
753360	756160	And he said, I said, what's the risk on this trade?
756160	759040	And he said to me, this trade will lose money.
759840	761360	If the global banking system blows up,
762160	765360	in which case you'll lose your job and I'll lose my job.
765360	766640	And it'll be the end of fucking everything.
767280	768080	But that's not going to happen.
768080	769200	So we're going to make a ton of money.
769200	771040	So you just cross your fingers and hope it works out.
773200	775040	So the first couple of years, all I did was that basically,
775040	776000	just lend these dollars.
777440	779680	And that was super profitable in 2008, 2009.
780320	784480	Then in 2010, that stopped being profitable.
784480	785680	I remember this weird thing happened.
785680	787440	The Swiss National Bank did something that fucked me.
787440	789040	And I lost like eight million dollars in a week.
789520	791120	And that's when I realized like,
791120	792560	it's not really free money like that.
792560	794960	And I have to start figuring out like a smarter way to make money.
794960	797920	So your first year, 2008, you make 400,000 pounds.
798640	800880	You clear for yourself personally, something like that now.
800880	802560	Oh no, that was, that was 2008.
802560	804720	So 2008, I started in June, 2008.
806240	810960	2009, my boss who hired me quit basically,
810960	812160	in the middle of the year.
812160	813280	And how come?
814800	817600	I think he made so much money in 2008 that like,
818320	819280	he just thought, I'm going to quit.
819280	820720	I'm going to like live the dream.
820720	822960	I'm going to like build my house in California.
822960	825520	And that's a whole nother story, which we can get into.
826240	831120	But he quit and he said to me,
831120	832160	you can ask me anything you want.
832160	834480	And I said, what do I need to do to make 100 grand for the bank?
834480	837200	At that age, so I would have been 20, just turned 22.
837200	840160	100 grand in my mind was like the most money you could make.
840160	841120	Like in a year basically.
841120	842240	What do I have to do to make 100 grand bonus?
842240	843120	You go, it's not possible.
843760	845520	You need to make 10 million dollars for the bank.
845520	848160	He said, I said, all right, I went back,
848160	850720	put one massive bet on 12 million dollars by the end of the year.
850720	853840	And then yeah, and I was expecting to get paid a bonus of like 100 grand.
853840	855680	And I remember going to the meeting room and it was like,
855680	857520	just under 400 grand on the piece of paper.
857520	858880	And I remember looking at it and just being like,
860240	862160	I remember, I could remember like it was yesterday.
862160	864640	My boss was a massive guy and I pointed at the number.
864640	865840	I thought it must be another number.
865840	867280	I pointed at the number and I said, is it that?
867280	868400	And he said, yeah.
868400	871200	And I literally said, wow, that's a lot of money.
871200	872000	How old are we?
872000	872800	Just turned 23.
875680	878880	And I think what is weird about that?
879440	880880	You know, there'll be people who hear that story
880880	881920	and they'll be like, that's fantastic.
881920	882480	That's amazing.
882480	884640	Like kids from poor background made a ton of money.
884640	885360	That's really, really good.
885920	886720	And it is good.
886720	888720	And you know, I wouldn't be able to afford to do what I do now
888720	889440	if it wasn't for that.
890080	894320	But the actual experience of it was like weirdly quite traumatic.
894320	896320	I remember seeing like, if I'd have had 100 grand,
896320	897760	I would have gone home to my parents and be like,
897760	898480	I got 100 grand.
898480	899920	I would tell my mates, I got 100 grand.
901280	902960	Yeah, I would have told my girlfriend about 100 grand.
902960	906240	But like 400 grand just seemed like an inhuman amount of money.
906240	909040	It felt like the kind of money that you couldn't tell anyone about.
909040	911920	It felt like, I felt like, how can I tell my, I went out
912960	914240	and I sat down next to this guy.
914240	916320	I used to work this gas guy and he could see I was upset.
916320	917680	And he said, go out and like sit down.
917680	921360	And I remember just thinking like, I think about my dad.
921360	922160	You know what I mean?
922160	924240	My dad worked for post office for 35 years
924240	926640	and he was probably never making much more than 20 grand.
926640	927760	And he used to start work.
927760	929440	He used to leave the house at like 5 a.m.
929440	931680	And the train used to go past the back of my house.
931680	933520	And my mum would wake me up and we try and look at him,
933520	935120	like wave at him, go and pass the house.
935120	937200	And obviously that's dark, you know, you see him
937200	940560	and you think about how hard he worked day after day after day
940560	941840	for 20 grand a year.
941840	944640	And then here's me, just 10, 23, sitting at a desk,
944640	946400	you know, for a year, 400 grand.
946400	947760	It just seemed like-
947760	949840	You were all of a sudden different to everybody you knew, right?
949840	950960	You're sort of disconnected to them.
950960	951440	Exactly.
951920	954800	That is 100 grand is like a gift.
954800	956720	400 grand like buys you out of your family,
956720	957840	buys you out of your friend group.
957840	959760	I remember like, I went around my mate's house
960560	962480	and we were playing like Pro Evo.
962480	966400	And they were all talking, a lot of them worked in finance.
966400	967280	Oh, did you get a bonus?
967280	968240	Oh yeah, I got five grand.
968240	970000	Oh yeah, I got like seven grand.
970000	972080	And then one of them said, did you get a bonus?
972080	973120	And I didn't tell anyone.
973120	974000	And I just thought, you know what?
974000	975200	These are like my closest friends.
975200	976480	I'm just going to fucking tell them, right?
976480	978880	So I told them, oh yeah, I got 395 grand.
978880	982400	And you could just like hear like the silence,
982400	985440	like feel the room of this like shock.
986240	988080	And it was almost, and then it started to feel like,
988960	990880	it started to feel like a cruel thing to tell people
990880	991840	in a weird way.
991840	993200	I made this amount of money.
993200	995600	And it was a, and it's, I know it's bizarre,
995600	997200	but I think in a weird way it was a cruel thing
997200	998000	to happen to me.
998000	1000080	And I know that sounds crazy, but it's just,
1002160	1004000	that level of inequality, you know,
1004000	1005760	I made a lot more than that in following years.
1005760	1006320	You know what I mean?
1006320	1008160	But like, it shouldn't exist.
1008160	1008960	It shouldn't happen.
1008960	1009760	You know what I mean?
1009760	1010240	It shouldn't.
1010240	1012880	And it's, don't get me wrong, right?
1012880	1014960	I think that people who work hard and are talented
1014960	1016560	and do good things should make money.
1016560	1018160	I think we should live in a world where that is possible,
1018160	1019280	100%.
1019280	1022160	But like, people like me and people where I'm from,
1022160	1024000	didn't even know that 400 grand was a thing
1024000	1024960	somebody could make.
1024960	1026080	I had no idea.
1026080	1027760	And then like, I was thinking,
1027760	1029440	if I've made 400 grand, what have the rest of these
1029440	1029920	fuckers made?
1029920	1030720	You know what I mean?
1030720	1031760	I was just looking around,
1031760	1033520	me thinking like, what is going on?
1034400	1036640	So yeah, it was, it was a, it was a mad experience.
1038480	1040880	You were city's most profitable trader globally
1040880	1042240	at one point, is that correct?
1042240	1042560	Yeah.
1042560	1043920	So that was 2011.
1043920	1044960	So basically like,
1044960	1046720	so this is after you've lost the money from?
1046720	1047040	Yeah.
1047040	1049360	So this sort of just lending the dollar stopped working
1049360	1049680	basically.
1049680	1051040	And I had to realize, I had to think like,
1051040	1051520	we're going to have to,
1052560	1053840	we're going to have to figure out a smarter way
1053840	1054640	to make money.
1054640	1057600	And so the history of this is actually quite interesting,
1057600	1057760	right?
1057760	1059120	So I was an interest rates trader.
1059120	1060240	We're going to get a bit technical here,
1060240	1061280	but we'll keep it simple.
1063280	1067120	So in 2008, all the interest rates in the,
1067120	1068960	in the rich world collapsed to zero,
1068960	1071040	because central bank cuts rates.
1071040	1072080	We want to boost the economy.
1072080	1073040	The economy is really shit.
1073040	1074160	So everybody cut their rates.
1074160	1076640	And then our job became basically
1076640	1078080	to bet on when more rates go up again.
1079200	1081360	And rates will go up when the economy recovers.
1081360	1082640	You know, that's a simplification,
1082640	1084960	but you know, that's basically what happens.
1085680	1088400	And interest rates stayed zero from 2008
1088400	1091200	until this year basically, 2022,
1091200	1092160	which is 14 years.
1092720	1094640	And in every single one of those years,
1095840	1097280	markets and economies predicted
1097280	1098640	that rates would go up the next year,
1099200	1101600	which was wrong 12, 13 years in a row,
1101600	1102880	which is interesting, right?
1103440	1105120	These are the best paid guys in the world
1105840	1106560	to do this thing.
1107200	1108400	And they're wrong year after year.
1108400	1110880	This is like if you studied, you know,
1110880	1112160	weather forecasting at uni
1112160	1114240	and you went to work at like the Met
1114240	1116080	and you saw that every single year,
1116080	1117280	every single day that like tomorrow's
1117280	1119360	going to be like sunny and 30 degrees,
1119360	1120640	you know, and they're always wrong.
1121280	1125520	So, you know, this happened in 2008.
1125520	1126880	And they're like, it'll get better next year.
1126880	1128320	It didn't 2009.
1128320	1129680	Okay, it was quite serious.
1129680	1131280	Maybe next year, 2010.
1131280	1132960	They're like, okay, well, just give it one more year.
1132960	1135520	And sort of, by sort of late 2010,
1135520	1137520	I'd seen these guys be wrong for two and a half years.
1137520	1141920	And I started to think like, maybe they're just wrong.
1141920	1143280	Maybe there isn't a recovery.
1143280	1145520	I think the big thing for me was,
1145520	1147280	because I came from a poor background,
1148080	1151120	and, you know, I still had the same friends,
1151120	1151840	the same family.
1151840	1156560	I could see that things were getting actively worse
1156560	1157520	for people from where I'm from.
1157520	1159600	And it was like, well, how do you expect,
1159600	1161920	the idea behind cutting interest rates
1161920	1163200	is you get people spending money on
1163200	1164400	because you can borrow money cheaply.
1164400	1165600	Oh, it's great, spend money.
1165600	1168480	But I look at the situation of my friends and family
1168480	1169200	that I grew up with.
1170880	1172880	These guys are losing their homes, right?
1172880	1173920	Their parents had property.
1173920	1175040	They'll never own property.
1175040	1176880	So they're getting poor year after year.
1177440	1179120	How the fuck are they going to start spending money
1179120	1180960	because you give them access to a cheap loan?
1180960	1182480	They don't even get access to that money.
1182480	1184400	They can't go and borrow money at zero percent.
1184400	1184880	You know what I mean?
1184880	1187920	So I started to look at this and I started to think,
1188880	1190720	I don't see it happening.
1190720	1191600	I don't see it happening.
1191600	1194000	And I guess I was in this sort of quite unique position
1194000	1195520	because there's not many people that go from
1195520	1198480	poor backgrounds to working in trading nowadays.
1198480	1202640	So I could see what it was like for ordinary people.
1202640	1204000	And I could also see what it was like
1204000	1205680	for these rich guys working in the city.
1205680	1206960	You know, it's a bunch of millionaires working in the city.
1206960	1209200	Do you also think because you started in 2008,
1209200	1210960	you had no sort of prior expectations?
1210960	1213120	Whereas somebody has been in the industry 25 years,
1213120	1214960	they've seen lots of ups and downs.
1214960	1217280	And so there's going to be a bunch of cognitive biases
1217280	1219520	where they say, I was here in the mid-80s.
1219520	1220720	I was here in the early 90s.
1220720	1222160	I was here for .com.
1222160	1223520	This is just the same.
1223520	1226800	But actually you didn't have any of that because there's all you knew.
1226800	1228320	I guess they're used to interest rates up and down.
1228320	1230240	They weren't used to this sort of flat lining, I think.
1230880	1233680	But you know, I think if you consider how long that went on for,
1233680	1236320	you know, even at the beginning of 2020,
1236320	1238480	people were still predicting rates going to go up later that year.
1239040	1240480	That's 12 years.
1240480	1242240	12 years of incorrect predictions.
1242240	1242800	It's incredible.
1242800	1244400	I think that's, you know,
1244400	1246800	we could have a whole discussion about why it is that happens.
1247280	1250800	And you know, I went back to Oxford 2017-2019
1250800	1251840	and I asked one of the professors,
1251840	1253200	we had an electoral interest rates.
1254720	1256000	And I went up to him afterwards and I said,
1256000	1256800	why do you think we were so,
1256800	1258480	we were wrong on these interest rates for so long?
1259040	1261120	And he said, oh no, we always knew rates would stay zero.
1262480	1264480	And I was like, I didn't know what to say to that
1264480	1266000	because, you know, this is my job, you know.
1266000	1268480	I know for fact that these guys predicted interest rates
1268480	1269680	would go back up every single year.
1269680	1271280	And I was like, no, you didn't.
1271280	1272000	It was like, yeah, we knew.
1272000	1272800	We knew.
1272800	1274240	I just said, I'm going to go home.
1274240	1276480	I'm going to send you the data and then we're going to talk about it.
1276480	1277680	2017, he said that.
1277680	1278320	Yeah, 2017.
1278320	1280000	Because even you had Janet Yellen before then
1280000	1282480	putting up US interest rates in like 2014, 2015,
1282480	1284240	they were saying, oh, we're going to try and go back to normal.
1284240	1286800	Yeah, which eventually came down again.
1286800	1287280	Yeah.
1287280	1290240	And I said, so I sent him the data and he was like, oh, that's interesting.
1290240	1291840	Yeah, we have been wrong for 10 years.
1291840	1293360	And his guy, right,
1295120	1297840	professor of macroeconomics at Oxford University,
1298400	1299920	he's been wrong for 10 years.
1299920	1302400	Not only has he been wrong for 10 years in a row,
1302400	1304320	he's not realized that he's done that.
1305040	1307040	That is the level we are at here of economics.
1308080	1310240	But look at this guy, rich guy, rich family.
1310240	1311760	He used to wear a nice snake skin belt.
1311760	1312320	You know what I mean?
1314080	1315360	He doesn't get hurt, does he?
1315360	1317360	This guy's wrong 10 years in a row.
1317360	1318640	He never gets hurt.
1318640	1319920	Of course, he doesn't notice.
1319920	1320400	You know what I mean?
1320400	1321200	I always, you know,
1321200	1323200	I wrote some articles at the beginning of COVID saying like,
1323200	1325360	this is going to cause a massive increase in inequality.
1325360	1327120	It's going to cause a massive increase in house prices.
1327120	1328800	It's going to cause a massive inflationary crisis.
1328800	1329200	Okay.
1329200	1331120	At the same time, Larry Elliott,
1331120	1333760	like chief economics editor at The Guardian,
1333760	1335360	was writing house prices are going to collapse.
1335360	1335600	Okay.
1336400	1337520	That was obviously wrong.
1337520	1338880	Who's punishing Larry Elliott?
1338880	1339680	You know what I mean?
1339680	1341920	But why was, wait, so at the beginning of COVID?
1341920	1343920	Yeah, because there was briefly,
1343920	1345440	there was briefly a buyer's market
1346000	1349600	because you did have lots of people with like student homes,
1349600	1351600	buy to let landlords, they just thought,
1351600	1354240	you know what, this is going to be unoccupied for God knows how long.
1354240	1355760	The margins are low, you should get rid.
1355760	1358160	So you got, you did get a big flood of those properties.
1358160	1359120	For a brief moment, yeah.
1359120	1360080	For about three, four months.
1360080	1362640	I remember, and it was less that the market fell,
1362640	1363760	there was just uncertainty.
1363760	1365280	So you could get real value.
1365280	1365600	Yeah.
1365600	1367360	But I think what people were missing was,
1367360	1369360	we knew at the beginning of COVID,
1369360	1371360	the government is going to give a shit ton of money out.
1371360	1373920	And in the end, the government gave out 600 billion pounds,
1373920	1374960	which I want to emphasize,
1375760	1378560	is 12,000 pounds for every single adult in the country.
1378560	1378880	Okay.
1378880	1380480	That's how much money the government gave out.
1380480	1381200	Okay.
1381200	1383120	And if anyone was bothered to do the analysis,
1383120	1384560	which basically nobody was,
1384560	1386560	you could see very quickly that that money is going to go
1386560	1388720	overwhelmingly to richest people in the country.
1388720	1389440	You could work that out.
1389440	1390800	We can go through the logic of that, right?
1390800	1391600	If there's a video on my YouTube,
1392080	1394320	exactly, you could see 600 billion pounds
1394320	1396000	is going to go to the richest people in the country.
1396000	1397280	They're going to fucking buy houses.
1397280	1398480	What the fuck house they're going to do with it?
1398480	1402720	You know, we're literally talking about 100, 200 grand per person.
1402720	1404000	Of course, house prices are going to go.
1404000	1405440	And I think there's this real,
1405440	1406640	I think the big problem is,
1407520	1409760	number one, there's very few economists
1409760	1410800	from poor backgrounds, right?
1410800	1412800	So then they're not really keyed into what's happening.
1412800	1415440	And number two, they don't get punished if they're wrong.
1415440	1416880	They don't get punished if they're wrong.
1416880	1418320	They don't get rewarded if they're right.
1418320	1419760	What sort of punishment would you like them to see?
1420480	1423440	Because obviously, you mean they lose legitimacy
1423440	1425440	and there's no counter incentives, right?
1425440	1427120	If you're right, you get low substates if you're wrong.
1427120	1429520	I'm not asking for these guys to be spanked in the streets, right?
1430160	1432400	At least knowledge is that they were wrong.
1434160	1436400	This guy at Oxford University, wrong for 10 years,
1436400	1437920	didn't even notice.
1437920	1438400	You know what I mean?
1438400	1441520	At least have some, you know, I'm from a poor background, right?
1441520	1442480	I walk onto the trading floor.
1442480	1444640	Within two years, I'm famous because I'm the guy who gets it right.
1445360	1446640	You know, I've been writing articles
1446640	1448560	for like two and a half years now about COVID.
1449120	1451600	And, you know, go read my articles from the beginning of COVID.
1451600	1453920	Every single thing I said would happen has happened, you know?
1454560	1456880	But, you know, I don't get the attention that Larry Elliot gets.
1456880	1458480	He's wrong in all his predictions.
1458480	1462000	You know, I mean, the problem is, if you don't have any mechanism
1462000	1465040	by which people who are consistently right get recognized
1465040	1468480	and people who are consistently wrong get shown up for being wrong,
1468480	1469760	then you will get shit analysis.
1469760	1470960	Of course you will.
1470960	1472080	It's obvious, isn't it?
1472080	1474160	And not only that, but it is inevitable
1474160	1475680	you'll end up with a posh boys club.
1475680	1478400	Because if you have no mechanism
1478400	1480320	by which people who actually understand
1480320	1482560	but are from don't have the social capital
1482560	1484160	can challenge people who are just chatting shit
1484160	1485360	but do have the social capital,
1485920	1487840	then you will just end up, you know,
1488960	1491520	how am I going to, how are people going to find my article?
1491520	1492480	You know what I mean?
1492480	1493680	You know, whereas in the city,
1493680	1495920	I could walk into any skyscrapers in Canary Wharf
1495920	1497200	and get paid a million pound a year.
1497200	1499200	Because these guys will look at my track record
1499200	1500640	and say, this guy keeps getting it right.
1501360	1504160	So actually there's more of a sort of meritocratic attitude
1504560	1506400	in the city than in journalism or academia.
1506400	1508160	Listen, there is no meritocracy in media.
1508160	1509680	And to be honest, in my opinion,
1509680	1511760	I look at economic analysis in the media,
1511760	1512800	that is not analysis.
1512800	1514320	That is an entertainment product.
1514880	1517200	If you are not taking these guys
1517200	1518720	and rewarding them for being right
1518720	1520240	and punishing them for being wrong,
1520240	1522720	then they are not analyzing their fucking dancing.
1522720	1523600	That's what they're doing.
1523600	1525760	You know, like, if you want them to be right,
1525760	1527120	pay them to be fucking right.
1527760	1528960	But we're not doing that, are we?
1528960	1529840	We're not doing that.
1529840	1532640	And if you think at the same time, right,
1532640	1534320	imagine you are an economist who's good,
1534320	1535280	who's really good.
1535280	1536960	You know what's happening, right?
1536960	1538960	You can write an article that's perfectly right
1538960	1540720	and no one will ever fucking read it.
1540720	1542320	Or you can go and work for fucking Bank of America
1542320	1543360	and get paid a million pound a year.
1544000	1545520	You know, that is the system that we've built.
1545520	1548880	And then we're surprised that the economy goes to shit.
1548880	1551840	You know, if you want, if you want good analysis,
1551840	1554400	at the very least, recognize good analysis.
1554400	1556640	This, nobody's even checking the homework here.
1556640	1557440	It's crazy.
1557440	1560240	There is some, well, I agree with you entirely.
1560320	1564800	But financial times, certain journalists,
1564800	1568320	instead of Ambrose Evans Pritchard at the Telegraph,
1568320	1569600	for instance, is really good on Russia
1569600	1571760	and the long-term consequences of what's going on there.
1572960	1574640	Generally speaking, I entirely agree with you.
1574640	1576240	And like you say, the incentives are much higher
1576240	1577840	to shut your gob and just make loads of money.
1577840	1578960	And the incentives aren't there to actually
1578960	1580480	have top, top finance journalists.
1580480	1582960	And I agree with you at the BBC,
1582960	1584720	which of course is where most people get there,
1584720	1587920	media in the UK, in most newspapers.
1588880	1591040	You might as well not bother being quite and quite informed
1591040	1592160	because you're not being informed.
1592160	1593520	Yeah.
1593520	1597840	But there are some good sources of news, surely,
1597840	1600320	because you yourself must consume new sources on this stuff.
1600320	1601040	So where are they?
1602000	1604720	To be totally honest, what I do more than anything else
1605520	1607440	is I trade and I talk to traders.
1608160	1608640	Listen.
1608640	1610400	There must be, there must be, there must be creditable,
1611040	1612800	there must be more creditable news sources
1612800	1614640	that at least some legitimacy is given to.
1615440	1616960	Blogs, podcasts.
1616960	1617520	You tell me.
1622240	1623520	There are good individuals.
1623520	1625280	You have good individuals who have good analysis.
1627120	1629200	I was never really a news reader.
1629200	1631680	I hired a guy to sit next to me and read the papers
1632400	1636320	and tell me like what's, because as a trader,
1636320	1638400	you need to know what people think.
1639040	1642320	Because as a trader, you don't make money just by being right.
1642320	1644240	You make money by being right specifically
1644240	1645840	when other people are wrong.
1645840	1648160	So it's actually like the art of understanding
1648160	1649440	the way in which people are wrong.
1649440	1650160	You know what I mean by that?
1650160	1651360	Because if everybody knows something,
1651360	1652000	it's not monetized.
1652000	1652800	It's not valuable exactly.
1654800	1658640	To be honest, I mean, I watch the news now largely because
1659680	1662720	I've moved away from purely financial analysis.
1662720	1665280	And now I'm in a space where what I want to do
1665920	1667520	is explain to people what's happening
1667520	1670640	to change the way that they view it and the way that they act.
1670640	1672400	So I need to know what you're being told
1672400	1674080	so I can explain to you why it's wrong.
1674160	1675760	There are good people who do good analysis.
1675760	1677280	There's, oh, I forget the names now.
1677280	1679040	There's the Norwegian guy at Financial Times.
1679040	1680480	I spoke to him, I should remember his name.
1680480	1681200	He's quite good.
1682560	1684800	But to be honest, when it comes to economics,
1684800	1688400	like I trade.
1689040	1690080	I trade.
1690080	1690880	That's what I do.
1690880	1692560	In terms of long-term market signals,
1692560	1693840	in terms of political risk,
1693840	1695440	and you think this might happen or this might happen,
1695440	1697840	where are you saying, oh, that's good information then?
1697840	1698960	So I talk to traders all the time.
1698960	1700560	The long-term implications, for instance,
1700560	1704240	of Russia's invasion of Ukraine
1704240	1706800	and what that means are the kinds of trades
1706800	1708000	you'd be involved in.
1708000	1709520	Clearly, you need source of information about that
1709520	1711280	because you're not in Ukraine.
1713280	1715920	Yeah, I mean, I think it's important basically
1715920	1717840	to know what you know about and what you don't know about.
1717840	1719760	I think that actually, in my opinion,
1719760	1721600	the economic significance,
1721600	1723680	the war in Ukraine is obviously a terrible thing.
1723680	1726080	But the economic significance of it in this country,
1726080	1728720	I think has been significantly overplayed, in my opinion.
1728720	1731040	I think that the inflation that we're seeing,
1731040	1732960	specifically in energy markets,
1732960	1734720	of course, it's affected the energy markets, right?
1734720	1736720	But look what's happening to London housing,
1736720	1737680	what's happening to London rents.
1737680	1739520	So Vladimir Putin didn't do that.
1740240	1742320	And I've been saying, from the beginning of COVID,
1742320	1745120	you know, we're giving 600 billion pounds to rich people.
1745120	1747040	If you don't expect an inflation in Christ after that,
1747040	1748400	then you don't understand money.
1748400	1752000	So you would put, let's say, well, we're at 10% now
1752000	1753440	and we don't know where we're going.
1753440	1755200	It was scheduled to go significantly higher.
1755200	1757280	We don't know because there's big intervention from government.
1757280	1759920	You would say, actually, the inflation we're seeing in this country
1759920	1762720	is more to do with quantitative easing
1762720	1765040	and printing money than Vladimir Putin.
1765040	1768480	I would say it's to do with the very large government deficit
1768480	1770480	during COVID and who ended up with that money.
1771200	1774560	I think people don't realize that there's two sides to the balance sheet, right?
1774560	1776640	If the government gives out 600 billion pounds,
1776640	1778800	then somebody gets 600 billion pounds.
1778800	1780640	600 billion pounds is a fucking lot of money, right?
1780640	1784080	That's 12,000 pounds per adult in the entire country.
1784080	1789280	So if you don't have 12,000 pounds more cash now than you had three years ago,
1789280	1791200	someone's got your 12,000 pounds.
1791200	1792080	That's a lot of fucking money.
1792080	1795840	And if you, you know, if we assume that that all went to top 10%, right,
1795840	1798800	which I think is a good sort of first order approximation,
1798800	1802800	that means every single adult in the top 10% richest people in the country
1802800	1806960	getting 120 grand cash, that fucking happened.
1807600	1809840	You know, and where did that cash go?
1810640	1812720	Well, they're going to, well, I think the thing is,
1812800	1816080	the interesting thing is you can't get rid of it once it's out there, right?
1816080	1817040	It only circulates, right?
1817040	1819360	So the first thing they do is they try and buy assets
1819360	1820400	because that's what rich people do.
1820400	1822160	So that's why we saw this massive boom in the stock market
1822160	1824160	and that's why we saw this massive boom in house prices.
1824160	1826880	But the thing about that is that doesn't get rid of the money, right?
1826880	1828720	I try and buy your house, you try and buy my house,
1828720	1830160	we're just stopping the money between us.
1830160	1831680	So the prices go up.
1831680	1835360	What you will see is some richer people buying the houses of poorer people
1835360	1837360	and that will often happen generationally.
1837360	1840240	So for example, a lot of my friends from poorer backgrounds
1840320	1843440	who've been saving up really hard 70, 80 grand deposits.
1843440	1846000	Nowadays, you can't buy a house with 70, 80 grand deposit in London.
1846640	1849760	Suddenly, they're competing with the kids of richer families.
1849760	1853760	Their parents giving them the 300 grand and then so they don't get the house.
1853760	1855920	So what you see is generationally houses
1855920	1858000	that would have been bought by kids from poorer families
1858000	1859600	are now being bought by kids from richer families.
1859600	1862320	So you do see a loss of asset ownership in the poor.
1862880	1865680	But essentially, the money doesn't disappear, it just circulates.
1865680	1868400	If the government gives money out until the government taxes it back,
1868400	1870080	people will have more money.
1870080	1872480	And the big question is, who will have more money?
1872480	1875280	And that is the question that nobody was asking during COVID.
1876000	1877840	Do you think quantitative easing was a mistake then?
1877840	1880960	Because obviously that creation of more money isn't just a response to COVID.
1880960	1883920	That's been the default alongside low interest rates since 2008.
1883920	1885120	That's a really good question.
1885120	1886560	And my answer is actually no.
1886560	1888400	And I think that might surprise some people.
1888400	1891920	When I say what I said that inflation was caused
1891920	1894240	by the government giving money out and by the low interest rates,
1894240	1896880	you might think that I'm opposed to the government giving money out and low interest rates.
1896880	1897520	I'm not.
1897520	1899040	The government had to do that.
1899120	1900560	I'm not opposed to furlough at all.
1900560	1903760	I'm not opposed to the massive deficits the government ran during COVID at all.
1903760	1904560	Those had to be done.
1904560	1906240	Otherwise, people would have literally died.
1906240	1907280	People would have not paid the rent.
1907280	1908080	People would have become homeless.
1908080	1909200	People would have not been able to eat.
1909200	1910320	Had to be done.
1910320	1913280	But at the same time, if you're giving out Â£600 billion,
1913280	1916000	you have to do an analysis of who's going to end up with this money.
1916000	1917600	And if that analysis had been done,
1917600	1921760	then we would have seen, well, we're injecting a massive amount of money to the rich here.
1921760	1922560	A massive amount.
1922560	1926080	And then we had the period of lockdown when that money wasn't damaging,
1926080	1928320	because the rich couldn't really spend it, because they're locked at home.
1928800	1931120	We could have used that one and a half years, two years, to say,
1931120	1934720	okay, we have to do this thing, which is going to make the rich fucking rich.
1934720	1939360	So we use the time we have to work out a way to tax them effectively to take that money back.
1940000	1943600	If you give Â£600 billion to the rich, and you don't want to see effects,
1943600	1945120	you have to find ways to take that money back.
1945120	1948720	And we had a year and a half where we could have had a sensible conversation about,
1948720	1951920	okay, look, COVID's shit, we had to do this thing,
1951920	1953920	and it's going to massively increase inequality.
1954480	1956880	We need to figure out how to stop that from happening.
1956880	1959520	And we didn't have that conversation, because nobody was talking about who's
1959520	1960240	going to end up with this money.
1960240	1962400	So the problem is not that the money was given out.
1962400	1963920	And the problem is not the low interest rates.
1963920	1968960	The problem is, we have an economic system here that is very happy to give tons of money to the rich,
1968960	1972480	and has no mechanism of reliably getting money from the rich.
1972480	1974160	That is fucking not sustainable.
1974160	1978560	And the thing that really worried me, now you see energy prices going up,
1978560	1983680	what's the solution, Â£150 billion direct from the government to the energy companies.
1983680	1987280	So if you believe my analysis that the government deficit
1987280	1989920	and increasing inequality caused inflation,
1989920	1993760	their solution is another massive government deficit that will increase inequality.
1993760	1995840	And I went out and I saw the fuck ton of government bonds,
1995840	1998960	because I was like, these guys are trying to fix inflation with inflation.
1998960	2004480	Listen, you need to have the systemic ability to take wealth away from rich people,
2005040	2008640	because there's a massive systemic force to give wealth to rich people.
2008640	2011760	If every time there's a crisis, you give a fuck ton to the rich,
2011760	2014240	and you have no mechanism of taking money back from the rich,
2014240	2017440	then you will impoverish and bankrupt your government and your fucking middle class.
2017440	2019440	And we're seeing it in front of our eyes.
2019440	2024160	And what frustrates me the most is just the lack of a discussion of,
2024160	2029840	listen, in Covid we gave them Â£600 billion with no mechanism of getting it back from them.
2029840	2033040	Well, in fact, we've actually just reduced their taxes.
2033040	2036320	I mean, that was one of the maddest things I've seen in my life.
2036320	2041680	And yeah, but when I saw that, I got very emotional when I saw that.
2041680	2045520	When I saw that, you know, and this is for you and for me, right?
2045520	2050320	When I saw that, I thought this is because me and people like me
2050320	2053360	have not explained clearly enough to the people of this country
2053360	2059120	that if the government gives you Â£10 and the rich Â£1,000, you are getting poorer.
2059120	2062480	Because in Covid, the average family accumulated like one, two grand cash,
2062480	2065200	and every rich family accumulated like 300 grand cash, okay?
2066080	2069200	And that had the obvious predictable consequences, right?
2069200	2070480	Money is not real resources.
2070480	2073600	If I give you 100 quid and him 100 grand, you have gotten poorer.
2073600	2075360	So after Covid, people had more money.
2075360	2077200	Explain that because they would say, no, we've both got richer,
2077200	2079280	but they've just got much richer than I have.
2079280	2080640	Let's break this down.
2080640	2082560	Money is not food.
2082560	2083920	Money is not energy.
2083920	2085440	Money is not housing.
2085440	2087120	Money is not healthcare, okay?
2087120	2091040	If we give everybody money, we have not increased the amount of actual resources
2091040	2092960	and assets we have in our society, okay?
2092960	2095760	So you don't make society richer by giving people money.
2095760	2099680	You make society richer by creating and having more resources and assets.
2099680	2102640	So if I give everybody more money, all that happens is the prices go up.
2102640	2105520	But if I give you a bit of money and him a lot of money,
2105520	2108080	then he gets richer and you get poorer because you have a bit more money,
2108080	2111920	but the prices have gone up relative to both of your increases in money.
2111920	2113280	So I think this is the thing I want to...
2113280	2116320	And the reason I'm hammering this down is because they did that in Covid
2116320	2117440	and they got away with it.
2117440	2122960	And to be honest, the conservative government lucked out with the Ukraine war
2122960	2124960	because that took the entire blame for the inflation,
2124960	2128000	which in my opinion was caused by their massive increase in inequality.
2128000	2131120	And because they got away with it, I'm not surprised to see them do it again
2131120	2133680	because what they did in the tax cuts was quite interesting, right?
2133680	2137120	They cut the taxes on ordinary people by a little bit, like 50 quid a month.
2138320	2141120	Let's just... for our audience, we've got a bunch of tax cuts here,
2141120	2142400	so corporation tax didn't go up.
2142400	2143680	We'll park that for a moment.
2143680	2147520	The basic rate, which we all pay, cut by 1%,
2147520	2150000	but that benefits wealthier people far more than ordinary people.
2150000	2152080	Well, yeah, they cut the basic rate by 1%.
2152080	2153360	It doesn't really give you that much more money.
2153360	2154560	It's like 50 quid a month, you know?
2154560	2157200	And only if you're like a higher middle learner,
2157200	2159040	if you're a lower middle learner, it doesn't benefit you at all, right?
2159040	2160960	But they cut your taxes a tiny bit
2160960	2163440	and then they cut the taxes of millionaires by like 50 grand.
2164320	2167040	And then my mate called me up, he's from an ordinary background,
2167040	2168480	and I was explaining that to him and he was like,
2168480	2171440	you know, I think my mates might be happy because they got this 50 quid tax cut, right?
2171440	2174080	And people need to understand if the government gives you 50 quid
2174080	2176400	and the rich 50 grand, you will have more money
2176400	2180080	and you will get less food, less energy, less housing, less health care,
2180080	2185440	because money is the asset that we use to determine the distribution of real assets.
2186080	2187360	Money does not make people rich.
2187360	2189200	Money is how we determine distribution.
2190240	2192080	Yeah, you can have as much money as you want, right?
2192080	2194160	If it doesn't buy you housing, if it doesn't buy you food,
2194160	2195760	it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, does it?
2195760	2197920	So people need to understand that because the government
2198960	2202880	has struck on this idea here where we give every poor person a bit of cash,
2202880	2205040	and we give every rich person a ton of cash.
2205040	2209520	And then the end result is prices go up a ton and ordinary people,
2209520	2211200	they don't understand why they're getting poorer.
2211200	2213040	Why? Because I've got more money, why is it happening?
2213040	2214720	And it's not just the inflation, obviously, like you said.
2215680	2217360	Wealthy people, they don't need to spend money,
2217360	2219760	they've already got loads of money, so they pump that into assets.
2219760	2221600	And then, of course, the assets are generally
2222640	2226480	ways for them to make more money because they're living off the revenues from those assets.
2226480	2230320	And of course, that's the rentierism that poor people find themselves subject to.
2230320	2232320	I always say, yeah, I always say this, you know,
2232320	2234240	we talk about shook with economics, if you give them money,
2234240	2236960	that the wealth create is like they're fucking Gandalf or something, right?
2236960	2238320	If you give them money, they'll boost the economy.
2238800	2242320	If you give these guys money, they're going to fucking buy your mum's house.
2242320	2243520	That is what they're going to do.
2243520	2246480	Listen, my friends' mums had houses, and my friends will never have houses.
2247040	2248720	Those houses are not fucking disappearing.
2249360	2251760	Those houses are owned by rich people's kids now.
2252320	2253920	That is what this means.
2253920	2257360	This is ordinary families losing their fucking homes,
2257360	2259520	and they will never have houses again.
2259520	2261360	Their kids won't have houses, their grandkids,
2261360	2263200	this is serious.
2263200	2267200	You cannot give all of your assets away and expect not to be poor.
2267200	2270480	Not only that, but we're giving the assets away to this group of rich people
2270480	2273040	who are internationally mobile and don't pay any fucking taxes.
2273680	2278320	I think it's, you know, I was not born and raised political.
2278320	2281600	I do this because it was my job to look into the future
2281600	2283680	and tell you what is going to happen to the economy.
2283680	2287680	If we do not find a way to tax rich people seriously,
2287680	2290560	the future of this economy is going to be a disaster.
2290560	2293840	It's going to be a disaster because the government's going further into debt.
2293840	2295600	Ordinary families are losing their homes.
2295600	2297280	Ordinary families are going further into debt,
2297280	2300000	and the homes are going to the rich and the debt is to the rich.
2300000	2303360	And it's, as you say, what that means then is you pay more rent to the rich.
2303360	2304960	You pay higher mortgages to the rich.
2304960	2306960	So as inequality gets bigger,
2306960	2310320	the cash flows from ordinary families to the rich get bigger,
2310320	2311920	which means inequality will get bigger still.
2311920	2313440	So it creates this really negative spiral.
2313440	2316160	You know, this is all, it's not an optimistic outlook,
2316160	2317200	but that is why I do what I do.
2317200	2319360	And but the thing that is most maddening is,
2319360	2322320	and also the thing which can give us a bit of hope is it's fixable
2322320	2324000	because those assets have not disappeared.
2324000	2325200	They are owned by the rich.
2325200	2326960	And if we fix our tax system,
2326960	2330400	we can, we can, we can get them given back to ordinary families.
2331200	2334240	You've got a quote here, which I'm going to refer to.
2334240	2335280	You've been a successful trader.
2335280	2336080	We've talked about that.
2336080	2337360	You're academically credentialed.
2337360	2338160	We talked about that.
2338160	2340000	I mean, it helps to be good in both fields
2340000	2341600	because then people can't try and discredit you.
2342240	2345680	You did maths and economics at the LSE and feel like you said Oxford.
2346240	2349920	But you've said, quote, throw your textbooks in the bin
2349920	2352800	if you want to really learn about economics.
2352800	2354240	So you've already talked about that one academic
2354320	2356080	who thought he wasn't a serious guy.
2356720	2357760	You're basically saying, look,
2357760	2359120	if you want to know what the story is,
2359680	2362160	don't bother with the sort of fusty dons
2362160	2364000	at these allegedly top universities.
2364000	2364240	Yeah.
2364240	2366800	That is a line from this Scous Trader who I used to work with.
2366800	2368080	He was the only trader I worked with.
2368080	2368960	He didn't go to university.
2368960	2370160	He's from Liverpool and he worked,
2370160	2372160	he worked on the cash desk when he was 18
2372160	2374400	and he worked as we're up to being like the top trader of Citibank.
2374400	2376480	And I was a Citibank's top trader in 2011
2376480	2380400	and he was Citibank's top trader in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013.
2380400	2381440	This guy was a fucking genius.
2381440	2382880	And when I got smashed that,
2382880	2384480	when I lost that $8 million that one week,
2384480	2387920	I brought up my instinct as a good economic student
2387920	2389760	was to go and bring my textbooks in
2389760	2391600	and start reading it and being like, what's happening?
2391600	2392960	And he came up to me and just fucking grabbed him
2392960	2394000	and he threw him in the bin.
2394000	2395760	And he was like, listen, how fucking old are you?
2395760	2397440	And I was like, I don't know, 23, 24, whatever.
2399360	2401600	You are not going to learn about it from those fucking books.
2401600	2402720	You want to learn about the economy?
2402720	2405040	Go out onto the street, walk down the high street,
2405040	2406400	see what shops are closing down.
2406400	2408000	Look at what the adverts are on the tube.
2408000	2408880	You know what I mean?
2408880	2410640	Is there more homeless people that you're seeing?
2410640	2412720	Ask your mum about her financial situation.
2412960	2414800	Ask your friends and your friends' mums
2414800	2416080	about their financial situation.
2416080	2417600	That is the fucking economy.
2417600	2420400	And look, I'm not saying nobody should study economics, all right?
2420400	2425680	But you should be using your study of economics
2425680	2427040	to get you into a situation
2427040	2428960	where you can analyze the real world.
2428960	2430640	And I'm going to use an example
2430640	2432960	to illustrate the problem that we have here, okay?
2433760	2437200	So this professor, the snakeskin belt professor, he...
2438400	2438880	What was the belt?
2438880	2440880	Did you know the belt make was Gucci or something like this?
2440880	2441440	I didn't ask him.
2441440	2442160	I don't think he'd tell me.
2442160	2443040	He's not my big fan.
2445040	2449440	He wrote a paper where he said that if the European Central
2449440	2453040	Mac didn't do QE, European GDP would be like 4.7% lower,
2453040	2453920	something like that.
2453920	2456240	And I was quite pleased to see him make a firm prediction
2456240	2457520	for once because these guys very rarely make
2457520	2458000	firm predictions.
2458000	2459200	And I put my hand up and I said to him,
2459760	2460480	do you think that's right?
2461120	2463040	And he was like, what do you mean?
2464080	2465440	And I was like, do you think he's right?
2465440	2467200	He's like, I don't understand the question.
2467200	2469120	I was like, do you think if that hadn't have happened,
2469120	2470560	GDP would be 4.7% lower?
2470560	2471840	He was like, I don't know what you mean.
2472160	2474800	And this guy, he is not analyzing the economy.
2474800	2475840	He's writing fucking papers.
2476560	2477520	He doesn't care if it's right.
2477520	2479360	He doesn't even think about whether it's right.
2479360	2483360	I asked him once, why do you think people have not
2483360	2484960	been spending money since 2008?
2484960	2488720	And he said, I'm not really sure,
2488720	2490560	but I think it's because of an exogenous shock
2490560	2492080	to consumption savings preferences.
2493040	2494160	And yeah, I've asked a lot of people,
2494160	2495760	nobody ever told me that was fucking why.
2495760	2496400	You know what I mean?
2496960	2497520	And I think-
2497520	2498880	But maybe they said it in other words,
2498880	2500880	which is there was this global financial crisis,
2500880	2502720	which then changed people's consumption habits.
2502720	2503920	The more you understand what that means,
2503920	2505840	the madder it is, because an exogenous shock
2505840	2508240	is a technical term referring to economic modeling.
2508240	2510320	It means something happened outside of our model.
2510320	2510880	All right?
2510880	2512960	And I've asked him something about the real world,
2512960	2515840	and his answer is something changed outside the model.
2515840	2516960	That is fucking insane.
2516960	2518560	That is an insane thing to say.
2518560	2522560	And a professor should be ashamed to say something like that.
2522560	2524000	So he's saying the global financial crisis
2524000	2525040	was an exogenous shock.
2525040	2525440	Exactly.
2525440	2527520	So you cannot describe things in the real world
2527520	2528560	as exogenous shocks.
2528560	2530640	That means something outside the model changed.
2530640	2534320	Well, no, for instance, you could say in the early 1970s,
2534320	2535680	you have a massive rise in inflation
2535680	2537040	because there is an exogenous shock,
2537040	2538960	which is the global oil crisis.
2538960	2539200	Yeah.
2539200	2540400	But you say what the shock is.
2540400	2540560	Yeah.
2540560	2542480	You know, it happened because of the oil crisis.
2542480	2544160	Okay, something over there changed.
2544160	2544240	Yeah.
2544240	2546160	But you can't just describe a real world change
2546160	2547440	as an exogenous shock in general.
2547440	2549760	What if something changed on fucking Jupiter or Mars?
2549760	2550720	So you're just saying long words
2550720	2551760	because he didn't really have a proper explanation.
2551760	2552240	And this is-
2552240	2553360	And the problem is he-
2553360	2556320	But the first is obfuscating his own lack of knowledge.
2556320	2558720	But the biggest problem is he thinks that's a legit answer.
2558720	2560320	And that is the problem when you have people
2560880	2562640	these guys live so much in the models
2563760	2565760	and care so little about the real world
2566320	2568880	that they don't even realize
2568880	2570560	that they're talking about models anymore.
2570560	2573840	You need to be coming to grips with the real world
2573840	2575040	and what is happening in the real world.
2575040	2577280	And this is why I get frustrated
2577280	2579680	about the lack of sort of class representation in economics
2579680	2581840	because they can get away with that
2581840	2583920	because they're fucking rich and they don't get hurt.
2583920	2586160	You know, whereas it's my mates who fucking lose
2586160	2586880	their fucking homes.
2587520	2588080	It's interesting.
2588160	2590000	I remember having a sort of interaction
2590000	2591600	with an economist recently.
2591600	2593600	Actually, I think he was formerly at the Bank of England.
2593600	2594240	I can't remember what it was.
2594240	2596080	He was on some subcommittee.
2596080	2597840	He wasn't like a big cheese
2597840	2600560	but he's a relatively sort of esteemed economist.
2600560	2602800	And I think I said some throwaway remark like
2602800	2603840	somebody says something about growth
2603840	2605040	and I said, mate, it's a little crap.
2605040	2605920	Go down a high street.
2605920	2607520	You know, I live in Portsmouth.
2607520	2610720	Like I go down the town center, city center,
2610720	2612160	I can tell you all born with where I'm from.
2613200	2615280	We ain't growing and we're not going to see
2615280	2617680	real meaningful economic growth for a long time.
2617680	2620160	And he said, well, that's literally why we have economics.
2620160	2621600	So we don't have to like go down the street
2621600	2622640	and see what's going on.
2622640	2623120	Oh my God.
2623120	2625280	But what's crazy is the Bank of England
2625280	2628240	even has methodologies which include survey data
2628240	2630720	going to talk to people and saying, how do you feel?
2630720	2633920	We have, you know, survey data about consumer confidence,
2633920	2635680	business investment confidence.
2635680	2637680	But like you say, like they just think it's the models
2637680	2638880	and like this is reality.
2639440	2641200	And the actual living organism out there
2641200	2643040	where we do these transactions in real life,
2643040	2644640	that's just, I'll forget about it.
2644640	2645280	That doesn't matter.
2645280	2646880	Yeah, but what's the point?
2647200	2649120	You know, I always remember when Russell Brand was
2649120	2649760	getting involved in the pot.
2649760	2651440	And a lot of my mates from back home like Russell Brand.
2651440	2652880	He's from not far where I'm from, right?
2652880	2655440	When he was, and he went on Newsnight.
2656000	2658080	And at that time it was E15 Mums.
2658080	2659040	You remember E15 Mums?
2659040	2661120	A bunch of Mums in Stratford too were losing their homes
2661120	2662960	and were getting kicked out of the area where they lived.
2662960	2664640	And he'd spoken to them and he went on
2664640	2667760	and he spoke to, it was Evan Davis at BBC.
2667760	2670960	And I thought he gave quite like a emotional like,
2670960	2672720	you know, a genuine like belief,
2672720	2673920	like the plight of these people,
2673920	2675280	look what's happened to these people.
2675360	2679040	And Evan Davis turned around and showed him a 150-year graph
2679920	2681680	of per capita wage growth.
2681680	2683440	150-year graph, right?
2683440	2684720	Which is, and it's an average, right?
2684720	2685440	It's an average, right?
2685440	2687600	So that could be dragged up by the super rich, right?
2687600	2688960	And he showed him this graph and he said,
2688960	2690640	well, you know, I can see what you're saying,
2690640	2691680	but look, you're wrong.
2691680	2693680	I've shown you this 150-year graph and it's,
2695200	2697040	this, that is sickening to me.
2697040	2698240	That is sickening to me.
2698240	2699520	Because here's a guy who's telling you,
2699520	2703360	look, people from where I'm from are losing their homes.
2703360	2704320	And the guys turn around and say,
2704400	2706640	well, actually I've done the fucking numbers
2706640	2707920	and it's, everything's fine.
2707920	2711440	And you know, Evan Davis can say that to me
2711440	2713120	because I've got fucking two economics degrees
2713120	2714320	and I can turn around to him and say,
2714320	2715280	well, that's a fucking average.
2715280	2717440	Who fucking cares if it's just a bunch of fucking millionaires
2717440	2718160	dragging it up?
2718160	2719120	Doesn't help my mates.
2719120	2720400	Doesn't help the E15 mums.
2720960	2721440	What was that?
2721440	2722480	That's a fucking comedian.
2722480	2724000	You can't show him 150-year graph.
2724000	2724320	It's fucking-
2724320	2725520	Was that, what was it, GDP?
2725520	2726080	What was it?
2726080	2727840	It was what per capita wage growth, I think.
2727840	2729600	And you can find, you can go over and look at it on YouTube.
2729600	2731040	But I mean-
2731040	2731680	But that's the force.
2731680	2732720	So it's like, look,
2732720	2733840	after you get the Industrial Revolution
2733840	2735040	for the first 40, 50 years,
2735040	2737120	there isn't actual meaningful improvements
2737120	2738000	and living standards.
2738000	2740320	That only happens when you get industrial actions,
2740320	2741920	strikes, revolutions, riots,
2741920	2743680	because they're all in class, realize,
2743680	2745200	okay, well, we can't do this forever.
2746240	2748000	And the thing is, Evan Davis will know something like that.
2748000	2749200	It's called, you know, it's called the Engels Paws.
2749200	2750480	It's named after Frederick Engels.
2751200	2752640	Interestingly enough, we're going to the next question.
2752640	2755200	Evan Davis was one of the people who pioneered
2755200	2756080	the poll tax policy.
2756080	2756880	And if you know that-
2756880	2757600	I didn't know that.
2757600	2758400	Yeah, he did.
2758400	2760080	Just raising him my estimation even more.
2760080	2760800	Yeah, he worked.
2760800	2762640	He worked in a think tank in the late 80s.
2762640	2763840	I can't remember which one it was.
2763840	2764720	So I won't say,
2764720	2767120	but it's one of these sort of pro-Proththrite think tanks.
2767120	2771120	And he was one of the minds behind the poll tax policy,
2771120	2773920	which is one of the most unpopular economic policies
2773920	2775200	in the history of this country.
2775200	2777360	And now he's just viewed as sort of some centrist,
2778000	2781920	you know, clever BBC political economics finance voice.
2782560	2785680	I mean, it shows you how extreme those voices really are.
2786240	2788000	Let's talk about the Tori Minay budget.
2788000	2789040	Yeah.
2789040	2790480	Which became this massive news story.
2791600	2794560	People who are watching this probably heard,
2794560	2795760	I know what guilt are,
2795760	2796960	but I don't talk about them very often.
2796960	2797360	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2798160	2800480	They heard lots of words like guilt for the first time.
2801200	2803840	Just kind of briefly explain what actually happened.
2804960	2806800	Okay, so let's break it down from basics.
2806800	2808240	So the very first thing is they announced
2810480	2812400	a big package of spending and also tax cuts.
2814480	2815840	The big thing which wasn't expected was
2815840	2817760	they had this cut of the 45p rate,
2817760	2819200	which the first thing to say is
2820000	2821760	that rate kicks in at 150 grand.
2821760	2823600	It doesn't affect you through an 150 grand
2823600	2825440	because it's only above 150 grand.
2825440	2828320	So really, you're only significantly cutting tax
2828320	2831040	on people who earn like 200, 300, 400 at grand
2831040	2831920	or a million pound a year.
2831920	2834720	So it's a big tax cut specifically for very high earners.
2835440	2836560	Markets weren't expecting that.
2836560	2842560	And traders looked at that and the next thing to say is,
2842560	2845040	you know, these were unfunded tax cuts.
2845040	2847600	So what that means is the government is planning
2847600	2848640	to borrow that money.
2848640	2850960	So, you know, it means we're getting less money in.
2850960	2852880	We're having to spend more money on things like energy.
2852880	2853920	We're going to borrow the difference.
2855120	2856080	And when you borrow money,
2856080	2857360	when the government borrows money,
2857360	2858400	it doesn't just come out of thin air.
2858400	2861200	They borrow it from people, essentially from rich people
2861200	2863040	and those decisions of whether to lend it or not
2863040	2863920	are made by traders.
2864640	2866480	And the traders look at the government and they think, well,
2867120	2868560	you know, COVID's finished now
2868560	2870960	and we're in more ordinary economic times
2870960	2873360	and you're planning to run a massive deficit
2873360	2877200	just to stuff rich people's pockets with cash, right?
2877200	2880480	And, you know, if you're going to run massive deficits
2880480	2882080	in normal times, you know, you don't have to be a genius
2882080	2883680	to be like, well, how are you going to pay that?
2883680	2884640	Back then, basically.
2884640	2887200	And traders basically thought, okay, well,
2887840	2890720	this is not a coherent plan.
2890720	2893520	So probably one of two things will happen.
2893520	2894480	You're a student of history.
2894480	2896000	You'll know that historically,
2896000	2898240	when governments have borrowed massive amounts of money,
2898880	2901120	the way they've paid it back normally is through inflation.
2901120	2902800	So if you have very high inflation,
2902800	2905440	prices go up, price go up, wages also go up
2905440	2907440	and your tax take rises significantly.
2907440	2908960	The debt stays the same size
2908960	2910640	because it's fixed in nominal terms.
2911200	2912320	And then it's easy to pay back.
2912320	2913760	That's how the Second World War debt was paid back.
2913760	2915600	So traders are looking at this thinking, well,
2915600	2916720	they're not serious about paying it back.
2916720	2918400	So maybe they're going to inflate it away.
2919360	2922000	Not only that, but they're given a crap ton of money out.
2922000	2923200	So that's going to cause inflation.
2923920	2925200	So they start selling the pound
2925200	2926080	because you don't want pounds.
2926080	2927520	It's going to be inflation, right?
2927520	2929440	You know, it basically means the pound is worthless.
2929440	2930640	You can't get as much for it.
2930640	2931840	They start selling the pound.
2931840	2932720	The pound starts falling.
2933440	2936080	The Bank of England, whose job is to keep inflation at 3%,
2936960	2938560	look at that and they say, okay, number one,
2938560	2940000	government's giving a crap ton of money out.
2940960	2942880	Number two, pounds falling,
2942880	2945120	which means our import's going to cost them all.
2945120	2946960	The inflation situation is looking even worse.
2947680	2949520	So people are looking at the Bank of England and thinking,
2949520	2952560	okay, they're going to raise rates massively.
2952560	2954000	And this is in the context of already,
2954000	2954880	even before the budget,
2954880	2957600	we're talking about rates going up to five, five and a half percent.
2957600	2958880	So suddenly they're thinking, okay,
2958880	2961680	maybe it's going to go up to six and a half, seven percent.
2963040	2966080	And if you know the Bank of England's going to raise rates,
2966080	2967760	then you're not going to lend to the government
2967760	2969200	unless you can get a similar rate, right?
2969200	2971600	You know, I'm not going to lend to the government for zero
2971600	2974080	if I can get four or five percent from the Bank of England.
2974080	2975440	So suddenly the Bank of England,
2975440	2977280	the government bonds all go up to four and a half percent.
2978160	2980960	And this creates a panic, basically,
2980960	2983120	because everybody starts selling the government bonds.
2984080	2985600	Pension funds, a lot of people's pensions
2985600	2986480	are invested in government bonds.
2986480	2987360	They start collapsing.
2988000	2989920	And it basically just creates a broad market panic
2989920	2991600	because traders are looking at the government
2991680	2994480	and thinking they don't have a plan.
2994480	2995680	They don't have a plan.
2995680	2996720	They're not going to pay the debt back.
2996720	2998240	Oh, they're going to inflate it away.
2998240	3000000	The central bank's going to raise rates.
3000000	3000640	People start thinking,
3000640	3002240	well, if rates got to five, six, seven percent,
3002240	3003680	what does that mean for mortgages?
3003680	3005520	You know, I think this is the big question, right?
3005520	3007280	You know, if the Bank of England rate goes up,
3007280	3008640	your mortgage will go up.
3008640	3010720	And you know, we all know how big mortgages are,
3010720	3011520	especially in London,
3011520	3012800	but also in the rest of the country.
3013440	3015520	And if you can fund that two percent, fine,
3015520	3016800	but can you fund it at 10 percent?
3017360	3018400	Can you fund it at 8 percent?
3018400	3019760	Well, there's this amazing data, isn't there,
3019840	3022640	which says basically, obviously,
3022640	3026320	people love to talk about 1990, 15 percent interest rates,
3026320	3028720	but because obviously house prices are so much higher now,
3028720	3030320	people have got much larger mortgages,
3031040	3033200	actually interest rates at five, six percent now
3033200	3035360	would feel like 15 percent in 1990.
3035360	3035680	Yeah.
3035680	3038160	And this seems kind of lost on a lot of analysis.
3038160	3039280	Yeah, people need to, yeah, exactly.
3039280	3040880	You know, house prices are a lot,
3040880	3042400	a lot higher now than they were in the 80s.
3042400	3045360	And you know, the reality of the situation
3045360	3046720	is a lot of people,
3046720	3048160	even people who are not that poor,
3048160	3049440	are going to be brought into situations
3049440	3050640	where they can't pay the mortgage.
3050640	3053680	You know, a lot millions of people, you know, that's,
3053680	3055280	and then you start questioning, you know,
3055840	3057360	the economy of the whole country.
3057360	3060800	You know, it's these guys and the maddest thing of it all
3060800	3064080	is this situation was created simply to the government
3064080	3065920	to give a tax cut to millionaires.
3065920	3068560	And it's one of the maddest things I've ever seen.
3069760	3072080	And it created this carnage.
3072080	3073760	Eventually the Bank of England was forced to come in
3073760	3076640	and agreed to start lending money to the government again.
3076640	3078720	You know, there's talk about is this QE, is this not QE,
3078720	3080880	but the Bank of England eventually came in
3080880	3082800	and backstopped the bonds, the government bonds,
3082800	3084320	start lending money to the government.
3086080	3090000	And you know, I talked to traders and they're looking
3090000	3091440	at the government and they're just thinking,
3091440	3093040	what are these guys playing?
3093600	3095200	It's such a fuck up.
3095200	3096960	You know, I think a lot of people think,
3096960	3097680	oh, this was the plan.
3097680	3098480	This was not the plan.
3099040	3099760	This was not the plan.
3099760	3101680	I think they thought they'd get away with it.
3101680	3104720	And yeah, they couldn't.
3104720	3108000	But you know, even now they've basically backed away,
3108000	3109040	you know, the U-turned on it.
3109040	3110320	And I predicted they would U-turn.
3110320	3111440	I put a video on Sunday.
3111440	3113280	The reason I predicted that U-turn, by the way,
3113280	3114000	is because I started-
3114000	3115360	It's on the 45P top rate.
3115360	3116880	On the 45P top rate.
3116880	3118560	It's because I started getting texts from people.
3118560	3120480	I don't get texts from, you know, like,
3120480	3123280	I live in these worlds now, you know, I'm writing a book
3123280	3124640	and I'm in this sort of publishing world,
3124640	3126320	you know, I'm in the media world now.
3126320	3128400	I'm getting texts from people who are not poor,
3128400	3130000	saying this policy's fucked.
3130000	3131440	And it's because they've got mortgages, right?
3131440	3132640	You know, they've got massive mortgages.
3132640	3134560	A lot of people who are not poor have got big mortgages.
3134560	3135920	It's not the poorest people who have the mortgages,
3135920	3137040	because they can't get mortgages, right?
3137040	3137760	Yeah.
3137760	3139600	And you know, these guys work in the media.
3139600	3141520	They were, and you know, even these guys, some of them,
3141520	3144480	you know, I guarantee you, those Tory-backed benches,
3144480	3146240	they or their kids have got mortgages.
3146240	3148960	You know, so what the Conservative government did here,
3148960	3150960	you know, you know, I don't need to tell you,
3150960	3153360	these guys have been hurting the poor for a long time.
3153360	3156160	But suddenly they took this big step to hurt homeowners.
3156800	3159600	And you know, a lot of people in the media are homeowners,
3159600	3162160	and I just thought the media is not going to accept this.
3162160	3163600	And if the media doesn't, you know,
3163600	3166320	they need the media to go with it for it to happen.
3166320	3167120	The media wouldn't accept it.
3167120	3168480	They're going to have to back down it.
3168480	3169200	Eventually they did.
3169200	3170960	Well, that's the big difference to austerity, isn't it?
3170960	3173040	And that's kind of what frustrates me the most with this stuff,
3173040	3175760	is that after 2010 to 2015,
3176800	3179840	the bottom 25% of this country were destroyed.
3179840	3180960	They were crushed.
3181920	3185920	And the middle class, the upper middle class,
3185920	3188480	like you say, if your height, you can be even ultra-rich.
3188480	3191600	If you're highly leveraged on loans for property,
3191600	3193120	you might be a buy-to-let landlord or whatever,
3193440	3194880	you're terrified by all of this, right?
3196080	3197360	And they got a glimpse of that.
3197360	3199600	And within a week, it was just amazing to see
3199600	3200800	how radicalized they became.
3200800	3204160	And it's like, welcome to reality for the rest of the country, right?
3204160	3204640	Yeah.
3204640	3205920	But I think this is kind of,
3207600	3210560	you know, the rich have got unbelievably richer in the last 15 years.
3212160	3218960	And personally, I think that the conservative party is basically behind this.
3218960	3220720	But there comes to a point where you've cut everything,
3220720	3222880	you know, the welfare state is cut to a bare minimum.
3222880	3224960	If they cut that back further, it's going to be,
3224960	3225920	and it looks like they might,
3225920	3229120	you're going to see real, it's going to be bad, right?
3229120	3230800	And it's difficult to cut stuff there.
3230800	3233600	But then how do you make the rich richer?
3233600	3234960	How do you keep making the rich richer?
3234960	3236320	And, you know, the only assets left
3236320	3238960	are the houses of the middle class now, you know?
3238960	3242960	So it comes to a point where, you know,
3242960	3244240	you need to hit those people
3244240	3245920	if you want to make the rich richer anymore, you know?
3245920	3247520	Because the economy is not growing.
3247520	3250320	So the only way the rich get richer is taking assets from the rest of us.
3250320	3251520	And you know, we've cut their taxes,
3251520	3253280	we've cut, you know, government services.
3254880	3256720	And now I think the conservatives are in this bind
3256720	3259760	where it's like, how do you keep that machine going
3259760	3263200	without hitting your core voter base, which is homeowners, you know?
3263200	3266560	And I think they're, I think they're really stuck here because,
3267440	3271440	you know, they, the only thing you can do here
3271440	3273280	to prevent an economic collapse is tax the rich.
3273280	3277040	And it's like their reason to be that they can't do that.
3277040	3280400	So I think that they tried this thing,
3280400	3283520	which is, well, why don't we, if you look at it,
3283520	3285120	in a sense, it's a clever strategy, right?
3285120	3286480	Because it worked in COVID.
3286480	3288400	Give ordinary families a bit and the rich a lot.
3290560	3292800	But the problem is, and I think this is like a great irony
3292800	3294320	and something, you know, people who are on the left,
3294320	3296320	such as yourself or myself should ask ourselves,
3296320	3298960	the people who stopped that, it wasn't us, it was financial markets.
3299920	3303040	And we need to be sending that message.
3303040	3305120	Look, they are taking your assets
3305120	3307040	and giving it to the rich and they're making you poorer.
3307040	3309920	And you know, I think this is an opportunity
3310880	3312800	because the conservatives need that wedge to be
3312800	3314240	between the middle and the poor.
3314240	3314720	Yeah.
3314720	3316160	They need that wedge to be there.
3316160	3318400	But at the same time, there's nothing left to take from the poor.
3319200	3321600	So, you know, we need to convince the middle,
3321600	3323760	look, these guys are not going to help you in the long run.
3323760	3325120	You know, where your kid's going to live?
3325120	3326400	How's your kid going to afford a house?
3326400	3327520	Where your grandkids going to live?
3327520	3328000	Yeah.
3328000	3330800	You know, we, and we need to make the explanation,
3330800	3333200	look, I know they're giving you money,
3333200	3335280	but they're giving the rich a ton of more money
3335280	3335920	than they're giving you.
3335920	3337120	And that will make you poorer.
3337200	3341360	We need to build that understanding.
3341360	3343120	What I think is ironic is sort of,
3343120	3345680	the riot has sort of built itself on economic credibility
3345680	3348560	and like the empowerment of individual.
3348560	3351200	And yet they are destroying the financial lives
3351200	3352160	of ordinary families.
3352720	3355040	And I think it's a great failing of us
3355040	3357200	that we haven't managed to explain to ordinary families
3357200	3359920	how bleak their future is on this path.
3359920	3362080	And that's, you know, that's what I try to do on my YouTube.
3362080	3364160	That's like my sort of mission to explain, look.
3364160	3368480	And then, so I think it's, where we are now is bad,
3369360	3371440	but that creates this opportunity to build
3371440	3374400	this broader coalition that unites the middle
3374400	3376720	and poorer people and says, look,
3376720	3377680	this doesn't work for any of us.
3378320	3379760	One of the most frustrating things for me, though,
3379760	3382720	is people are saying, this is the Tories.
3382720	3384400	And then when Labour come back in, you know,
3384400	3385520	things will be fantastic.
3386240	3388160	Some things will be obviously be significantly better.
3388160	3390160	But like you say, our economic model
3390160	3392880	is about generating revenues for a certain group of people.
3392880	3394720	They're looking around for sources of wealth.
3394720	3396720	What are they, NHS?
3396720	3398320	And like you say, the housing assets
3398320	3399680	of the middle class in this country,
3399680	3402160	and they will gobble them up because that's how it works.
3402160	3403760	Whoever the government is,
3403760	3405280	that's where the pressure will come from.
3405920	3409520	Housing, 2023, since we're talking about it.
3409520	3410800	What's going to happen to the housing market?
3410800	3412240	You said that you were right when
3412240	3414800	Larry Elliott was wrong about house prices during COVID.
3414800	3415680	What happens next year?
3415680	3417600	So I'm actually quite confident,
3417600	3419120	and most people won't agree with me on this,
3419120	3421760	that in the medium to long term, house prices will go up.
3421760	3423680	And the reason for that is because
3423680	3425600	the government's giving a ton of money out,
3425600	3427360	and that money's ending up with the rich,
3427360	3429440	and that will, you know, rich will buy assets
3429440	3430960	and that will push broadly assets up.
3431600	3433600	Obviously in the short term, we've got massive headwinds,
3433600	3435200	which is this massive increase in interest rates.
3435200	3437040	So I think in the short term, anything could happen.
3438240	3441120	I actually think, so I was of the opinion
3442000	3444000	that interest rates would come back down
3444000	3447200	because ordinary families, you know,
3447200	3449520	the bottom 70, 80% are being so squeezed
3449520	3451440	by what's happening that they will not be able to spend,
3451440	3453520	and that means inflation will be quite short lived,
3453520	3455120	and that means the rates will come back down.
3455120	3457200	But then what I saw was that the government
3457200	3460240	is planning to fix that by running another massive deficit.
3460240	3463520	And you know, I know you know your history.
3464480	3466000	This has happened before, right?
3466000	3467760	If the government gives out a ton of money,
3467760	3469440	that creates inflation, and they try to deal with it
3469440	3470880	by giving out a ton of money,
3470880	3472800	that does not bode well for long term inflation
3472800	3474240	and the long term value of the currency.
3475200	3477280	So I sort of started to think, well, actually maybe
3477280	3479360	we could enter a bit of a spiral here
3479360	3481680	where inflation stays high and interest rates stay high.
3482480	3484640	But then what happened is the market rejected that.
3484640	3488960	So I think it depends on what the government does.
3489760	3491760	And unfortunately, both outcomes are bad, right?
3491760	3494480	If the government decides to just churn money out,
3494480	3496480	which ends up going, ending up with the rich,
3496480	3499920	then you will see a big rise in interest rates
3499920	3501200	and a big rise in inflation.
3501200	3504480	And that causes this kind of conflict, right?
3504480	3506480	Because in the long run, assets have to go up,
3506480	3508240	but people can't get mortgages.
3508240	3510320	And I think what that would lead to in the end is basically,
3510320	3511280	people who have used mortgages
3511280	3513680	will have to sell their houses to the people who have the cash.
3513680	3516320	Because I mean, you and I sit here and you think,
3516320	3519200	oh, interest rates go up, that makes it harder to buy a house.
3519200	3521440	A ton of people don't need a mortgage to buy a house nowadays,
3521440	3524080	because the really rich are stacking up so much cash.
3524080	3525920	And they are the guys who get paid
3525920	3527760	the high rates of interest on this cash.
3529520	3533040	But now it looks more likely, and this is very up in the air,
3533040	3534320	we don't know what the government's going to do,
3534320	3537680	that they're going to move towards a kind of austerity light model.
3537760	3539440	And I think that will probably take us,
3539440	3542400	if they do that to a more post-2008 situation,
3542400	3544560	where it's immiseration for ordinary people.
3545680	3546880	Inflation will eventually come down,
3546880	3549920	because the middle class has their spending power so badly hit.
3550880	3553520	And house prices end up going up,
3553520	3554880	because the rich have so much money,
3554880	3557040	and they need, they want assets,
3557040	3558800	they want to buy things with that money.
3560240	3562400	And I think that's the bigger risk,
3562400	3566080	because I think people don't realize how much it,
3566160	3568560	a lot of people in the middle of society economically,
3568560	3570880	don't realize how much it hurts their family,
3570880	3571920	especially the kids and their grandkids,
3571920	3572880	when house prices go up.
3574800	3575920	I think that is the risk,
3575920	3578160	but medium to long term,
3578160	3580160	I'm very confident that house prices will go up.
3580160	3585920	And that's a very, that's a very anti-consensus view at the moment.
3585920	3588720	But the fact is, and this is the thing people keep missing,
3588720	3590400	and have missed this at the beginning of COVID,
3590400	3593680	the rich are stacking up so much cash here,
3593680	3595040	and they're not going to sit on it.
3595040	3596000	They're going to use it to buy assets.
3596000	3598000	And I think one thing that will have to happen,
3598000	3600240	is the government will end up being forced
3600240	3603920	to relax mortgage requirements, because...
3603920	3604800	We're all doing this, right?
3604800	3606480	That's why 50 year mortgage products and whatnot.
3606480	3609520	They need to keep people being homeowners,
3609520	3611440	but they also want to make the rich richer.
3611440	3613280	Well, how do you do that, bigger mortgages?
3613280	3615200	Then you can own your home technically,
3615200	3617440	you own your 800, 900 grand home,
3617440	3619520	but you also owe 800 grand debt to the rich.
3619520	3621840	So you've got the home, but they've got the actual wealth.
3622640	3623920	So I think that will happen.
3623920	3625920	And I think the way that we fight that,
3625920	3629360	is we have to make this connection between the distribution
3629360	3631120	and the quality of life of ordinary people.
3631120	3632320	We have to make that connection,
3632320	3634560	because if we don't make that, people's lives get worse,
3634560	3635760	and they don't understand why.
3635760	3636720	They're like, well, I've got more money,
3636720	3638320	my house price is going up, I should be richer.
3638960	3641200	But if you are getting relatively poor art,
3641200	3642640	then you will get less stuff.
3642640	3644400	We've had in the last three years,
3644400	3646080	the biggest and fastest ever increase
3646080	3647600	in inequality in the country.
3647600	3649280	And the biggest and fastest decrease
3649280	3651280	in living standards in peacetime,
3651280	3652640	and no one's connecting the two.
3652640	3655120	And I think it's such an opportunity that we're missing.
3655120	3656880	We need to say, look, you are getting poorer
3656880	3658320	because of that increase in inequalities.
3659120	3660800	It's not a complicated connection.
3660800	3662960	You increase inequality, you improve their living standards,
3662960	3663760	you decrease yours.
3663760	3664800	I'm kind of surprised, actually,
3664800	3666640	the middle class aren't more angry about it.
3666640	3669120	Like, the people that shop at Waitrose,
3669120	3671840	very affluent, looking to retire in a couple of years,
3672960	3675280	there's many, many people like that who are very, very,
3675280	3678240	I'm not saying they all vote Labour or Tory or Lib Dem,
3678240	3680000	they do all three, or they don't vote at all.
3680560	3682160	But they know that they're really
3683520	3684880	fucking their kids and their grandkids.
3684880	3685920	They know that.
3685920	3687280	That's the connection we need to make.
3687280	3688400	But they know that.
3689520	3690880	Because there's polling out there, for instance,
3690880	3692720	about should house prices fall?
3692720	3694000	Which is really interesting.
3694000	3695520	And actually, over 50% of the public
3695520	3697440	say it would be in the public interest
3697440	3698800	for house prices to fall.
3698800	3700400	That doesn't mean they want house prices to fall
3700400	3702080	because it's not necessarily in their rational self-interest,
3702080	3703600	but they know what needs to happen.
3704560	3706960	There's a lot of guilt out there, surely, amongst those people.
3706960	3708000	You know there's this article,
3708000	3709360	which always appears in the newspapers,
3709360	3712880	which is how I bought a house by saving up
3712880	3714160	and stop buying coffees.
3714160	3716400	And famously, it always has, like, in there,
3716400	3718720	and then I got 300 grand from my mum, like, hidden in there.
3720400	3722080	Those articles, in my opinion,
3723120	3725920	are to assuage the concerns of older property owners.
3726480	3727920	Because older property owners,
3727920	3730720	which is massively the voting base of the Conservative Party,
3731920	3733760	have been to a large degree protected.
3733760	3734640	You know, so, you know,
3734640	3735680	my parents have always been poor,
3735680	3736880	but they own their own property.
3736880	3738240	And that means that, very likely,
3738240	3740320	they'll be able to live to some degree comfortably
3740320	3740960	until their retirement.
3740960	3742640	They'll probably have to dissafe that property, right,
3742640	3743600	and they'll lose the home.
3744160	3744960	But they've been protected,
3744960	3746480	even though they've been poor their whole lives, right?
3747040	3749120	But if they were to look more broadly
3749120	3750480	and to look at their kids and say,
3750480	3752640	oh, well, you know, how are my kids going to be?
3752640	3754320	They'd be like, they'd have to look realistically
3754320	3755920	and be like, fuck, that's what they earn.
3755920	3756960	That's the house prices.
3758880	3759840	What's their pension?
3759840	3760960	What's their retirement look like?
3761840	3762640	How do I have elderly care?
3762640	3763840	But people don't want to think about that.
3763840	3765840	And then if the media tells you, well, listen, don't worry.
3766800	3768000	You know what kids are like?
3768000	3768880	They're a bit silly.
3768880	3769760	They waste their money.
3770560	3771200	They'll sort out.
3771200	3772480	They'll stop buying the coffees.
3772480	3773360	They'll stop buying that stuff.
3773360	3774320	And they'll be okay.
3774960	3776960	Those articles are there to tell.
3776960	3779680	And, you know, it's easy to convince someone
3779680	3781200	something they want to believe, right?
3781200	3783440	Those guys grow out there and sell to older people
3783440	3784880	that you're protected.
3784880	3786320	And we know you might look bad for your kids,
3786320	3786960	but don't worry.
3787760	3788480	We've got that.
3788480	3789600	They don't have that.
3789600	3790880	And we need to counter that.
3790880	3793120	And it's not easy because our message is,
3793120	3794080	in some ways, unpalatable,
3794080	3795360	which is if we stay on this path,
3795920	3796800	your kids and your grandkids
3796800	3798480	will have very, very difficult economic lives.
3799520	3800880	But we need to make that case.
3800880	3803120	And, you know, those are the people,
3803120	3804240	in a sense, that we need to win.
3804240	3806400	And, you know, it's their kids and their grandkids being hurt.
3807040	3809840	And we need to find a way to communicate to them clearly
3809840	3811680	and compassionately so they don't feel attacked.
3811680	3814000	Look, we are trying to protect your kids and your grandkids.
3814000	3815280	We're not attacking you.
3815280	3816800	You know, where are your kids going to live?
3817360	3818480	What is their life going to be like?
3818480	3820400	Are your kids going to be able to afford to have kids of their own?
3820400	3823040	You know, that is the message that I think we need to be making.
3824320	3826080	If there's a young person watching this
3826080	3828240	and they're thinking, I really want to get on the housing ladder,
3829520	3832240	and then there's loads of calculations at play, right?
3832240	3833600	Do I need to maybe move?
3834560	3836800	Or should I prioritize, et cetera, et cetera?
3836800	3837840	Presumably, you would still,
3837840	3838880	it's not often on Navarro media,
3838880	3840480	we talk about financial advice.
3840480	3842320	But presumably, you would therefore say to them,
3842320	3843840	given what you said five minutes ago about,
3843840	3845920	you think house prices will continue to go up,
3845920	3847040	that they should do that.
3847040	3849600	I've been saying this, you know, consistently.
3849600	3850480	If you can buy property.
3850480	3851920	Don't wait for the market to go down.
3851920	3853280	If you can do it, get on the ladder.
3853280	3854640	If you can, if you can.
3854720	3856880	Listen, if you don't have property,
3856880	3857760	that's not a flat position,
3857760	3858800	you're short one property,
3858800	3860320	because you've got to live somewhere.
3860320	3862160	You know, the first thing you should be looking to do,
3862160	3865840	and I totally understand that in today's economy,
3865840	3868080	that means taking 300, 400,
3868080	3870640	if you're in London, 600, 700 grand of debt maybe.
3870640	3872960	And that is risky, and that is unappealing.
3872960	3875040	And I wish that we were not in that situation.
3875040	3877440	But the truth is, if you don't own a property,
3877440	3880560	you are in a very precarious financial position.
3880560	3883040	And the best way you can get yourself out of that,
3883040	3884160	is to get yourself a property.
3884160	3886720	And you know, I wish that didn't mean
3886720	3888160	taking a massive, massive mortgage.
3888160	3889920	And I can't pretend to people
3889920	3891520	that you're not taking a massive financial risk
3891520	3892080	of buying a property.
3892080	3894720	But the truth is, you are also taking a massive financial risk
3894720	3895840	of not buying a property.
3895840	3897440	Because look what's happening to rents.
3897440	3898640	Look what's happening to their house prices.
3898640	3900480	You know, there's people in London now,
3900480	3902000	they don't even know where they're going to live.
3902000	3903440	You know, and you know,
3903440	3905360	if you don't have a property, you are short one property.
3905360	3907680	You need to get that, just to make yourself secure.
3907680	3911760	And I have to say when I say that, that I know,
3911840	3913520	I know full world, that that is advice,
3913520	3914800	that is impossible for a lot of people.
3914800	3915600	And I understand that.
3915600	3915920	Of course.
3917680	3919440	But that is, you know, I have to tell people that,
3919440	3919920	and it's true.
3920560	3922480	And if you are in a situation where you can't,
3923040	3926720	then you know, support me, follow my channel,
3926720	3928560	people like you, so we can come out and explain,
3928560	3931600	look, that it could be possible if we change things.
3931600	3933520	I mean, I'll provide an example here.
3933520	3937920	So I left, I left London because I'm with my now wife,
3937920	3939040	because we wanted to have children.
3939040	3941200	And we knew that we had to own somewhere
3941280	3943360	to do that, because we, we couldn't,
3943360	3946480	we'd love to rent if you had five year, 10 years,
3946480	3948320	you didn't have a massive increase, et cetera,
3948320	3949920	and kind of sort of security around housing
3949920	3951360	that you say maybe have in Germany.
3951360	3952400	We don't have that here.
3952400	3953920	So we knew that we had to buy somewhere.
3953920	3955520	That meant we had to move out of London.
3956240	3958880	We did buy somewhere on the south coast.
3959760	3966160	And doing that, just open my eyes so much as to,
3966160	3968640	it's even worse than you think, if you're renting,
3968640	3969840	how rigged the system is.
3970400	3972640	The minute we accessed the mortgage,
3972640	3975040	we didn't pay any stamp duty, that went.
3976160	3979840	We then, that house in two years has gained more in value
3979840	3980720	than I've earned working.
3981440	3983600	We actually bought in a really good moment
3983600	3984880	right at the beginning of the COVID crisis,
3984880	3987680	where lots of, like I say, sort of student property developers
3987680	3989040	just wanted to get rid of their assets, right?
3990000	3992400	And I just feel like, and then as we're remortgaging,
3992400	3994800	fortunately we remortgaged just before all this happened,
3994800	3996320	you've got people saying, yeah, you can,
3996320	3997680	you can borrow against the increase
3997680	3998800	in the value of the house.
3998880	4001440	And you think, this is nuts.
4001440	4003520	And yet there are tens of millions of people in this country
4003520	4007840	who think it's not normal, not acceptable, they're virtuous.
4007840	4011280	And it's like, you keep on being rewarded for being lucky
4011280	4013440	and then you get rewarded again and rewarded again.
4013440	4014800	The people who actually down on their luck
4014800	4017440	because they couldn't get the initial cash capital for the deposit,
4017440	4018640	they keep on being punished.
4019280	4022480	And I just feel like, how do we get that?
4022480	4024880	I know renters know they're in a bad situation,
4024880	4027200	but it's like, it's so much worse than you even realize.
4028160	4032160	Yeah, I mean, it's, you know, my channel,
4032160	4034160	it's mainly about sort of economics and politics,
4034160	4036640	but we do do sort of, we talk about investing,
4036640	4037760	we talk about buying property.
4037760	4040560	And it's hard because I get so many messages like,
4041440	4042720	you know, what can I do to make money?
4042720	4045360	And the truth is like, you know, in the last years,
4045360	4047600	we've seen this big increase in sort of crypto
4047600	4048640	and online trading.
4048640	4052000	And it sells this dream that you can sort of invest your way to wealth.
4052560	4055520	But the truth is, you know, like, I live off of my assets,
4055520	4057440	you know, I'm a wealthy individual, I live off of my assets,
4057440	4060160	you know, if you come, if you come to me with like 500 grand,
4060720	4063760	then if you make 5% a year, you can make 25 grand,
4063760	4064800	you can live off that.
4064800	4068560	If you come to me with 10, 15 grand, you make 5% a year,
4068560	4070640	you know, you're never going to make 100 pound.
4070640	4074560	You know, so it's sort of, this is, and the thing is,
4075200	4077520	I want to tell people this, buy a property if you can,
4077520	4078640	because it's good financial advice,
4078640	4080320	but I just know it's impossible.
4080320	4082640	And then that's why I think what is really interesting,
4082640	4084880	you look at the journey that Martin Lewis has been on,
4084960	4086800	my Lewis Money-Saving Expert, I guess people know,
4087920	4090160	he's this guy that's like, protect your interests,
4090160	4092080	do what's good for you, change your mortgage provider,
4092080	4093360	change your electricity provider.
4093360	4096240	And now he's coming out with, you have to fight the government.
4097200	4098880	Because the problem is,
4102160	4104160	they, the rich have all the money and all the assets,
4104160	4105840	you are not going to beat them in that game.
4105840	4110400	The only power you have, the only power you have is that there's more of you.
4110960	4113840	And if you try and use that by trading crypto,
4113840	4114720	you don't use that power.
4114720	4116320	It's like the Kung Fu movies,
4116320	4118240	where 100 guys fight Bruce Lee one at a time.
4120000	4124240	We need to explain to people that being political
4124240	4127520	is the best way to protect your financial interest
4127520	4129600	as an individual, as a family, as a community,
4129600	4132640	because it genuinely is, I genuinely believe that.
4132640	4133920	And if you don't do that,
4133920	4136480	and you know, this thing recently where we suddenly saw,
4137200	4139440	a lot of nice, well-off people messaging me,
4139440	4140960	oh, my mortgage rate's going to go up,
4140960	4142400	and then the government backs down,
4142400	4145440	that is what happened when you act politically as a community.
4145440	4146960	You force government to change.
4147600	4152720	And I also understand that a lot of people are struggling financially,
4152720	4155360	and they struggle to have the energy to act politically.
4156000	4157920	And you know, if you don't have anything to give,
4157920	4158720	don't give anything.
4158720	4162160	But if you have a little bit of space, a little bit of energy,
4162160	4163600	you need to engage with this,
4163600	4165200	because you are under attack,
4165200	4166320	your houses are under attack,
4166320	4168000	your living stands are under attack.
4168000	4170560	And the only way to push back is to be political.
4170560	4172560	And you know, I come from a poor background,
4172560	4174240	and people where I grew up don't want to be political.
4174240	4176320	But the truth is, this is what happens if you're not political,
4176320	4177280	you know, there's a fight going on.
4177280	4178560	If you don't fight it, you lose.
4181360	4187440	Yeah. Going back to that thing about renting and homeownership,
4187440	4189200	because of course, if you say, well, we need,
4189200	4190160	and I believe this,
4190160	4192560	we need house prices to go down at least 10%, 15%,
4192560	4194480	and then stagnate, basically, for 20 years.
4195680	4196400	And then somebody would say,
4196400	4198160	well, that means that somebody who's just bought a property here,
4198160	4202000	and there might be a young viewer of yours living in, I don't know,
4203280	4204400	Leicester, right?
4204400	4206000	And they've just bought a nice terraced house,
4206000	4208720	nothing special, 230 grand,
4208720	4210160	and they're going to go into negative equity.
4210720	4212080	Okay, they go into negative equity,
4212080	4213680	let's say for 18 months.
4213680	4215280	I'd still rather be in their shoes,
4216000	4217360	paying towards an asset,
4217360	4219120	which at least in the medium to long term,
4219120	4222240	is going to be making cash than renting.
4222240	4224960	I don't understand how people think the negative,
4224960	4226480	you say negative equity and people go,
4226480	4227680	oh my God, they start panicking.
4228240	4230160	Renting is much worse than negative equity.
4230160	4231920	I was renting in London for 15 years,
4231920	4233920	I lost about 85 grand renting,
4233920	4235040	I've got nothing to show for it.
4235680	4237040	And yet in the popular imagination,
4237040	4239840	somehow negative equity is way worse than renting.
4239840	4240880	Yeah, I think what I say is,
4240880	4245440	the problem actually is the house price to wage ratio.
4245440	4246720	If you think about it, that's the problem.
4248000	4250480	That's gone up massively, 20 years ago, 30 years ago,
4250480	4251840	that was like three or four,
4251840	4254240	and now it's like in London, 20, 30 or more.
4255200	4256960	So what you really want,
4257760	4259360	you can fix the problem with that house price
4259360	4261120	is coming down if you allow wages to rise.
4261120	4263120	And I think what's interesting is in the last 20, 30 years,
4263120	4264480	so we have the Bank of England,
4264480	4266240	who have this mandate to keep inflation down.
4267120	4268160	Except housing inflation.
4268800	4270880	Exactly, it doesn't look at house prices.
4270880	4272480	That inflation does not include house prices.
4272480	4275200	So we have a mechanism that allows house prices to go up,
4275760	4277600	but does not allow wages to go up.
4277600	4279280	And because people want to avoid negative equity,
4279280	4280640	we do not allow house prices to come down.
4280640	4282480	So we've created an unfixable problem.
4282480	4284160	If you allow house prices to go up,
4284160	4285760	and you simultaneously will not accept
4285760	4288240	falling house prices or rising wages,
4288240	4289760	then that problem is unfixable.
4289760	4291040	And I think we need to accept
4291040	4292480	that we have a problem here,
4292480	4295120	and we need to look realistically,
4295120	4297280	why is this so big, and how do we bring wages up?
4297280	4299520	In my opinion, the reason that
4299520	4301200	this market has become so big
4301200	4303440	is because the rich are so fucking rich now,
4303440	4304880	and these guys buy assets.
4304880	4306640	It's not just houses that have gone up,
4306640	4308560	land prices gone up, stocks have gone up,
4308560	4309840	luxury cars have gone up,
4309840	4312000	luxury art has gone up, gold has gone up.
4312080	4314800	Every single asset has rocketed in price
4314800	4316640	because the rich are unbelievably rich.
4316640	4317680	People need to understand,
4319200	4320640	ultimately, there is a competition here
4320640	4321440	for who owns the assets.
4322080	4324800	And if you allow the rich to be unbelievably rich,
4324800	4325920	think about it like this, right?
4325920	4328640	Imagine you are, Elon Musk is a billion or whatever,
4328640	4329920	but imagine you've got 100 million quid.
4329920	4332480	Imagine that's your net worth, 100 million quid.
4332480	4333920	You will make on that wealth
4333920	4335200	about five million pounds a year.
4335920	4336560	Let's say four.
4337120	4338240	You make four million pounds a year
4338240	4339120	just for getting out of bed.
4339120	4339920	How much do you spend?
4340880	4341760	Per day.
4342320	4342800	Per year.
4343600	4345600	I could live on 15 grand a year easily.
4345600	4347200	Well, you're making four million pounds a year.
4347200	4348400	Yeah, but honestly, I mean,
4348400	4350160	as me, being a slightly 30 grand a year,
4350160	4351520	40 grand a year easily.
4351520	4355200	A sensible person would spend 200, 300 grand a year,
4355200	4356560	live a life of luxury,
4356560	4358720	and use the other 3.7 million pounds
4358720	4360480	to buy more assets.
4360480	4361120	That's what they do.
4361120	4362960	And it's not that they're evil.
4362960	4363840	I don't hate these people.
4363840	4364720	They're not bad people.
4364720	4366400	It's just, if you're super rich,
4366400	4367920	you have a massive income.
4367920	4369440	And it happens automatically.
4369440	4370320	You just put it in the stock market.
4370320	4371360	Those are the incentives.
4371360	4372960	Yeah, you know, and that's so...
4372960	4374720	You create this vacuum of wealth
4374720	4376480	that sucks wealth out of ordinary family.
4376480	4377920	So, of course, how's prices going to rise?
4377920	4379280	Because they have got so much money,
4379280	4380160	they're going to push it up.
4380160	4380960	Let me ask you a question
4380960	4381840	that I'm actually relating to this,
4381840	4383600	because at Labour Party Conference,
4383600	4384880	Keir Starmer outlined a policy,
4385440	4386640	and he said he wanted home ownership
4386640	4388480	to go from 65% to 70%.
4388480	4390080	It was 70% in 2003.
4390080	4392320	So, important to say, we've gone backwards, right?
4393120	4394080	And that they would do this
4394080	4397360	basically through some government-led mortgage scheme,
4397360	4399440	presumably they would provide deposits to people.
4399440	4400480	I don't know how they would do it.
4401280	4402400	They could be subprime mortgages,
4402400	4403760	presumably, which are backed by the state.
4403760	4404400	I have no idea.
4405680	4406960	That to me sounds like
4406960	4408160	you're only going to further inflate
4408160	4409040	the mortgage market, though,
4409040	4412400	because, of course, going from 65% to 70% again
4412400	4414800	means you've got massive increase in demand.
4414800	4416640	Good, I'm happy to do that.
4416640	4418240	But that doesn't sound like a solution to me,
4418240	4420240	if you're saying we're going to help home ownership
4420240	4422080	by increasing prices,
4422080	4424400	and, again, they're going to out ship wage increases.
4424400	4426880	I think this is what happens when you don't deal
4426880	4427920	with the fundamental problem
4427920	4430000	that inequality is increasing massively.
4430000	4431760	You know, how do you keep people in homes
4431760	4433360	when inequality is increasing massively?
4433360	4436880	You know, if you have this constant flow of wealth and assets
4436880	4439520	from ordinary families to the rich,
4439520	4440720	then how do you keep them in their homes?
4440720	4441920	The only way to do it,
4441920	4443360	because homes are ultimately
4443360	4445760	the largest form of wealth in the country,
4445760	4448320	the only way to do it is have massive increase in debt.
4448320	4449600	And this is, if you start looking
4449600	4450960	for sort of technocratic solutions,
4451520	4452080	this is what will happen.
4452080	4454080	You'll just end up putting people into more and more debt.
4454080	4455520	And I think that is what will happen.
4455520	4460080	And we need, people need to understand
4460080	4462160	that you cannot be rich without assets.
4462160	4465280	And the current setup sees an enormous flow of assets
4465280	4466800	and wealth and money every year
4466800	4468400	from ordinary families to the rich.
4468400	4470240	You know, you make 30 grand,
4470240	4474000	you spend all of that on mortgage, rent, food, bills, energy.
4474000	4475120	That money doesn't disappear.
4475120	4476480	It goes to the owner of your house,
4476480	4477520	the owner of your mortgage,
4477520	4479200	the owner of the food, the owner of Tesco,
4479200	4480720	the owner of the energy companies, right?
4481280	4484080	You earn 30 grand, you give all of it to the rich.
4484080	4486000	And it is that guy, Rishi Sunaki,
4486000	4487520	he's worth 700 million pounds, right?
4487520	4489520	You know, he will make every year,
4490400	4492640	he'll make 20 million pounds on that every single year.
4492640	4494800	And that's where your mortgage payment goes.
4494800	4496960	You know, so if you create a system
4496960	4498880	where there's this enormous flow of money,
4498880	4501840	wealth assets from ordinary families to the rich,
4501840	4504000	then year after year, generation after generation,
4504000	4506560	ordinary families will get poorer.
4507200	4509520	And this fundamentally needs to be fixed on it
4509520	4510880	until we grasp this problem,
4511440	4512560	life will get worse and worse.
4512560	4514400	That is exactly why I do the job that I do.
4514400	4515280	I don't need to do this.
4515280	4516080	You know what I mean?
4516080	4517120	I've made a lot of money
4517120	4518160	and I could keep making more money.
4518160	4520000	I could go live on a beach in the Philippines,
4520000	4523760	but poverty will explode if we don't deal with this.
4523760	4525040	Let's talk about deficits.
4525040	4526480	It's a word that's not mentioned anymore.
4526480	4529440	It was very common between 2010 and 2015.
4530800	4533440	The Tories promised to eliminate the deficit by 2015
4533440	4534400	when they came into government
4534400	4536400	with the Liberal Democrats in 2010.
4536400	4538160	We've been running a deficit since 2010.
4538160	4538960	Actually, it's important to say,
4538960	4540960	we've been running virtually permanent deficits
4540960	4542320	since the late 1970s.
4544000	4545520	For the Tories, quote unquote,
4545520	4548400	balancing the books is always this big watchword.
4548960	4550880	Are they ever going to balance the books?
4550880	4551520	Which is to say,
4551520	4553600	are they ever going to preside over a situation
4553600	4556720	where actually they bring in more through general taxation
4556720	4558560	than they spend through public spending?
4558560	4560000	Because they promised to do that for years.
4560000	4560880	It never happens.
4560880	4562640	I think it will probably never happen.
4563200	4564160	Okay, so, you know,
4564160	4565760	lots of people have lots of strong opinions on this.
4566560	4568320	Governments don't need to run surpluses.
4568320	4569200	You can run a deficit.
4569200	4571840	The reason is because deficits get eroded over time
4571840	4574320	by both economic growth and by inflation.
4575040	4577600	So, your debt is fixed in nominal terms.
4577600	4578800	Inflation pushed all the prices up.
4578800	4580240	So, if you have growth of,
4580240	4581200	nowadays we don't get much,
4581200	4582480	but if you get one, two percent,
4582480	4584080	if you have inflation of two, three percent,
4584080	4585760	then your deficit is naturally falling
4585760	4588960	relative to the size of your economy by four or five percent every year.
4588960	4592720	So, you can afford to run a four or five percent deficit over time.
4592720	4593680	You can, if that's what you want.
4594560	4595840	I'm not opposed to deficits at all.
4595920	4600560	I think the last few years,
4600560	4602400	I've seen some people sort of pushing this direction
4602400	4603920	of let's run massive deficits.
4603920	4608160	And I think the deficit in Corridor is necessary.
4608160	4612400	I think the big problem that this sort of people saying
4612400	4613760	let's run massive deficits is,
4614320	4617040	it totally defangs people like me saying,
4617040	4618400	let's tax the rich.
4618400	4619840	Because if you turn around to me and say,
4620480	4623280	there's no problem with deficits, even massive ones,
4623280	4624400	why tax the rich?
4624480	4625840	We just run a massive deficit.
4625840	4628080	And then what you do is you politically enable
4628080	4630640	things like COVID where a massive crisis
4630640	4634400	led to a Â£600 billion wealth transfer to the rich.
4634400	4636080	So, actually, you think the MMT people,
4636080	4637440	the modern monetary theory people,
4637440	4638720	they've got it completely wrong.
4638720	4640560	They're providing the sort of intellectual foundations.
4640560	4642720	If they're saying, and not all of them do say that,
4642720	4643920	we need to run massive deficits.
4643920	4645040	Don't worry about class struggle.
4645040	4646400	Don't worry about inequality.
4647040	4650560	Actually, what they're doing is providing a license to the transfer
4650560	4651760	of wealth from poor to rich.
4651760	4652960	I don't want to mischaracterize them
4652960	4654480	because it's a big community and different people
4654480	4655280	believe different things.
4655280	4658080	And I think the high priests of it,
4658080	4659840	the people who are really into it,
4659840	4660800	often they will say, well, actually,
4660800	4662880	MMT does support taxation of the rich.
4662880	4665280	The problem is the message that has cut through
4665280	4666640	is deficits are not dangerous.
4666640	4668080	And the message that you need to tax the rich
4668080	4669120	has not cut through.
4669120	4671280	Because I talk about taxing the rich all the time
4671280	4673680	and I frequently get people posting against me,
4673680	4675680	you don't need to tax the rich, you don't understand money.
4675680	4677280	So, there's no doubt about it
4677280	4679280	that MMT has persuaded a lot of people,
4679280	4680640	you don't need to tax the rich.
4680640	4683840	And I think, and people disagree with this,
4683840	4685840	but I think if you just print money
4685840	4687440	and that money ends up with the rich,
4687440	4688880	you will increase inequality
4688880	4690480	and you will decrease living standards.
4691040	4692320	Distribution matters.
4692320	4692960	It matters.
4692960	4693920	Of course it does.
4693920	4696000	You can't massively increase inequality
4696000	4698080	and not expect living standards to fall.
4698080	4701760	And the last three years have shown exactly that happening.
4701760	4704320	So, I think I'm not against deficits.
4705600	4707200	Of course, I'm not pro austerity.
4707200	4708960	And government can afford to run a deficit.
4709600	4713120	But if you take your eye off of inequality
4713120	4715440	and you say deficits are totally fine,
4715440	4717840	we don't really care about what that does to inequality,
4717840	4719920	you can't be surprised when the Tory government turns around
4719920	4722720	and say, okay, well, we're going to tax ordinary people's taxes,
4722720	4724960	we're going to cut ordinary people's taxes by 100 quid
4724960	4726640	and the richest taxes by 50 grand.
4726640	4727600	You've allowed that, right?
4727600	4729360	You've allowed that because you've said to them,
4729360	4730960	we're not going to fight you on running deficits
4730960	4732560	and we're not going to fight you on inequality.
4732560	4734800	So, they're going to run a deficit to increase inequality.
4734880	4738960	So, I think deficits can be a tool in a certain time.
4738960	4740240	Of course, the power is not unlimited.
4740240	4742080	Of course, the power is not unlimited.
4742080	4744320	But if you take your eye off the ball with inequality
4744320	4746640	and with distribution, it will rise.
4746640	4747840	You need to watch it.
4747840	4749280	So, you're talking about taxing the rich,
4749840	4753840	but we're often told that imposing higher taxes on profits,
4753840	4756320	higher incomes would drive business away from the UK.
4756320	4757360	What would your response to that be?
4757360	4759840	So, the first thing is, I'm not talking about taxing incomes more.
4759840	4761440	I'm talking about taxing wealth more.
4761440	4763520	You can tax income less if you want, you know what I mean?
4763520	4765840	And then you can attract high earners here if you want.
4766480	4768160	But when we talk about driving people away,
4768160	4772000	I think the one single only good thing to come out of this war in Ukraine
4772960	4775680	is that the government turned around and suddenly decided
4775680	4777120	they wanted to tax rich people.
4777120	4778960	A very specific subset of rich people,
4778960	4780160	which is Russian billionaires.
4780720	4784800	And Roman Abramovich, who of course owns Chelsea Football Club,
4784800	4788400	he fucking paid it because you cannot put Chelsea Football Club in a bag.
4788400	4792800	You know, I think that idea rests on a perception of rich people
4792800	4796080	as if they are guys with like a massive bag of cash, okay?
4796080	4798800	Rich people are rich because they own your houses.
4798800	4799680	They own your house.
4799680	4800800	They own your mortgage.
4800800	4802320	They own fucking Tescos down the road.
4802320	4803360	They own the skyscrapers.
4803360	4804720	They own the fucking windmills.
4804720	4805520	They own the oil rigs.
4805520	4807440	They own the fucking land that makes the food.
4807440	4809680	They are rich because they own real assets.
4810320	4813040	In this, they're rich because they own this country
4813040	4814480	and they can leave if they want.
4814480	4817280	The country will still be here and we can tax the assets
4817280	4819040	where the assets are, which is here.
4819040	4820080	You know what I mean?
4820080	4822160	You know, Jeff Bezos owns Amazon,
4822160	4825600	but Amazon sells to the UK, to the US, to Europe, to Japan.
4825600	4826080	You know what I mean?
4826720	4829120	You know, these guys can't just all move to the Cayman Islands.
4829120	4831040	The assets are in the world.
4831040	4834320	You know, they own real things and we can tax those real things.
4834320	4836800	You know, ultimately it's a question of,
4836800	4840720	do you want your country to be owned by people who pay tax or people who don't?
4841200	4842800	You know, and it's, they can leave.
4842800	4843680	The stuff is here.
4843680	4844880	They own your mortgage.
4844880	4845600	What are they going to do?
4846160	4849040	You know, we can tax that payment when you make it.
4849040	4851040	Ultimately, their money comes from you.
4851040	4853760	Their money comes from when you, when you go to the supermarket,
4853760	4855360	when you work, when you pay your bills,
4855360	4857040	when you pay your mortgage, when you pay your rent.
4857040	4859280	I think people need to, there's one video on my channel
4859280	4859920	called What Is World?
4859920	4862320	You know, I'm going to just plug it because it's to explain,
4862320	4864480	these guys are rich because they own assets.
4864480	4865440	They own this country.
4865440	4866640	Of course, we can tax it.
4866640	4868640	And I think nothing shows that better than
4868640	4869840	Roman Abramovich turning around,
4869840	4872400	trying to sell Chelsea Football Club to the only one who's going to buy it.
4872400	4874560	Because it's there.
4874560	4875760	It exists and we can tax it.
4876400	4879520	Why do you think Quasiquata and got rid of the Cap on Bankers bonuses?
4879520	4882000	Because presumably the same argument there, right?
4882000	4884160	Actually, it's a little bit different because that's not a tax.
4884160	4885600	It wasn't actually raising money.
4886240	4888160	They might actually make the argument it will raise more money
4888160	4890720	because we'll have a larger financial service industry here.
4890720	4892080	What was the thinking that you think?
4893280	4894080	I'll be honest.
4894640	4899600	The thing, I understood the economics of the budget very well in my opinion.
4900480	4903680	The thing which I'm struggling to understand is why they did what they did.
4903680	4905680	And the most people I speak to are struggling as well.
4906480	4908480	And you know, some people say they're ideological.
4908480	4910400	I'll be honest, a lot of people say that they're idiots.
4910400	4912320	A lot of people in the markets genuinely think they're idiots.
4912320	4913840	Quasiquating worked in markets.
4913840	4915520	And everybody's saying, oh, I know this guy that worked with him.
4915520	4916800	He said he was an absolute idiot.
4916800	4918640	He's got PhD in economic history.
4918640	4921200	Mind you, you've already said you've already rinsed academics.
4924080	4925280	I couldn't tell you honestly.
4925280	4927120	I think that he probably thinks that it will...
4927920	4930560	Do you think he thinks it'll play well with a certain demographic?
4930560	4936800	That he's trying to pitch himself as we are pro-growth and we are pro-dynamism.
4936800	4940000	One thing I think is interesting about Banker, because I was a banker for a long time.
4941200	4942960	I was very poor growing up, right?
4942960	4945920	That is the kind of policy which you ask 15-year-old me,
4945920	4948720	doing maths lying on the floor of his front room, you know what I mean?
4948720	4949760	Who'll probably like it.
4949760	4950320	You know what I mean?
4950320	4957760	Because I'm poor and I see a system where people around me in London are millionaires
4957760	4958880	and don't pay much tax.
4958880	4960960	And I'm thinking, well, I want to get out that channel.
4961600	4964000	Finance is aspirational, isn't it?
4964000	4965760	For me, it was aspirational.
4965840	4966320	You know what I mean?
4966320	4970880	So I couldn't tell you for sure and I think it's fallen flat.
4972160	4977200	But I think maybe he's trying to pitch himself as aspirational.
4977200	4978880	That seems to be what they're going for as a brand.
4978880	4980960	Would it play well with the sort of people you used to work with?
4980960	4984080	Would they sort of hear that come through in the mini-budget statement
4984080	4986240	at Citibank and go, fucking hell, brilliant.
4986240	4987920	I'll tell you, I've got a good story about this.
4989120	4994240	So I started working in 2008 and in 2009, I think it was in 2009,
4994240	4997360	it was still a Labour government and they announced a big increase in tax on the banks.
4999520	5001040	And I was shitting myself, right?
5001040	5002960	Because I was still poor, I'd never been paid.
5002960	5005040	You know, I had a job at a bank, but I didn't make any money yet.
5005040	5007200	And I was like, fuck me, I'll work this hard to get here
5007200	5008880	and now they're going to raise taxes on me.
5008880	5010800	And I looked around me at the traders on the desk,
5010800	5011920	they were fucking laughing.
5011920	5015200	They were fucking laughing because they knew it wouldn't affect them.
5015200	5016400	They knew it wouldn't affect them.
5016400	5019520	And I remember this sort of, it's weird for someone like me
5019520	5023120	who comes from a poor background to just see this confidence, this like,
5023120	5024880	and that was a Labour government, right?
5024880	5028480	This knowledge that, look, these guys, don't worry, we got them.
5028480	5030000	They're going to come for us.
5030000	5034000	It's just, it's just, it's for the people, you know, it's, you know,
5034000	5038240	and, you know, the bank of bonus cap, in the reality of it is,
5038240	5040800	all it led to was a massive increase in bank of salaries.
5040800	5044080	You know, so it's a good example of a tax which is
5046720	5048880	for your image, basically.
5048880	5052080	It's a messaging tax because, you know, essentially it's not a tax,
5052080	5053920	it's just a change in the structure of pay, you know.
5056240	5058320	So I honestly think they probably don't really care.
5059200	5062000	They understand that it's just, it's for messaging.
5062000	5064720	It's for the conservative part in the way that they look.
5065600	5068000	On the crypto thing, we mentioned it a bit earlier on.
5068000	5070960	So tons of working-class guys and others as well,
5070960	5073680	but it is a thing, as far as I can see,
5073680	5076000	have sort of been sucked into crypto.
5076000	5077520	Yeah.
5077520	5078800	Are they being conned?
5078800	5080800	You know, you're somebody that's interested in financial markets
5080880	5083680	and assets and wealth, but the way it's being talked about
5083680	5086320	and speculated on, particularly on social media,
5087360	5089120	it seems a little bit more like a Ponzi scheme.
5089120	5090160	Am I being unfair?
5090160	5091760	Basically, in my opinion, yes.
5091760	5093280	Listen, I live on my investments.
5093280	5094400	I make investments.
5094400	5095440	I'm an investor.
5096160	5098640	If you want to invest in something, you should do a due diligence, okay?
5100000	5102800	The number one thing that you should check before anything else,
5102800	5103840	you probably should need to check it,
5103840	5105520	is that the thing that you're buying fucking exists.
5106400	5109360	You know, these guys, it's fucking internet points, mate.
5109920	5112480	See, I'm going to get hate on this for the internet.
5112480	5113280	That is what it is.
5113280	5114240	It's internet points, you know?
5114240	5115440	And I said this before this crash.
5115440	5116560	I've been saying it for a long time.
5117360	5119360	These guys are selling you fucking snake oil, you know?
5119360	5121840	And they're going to take that money that you gave to them
5121840	5123680	to buy their fucking dog coin,
5123680	5125760	and they're going to buy your fucking mom's house.
5125760	5127040	That is what they're going to buy with it.
5127040	5129760	You know, you could be saving that money to buy houses,
5129760	5131760	and they're selling you fucking points on the internet.
5131760	5133760	And I understand it.
5133760	5135760	I understand it, you know, because I've been there.
5135760	5136480	I've been poor.
5136480	5138800	You see the guys, oh, I'm making money trading, blah, blah, blah.
5138800	5140960	And you know, all the guys who, you know,
5140960	5142400	they're showing on their Instagram,
5142400	5143600	I bought a Lamborghini with crypto.
5143600	5145360	Listen, I've come out on crypto,
5145360	5146800	so I get the messages from people, all right?
5147760	5149920	The guys who fucking lost their fucking life savings
5149920	5152160	trading crypto, they don't fucking post it on Instagram.
5153040	5153520	You know?
5153520	5154240	It's as simple as that.
5154240	5155280	But they message me.
5155280	5157520	They message me saying, oh, I've lost all my money.
5157520	5158400	Can you give me some advice?
5158400	5159840	I've got this new strategy.
5159840	5161680	And I have to message them back saying, listen,
5161680	5162560	you've got a problem.
5162560	5163600	It's an addiction.
5163600	5165840	My advice is that you'd never trade this ever again.
5165840	5167360	And you know, and you come out,
5167360	5169280	and you, once you speak out on it,
5169280	5170560	you get these guys flooding to you,
5170560	5171840	oh, I've lost all my fucking savings.
5171840	5174000	And it's, you know, it's fucking gambling addiction, man.
5174000	5176800	And it ruins, it ruins lives, it ruins family.
5176800	5180480	And you know, also, you know, these people, I've been poor.
5180480	5182400	I've been that fucking young, dumb, full of cum guy
5182400	5183520	that wants to make a ton of cash.
5183520	5184400	You know what I mean?
5184400	5185520	I understand it.
5185520	5188640	But these people, they should be our best fighters
5188640	5191360	to make this fucking system better for ordinary families.
5191360	5192560	The guys buying crypto.
5192560	5194400	Yeah, because they're young, they've got energy.
5194400	5196000	Listen, I'm getting older now, you know what I mean?
5196000	5198080	I can't be out every day like pushing this, you know?
5198080	5201840	But these guys, they're getting screwed over by the system,
5201840	5203760	and then they're getting sold the fucking fake cure
5203760	5205680	by the system that's taking all their money.
5205680	5207760	Come here and help us build a system
5207760	5209920	that will get you a fucking house, you know what I mean?
5209920	5213920	And, and I know it's a seductive idea
5213920	5216000	like you buy this coin, you can become a millionaire.
5216000	5217200	And you know, I'm not telling you,
5217200	5219520	if you follow my fucking YouTube, you'll be a millionaire.
5219520	5220800	That's not gonna work like that.
5220800	5223520	But if we lose this fight, you and your family will be fucked.
5223520	5225280	I'm sorry. I don't want to say it like that.
5225280	5226160	But that is what it is.
5226160	5229120	You know, this is not a fight where the winners make millions.
5229120	5230960	This is a fight for survival, you know?
5230960	5232400	So I see-
5232400	5236400	You would put crypto as a very discreet asset sort of class,
5236400	5241280	which is nothing like, like you said, housing or land or gold.
5241280	5242800	You wouldn't touch it with a barge pole.
5242800	5244640	I'm short. The reason I'm short,
5244640	5246560	people probably say I always send this shit because it's short.
5246560	5248720	The reason I'm short is because I started to get asked
5248720	5250240	to do a lot of interviews on crypto.
5250240	5252880	And I went on TV and radio and said, I think it's bullshit.
5252880	5258240	And, you know, I'm a big believer that you shouldn't say shit.
5258240	5259760	You don't believe, okay?
5259760	5262000	So if I'm going to say something on the radio,
5262000	5263200	I've got my nuts on it, okay?
5263200	5264720	I still trade every day, right?
5264720	5267440	And the things that I say is going to happen, I'm betting on it.
5267440	5269760	So I went, I opened up and I went short crypto, you know?
5269760	5272320	I went short crypto just simply because-
5272320	5273520	So explain what that means to our audience.
5273520	5275120	It means I basically bet the price will go down.
5275120	5277680	And if the price goes down, I made money and I've made some money on it going down.
5277680	5279520	And I'm still short because I think it will still go down.
5280320	5282160	I don't consider myself to be a crypto trader.
5282160	5286560	I'm just saying that because, you know, opinions are cheap, okay?
5287200	5288240	I've got my nuts on this.
5288240	5289680	If it goes up, I'm going to lose money.
5289680	5290880	So you know what I believe.
5290880	5291600	That's what I believe.
5291600	5295840	And, you know, I was one of the top traders in the world and I'm a very successful trader.
5295840	5297920	People don't have to believe me, but that isn't,
5297920	5299360	for me, that is a statement of intent.
5299360	5301280	And look, I don't want to trade crypto.
5301280	5302240	I think it's bullshit.
5302240	5303760	And I think it takes away-
5303760	5306400	I think it's sucking the life out of a lot of talented young people.
5306400	5308080	And I've seen a lot of things do that in my time.
5308880	5310560	And it's turning them into gambling addicts.
5310560	5313120	And I'm being very harsh on it here and I know people are going to come at me.
5314080	5317120	But I'm trying to save you money.
5317120	5319680	But seriously, you know, I'm just telling you what I believe.
5319680	5320720	You don't have to agree with me.
5320720	5323440	But look, you know, we're losing our houses here.
5323440	5324560	You're trading dog coins.
5324560	5326640	Like you're going to play with us or you're going to play with that.
5326640	5327360	That's the way I see it.
5328320	5328960	Last question.
5329680	5335120	You recently said, my grand macro thesis is that real interest rates have to stay low,
5335120	5335680	as we've said.
5336240	5339120	And that's because the rich have all the wealth and like saving, as you've said.
5339200	5342960	Now, no matter how hard you work, how smart you are, if you come from, quote,
5342960	5346080	the wrong family, you'll probably never own property.
5346080	5347680	That is feudalism.
5347680	5350560	We're going back into a world of aristocracy.
5350560	5352000	Capitalism's over.
5352640	5353600	So capitalism's over.
5353600	5354160	What does that mean?
5354800	5355920	So with quote, first of all-
5355920	5356640	It's a great quote.
5356640	5357600	That's why we're ending on it.
5358800	5361920	When I say capitalism is over, I say capitalism is a big word.
5361920	5363360	People have different ideas of what it means.
5363360	5364160	Okay.
5364160	5367120	But for me and for what I think a lot of people from where I'm from
5367120	5371440	believe capitalism is or should be, is a system where if you fucking work hard
5371440	5374800	and you're talented and you go through it and you do your best and you get the good degree
5374800	5378720	and you get the good job and you hit it, you should not necessarily become super rich,
5378720	5383040	but you should have there for you a nice, secure, comfortable life, house, family.
5383040	5385120	If you want it, that's capitalism.
5385120	5388720	That is the way, I know some people are not agree with that, but that is the way people
5388720	5392560	where I'm from, I raise to believe that it's about a society where if you work hard,
5392560	5396400	if you do the right thing, you will be quite actually secure.
5396400	5400640	Yeah, that is what we are like raised to believe that we live in that kind of society.
5400640	5404400	And I live in a world now where look, I've got a mate, he's a big fan of yours by the way,
5404400	5405520	so we'll be happy to be mentioned.
5406080	5409360	He works in fashion, smart guy, went to Central Saint Martin's big fashion school,
5409360	5412480	works fucking hard, he lives with his, he owes good money now,
5412480	5413680	he took him a long time to get there.
5413680	5417520	He lives with his parents, saves up, saves up, saves up because he wants to buy a house.
5417520	5422560	But the fucking house price has gone quicker than his fucking deposit does.
5422560	5426160	And now mortgage has gone up, how's this guy going to get a house?
5426160	5428960	This guy's done fucking everything you want him to do, you know what I mean?
5428960	5433920	Studied, hard, best university, really gone for it, worked, worked, worked, saving up everything.
5434480	5437440	This guy doesn't even know if he's ever going to be able to afford a family.
5437440	5443120	So from, and at the same time, I've got friends buying houses because their mom gave him 400 grand.
5443120	5446320	That's not fucking capitalism, that is an inherited society.
5446320	5451120	We are moving away, you know, there was 30, 40, 50, 60 years where, you know,
5451120	5454400	my dad worked for the post office, you know, I grew up, it's all Pakistanis and Indians
5454400	5457200	where I grew up, right? Their grandparents came over from Pakistan,
5457200	5461200	from India, from Kenya, right? Just worked in shops, you know, some of them are cleaners
5461200	5463920	and they've got properties now, you know what I mean? They're secure now.
5463920	5468960	That was possible in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and it is not possible anymore.
5468960	5472640	We've got smart, bright, hardworking kids going to the best universities,
5472640	5474880	doing everything they can and they will never own property.
5474880	5479120	So when I say capitalism's over, that is what I mean because we have ended a society
5479120	5482560	where ordinary people can expect to get a good quality of life for working hard.
5482560	5487360	Gary, what a pleasure, mate. Thank you. Cheers.
