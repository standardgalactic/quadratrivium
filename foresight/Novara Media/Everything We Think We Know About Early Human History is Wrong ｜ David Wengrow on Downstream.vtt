00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
the dawn of everything is is trying to undo just to write about even very remote periods of history

00:06.560 --> 00:12.400
that we have evidence for as if there were real people in them which sounds like a ridiculous

00:12.400 --> 00:16.800
thing to say but it's very rarely done you know prehistoric people are more likely to be compared

00:16.800 --> 00:20.480
to non-human primates than they are to people like you or I.

00:20.880 --> 00:29.440
What if everything we knew about human history was wrong?

00:30.400 --> 00:34.880
Received wisdom is that humans have been around for two maybe 300,000 years

00:34.880 --> 00:40.000
but that we only start agriculture in the last 10 to 12,000 after that we have cities,

00:40.000 --> 00:48.480
astronomy, numbers, civilization as we know it but according to a book by David Wengrow and the

00:48.480 --> 00:55.360
recently deceased David Graber that's not quite accurate they say that cities and what we judge as

00:55.920 --> 01:02.480
advanced human culture actually precedes agriculture the story of prehistory is far more

01:02.480 --> 01:10.080
complex and interesting than we thought and that this has quite remarkable political implications.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.320
David Wengrow, welcome to Downstream. Thanks for having me on.

01:15.040 --> 01:19.440
You're an archaeologist you teach archaeology at University College London

01:20.000 --> 01:22.240
is that a job you always wanted to do when you were a child?

01:22.880 --> 01:29.920
No it isn't when I left school I wanted to be in the theatre and I'd already done a fair bit

01:29.920 --> 01:36.560
of that I think from the age of about 14 I fell in love with acting in the stage and I joined up

01:36.560 --> 01:41.120
with the National Youth Theatre which was a wonderful time because it was the first time

01:41.200 --> 01:46.080
Londoner was the first time I actually met people from all over the country all over the UK

01:47.200 --> 01:55.920
and I did it I left school and got an agent and did that for a while then did various other things

01:55.920 --> 01:59.200
and then I fell into archaeology more or less by accident.

02:00.080 --> 02:03.840
So how was that? Wow child actor becomes archaeo that sounds like a great story.

02:03.840 --> 02:08.240
Yeah I think it was more of a sort of young adult actor I mean I've met child actors and

02:08.240 --> 02:12.800
they're a very specific kind of person but there's never quite one of those but

02:14.480 --> 02:19.360
what happened basically after trying various other things including a little

02:20.080 --> 02:27.200
flotation with journalism at the BBC Arabic service and various other things I wasn't

02:27.200 --> 02:35.040
really finding a direction so I had good grades from school and I decided to apply to Oxford

02:35.760 --> 02:40.400
well that's when I want to go to the best university I can get into I want to go to Oxford

02:41.280 --> 02:45.760
and I wrote to all these Oxford colleges saying can I come and do English literature

02:45.760 --> 02:53.680
and they all ignored me and a friend of mine who it was told me it's easier to get into places

02:53.680 --> 02:58.720
like that if you apply for a subject that's a bit off the beaten track and they had just

02:58.800 --> 03:05.440
started a new programme new degree called Archaeology and Anthropology which is actually

03:05.440 --> 03:11.520
the name of the degree that I teach and coordinate now at UCL. So I wrote to one college in Hughes

03:11.520 --> 03:17.840
College asking if I could do that and I got an interview and I went into this interview with

03:18.960 --> 03:24.400
a very formidable woman called Barbara Kennedy she was a geographer because they didn't have any

03:24.400 --> 03:30.160
archaeologists at that particular college and she grilled me for a while and I sort of spouted on

03:30.160 --> 03:37.120
about how archaeology was my great passion and so on and then she reached down and produced from

03:37.120 --> 03:43.280
under her chair all these letters that I'd written to other colleges saying can I come and do English

03:43.280 --> 03:49.920
literature I thought well I'll bolt that up but then she admitted me and I was technically a mature

03:49.920 --> 03:55.840
student although it was probably anything but in terms of everything else but I think it was

03:55.840 --> 04:02.320
classified as a mature student when I started and I nearly made a complete mess of that actually

04:02.320 --> 04:09.200
and nearly got slung out after about six months but I had one teacher it was one of those things

04:09.200 --> 04:14.560
where it's just one person actually gets you hooked and gives you the confidence to think you

04:14.560 --> 04:18.640
know yes you know you have a place in this you can contribute and that was a guy called Andrew

04:19.440 --> 04:26.720
Sherrod who passed away very young actually same age as David 59 and just had a massive

04:26.720 --> 04:34.880
heart attack one day but really sort of got me to pull my finger out and got me addicted to this

04:34.880 --> 04:39.840
stuff and I didn't really look back after that because there's something here all the time I'm

04:39.840 --> 04:46.960
sure that at some point most people when they're children want to be archaeologists yeah I did

04:47.040 --> 04:52.160
I mean there's obviously something there I can remember a school trip to Old Serum

04:52.160 --> 04:58.720
St Salisbury Plain one of these great Iron Age hill forts and I came back from that and went back

04:58.720 --> 05:02.480
I used to live with my grandparents a lot in North London I remember going back to their

05:02.480 --> 05:07.600
place after that and my head was just full of images you know I could see all the different

05:07.600 --> 05:14.640
sort of waves of migrations and invasions and I produced this this sort of tone this is all

05:14.640 --> 05:19.920
pre-computers I think I got like a calligraphy pen or something and sort of tried to create a

05:20.480 --> 05:25.200
I remember my grand helping me with coffee grinds to sort of age the paper so you know

05:25.200 --> 05:30.000
there was something there which is completely irrational where you just feel an attachment

05:30.000 --> 05:36.480
to some era and I don't have any family roots in the British Isles so you know it's not like a

05:36.480 --> 05:42.960
local attachment but you just identify for some reason with a place or an era of history

05:43.840 --> 05:47.360
and I don't know why that happens but clearly people who choose

05:48.080 --> 05:52.960
to pursue archaeology they have they have that in an unusually high dosage

05:53.920 --> 05:57.600
just against the meat of your book the dawn of everything

05:59.520 --> 06:06.400
the conventional view is humans have been around for 200 300 000 years you can give the specific

06:06.400 --> 06:12.400
numbers in the answer but we've only engaged in agriculture for 12 000 years 11 000 years

06:12.400 --> 06:17.760
12 000 years and that with the advent of agriculture we then get all the things that we associate

06:17.760 --> 06:25.920
with with modern humans cities numbers numeracy literacy astronomy civilization your book

06:25.920 --> 06:33.280
co-written with the recently departed David Graber says that's completely wrong or it's

06:33.280 --> 06:41.280
it's significantly wrong um well we'd have to pick apart what you said there uh a bit

06:41.360 --> 06:48.240
Aaron you know um when you say we we started having agriculture 12 000 years ago

06:49.120 --> 06:55.120
only a very tiny number of people on the planet started doing that in very specific locations

06:55.120 --> 07:00.640
specifically the Middle East or they sometimes call the fertile crescent most of the world at that

07:00.640 --> 07:06.960
time was still hunter-gatherers and fishes so um you know actually what you've presented as a

07:06.960 --> 07:11.440
summary is a classic example of what we would call a kind of stage theory where you've got these

07:11.440 --> 07:16.240
long periods when sort of nothing happens then everything changes you get the agricultural

07:16.240 --> 07:23.120
revolution populations expand then you get cities and everything changes again then you get civilization

07:24.400 --> 07:31.760
and one of the things we try to show in the book is that actually the process is much more

07:31.760 --> 07:37.920
interesting than that and you've got people at what are supposed to be different phases or stages

07:37.920 --> 07:43.200
of history actually living cheek by jowl sort of feeding off each other reacting against each other

07:43.760 --> 07:49.680
and also consciously planning and designing societies according to different sets of values

07:49.680 --> 07:56.400
which you know when we talk about civilization and modernity there's this deeply ingrained assumption

07:56.400 --> 08:02.640
to think that it's only us moderns or supposedly moderns you know us post enlightenment folk

08:03.280 --> 08:08.400
who've been able to do that to actually make a decision about the kinds of societies we wish to

08:08.400 --> 08:14.800
live in and then consciously try to make that happen um and I think that's that's a deeply

08:14.800 --> 08:22.320
rooted idea both in the intellectual philosophical and political traditions of the left and of the

08:22.320 --> 08:30.320
right in Europe in the european tradition let's say and we think that's wrong and as you say humans

08:31.520 --> 08:37.920
have been around as far as we know humans who are cognitively just like you and I

08:38.480 --> 08:43.360
same kinds of brains perfectly capable of having a conversation just like the one that we're having

08:43.360 --> 08:52.240
for something in the order of 200 to 300 thousand years and what we know about most of that

08:52.240 --> 09:01.440
time is vanishingly little um but if you think about it that's extraordinary I mean the number

09:01.440 --> 09:06.800
of things that could have happened the number of different kinds of conversations and experiments

09:06.800 --> 09:13.120
that could have taken place and yet the way we tend to write about and characterize those

09:13.120 --> 09:19.360
early periods is the opposite it's as if people were existing in some sort of strange haze just

09:19.360 --> 09:28.240
kind of you know following patterns or routines until one day somebody invents agriculture and

09:28.240 --> 09:36.240
everything changes and that's the kind of I guess conceptual damage that we do to our own past

09:36.880 --> 09:43.520
the the dawn of everything is is trying to undo just to write about even very remote periods of

09:43.520 --> 09:49.200
history that we have evidence for as if there were real people in them which sounds like a

09:49.200 --> 09:53.520
ridiculous thing to say but it's very rarely done you know prehistoric people are more likely to be

09:53.520 --> 10:00.000
compared to non-human primates than they are to people like you or I and I love this insert which

10:00.000 --> 10:07.520
you have which I'd never ever thought of before maybe we can go into a little bit about foragers

10:07.520 --> 10:14.800
hunter-gatherers being less parochial basically than modern humans I mean maybe not today in the

10:14.800 --> 10:19.760
age of the internet but until relatively recently yeah can you talk about Alice this is this is

10:19.760 --> 10:26.640
one of the great revelations of modern archaeology is you know this whole idea that humans before

10:26.640 --> 10:35.040
agriculture lived in these tiny bands sort of isolated isolated pockets of humanity nomadic

10:35.040 --> 10:40.240
roaming around the landscape not having much contact is completely wrong like we can trace back

10:40.240 --> 10:46.240
now in concrete terms evidence going back tens and tens of thousands of years before agriculture

10:46.960 --> 10:53.680
to show that human societies you know way even beyond the last ice age were already highly

10:53.680 --> 11:01.120
structured over very large areas interacting moving things around the landscape we've got

11:01.200 --> 11:06.080
scientific techniques these days which are pretty good I mean you can actually trace

11:07.120 --> 11:11.760
people's diets tens of thousands of years ago you can say whether they moved from a

11:11.760 --> 11:17.440
coastal environment to a terrestrial environment you can trace movements of plants animals raw

11:17.440 --> 11:24.480
materials we have ancient DNA so there are many methods by which we can reconstruct a picture of

11:24.480 --> 11:30.960
early human societies and it turns out that the world was highly connected and if you think about

11:30.960 --> 11:34.880
it this shouldn't be surprising because of course one of the first things that that humans do

11:37.120 --> 11:43.600
is actually move and actually the word that's usually used is that we colonize the globe

11:44.240 --> 11:47.440
which is a strange term to think of in a way because there's nobody out there

11:48.480 --> 11:56.640
to be colonized but we move and we we we somehow find our way everywhere from Africa down to

11:56.640 --> 12:02.560
South America and eventually Australia so you actually start off with a highly

12:03.200 --> 12:09.760
integrated and connected social universe which may not demographically involve that many people

12:09.760 --> 12:18.160
but they're finding ways to maintain connections and transfer ideas over extraordinary distances

12:18.160 --> 12:22.080
in a way that in say the middle ages in Europe certainly wasn't the case the average

12:22.160 --> 12:26.880
yeah rural peasant wouldn't leave there that's right and this is very interesting because it

12:26.880 --> 12:31.600
means you have to rethink scale like the whole scalar factor in human history in a way I think

12:31.600 --> 12:36.800
the sort of stereotypical picture that most people have is kind of back to from where you

12:36.800 --> 12:41.760
know you think you start off with these small isolated groups and then human populations expand

12:41.760 --> 12:46.560
and we end up with globalization it's almost the opposite actually if you look at the history of

12:46.560 --> 12:52.560
the Middle East for example you go from having these big kind of regional systems to a situation

12:52.560 --> 12:58.480
where today you know if you want to move from Cairo to Damascus you've either got to work for the

12:58.480 --> 13:06.000
CIA or go through you know about 50 different border checks so in a way actually you know the

13:06.000 --> 13:13.520
history of nation states and hard borders we've become much more enclosed over time one thing

13:13.520 --> 13:19.120
about megalithic sites which again I've only really discovered in the last several years your book

13:19.120 --> 13:27.280
is a part of that is the role of astronomy and obviously there's the equinoxes and the solstices

13:27.280 --> 13:33.520
but more besides that too often certain constellations of constellations of stars being sort of aligned

13:33.520 --> 13:42.720
and recognised and whatnot so are we looking then at many many societies which didn't have agriculture

13:42.720 --> 13:47.360
yet engaged in really advanced astronomy because again that's something people don't really

13:47.360 --> 13:53.040
and navigation you know we're talking about human populations finding their way through

13:53.680 --> 13:59.760
island landscapes to remote places out in the middle of the pacific of course you know they've

13:59.760 --> 14:06.640
got to have a superb grasp practically and intellectually of topography and the behaviour of

14:07.600 --> 14:16.560
of the seas and yes I mean there's no question and you see it reflected in monumental architecture

14:16.560 --> 14:23.360
from very early periods which is often laid out in very precise alignments in relation to other

14:23.360 --> 14:29.600
monuments in relation to the solstices here in the UK obviously you have famously Stonehenge

14:30.000 --> 14:37.840
that's right I mean people were were clearly more than capable of developing very sophisticated

14:38.400 --> 14:43.680
mathematical geometrical understandings in different ways to the way we do it now

14:44.720 --> 14:50.080
and the most famous I guess sort of discussion of this was the book in the 1960s by Claude

14:50.080 --> 14:54.720
Livestrasse where he tried to suggest that there are basically two different forms of science

14:55.520 --> 15:00.800
there's our notion of science which begins in the laboratory so you carve out an artificial

15:00.800 --> 15:07.360
environment and you have many codes or whatever you know trying to generate new ideas and theories

15:07.360 --> 15:12.000
which are then applied to the world and he contrasted that with the way that most human

15:12.000 --> 15:17.840
discovery throughout the history of our species has actually taken place which is a world of

15:17.840 --> 15:24.560
discovery in which there are no laboratories discovery is part and parcel of social life it's

15:24.560 --> 15:30.080
out there in the landscape in people's interactions with plants and animals it's applied from the

15:30.080 --> 15:37.760
beginning and that presumably is how all those early systems of navigation monumental construction

15:38.720 --> 15:44.240
metallurgy all of these things were discovered and generated through other systems of knowledge

15:44.240 --> 15:47.920
than the one that we're familiar with which is kind of intriguing in itself

15:48.560 --> 15:53.600
was Stonehenge built by people that engage in agriculture do we know that for a fact for instance

15:54.320 --> 15:59.360
that was the consensus until very recently but actually what we found out in

16:00.880 --> 16:06.800
in just the last sort of a couple of decades is that the picture is more interesting so Stonehenge

16:06.800 --> 16:13.200
by the time it's constructed about 5 000 years ago farming has already been adopted in the British

16:13.200 --> 16:20.480
Isles as an import from the European continent but then as in many other places of the world and

16:20.480 --> 16:24.480
again you know this goes back to your initial characterization of human history where you

16:24.480 --> 16:29.600
get agriculture and then everything changes the British Isles are one of many examples of where

16:29.600 --> 16:36.080
people adopt agriculture and then basically change their minds so the period when Stonehenge and

16:36.080 --> 16:42.640
many other great monuments constructed is actually one in which the populations of this island

16:43.680 --> 16:51.120
more or less give up the habit of cereal farming and they go back to foraging wild nuts and acorns

16:51.120 --> 16:55.600
and things as their staple plant food they decide to keep they hold on to other things so they hold

16:55.600 --> 17:03.280
on to the farming of animals pigs and cattle in particular there's a site close to Stonehenge

17:03.280 --> 17:10.000
called Durrington walls where they've actually found the place where people congregated for seasonal

17:10.560 --> 17:17.120
festivals and feasted on huge amounts of meat it must have been a hell of a party and this presumably

17:17.120 --> 17:23.520
was at the times when they were also engaging in these big coordinated construction activities

17:23.520 --> 17:28.720
that we see there so it's a more complex picture they're not farmers or hunter-gatherers they're

17:28.720 --> 17:37.600
some hybrid of like farmer forager herders or something so you're saying essentially it's a

17:37.600 --> 17:42.560
social choice that's being made it must have been i mean i can't imagine any other way in which people

17:42.560 --> 17:51.120
from you know one end of the country to the other turn their backs on a practice like cereal i mean

17:51.120 --> 17:55.680
how could that happen unconsciously there's no evidence of any sort of massive climatic

17:56.480 --> 18:02.240
rupture or depopulation it just seems to be people deciding that that's not actually what

18:02.240 --> 18:06.720
they want to do anymore that's quite that's quite an extraordinary political choice isn't i mean

18:06.720 --> 18:10.880
it is you know sort of analog to stonehenge is quite extraordinary i mean there must have

18:10.880 --> 18:15.760
been pretty extraordinary things going on for people to even engage in those kind of you know

18:15.760 --> 18:20.080
feats of construction but for a contemporary audience i mean the equivalent would be us

18:21.440 --> 18:25.120
deciding that the industrial revolution wasn't a good idea or just you know to stop using fossil

18:25.120 --> 18:31.600
fuels wouldn't it i mean yeah in terms of social implications obviously they weren't thinking in

18:31.600 --> 18:38.960
those terms but it's actually yeah and and it raises a question right which is if people have

18:38.960 --> 18:46.640
been able to make decisions on that scale in what we are taught to think of as primitive societies

18:47.840 --> 18:51.520
why do we struggle so much with those kinds of structural changes now

18:52.320 --> 18:57.920
which leads me on to i suppose the central question in the book for our audience which is a

18:57.920 --> 19:02.160
political audience there are obviously extraordinary political implications if

19:03.520 --> 19:08.960
the generic what you call stagest view of history is incorrect or inaccurate

19:10.800 --> 19:18.000
because this is the bedrock of most modern political theory from in different ways lock

19:18.000 --> 19:22.480
russo hobs we can talk about that in a second but also more contemporary people you know

19:22.480 --> 19:28.640
the steven pinkers the u val horaries because their essential formulation is

19:30.320 --> 19:35.440
the more complex society becomes the more unequal the more unjust but it creates it

19:35.440 --> 19:39.680
creates more abundance therefore there's a kind of utilitarian argument for it you know it's

19:40.560 --> 19:46.000
well you're talking you're talking about authors and books who sometimes explicitly model what

19:46.080 --> 19:52.960
they're doing on those philosophers of two or three hundred years ago you know people actually

19:52.960 --> 20:01.360
say i am a neo-hobsian nor a kind of neo-russoian take on human history which is interesting and

20:01.360 --> 20:06.160
it's something david and i noticed around the time when we decided to start thinking about

20:06.160 --> 20:11.680
these kinds of issues was pretty much exactly the time of the last big financial crash about

20:11.680 --> 20:17.200
two thousand and eight nine and you know there was a slew of literature as you might expect on

20:17.200 --> 20:22.880
inequality and the roots of inequality and suddenly a lot of those very old ideas you

20:22.880 --> 20:29.280
know going all the way back to the 17th 18th centuries really coming back in quite a surprisingly

20:29.280 --> 20:34.560
aggressive way you know let's think again about the deep roots of inequality let's go back to

20:34.560 --> 20:40.880
harps let's go back to russo which as you say you know we're talking about the the foundational

20:40.960 --> 20:46.160
texts of modern political theory but it's important to remember that they were completely

20:46.160 --> 20:53.680
speculative i mean they were conjured out of the imaginations of those people with no evidence

20:54.400 --> 21:00.240
tangibly whatsoever for the nature of human societies hundreds thousands of years ago

21:00.880 --> 21:08.880
so it's these are kind of imaginary worlds of prehistory which is quite a sobering thought

21:08.880 --> 21:12.640
you know the idea that modern political thought actually comes out of imagination

21:13.280 --> 21:18.080
and its imagination rooted in very specific political contexts you know leviathan was written

21:18.080 --> 21:23.920
what 1651 middle of the english civil war and it's partly about what is the nature of society

21:23.920 --> 21:30.480
without government and why is government necessary russo died what 10 years before the french

21:30.480 --> 21:35.280
revolution you know when he's addressing the question what are the origins of inequality it is

21:35.280 --> 21:41.280
the burning question of his time so these are entirely political you know they're exercises

21:41.280 --> 21:47.680
in political imagination which are obviously radical and generative at their time but why

21:47.680 --> 22:02.800
should we be still asking questions that were pertinent in 1754 in 2022 is i think an interesting

22:02.800 --> 22:07.600
question in itself when we've got all this other information all this other evidence you know why

22:07.600 --> 22:12.880
are we still asking the same questions in this slightly sort of sclerotic manner you are an

22:12.880 --> 22:17.680
academic you're at ucl i was at ucl as an undergraduate oh yeah i did some modules in

22:17.680 --> 22:25.520
political theories it goes and what are you taught you know introduction to political theory

22:25.600 --> 22:32.480
hobs lock playto robert not sick it's more contemporary political theorists

22:32.480 --> 22:39.040
generals but who these effectively are building their thinking on the early liberal tradition

22:39.040 --> 22:48.480
of lock on hobs and it's basically 101 why you should obey the state and like you say it's it's

22:49.600 --> 22:55.200
it's based on conjecture speculation which is several hundred years old and this is a modern

22:55.200 --> 23:01.200
institution in a very advanced western capitalist market economy where apparently we believe so

23:01.200 --> 23:07.200
deeply and passionately in empiricism and yet the very basis upon which we say political sort of

23:07.200 --> 23:15.360
political status quo is legitimate is nonsense frankly it's a good example of i think what is

23:15.920 --> 23:22.800
wrong with universities quite often because you know around the corner from where you were doing

23:22.800 --> 23:28.960
that would have been the place where i worked so we're talking about what the 19 i can't place you

23:28.960 --> 23:36.080
here and you're very ageless no no 2003 okay so around the corner from where you were learning

23:36.080 --> 23:40.880
about lock and rules and all the rest of it would have been the place where i work the

23:40.880 --> 23:44.880
institute of archaeology actually i think i probably was already just about teaching there

23:45.600 --> 23:50.400
around that time no sorry 2003 no god no thank god no i wasn't

23:53.440 --> 23:58.480
and yeah um you know just up the road from there you would have had all these people

23:58.480 --> 24:05.360
actually studying uh human prehistory but you know it's i guess it's unfortunately in the

24:05.360 --> 24:11.600
nature of universities to carve these things up into separate departments which don't actually

24:11.600 --> 24:18.640
generate that kind of learning where knowledge moves in what should be very obvious directions

24:18.640 --> 24:23.600
so well how does this stuff look now in light of what we actually know and what are the implications

24:23.600 --> 24:28.000
of that so i think it's highly unlikely that archaeology students would have been thinking about

24:28.720 --> 24:33.520
those philosophers whereas the students learning about those philosophers almost certainly wouldn't

24:33.520 --> 24:39.840
have been thinking about the evidence of deep human history and i think that is a that is a

24:39.840 --> 24:44.800
that is a problem i mean it's a lost learning opportunity effectively but isn't it a failure

24:44.800 --> 24:50.080
also the academics yeah totally absolutely 100 percent i mean it just strikes me as completely

24:50.080 --> 24:56.480
crazy that you know you have talented professionals treating teaching this frankly nonsense to young

24:56.480 --> 25:00.240
people but a really important subject you could teach you don't have to teach it as nonsense i mean

25:00.240 --> 25:06.800
you could see it as part of a tradition you know it is it is it is it is important to to study it

25:06.800 --> 25:11.680
but you know within the confines of what it is and actually you know when you look closely at these

25:11.680 --> 25:16.640
texts they're very openly speculative you know rousseau i think sort of spells it out somewhere

25:16.640 --> 25:22.640
when he's describing a story very similar to the one you started with about you know how agriculture

25:22.640 --> 25:27.920
trapped us in certain new ways of life and he mentioned a private property he says do not take

25:27.920 --> 25:34.400
this as history this is effectively a thought experiment and you know it's it's meant to make

25:34.400 --> 25:41.120
you reflect on what private property is and its place in the world and its effect on us as human

25:41.120 --> 25:48.480
beings the distinction of mine and vine if you like it's not meant to be a reconstruction so actually

25:48.480 --> 25:54.080
what's happened with some of the other modern authors you mentioned is also rather strange

25:54.080 --> 25:59.760
where you've got what began as sort of radical speculation is now presented as objective truth

26:00.560 --> 26:07.120
or even a sort of laws of history and that's what i think sort of provoked us you know david as an

26:07.120 --> 26:12.400
anthropologist me as an archaeologist to think hold on this isn't okay you know we should try

26:12.400 --> 26:18.240
and do something about this basically and that you know that kind of motivated us to um to start

26:18.240 --> 26:26.480
trying to liberate um some of this extraordinary body of knowledge from from these rather siloed

26:27.040 --> 26:33.360
context you know get it out from behind the paywall journals and start piecing together a puzzle which

26:33.440 --> 26:38.800
is still very incomplete of human history but there's already enough pieces there to say that

26:38.800 --> 26:44.640
it looks nothing like the stories that we've inherited from the Enlightenment. Let's talk

26:44.640 --> 26:50.560
about um indigenous american society um again there's a few more questions particularly around this

26:50.560 --> 26:57.680
which i i think are so impressive just the the source material that you cover in the book and

26:57.680 --> 27:03.120
things that i've just also learned in recent years again let's go back to um stereotypes

27:03.120 --> 27:08.800
and received wisdom the idea is that europeans discover the western hemisphere in 1492 will

27:08.800 --> 27:15.760
leave um leaf ericsson to one side and just came back from sweden actually more keen they

27:15.760 --> 27:18.720
they haven't forgotten they have no they haven't that's it's interesting it's interesting how they

27:18.720 --> 27:24.720
do really emphasize that isn't it the nordics um we discover effectively a backward civilization

27:24.800 --> 27:30.080
which we then broadly exterminate through a combination of guns germs and and steel um

27:31.440 --> 27:37.520
that's not quite right though is it no and i mean i've been very fortunate in the last

27:37.520 --> 27:44.640
year to be able once travel became possible again after the pandemic to spend some time

27:44.640 --> 27:51.360
in canada and in the u.s including talking with indigenous scholars and historians on various

27:51.360 --> 28:00.160
campuses um about this um and it's not there is a lot in the book i wrote with david about the

28:00.160 --> 28:08.320
pre-columbian americas um and about early colonial contacts between european colonizers

28:08.320 --> 28:15.840
and uh native peoples and um it's not an area that is actually you know particularly within

28:15.840 --> 28:21.280
either of our wheel houses you know david's field work as an anthropologist was in madagascar

28:22.400 --> 28:29.280
my uh phd and most of my field experiences in north africa in the middle east so this was a

28:29.280 --> 28:36.720
steep learning curve for us which i'm still very much on uh but it was necessary in order to answer

28:36.720 --> 28:42.800
the questions we were asking particularly about the origins of inequality which is how the the

28:42.880 --> 28:48.880
project started uh if you look at the literature around the middle of the 18th century take a

28:48.880 --> 28:55.200
figure like rousseau and the intellectual milieu in which they're debating the ideas they're thinking

28:55.200 --> 29:00.560
through you cannot avoid the americas and particularly that part of north america that's

29:00.560 --> 29:06.160
now split between canada and upstate new york basically the the great lakes region and what

29:06.160 --> 29:12.720
sometimes called the eastern woodlands which is where europeans uh encountered societies that were

29:12.720 --> 29:20.240
organized on radically different lines uh much more democratic lines uh with uh levels of freedom

29:20.240 --> 29:26.240
particularly for women which were unheard of in european societies at the time and which clearly

29:26.240 --> 29:32.960
had an enormous impact on the european imagination including on the political imagination and we

29:33.040 --> 29:39.280
found it was impossible really to understand what was going on you know when we were once we decided

29:39.280 --> 29:46.080
that we didn't want to uh fall into that trap of just recapitulating these questions and stories

29:46.080 --> 29:52.640
from hundreds of years ago we started asking well how did they come about in the first place and

29:53.200 --> 29:58.960
that does lead you down a certain line of questioning which leads to the americas and

29:58.960 --> 30:05.680
that's why the book ended up with such a strong focus there let's talk about candieronk a candieronk

30:05.680 --> 30:09.360
and maybe you've got a really good french accent i've no section some videos i'll watch for this

30:09.360 --> 30:18.800
um he is an actually existing figure it seems i definitely i mean you can if you want to google

30:18.800 --> 30:27.440
it you can see an image from 1701 of a treaty called the great piece of montreal and you can

30:27.440 --> 30:34.880
see candieronk's signature his mark on it so what's candieronk's importance who is he candieronk was

30:37.920 --> 30:48.400
very well known figure person of the here on wendat nation which is is very much still

30:49.680 --> 30:55.600
a thing it has its administrative center which i was lucky enough to be invited to

30:55.600 --> 31:01.120
on the outskirts of quebec city where they have a small street called candieronk

31:01.120 --> 31:07.440
arm celebre um so we were joking that maybe should extend it a bit now because he's he's um

31:08.240 --> 31:17.920
he is um a key sort of um individual in in our book um because we have various independent

31:17.920 --> 31:26.240
accounts of this person which tell us that uh in that time so we're talking about the the end of

31:26.240 --> 31:36.240
the 17th century this is someone who's playing a pivotal role um in diplomacy warfare and in

31:37.040 --> 31:44.240
trying to negotiate a better future for for his own people in the midst of a highly complex

31:44.240 --> 31:50.400
colonial situation with french english dutch colonizers and so on in the mix someone who was

31:50.400 --> 31:55.280
multilingual and who in addition to all of those qualities was clearly an extraordinary intellect

31:55.920 --> 32:04.560
and a brilliant speaker um and we have various independent accounts of this um but for reasons

32:04.560 --> 32:13.360
which are very contingent um some of those kinds of conversations and ideas that would have been

32:13.440 --> 32:18.880
exchanged between candieronk and european interlocutors at the time found their way

32:19.600 --> 32:29.440
to a much larger audience in europe we know that around that time the governor of what europeans

32:29.440 --> 32:35.120
then referred to as part of new france that part of the colonies would actually invite candieronk

32:35.840 --> 32:41.360
to his table to engage in debates purely for pleasure he says you know i did it to entertain

32:41.360 --> 32:49.040
my offices because this guy was just so funny and witty and they would debate many of the topics

32:49.040 --> 32:53.440
that would later become central to what we think of as enlightenment thought you know

32:54.080 --> 33:01.520
rationality versus revealed religion sexual habits marriage customs questions of freedom

33:02.960 --> 33:10.560
the role of money in society and in the mix of people who witnessed those conversations

33:10.560 --> 33:17.360
was a a minor french nobleman who went by the name la honte the baron la honte

33:18.240 --> 33:23.600
who is a person who went over to the colonies in his youth i think at the age of 17

33:24.960 --> 33:33.680
lived there for a decade spoke at least two uh indigenous languages um and was deeply embroiled

33:33.680 --> 33:39.280
in the goings on uh of of those tumultuous times it also seems to have been a bit of a

33:39.280 --> 33:44.400
troublemaker didn't get on with authority ended up getting kicked out of the colonies and found

33:44.400 --> 33:49.520
himself uh more or less penniless on the streets of amsterdam and he writes these books these sort

33:49.520 --> 33:59.040
of travel logs and finds his way back into favor at court um and one of those books is the one

33:59.040 --> 34:05.840
called curious dialogues with a savage of good sense who has traveled and it features these

34:05.840 --> 34:14.560
conversations between la honte playing himself and a character called adario who everyone

34:14.560 --> 34:23.680
accepts is based on kandirong and in these dialogues adario slash kandirong gives the most brilliant

34:23.680 --> 34:30.560
sort of scathing withering analysis of european civilization and this is the book that takes

34:30.560 --> 34:36.560
off like wildfire and inspires countless imitations it's it's a bestseller it's translated into

34:36.560 --> 34:44.480
multiple european languages uh stage plays which run for years are based on it and uh it becomes

34:44.480 --> 34:49.840
the foundation of a whole genre of such dialogues that almost every major enlightenment thinker

34:50.560 --> 34:55.120
had to go at so they will take the substance of the dialogues and put them in the mouth of some

34:55.120 --> 35:01.760
completely imaginary exotic you know other person maybe a tahitian or chinese or you know

35:01.760 --> 35:09.040
there are many different examples but the the context that it comes out of is is a real one

35:09.040 --> 35:16.400
of culture contact and exchange and the effects on european thought we would argue were explosive

35:17.200 --> 35:22.800
so kandirong in other words ought to be considered part of the story of what we call the enlightenment

35:22.800 --> 35:28.800
in the same way as voltaire dida and all the rest i mean importantly it proceeds all of them so

35:28.800 --> 35:32.480
and it proceeds them all by some decades so you have what you might call a sort of proto

35:32.480 --> 35:38.880
enlightenment salon before the appearance of the the famous salons in europe you call this the

35:38.880 --> 35:48.240
indigenous critique um which again reading it i was like it seems obvious in in in retrospect so

35:48.240 --> 35:52.400
for instance you know you have engagement between the americas and europe between 1500 and let's say

35:52.400 --> 36:00.960
you know the early 18th century 200 years there of of of cultural to and throw and clearly there

36:00.960 --> 36:04.480
would have been these kinds of dialogues and there would have been some transmission back to

36:04.480 --> 36:09.200
europe it may not have been as much as one would have hoped or have liked but it would have been

36:09.200 --> 36:16.480
significant we're talking about 200 years and yet that barely figures in our in our understanding of

36:17.280 --> 36:22.000
the exploitation and the colonization of the americas it's seen as purely one way in terms of ideas

36:22.000 --> 36:28.000
in terms of capital and humans um but what you say which i think is actually very empowering for

36:28.800 --> 36:33.680
for for peoples and ideas which aren't in the global north the most powerful countries is actually

36:33.680 --> 36:39.520
it went both ways and that you can actually situate an indigenous american or you know a whole

36:40.400 --> 36:46.240
sort of school of thought which is you know coming out of the americas within that european

36:46.240 --> 36:50.560
enlightenment which is just i think really powerful well isn't it isn't it actually earth

36:50.560 --> 36:57.200
shattered isn't it isn't it odd that we even have to make that point i mean you know what

36:57.200 --> 37:03.360
what's the other implication that these people were you know either living in in some utterly

37:03.360 --> 37:11.600
different uh sort of mode of reality um which cannot be entirely true given that we're talking

37:11.600 --> 37:19.120
about a period of trade and military alliances and you know very intense interaction um it's not

37:19.120 --> 37:24.080
controversial to point to the fact that europeans adopted a lot of material habits from the americas

37:24.080 --> 37:28.800
at that time many of which are actually linked to the habits of sitting around having those kind

37:28.800 --> 37:34.880
of intellectual conversations you know smoking tobacco from pipes drinking caffeinated beverages

37:35.680 --> 37:40.800
and yet there is a great resistance to the idea that along with those substances and material

37:40.800 --> 37:47.600
habits came ideas you know then you get real kickback and that's kind of interesting in itself

37:47.600 --> 37:54.000
because all we're trying to argue in a way is that ideas particularly about democracy and freedom

37:54.000 --> 38:01.360
which european enlightenment philosophers themselves attributed to the americas were actually

38:01.360 --> 38:08.240
theirs and i think there is something disempowering about the idea that notions of freedom

38:08.400 --> 38:15.360
um do not come from the oppressed or do not come from the colonized but there's something to do

38:16.240 --> 38:20.240
with ancient greece or you know somehow sort of rooted in europe actually in the soil of the

38:20.240 --> 38:28.160
colonizer i think that is disempowering um and there is something uh uh for those who haven't

38:28.160 --> 38:33.040
already realized this there is something emancipatory in understanding what perhaps should be obvious

38:33.040 --> 38:40.080
that actually ideas about um how to free oneself from oppression come from the oppressed

38:40.640 --> 38:45.920
let's talk about some particular places in the americas there's one place called cahokia

38:45.920 --> 38:50.560
yeah it was there not long ago about eight months ago so around a thousand years ago this place is

38:50.560 --> 38:55.360
the same size as as london so about a thousand ad it's got population in the tens of thousands

38:55.360 --> 39:02.640
you know ballpark it's a it gets up uh estimates are uh something like around perhaps 40 000 people

39:02.960 --> 39:08.320
at its height um around the 14th century yeah so maybe norwich or something you know it's a

39:08.320 --> 39:16.400
largest european city what happens to it um this is very interesting and a little bit controversial

39:16.400 --> 39:22.160
but what is clear is that having grown and extended i say i was walking around in this place with

39:22.160 --> 39:26.800
colleagues of mine including an archaeologist who's worked there all his life like about 30 years

39:26.800 --> 39:32.640
which was great because when you go there um there isn't a lot to explain to you what you're

39:33.440 --> 39:38.880
walking around there's this enormous mound called the monks mound there are many different

39:38.880 --> 39:44.480
earthworks and mounds there and this thing is huge um and it's in the middle of what is now

39:45.280 --> 39:50.480
a kind of national park that has a road running through the middle of it and you know this

39:50.480 --> 39:57.280
unfortunately has been the fate of many important uh indigenous heritage sites um in north america

39:58.240 --> 40:03.440
you may have a road running through it um you get very good mexican food and those little

40:03.440 --> 40:09.760
restaurants and things and you're actually standing in the middle of the largest uh pre-columbian

40:10.320 --> 40:17.440
city the largest uh indigenous settlement um in north america and it has these great monuments

40:17.440 --> 40:25.840
archaeologists have worked there over the years um it becomes uh uh the center of a whole regional

40:25.840 --> 40:32.080
system not probably an empire uh in the sense that we think about it but the influence culturally

40:32.080 --> 40:37.680
and politically of cahokia spreads on a really extraordinary scale throughout the mississippi

40:37.920 --> 40:47.680
base and um it's clear that certain things are going on there um which are predicated on

40:50.400 --> 40:55.600
various forms of hierarchy or inequality there's a mound which is is actually full of the bodies of

40:55.600 --> 41:00.640
young women who seem to have been ritually killed in in some kind of horrible ceremony

41:01.520 --> 41:08.240
um on the monks mound itself there there's an incredible uh ability to have surveillance over

41:08.240 --> 41:12.880
the whole settlement and we know that when the site centralizes the surrounding countryside sort of

41:12.880 --> 41:18.400
empties out you get these housing districts which would have all been visible from up there

41:18.400 --> 41:25.200
you get fortifications forming and it seems to be going in that kind of direction and then

41:25.200 --> 41:33.280
everything changes uh and the area is abandoned depopulated archaeologists for generations have

41:33.280 --> 41:42.160
referred to the whole region around cahokia as a sort of vacant quarter um and it appears to have been

41:46.480 --> 41:53.040
almost forgotten i guess to the extent that um we don't even know you know the name of this place

41:53.040 --> 41:59.360
the genuine name of this place it doesn't really feature in any clear way in later oral histories

42:00.080 --> 42:05.520
so people in some way or other turn their back on cahokia and there are various theories about

42:05.520 --> 42:13.440
this to do with environmental collapse um which are in my opinion not entirely compelling um

42:14.400 --> 42:18.960
and uh increasingly i think people are looking at this situation in the same way that they're

42:18.960 --> 42:25.840
beginning to look at the uh the so-called uh Puebla civilizations of the american southwest

42:26.720 --> 42:32.400
where again you have these um you know quite big centralized sites which are subsequently

42:32.400 --> 42:39.040
abandoned is that well why shouldn't we at least consider the possibility that people are genuinely

42:40.800 --> 42:46.880
walking away and deciding to create a different uh a different kind of social order different

42:46.880 --> 42:52.480
kind of social arrangements and actually when you start looking at it that way it enables you to

42:53.440 --> 42:59.600
join the dots or make a bit more sense of the kinds of societies that europeans did eventually

42:59.600 --> 43:07.120
encounter few centuries later in the same regions some of which were still very hierarchical like

43:07.120 --> 43:14.560
little mini cahokias but others had developed uh this highly egalitarian uh way of living

43:14.560 --> 43:18.960
which you know the natural assumption for europeans to make is that they just always been that way

43:21.360 --> 43:26.160
but of course we're talking about people with fully developed historical consciousness

43:26.160 --> 43:31.680
who do have in their own histories the history of cahokia and the whole regional system that

43:31.680 --> 43:36.880
it generated which goes almost as far north as the great lakes so there is a hierarchical past

43:36.880 --> 43:41.520
there that people have for one reason or another turned their backs on and created a different

43:41.520 --> 43:50.720
form of society um and uh that's something that we um we dwell on a bit in the book because it just

43:50.720 --> 43:56.320
you know it enables you to get past this idea um that we're talking about people who are somehow

43:56.320 --> 44:02.160
you know frozen in one pattern of culture uh or sort of have no history there's also this other

44:02.160 --> 44:08.080
great example of i'll get this right tia ti huakan which is i think that's very good but i'm told by

44:08.080 --> 44:15.520
my mexican colleague that um even mexican scholars don't always pronounce it quite there's

44:15.520 --> 44:23.120
teotihuacan which she tells me is better but you hear teotihuacan anyway i think we're okay i think

44:23.120 --> 44:29.120
we're fine yeah it's possible um so this is a city that in terms of its size scale magnificence at

44:29.120 --> 44:36.240
rivals rome um very centralized very authoritarian then then something changes and you sort of imply

44:36.240 --> 44:41.200
it's almost like a you know this is the paris commune in the sort of western hemisphere but

44:41.200 --> 44:47.200
potentially there's a big sort of political shift well the archaeologist who guy called rene milan

44:47.200 --> 44:54.720
who produced this extraordinary map of teotihuacan which we um were very fortunate to get permission

44:54.720 --> 45:02.000
to reproduce the map so you can see it in the dawn of everything and he um directed one of the most

45:02.080 --> 45:07.280
incredible ground surveys ever undertaken in the history of archaeology because we're talking about

45:08.160 --> 45:14.720
absolutely vast settlement which at its height uh around 300 ad would have had

45:15.680 --> 45:20.240
well conservative estimates say a hundred thousand people i've seen estimates that go up to double

45:20.240 --> 45:29.920
that big place and uh milan himself and some later scholars argued that there was a a turn

45:29.920 --> 45:36.240
around like a complete reversal of of fortunes for that population where it begins uh on a very

45:36.240 --> 45:41.040
hierarchical path you know if you go there today as a tourist or just google some pictures of the site

45:41.040 --> 45:45.520
you'll see the two great pyramids pyramid of the sun pyramid of the moon this other great

45:45.520 --> 45:51.040
structure called the temple of the feathered serpent um these are all later names that the

45:51.040 --> 45:56.640
aztec actually invented for teotihuacan we don't know what they were originally called so it begins

45:56.640 --> 46:01.040
in this very hierarchical way and again you've even got evidence for ritual killing and human

46:01.040 --> 46:06.000
sacrifice they buried the bodies of captives under the foundations of the pyramids it's quite

46:06.000 --> 46:10.560
disturbing the hands type behind their backs and they built these structures on top of them

46:11.760 --> 46:20.400
but then something changes uh around 300 ad 250 300 ad there is no more monumental construction on

46:20.400 --> 46:27.280
bat scale and all of the labor and resources that presumably went into building great temples

46:27.280 --> 46:33.760
and pyramids go into something else and that's something else is housing and they cover the

46:33.760 --> 46:45.360
entire settlement on a grid uh formation with beautiful housing apartments these are uh uh

46:45.360 --> 46:50.240
apartments which are low rise so we're going to go about apartment compounds we're not talking

46:50.240 --> 46:54.960
high rise we're talking something more like a villa with a number of a small number of

46:54.960 --> 47:00.800
nuclear families big central courtyard subfloor drainage gorgeous murals on the walls actually

47:00.800 --> 47:05.360
when archaeologists first started investigating those housing complexes they thought there were

47:05.360 --> 47:14.080
palaces then they realized that everybody in the city was living in a palace um now how we to

47:14.080 --> 47:22.560
conceptualize this we don't have any detailed written sources from the time archaeologists

47:22.560 --> 47:28.000
have tried in various ingenious ways to sort of reconstruct what was going on but what you can say

47:28.800 --> 47:35.840
is that people in that city from that point onwards had a really good standard of living

47:35.840 --> 47:42.000
and that it was generalized to you know the whole urban population which is pretty extraordinary

47:42.960 --> 47:47.920
and we know uh you know you talk about guns germs and steel if we skip ahead

47:48.560 --> 47:54.960
some centuries to the the beginning of the the spanish conquest when we do have

47:55.760 --> 48:04.320
eyewitness chronicles and accounts of the kind of cities that existed in that region

48:04.720 --> 48:12.960
uh from say um the 16th century onwards um there are a whole different range of them you know we

48:12.960 --> 48:18.720
tend to think about tenosh titlan and montezuma and sort of aztec empire and that it's all very

48:18.720 --> 48:25.840
hierarchical actually and we we go into this in the book the city where hernan courtes and the

48:25.840 --> 48:33.040
conquistadors make alliances that enable them to go and challenge the the might of the aztec empire

48:33.760 --> 48:42.560
is a city uh by the name of claskala which had a relationship to the aztec capital that was a

48:42.560 --> 48:46.960
bit like athens and sparta there's one's very hierarchical the other one's very democratic

48:47.520 --> 48:52.880
claskala clearly was a republic of some sort with its own parliament and we even have records

48:54.000 --> 49:00.480
in spanish um of the kind of debates uh that went on there and this just doesn't

49:00.480 --> 49:06.240
feature in our world histories you know we're quite rightly taught that the fall of tenosh titlan

49:06.240 --> 49:14.560
was uh in in a sense you know the beginning of um western global domination what we're not taught

49:14.560 --> 49:19.360
is that one of the things you know one of the steps on that pathway was this extraordinary

49:19.360 --> 49:26.960
encounter between uh european conquerors and an indigenous urban democracy of sorts and i've

49:26.960 --> 49:34.720
got no hesitation in calling it a democracy um at a time when uh you know cities run on that kind of

49:34.720 --> 49:42.880
basis were extremely unusual in europe itself and you know none of this is terribly sort of secret

49:42.880 --> 49:48.400
you don't have to delve very deep into the sources we've got the letters that courtes himself wrote

49:48.400 --> 49:53.680
back to the king of spain saying i found this place it's it's weird you know there's no king

49:53.680 --> 49:57.840
it's it's maybe a little bit like some of our florentine or venice you know it's run on some

49:57.840 --> 50:07.680
other principles all this stuff is out there um but um it really isn't given the prominence that

50:07.680 --> 50:12.960
you know you think it it probably ought to have i mean that sounds what you're describing in um

50:12.960 --> 50:17.280
and you know these are obviously people who have no connection whatsoever to the mediterranean

50:17.280 --> 50:23.760
you know ancient greece road yeah nothing to do with it there's an indigenous form of urban

50:23.760 --> 50:32.240
government what you're describing in teotihuacan um sounds like a revolution potentially or a

50:32.240 --> 50:40.000
social revolution yeah there are yeah absolutely and and there are um experts uh on on that site uh

50:40.000 --> 50:45.120
who have suggested that that may have been the kind of thing that took place there's no absolute

50:45.120 --> 50:50.240
consensus on it in the way that there's generally very little consensus in archaeology but i think

50:51.120 --> 50:56.160
everyone would accept that there is a profound transformation that takes place there and that's

50:56.160 --> 51:00.800
kind of fascinating because you know one of the things that we're told in the traditional narrative

51:00.800 --> 51:06.800
of human history is that once you have very large dense human populations and once hierarchy sets

51:06.800 --> 51:11.600
in in those kind of settings it is irreversible whereas here we seem to have a situation where

51:11.680 --> 51:18.480
there is a reversal yeah like you say in um in in in western political history people say though

51:18.480 --> 51:23.520
isn't a successful slave revolt until haiti for instance which is you know as far as we know is

51:23.520 --> 51:28.160
broadly correct but that may have not been the case in the america you make this great sort of

51:28.160 --> 51:33.520
rhetorical question in the book which is what we talk about the abolition of slavery um and of course

51:33.520 --> 51:38.400
we talk about the story of simonda bolivar and tucilla mature and the abolitionists and whatnot

51:39.280 --> 51:45.200
but perhaps it was abolished numerous times many times in history yeah i mean i think this is just

51:45.200 --> 51:51.200
sort of classic eurocentrism you know the idea that yeah maybe these things were happening elsewhere

51:51.200 --> 51:56.320
but they don't really happen until they happen in a european context i mean it's just a kind of

51:56.320 --> 52:02.560
sorting and filtering mechanism um which allows you to say that europe has some kind of monopoly

52:02.560 --> 52:08.720
on progressive politics which you know even if taken to an extreme length can become a justification

52:08.720 --> 52:16.080
for colonialism genocide and all the rest of it is say well at least we were bringing this kind of

52:16.880 --> 52:23.040
you know these sort of progressive concepts of democracy um which were completely lacking

52:23.040 --> 52:28.800
in all these other places so you know despite the fact that we decimated them ruined their

52:28.800 --> 52:34.080
landscapes and killed most of the people at least you know we sort of again you're back to stage

52:34.080 --> 52:38.880
theory at least we moved them on at least we got them out of that that that that kind of malaise

52:38.880 --> 52:43.200
that they were clearly stuck in will know you know one of the things we show in the book is that

52:43.200 --> 52:49.280
far from it you know there's a huge array of conscious political experimentation going on

52:49.280 --> 52:56.320
outside european contexts and we have evidence for your area of expertise is west asia northeast

52:56.320 --> 53:01.920
africa um although you're very lucid on the americas and elsewhere you had to research it for

53:01.920 --> 53:09.120
this ginormous 700 page book um what i want to talk about is you've got sites like gobekli tepe

53:09.120 --> 53:17.120
in um eastern turkey you've got these incredible megalithic sites in in malta this might sound

53:17.120 --> 53:22.560
strange questions it's not in the book is it possible that if cities precede agriculture

53:23.120 --> 53:29.360
that you have homo sapiens living alongside archaic humans potentially in urban environments

53:29.360 --> 53:33.040
because you know neanderthals are around until relatively recently in europe

53:35.600 --> 53:39.760
is it is it plausible that there were i mean permanent settlements that sort of see them

53:39.760 --> 53:43.440
featured together or is that just something that we can never even speculate on i wouldn't

53:43.440 --> 53:48.640
personally refer to gobekli tepe which is much later i mean there's no neanderthals around at

53:48.640 --> 53:59.360
that point so we're going back about to about 9 000 bc here in in the middle east and i wouldn't

53:59.360 --> 54:08.800
personally characterize gobekli tepe as a city i think we're dealing with a site which is clearly

54:08.800 --> 54:14.880
permanently settled but where you have periods when people are coming together and aggregating

54:15.440 --> 54:21.280
and coordinating their activities in very large numbers okay so i'll rephrase it yeah

54:22.880 --> 54:26.720
it's a built environment which is a permanent built environment yeah plausible that you had

54:26.720 --> 54:31.440
humans operating alongside archaic humans in those in those kinds of places well if we go back

54:31.440 --> 54:39.040
let's say a bit further a lot further like 50 000 years ago um we know at that point there are at

54:39.040 --> 54:45.920
least four probably five different species of humans around the planet there's us there's the

54:45.920 --> 54:51.840
neanderthals there's the denisovans there's home of floriansis in indonesia which are the little

54:51.840 --> 54:57.520
people sometimes playfully called hobbits um and there's also some more recent discoveries from

54:57.520 --> 55:02.560
luzon island in the philippines so this is a situation with no modern parallel when you've

55:02.560 --> 55:08.080
actually got different varieties of the human species interacting we know genetically that there

55:08.080 --> 55:13.680
was interaction of the closest possible kind there was reproduction across those species

55:13.680 --> 55:20.880
some of them um so yeah i mean and actually when you go back even further to the origins of our

55:20.880 --> 55:27.360
species the picture now looks rather like that so we're going back now to africa to the african

55:27.360 --> 55:32.400
continent where you know there used to be this idea of sort of mitochondrial eve and that there

55:32.400 --> 55:38.160
was one ancestral savannah environment where suddenly we became humans actually the modern

55:39.040 --> 55:44.480
fossil evidence and genetic evidence suggests that that's wrong and that actually we evolved

55:44.480 --> 55:51.360
on the african continent but in multiple different environments between about 500 000 200 000 years

55:51.360 --> 55:58.480
ago coastal environments forest environments and savannah environments and there were periods of

55:58.480 --> 56:04.560
isolation and periods of contact between ancestral human populations which could be very long so you

56:04.560 --> 56:09.680
actually get a huge amount of physical variation you see it in the fossil evidence and if you think

56:09.680 --> 56:16.080
about physical variation imagine what was going on with language or child rearing habits or social

56:16.080 --> 56:23.440
customs so again you know it flies in the face of this very entrenched philosophical habit of trying

56:23.440 --> 56:30.400
to reconstruct the original form of human society there wasn't one and just the panoply of experimentation

56:30.400 --> 56:34.640
and social forms which is kind of inconceivable to us but actually that's where we that's where

56:34.640 --> 56:41.120
we come from yeah we're a product of this um this kind of composite uh composite of different

56:41.120 --> 56:47.040
subspecies and different traditions and let's talk about pseudo archaeology if that's the right word

56:47.120 --> 56:53.040
there is such a word pseudo archaeology pseudo archaeology um and i i feel like particularly

56:53.040 --> 56:58.800
with the rise of the internet youtube it's probably increasingly something of an entry point for people

56:58.800 --> 57:04.320
who eventually end up in sort of more formal archaeology is not the right word archaeology

57:04.320 --> 57:08.160
proper i suppose there might that might be the gateway that then sends them to somebody like

57:08.160 --> 57:15.200
yourself maybe yeah it could well be why do you think pseudo archaeology is increasingly popular

57:15.200 --> 57:20.400
why isn't there there's clearly a there's clearly a desire for it in the cultural zeitgeist well

57:20.400 --> 57:24.720
let's be clear what we're talking about because i don't think it's immediately obvious to a lot of

57:24.720 --> 57:30.480
people what the difference would be between what you're calling pseudo archaeology and what people

57:30.480 --> 57:38.960
like me do and teach for a profession um pseudo archaeology i guess or at least my mental picture

57:38.960 --> 57:43.200
of what you're talking about is probably largely written by people who've never actually taken

57:43.200 --> 57:48.880
part in an archaeological field project or you know aren't actually engaged in producing any of

57:48.880 --> 57:58.560
the evidence that you and i have been talking about today but who for other reasons choose to present

57:58.560 --> 58:06.320
a reconstruction of the past which is often presented as rather mysterious or even conspiratorial

58:06.320 --> 58:13.680
as the people like me uh you know the reason we devote our adult lives to learning all these skills

58:13.680 --> 58:23.280
and teaching archaeology is because we want to cover up the truth okay um and that the truth

58:23.280 --> 58:29.600
is actually available to people who don't do that right who may have had entirely different

58:29.600 --> 58:34.160
career paths and you know i don't want to come off snobbish you know there's nothing wrong with

58:34.160 --> 58:39.760
people speculating and reaching their own conclusions but actually what is often presented

58:39.760 --> 58:47.280
as some great new revelation is actually just a very old rehashed obsolete theory that comes out

58:47.280 --> 58:52.560
of what was probably mainstream archaeology you know sometime in the early 19th century like you

58:52.560 --> 58:58.880
know lost city of atlantis that kind of thing there's nothing new about those ideas and you know as

58:58.880 --> 59:06.800
i hope comes across in our book and in our conversation the real evidence is fascinating

59:06.800 --> 59:12.880
and it's puzzling and it's challenging on its own terms you don't need to you know

59:15.680 --> 59:21.440
come up with confections and elaborations to make it interesting just try and get to grips

59:21.440 --> 59:27.520
with it is already challenging and stimulating enough without you know it's trying to surround it with

59:27.520 --> 59:34.800
some fabricated area of mystery it's always the way with conspiracy theories because you you you

59:34.800 --> 59:39.280
talk to somebody and they'll say oh this person is controlling this and it's this secret cabal of

59:39.280 --> 59:44.880
these people and look that there's a great deal of exploitation um in the world and yes the powerful

59:44.880 --> 59:48.960
regular system and in extraordinary ways which actually we can discern and understand you don't

59:48.960 --> 59:54.480
need to you don't need to be talking about the bilderberg group or i god knows what no but you

59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.080
know it's really important and i i do get a little bit irritated sometimes with colleagues of mine

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:06.160
in the way that they respond to what you've called pseudo archaeology um which is to say um you know

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:11.840
we're the scientists we know best and um if you believe any of that stuff you're just a lunatic

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:17.280
well i think i think that's um you know it's obviously true in a sense but you have to look

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:23.360
also at the history of our own disciplines um which again as we've been talking about are very

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:29.680
strange in the way that they will deny humanity and consciousness to whole populations and whole

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:35.440
groups of people you know when when europeans first saw those monuments at places like kahokia

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:40.000
they couldn't fathom you know the idea that native people would have constructed these things they

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.440
came up with all kinds of wacky theories about laferics or you know vikings coming over or or

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:52.000
you know whatever it may be lost tribes of the israelites and those sort of ideas were coming

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:58.720
out of what was then mainstream european scholarship you know in egypt where i've

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:06.000
done a lot of work on the the origins of ancient egyptian civilization the period before all of

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.920
that you know the pyramids and mummification all the famous stuff is what archaeologists call the

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.240
pre-dynastic i mean it's almost if you don't want people to be interested if you go to a

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:21.440
conference on the pre-dynastic they'll be talking about like you know we measure this kind of pottery

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.840
and it's slightly different from that kind of pottery and you know it's all a huge turnoff for

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:31.520
anyone who's trying to figure out what's actually going on and if you go even deeper you know where

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.800
i work at ucl where you studied you have the petri petri museum if you ever stuck your head in there

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:44.320
wonderful place which is now very openly engaged in looking at its own history and flinders petri

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:52.320
the archaeologist who it's named after was a eugenicist he believed that non europeans were

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:58.080
intellectually inferior and he was very into this whole business of phrenology and measuring people's

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:05.280
skulls and that sort of thing and he actually had a theory in the late 19th century that ancient

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:11.760
egyptian civilization could not have been created by africans and that there had been an invasion

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:18.160
of what he called the new race okay so we're talking about theories which are at least as wacky

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:23.520
there's the kind of stuff that you'll see on netflix now but they're coming from within our

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:31.200
disciplines and it's easy frankly to you know empirically refute those kinds of theories about

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:36.640
some lost race of people from atlantis or whatever but i think that's only half the battle we also

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:45.280
have to introspect a bit and ask the more difficult questions about how did those spaces open up in

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:52.560
the first place in which that kind of theory is able to gain traction and i do think a lot of that

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:59.680
does have to do basically with racism and the idea that people long ago on different continents

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:06.880
could possibly have been as intelligent and creative as us albeit in different ways you know if you

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:12.320
have a mental block with that i think you have to ask yourself but there are more ambiguous

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.480
examples of this aren't there so you know there's there's people out there who say that the sphinx

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:23.040
is significantly older than the pyramids it's still constructed by people in egypt you know not by a

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:28.720
sort of race of aliens and that actually we're really wrong and it's thousands of years older

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.160
than we presently think would you call that a conspiracy theory no it's a completely legitimate

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.920
line of questioning um it just happens i think not to really lead anywhere terribly interesting i

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:44.160
mean there are ways of investigating that sort of thing and you would also have to put it in the

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.960
context of what we do know about what was going on before the pyramids and the construction of the

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:56.000
sphinx in the fourth dynasty which is fascinating in its own right you know i mean i've been to

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.640
a place called umel kab which is in the south of egypt which is where you have the earliest royal

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:08.880
cemetery what's sometimes called egypt's first dynasty and it is fascinating and you've actually

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:13.840
got a very disturbing phenomenon there that we talk about in the dawn of everything which is the

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:20.720
burials of the earliest egyptian kings and queens there's these great sort of holes in the ground

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:27.280
with all these elaborate staircases and furnishings completely surrounded by smaller

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:33.200
sort of cubicles where other people were buried and i'm talking about hundreds maybe even thousands

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:40.480
of other people who it is generally thought by archaeologists were ritually killed in order

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:47.520
to be buried around the tombs and it's not just people actually one of the earliest egyptian kings

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:57.280
goes by the name which we can read in early hieroglyphs amusingly his name is aha and it's

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:05.760
transcribed into english as aha and aha's tomb actually has not only human beings in pits

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:10.960
there's also like three lions buried in it nothing to do with the england football team

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:16.160
and you know that isn't that fascinating enough you know let's try and get our heads around what's

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:21.280
going on there which we do in chapter 10 or something of the dawn of everything let's talk

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.000
about that that's kind of intriguing you know why does the beginning of what we call the ancient

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.680
state involve this extraordinary carefully orchestrated violence against people and

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:39.280
you know the sphinx has no place in that context let's but we can reconstruct something of what

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:44.960
was going on and it's perfectly interesting in its own right but i suppose a pseudo archaeologist

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:51.600
respond to you they'd say well this civilization is older than the first dynasty perhaps they could

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.120
say that it's a lost civilization again we know actually quite a lot about what's going on it's

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:02.960
actually one of the things i wrote my phd about is it's the fourth millennium bc so that long

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:07.920
period that's referred to as pre-dynastic because if all they were trying to do was build dynasties

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:14.240
we actually know quite a lot about what was going on in those periods and you can go and see it i mean

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:20.080
go to a museum go to the the british museum go to the ashmolean museum in oxford it's fascinating

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:24.960
stuff you know they had these beautiful artistic styles this is one of the things i wrote about in

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:30.960
my phd actually you know we all get obsessed with the monuments the sphinx the pyramids what you see

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:36.960
if you focus on ordinary people and particularly their burials because we have a lot of evidence for

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.720
how people were treated in funerary rituals egypt is incredible in that sense that you can trace the

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:48.960
evolution of a ritual it's a funerary ritual you can trace its evolution over thousands of years

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:54.720
we know how people were buried and what you see is kind of fascinating in the build-up to the time of

01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:01.440
the the first dynasties and the first pharaohs and pyramids people lose a lot of the capacity to

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:06.320
conduct their own rituals so you start off with a situation where almost anyone can be buried like

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:11.600
a prince or a princess with sort of gorgeous elaborate ornamentation and very individualized

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:20.880
pottery and beautiful cosmetic articles and with the rise of the kingship and the pharaonic state

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:27.520
people seem to lose a lot of that kind of aesthetic control over their own lives and no longer able

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.840
to conduct their own rituals which is kind of fascinating you see something similar with the

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:38.080
rise of the inca empire where we do again have you know spanish colonial accounts and descriptions

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:45.520
of what's going on where in order to perform an important ritual like a marriage or a funeral

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:54.080
or to honor your ancestors you need certain resources you need bread and beer what's called

01:07:54.080 --> 01:08:01.040
chicha in order to just perform the ritual and do the right thing but of course not everyone

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:05.840
can get their hands on those resources in the same way that in egyptian funerary rituals at a

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:11.840
certain point you have to have bread and beer but to have bread and beer you know you have to have

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:19.760
access to estates where cereals are farmed and you have plough agriculture so people who can't

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:26.400
actually look after their families in a cultural sense i'm not talking about biological survival

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:33.840
but you know who can't actually complete their their necessary social rituals begin falling into

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:41.040
debt uh relations of debt um or we'll go and we'll have to go to extraordinary lengths and make

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:47.920
sacrifices just to be able to do that and that seems to be a big part of what creates hierarchies

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:55.840
and systems of dependencies is people either abdicating or somehow losing control um over

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:02.640
over their own um yeah their own sort of basic uh basic kind of life rituals or life cycles

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:08.960
what future projects do you have lined up i'm involved with various um sort of side projects

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:17.520
at the moment i don't find the time right now to do uh much research in depth so i'm actually

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.800
involved with projects which are not strictly writing projects but just trying to keep myself

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:30.640
you know moving on a bit so i'm involved with a new collaboration with a group that you might

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:36.560
have heard of called forensic architecture based at goldsmith's college that's an interesting one

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:43.600
because they do mostly human rights work um and they use architectural theory and principles

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:50.400
modeling to go to court over a whole range of different issues from uh deforestation in the

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:56.160
amazon they did the mark dougin case and top them uh extrajudicial killings those archaeologists

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:01.200
architects architects architects forensic architects now i have that forensic architecture

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:12.000
eyal weizmann his amazing team um so he came to uh an event a big event in germany in berlin

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.480
about the dawn of everything which was called uh the civilizations frage the civilization

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:26.000
questions big three-day event and the the curator of that invited eyal who gave a presentation

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.040
that just sort of blew me away and when we got back to london he's based here you know we just

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.400
sort of went out for coffee and we had the most incredible conversation of you know his take on

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.720
the book it's all very much through the lens of what they do and at first i couldn't really see

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.680
the connection because the scales are obviously radical different but he read our book as a kind

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:51.120
of extended case study in forensic architecture in the sense that it's an anti-state narrative

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.840
where as in some of the cases i've mentioned you know you can't always prove definitively

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:03.040
the other version of events like the non-police version or the non-official version but you

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.880
can just poke enough holes and cast enough doubts on the official narrative so that it

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:16.240
starts to wobble doesn't stand up in court in the court of judgment in our case um and in the

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:22.160
process of making it wobble you open up other possibilities for speculation and i thought

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:26.240
well this is intriguing you know it's right i mean what it's describing is a very similar kind of

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:34.720
logic to our book um so we decided to collaborate on something so we're trying an experiment i can't

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:39.360
say too much about it right now but i'll be able to say more about it early in the new year and it's

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:47.200
going to focus on these incredible archaeological sites in ukraine in ukraine you have cities going

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:53.680
back as early as the earliest ones that we know of in mesopotamia in what's now iraq and parts of

01:11:53.680 --> 01:12:00.480
syria so we're going back around six thousand years ago you have these huge cities that present no

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:08.960
evidence of centralization not in political or economic terms and there is a big debate about

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:14.400
whether they should or should not be referred to as cities or rather as something else like

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:20.800
overgrown villages or megasites you know you get lots of sort of euphemistic terms being used and

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:29.280
essentially what it makes you do is reflect on what we mean by a city um and what are the assumptions

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:36.640
that are baked into that so we're going to produce a kind of installation which models these rival

01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:42.560
accounts and debates doesn't necessarily try to prove one version but which visually kind

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:48.240
of immerses you in the questions if that makes sense so that's one project i'm doing uh i've

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:54.240
also been talking i mean one of the things that's really um just been kind of overwhelming about

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:59.760
the the response to the dawn of everything is the creative response and i'm not talking particularly

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:07.680
about um people writing or you know academic writing or even essays but musicians uh artists

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:16.160
filmmakers i was just the other week with a uh a fantastic singer and artist she's based in Paris

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:24.640
Yasmine Dubois her stage name is La Fonda and um she wrote a song called the dawn of everything

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.840
and she came here to London and performed it uh you know a few weeks back at the uh the festival

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:35.680
hall they had the women life freedom event for human rights in Iran and she performed it there

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:41.280
and i was very upset actually i was just getting back from Chicago and couldn't quite get through

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:47.920
my jet lag to actually physically make it but we met up afterwards and um you know that kind of thing

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:59.600
is um it's incredible you know to me and i think it's a huge tribute to David you know to my late

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:07.360
co-author uh i think he had that incredible capacity to take some of these rather obscure

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:13.360
topics and concepts and write about them in a way that touched people and made it personal

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:20.160
and made them want to engage and and create and in a way i see it all as a kind of extended

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:27.280
tribute to him which i've just been a lucky sort of passenger final question just on David if that's

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:36.080
possible um David Graeber was your co-author on this book he tweeted in 2020 i believe how

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:42.320
he'd finished the manuscript that's right yeah he put out a sort of faux jim Morrison quote yeah

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:47.520
my brain is bruised with no surprise we finished something like that yeah and then he passed away

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.880
a month later yeah about three weeks three weeks after we finished the manuscript so what's it been

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:58.560
like to publish a globally best-selling book i mean it's been it's been translated into multiple

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.160
languages you've worked on it for a decade alongside somebody yeah and then they're not there to share

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:14.160
in the success yeah um well you know you have to kind of i have to sort of pinch myself in two

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.840
senses there's there's the kind of good pinching yourself that the the reception is so extraordinary

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:25.440
and you know suggested to me recently by someone who's apparently got some figures that we're you

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:30.480
know getting up to a million copies worldwide which is just can't really get your head around it

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.360
but then there's also the other kind of pinching yourself which is very painful which is you know

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:41.200
just constantly having to accept that david's not around to witness any of it um and he was

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:47.280
really looking forward to it i mean this book he couldn't wait to get out there and have these kinds

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.560
of conversations should have been the two of us really sitting here having fun with with you shooting

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:58.720
the breeze about all this stuff so it's very painful and very paradoxical and the only thing

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:04.160
that i can really hold on to in the middle of it all is that he would definitely want me to be out

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.760
there working hard talking about the book telling people about the book and just trying to get the

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:16.880
work across uh as well as i'm capable of so you're doing it partly for him as well when you go that

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:25.680
extra mile yeah yeah 100 yeah david wengrow thanks for joining us my pleasure thank you
