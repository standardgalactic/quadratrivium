0	6940	We will need each other, and we, you know, I do believe that every, you know, victory
6940	16780	for the fascist right is also a story of division, sectarianism, failure to make strategic alliances
16780	20720	on the anti-fascist left, and we're on the, we are on the knife edge, we are just on the
20720	21720	knife edge.
21720	28960	We can't afford to destroy each other.
28960	33800	When we were all locked down and isolating, conspiracy theorists went on the march.
33800	40200	The emergence of anti-vaccine scaremongering coupled with virulent antisemitism was disconcerting
40200	42000	for all of us.
42000	48040	But it was even more nuts for Naomi Klein, journalist and author of The Shock Doctrine,
48040	54400	who found herself constantly getting mixed up with Naomi Wolfe, another author and academic.
54400	60120	Naomi found herself being drawn into a strange mirror world as she tracked her doppelganger's
60120	66840	journey from feminist, academic and liberal darling to gun-toting anti-vaxxer, palling
66840	69840	around with Steve Bannon.
69840	76240	What was it about COVID that strengthened the far right and how did all of us create doppelgangers
76240	78360	of ourselves online?
78360	83520	Stay tuned to find out as I talk to Naomi Klein for Downstream.
83520	89000	So when did it stop being funny that you were being confused for Naomi Wolfe?
89000	95360	I mean, I still find it funny sometimes to be honest, especially because it still happens.
95360	101560	In fact, I was doing a TV interview in the States last week and the host had to do a
101560	102560	retake.
102560	103560	No.
103560	104560	And he didn't realize that he'd done it.
104560	108200	And I was like, you have to stop now and redo that because you just called me Naomi Wolfe.
108200	110800	Oh my God, you should have kept it in.
110840	113040	I'm not going to name him, but he knows who he is.
115320	122000	Yeah, I think, I mean, to be honest, it's always been a little cringy, you know, starting
122000	126360	from the very beginning, you know, I start the book with this story about being at Occupy
126360	135320	Wall Street and being in a public loo and hearing a couple of demonstrators talking
135320	139960	about an article that Naomi Klein had written and, oh my God, she doesn't understand our
140000	141640	demands or our movement.
141640	143240	And obviously that was lower stakes.
143240	145880	I mean, that was, they were talking about an article by Naomi Wolfe.
145880	151720	Did you call from inside the store like, sorry, you've got the wrong?
151720	158600	No, I mean, I froze, you know, like flashbacks to high school, mean girls, like, what have
158600	159600	I written?
159600	160600	You know?
160600	164720	And then as I listened more, I recognized the article that they were discussing and knew
164720	166080	that I had not written it.
166080	171400	And so I just very casually came out and made eye contact in the mirror and said, I think
171400	173040	you're talking about Naomi Wolfe.
173040	178720	Words I have had to say many times since then, so that was 2011.
178720	184240	But even then, I mean, it was funny and I would entertain my friends, you know, overdrinks
184240	190160	with these sorts of stories, they couldn't get enough of it.
190160	196280	But I mean, I would also get, you know, I'm going to be talking to Andrew Marr later today.
196280	200200	And I'm going to remind him that the last time he interviewed me, it was on the BBC
200200	202680	and he referred to me as Naomi Campbell.
202680	203680	Naomi Campbell.
203680	206560	I was like, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
206560	210960	You broke so many barriers in fashion, you know.
210960	214800	That one is harder because then I feel like, you know, the audience is really quite disappointed
214800	215800	when I come out, you know.
215800	217960	How do you feel about your feud with tower banks?
218760	220480	Yeah, the whole blood diamond thing.
220480	225200	Yeah, you really, I mean, in hindsight, except for most blood diamonds, really poor form
225200	226680	for the author of No Logo.
226680	229800	So there's something about the name Naomi that people do have trouble with.
229800	230800	But no.
230800	237160	So I mean, even back to Occupy Wall Street, it was, the stakes were lower, but it still
237160	242400	bothered me just for sort of niche reasons because that particular context, she had written
242400	248320	an article where just, you know, if you, I'm sure you remember from Occupy Wall Street,
248320	255400	there was a very, you know, there was a decision not to have a list of demands that politicians
255400	257400	could just meet and everyone would go home.
257400	260960	It was much, you know, it had a deeper critique of the system than that.
260960	265120	And what Wolf had done in the article that they were upset about was claim that she had
265120	270440	divined the demands of Occupy Wall Street and she came up with a list based, yes, based
270440	275920	on a random assortment of online communications that she'd had.
275920	280880	So even though that was like pretty low stakes, for me, it was quite a cringe because I do
280880	284680	try to be pretty careful not to do that sort of thing.
284680	288880	I mean, it was one of the things that really struck me about the book, which is that one
288880	295080	of the early chapters, when you're talking about being mixed up for Naomi Wolf.
295080	301960	Do you sort of really strive to talk about the rigor of your journalistic work and the
301960	308400	depth of the research and the scrutiny that you apply to your own writing?
308400	312920	Do you feel a bit defensive about this mix up and that you feel that you've got to put
312920	315320	all this distance between the two of you?
315320	319600	Well, I mean, if anything, I think I've put less distance between the two of us.
319600	324440	Like I've probably cemented the connection forever, I'll never be able to escape it.
324440	331400	And I do think that it is important to make a distinction between what investigative journalism
331400	338560	does, what rigorous research is, how we make sure that we don't go to press with speculation.
338560	341960	Because honestly, I think a lot of people are confused about that.
341960	348600	And part of what she does, and she's just a case study of a broader movement, which is
348600	350280	this conspiracy culture.
350280	354000	And I don't call it conspiracy theory because there really isn't a coherent theory.
354000	356840	It's just jumping around.
356840	359360	She's more of a conspiracy influencer than she is a theorist.
359360	365120	I don't think it's really fair to theory to call her a theorist because the theories
365120	367840	are constantly contradicting each other, right?
367840	374120	One minute COVID is a bio weapon cooked up by the Chinese to depopulate the West and
374120	378080	the next minute it's nothing, don't worry about it, don't even put on a mask.
378080	383360	So like you presumably would have to choose, yeah, between the two.
384360	390640	But there is something about the fact that there are people who consume these things interchangeably,
390640	391640	right?
391640	396960	And I describe this as a doppelganger of journalism because it uses a bunch of the conventions,
396960	402480	breaking scoop, like, I've got the papers, smoking gun, all of this.
402480	407760	But because it's within the attention economy and the need to be first out of the gate to
407760	412560	get the clicks to get the cloud, you leap over all the guardrails.
412560	418200	So yeah, I spend some time in the book just sort of explaining what we try to do and whether
418200	423480	it's investigative journalism or academic research to check our facts based on the idea
423480	425480	that facts don't matter.
425480	430800	But it isn't so much about me putting distance between her because it's a doppelganger.
430800	434640	And doppelganger books are, you know, you have to see yourself in the mirror of your
434640	437080	doppelganger or you have failed.
437080	439680	Do you ever wonder who the mad woman in the attic is?
439680	441280	Like is it her or is it me?
441280	442280	Absolutely.
442760	446200	There's been uncomfortable winces of recognition throughout this journey.
446760	456120	I mean, the moment when Naomi Wolfe is on BBC Radio and her book Outrageous just gets a
456680	458680	tractor driven through it.
458680	465240	So it turns out that she made this reading error and it meant that what was supposed to
465240	468440	be spectacular revelation was exactly wrong.
469320	476840	I felt such a pang of empathy when that happened because I thought, oh, my God, that could be
476840	478040	me one day.
478040	484440	And it was this horrible fear of seeing something that you've always had nightmares about
484440	486200	happening to someone else.
486200	492280	And then you want to put distance between them and you by going, how could you be so
492280	492600	stupid?
492600	494040	How could this happen to you?
494040	498680	I mean, did you ever have those moments of like empathetic recognition with her where
498680	500360	you go, oh, God, that could have been me.
501000	502760	I mean, it's every writer's worst nightmare.
506520	510520	I mean, it's a little hard for me to just feel straight empathy because a lot of people
510520	513080	thought it was me who made that mistake.
513080	518920	So like, you know, I only found out that it happened because my feed was filled with people
518920	521480	going thoughts and prayers to Naomi.
522440	524120	I was like, oh, no, what has she done now?
524120	529000	And I'm always having to kind of reverse engineer whatever the scandal is based on.
529000	534440	People either literally thinking it's me or sort of sending mock sympathy.
536840	542600	But, you know, I like, as you know, in the book, I have a little maybe a little sort
542600	551400	of half-jokey equation about not only her, but many figures who who, you know, we've
552040	555560	many of us have had conversations like, whatever happened to that person, I thought,
555560	556600	I thought I knew who they were.
556600	558040	I thought I could trust them.
558040	563720	And now suddenly they're palling around with Tucker Carlson or Elon Musk or, you know,
563720	565480	whatever happened to Phil in the blanks.
567240	575880	And so I had this equation that might not be perfect for every person, but it is narcissism,
576360	581960	bracket grandiosity times social media addiction, which you and I have discussed.
583640	585560	I don't want that mirror being held up to me.
585560	587080	I don't want to see the faces in this.
587080	589960	Plus midlife crisis, which you don't have to worry about for a while.
589960	590680	I got 10 years.
592040	596120	Divided by public shaming equals right wing meltdown.
596120	602680	So I think that that, you know, I think that she should have been held accountable for those
602920	606440	for those major errors in outrageous.
606440	611880	And in general, book publishing, you know, doesn't fact check as much as they should.
611880	619240	I always, you know, I'm lucky to be one of the few writers who can afford to pay my own
619240	623240	fact checkers, but I pay my fact checkers out of out of my book advance, you know,
623240	628280	I pay my research assistants and then a whole separate process of going back over every single
628280	633800	fact because, because my first book made me a target, right?
633800	635560	I couldn't afford it for my first book.
636920	640840	But after that book, I, you know, I've, I've, I've had the fear of God
641400	646360	to not be in that situation where, where a reporter discovers that you have a huge
646360	649400	error in the middle of your book and the whole thing gets discredited.
650280	654200	So, but so I think accountability is good.
654200	660200	But what happened after that was just a disgusting pile on online where people were,
660200	665880	I mean, I think as you say, like putting that distance between them and her,
667000	672680	because everybody, it's everybody's worst nightmare and just having a lot of fun
673240	676680	shaming her and turning her into a spectacle.
676680	680920	And I think that that probably nudged her a little bit in the direction.
680920	684360	I mean, and I think she should be held accountable for these terrible decisions
684360	687400	she's made to align herself with some of the most dangerous men on the planet.
688920	693080	But, you know, I don't think it's great that people, you know, are so cruel to each other
693080	695240	online. That's my radical position today.
695240	699640	I mean, you're talking about the word accountability in some ways it's easier
699640	704360	to talk about accountability for Naomi Wolfe because she's this individual and we've seen
704840	709080	this descent into fact free conspiracism.
709080	715720	But the responsibility for cruelty online is a lot more diffuse and we can more easily dodge it.
715720	724920	Yeah. And, you know, the reason why I thought this might be a fun idea for a book and it got
724920	731080	less fun, you know, there's I have a quote early on in the book from Philip Roth about
731080	738120	from his really quite wonderful doppelganger novel Operation Shylock, which is about Philip Roth,
738680	743320	a character called Philip Roth who has a doppelganger called Philip Roth creating all kinds of mayhem.
743320	749560	And he says it's it's it's too ridiculous to take seriously and too serious to be ridiculous.
750120	754680	And when I started this, it was more on the ridiculous side of the ledger.
754680	759400	And then as things went on and she got closer and closer to Steve Bannon started
760360	765240	engaging in election denial, started taking pictures of herself with her guns, started
765240	771400	taking posting pictures of her new one, not so new anymore, but her husband is a
771400	777800	private detective slash mercenary who likes to post pictures of himself doing target practice
777800	783480	and so on. So it's gotten more serious than ridiculous just because it is part of a broader
783560	787800	fascist surge globally. So, yeah.
789080	796520	So you talked about that that seriousness and that kind of quite scary descent into fascism.
798840	804200	How can you stop people laughing? You know, when does when does the comedy stop and the sense of
804200	810120	urgency kick in? Well, you know, this is why I think that that sentence is really resonant,
810120	814920	because I feel like people have that same feeling about Trump a lot of the time, or at least they
814920	819640	did before where it was just like unclear and Boris Johnson and Duterte. I mean, these sort of
819640	826520	buffoonish figures. Berlusconi, I think was the. Oh, absolutely. The original, you know.
826520	832040	Bolsonaro is the only one who's not at all funny. I know. I mean, he is funny in that he just kept
832040	838680	getting COVID. That was it was like sideshow Bob stepping on the rakes. Like it wasn't a comedy
838680	845880	of his making. It was kind of God's comedy. Exactly. But he didn't seem to be playing
845880	852200	playing up the character. But yeah, I think, yeah, at what point do we stop? I think we're still
852200	859560	trying to figure out how to how to respond to the weight of our historical moment and,
860200	866920	frankly, failing most days, right? I think there are flashes. I don't know about you where I feel
866920	876040	like, okay, we're we're getting close to touching just how consequential the decisions we're making
876040	883640	are in these in these in these years of, you know, climate breakdown, surging, fascism,
884200	892440	border violence, just oligarchic concentration of I mean, wealth, it's a lot. It's a lot. And so
893400	899240	I mean, this, I think the through line of the book and the reason why I thought that doppelganger
900200	904440	doubles like the book, the through line of the book is less her than it is the way in which we
904440	912280	create doubles of ourselves. And our groups, you know, respond to each other in these in these
912280	918440	sorts of mirror world ways, we react to one another rather than behave based on legible
918440	924360	principles a lot of the time. And my analysis is that all of it is about not looking at what we
924360	929400	need to look at, right? That that, you know, the third section of the book is called the Shadowlands.
929400	934040	And I think that, you know, whether we're staring into our phones looking at our digital doubles,
934040	938600	you know, the way we create these little doppelgangers of ourselves to represent us,
939720	945400	which is, you know, why I thought it was interesting that I lost control over my digital
945400	951080	identity during COVID. And I thought, well, this is an interesting way in, you know, or the way we
951080	958680	sort of project all that we want to distance ourselves from onto the other as if we are the
958680	965080	ones who are really, you know, married to truth and facts and, you know, facing the weight of our
965080	969240	moment when we all know that we are distracting ourselves endlessly and looking away endlessly.
969240	974840	And, you know, it's, you know, there's more than one way to look away. Conspiracy culture
974840	979960	plays that role for a lot of people. It's, you know, just a decision to divorce from
979960	984280	any recognizable shared reality and just make up your own facts, make up your own reality. But,
985160	990280	you know. I mean, one of the things that I was reflecting on as I was reading this book was
991160	996680	my own career in the media, because when I started out, I was always paired up against
996680	1004520	really old white guys. And that allowed me to have a sort of brand identity as young,
1004520	1010840	female, brown, left wing, disruptor. Oh my God, what is she going to do next? And then over time,
1010840	1016600	I started getting partnered with young, right wing women of color. So it was like they were
1016600	1024040	putting me up against my own Wario. And I then suddenly felt the sense of nausea where I was
1024040	1031480	like, have I contributed to creating this category of right wing talking head where they want the
1031480	1039880	one of color to play against type? And I've participated in the commodification of identity
1039880	1045800	to the extent that it becomes very powerful for the right. I mean, I felt quite kind of,
1045800	1050520	you know, disoriented by it. And I guess I was wondering, when you're looking at your
1051080	1055320	conspiratorial doppelganger, do you ever feel this little sense of responsibility going,
1055320	1060760	did I make this in some way? Like it's not just a mirror, did I create this mirror somehow?
1063640	1069880	You know, I think it is always worth interrogating, right? And looking at, you know, and sometimes
1069880	1077400	those winces can be really productive, because it pushes you to think about what is it that you're
1077400	1084840	doing and what, you know, what parts of it are most important to you, right? And if it's an easy
1084840	1089800	to doppelgang part of you, then you might want to lean into some of the other, because you aren't
1089800	1096280	just playing an identity game. You know, that's not the way I perceive your role in the media.
1098040	1103640	You're making arguments, and you're representing a set of values and beliefs. And
1104600	1110760	they can doppelgang your identity. But, you know, I think it's a lot harder to do that when you're,
1112360	1115640	you know, when you're making arguments that are genuine, challenged power.
1116280	1124120	And so I did interrogate, you know, it wasn't only Wolf who was doing a kind of fact, like,
1124120	1129640	you know, describing the book as a kind of fact-free remix of the shock doctrine specifically.
1130200	1134760	And here I'm not saying it was deliberate, but there was a way in which, I mean, I still,
1135400	1145240	like, every tour stop, every time I log on, I hear people who are furious that I
1146280	1151000	wrote the shock doctrine and have failed to recognize that the vaccines are the biggest
1151000	1155800	shock doctrine in world history, not for the reasons that I believe they are, because there
1155800	1160680	should never have been patents, and this was an opportunity for massive illegitimate enrichment,
1160680	1164280	and we should have, you know, they should have never been patented in the first place,
1164280	1169640	but because they were violating bodily sovereignty, and, you know, they believe that there has been
1169640	1177160	a genocide that has been covered up by the quote-unquote elites. There's some graffiti near my house,
1177160	1183160	where it says anti-vaxxer, and then next to it, I love my sperm, and then like a big picture of
1183160	1191000	sperm, and I was like... Yeah, so that's the shock doctrine I missed. Yeah, you're really low on
1191000	1197640	sperm, you really... But no, I think I did feel that, you know, when I started to hear people
1197640	1206040	using the shock doctrine to sell, you know, what I considered to be largely made-up theories about
1206120	1216200	how public health measures were an attempt by the CCP and Fauci and Gates to bring in
1216840	1221160	Chinese social credit, or whatever it was. I mean, the great reset, all of that.
1222920	1226760	Like, to be clear, I think there have been real examples of what I would call the shock doctrine
1226760	1230920	in disaster capitalism under cover of COVID. I'm very concerned about them. The NHS has been
1230920	1235000	attacked, you know, under cover of COVID. I live in Canada, the same thing has happened to our
1235000	1241000	public health care system. A lot of the attacks on the schools about COVID measures are really
1241000	1245000	just attacks on public schools by the same people who always attack public schools under cover of
1245000	1252760	emergency. But there is this kind of doppelganger of the shock doctrine out there, and I think for
1252760	1258360	a while it made me less willing to talk about that, because I couldn't figure out how to talk about
1258360	1264200	the shock doctrine, how to talk about my concerns about Bill Gates, which were not fantastical,
1264280	1270280	but very provable about what he was doing, providing cover for the drug companies to keep
1270280	1277880	their patents in place, and so on. Because it was just getting all, it was just a swirl of Bill Gates
1277880	1285960	tracking, you know, implants. And, you know, I was just getting like the algorithms were
1285960	1291480	starting to confuse me with Wolf. And I was just like, we're just a mess of Naomi is talking about
1291480	1298520	Bill Gates. So, but I think the worst thing you can do is let that doppelganger experience
1299640	1307800	silence you. You know, I regret not talking more about the patents during this period.
1309160	1318840	I regret any way in which the left has ceded territory to the fake populist right by not going
1318840	1324840	after corporate power and not making the connections with the logics of capitalism,
1326120	1331000	because that's just such a gift to the Steve Bannon's of the world who just suck it all up,
1331000	1336760	or Giorgio Malone, and then twist it and turn it into transphobia and xenophobia,
1336760	1341880	and, you know, an incredibly malevolent agenda. I mean, is there a way to sort of
1342680	1349640	reclaim the integrity of left-wing ideas without it being about insisting on your
1349640	1353400	intellectual property rights? Because the strength of the left has always come from the
1353400	1359160	dissemination of ideas in a very open way. The communist manifesto was meant to be passed
1359160	1365000	hand to hand from worker to worker. And then, you know, in some ways, shock doctrine being
1365800	1371640	appropriated by conspiracy theorists is testament to its success and its its meaning and its
1371640	1376520	power as an idea. So how do you how do you navigate that as someone who's on the left?
1377320	1384120	I mean, I agree. I mean, I think the left should be taking popular education as seriously as,
1384120	1389960	you know, it originally was with the original pamphleteers and the idea of
1390600	1395880	doing this kind of popular education in part because the alternative was conspiracy theory,
1395880	1402680	right? I mean, I have a section in the book that looks at anti-Semitism as the socialism of fools
1402680	1408760	and, you know, in part, you know, looks at the history of Marxist thought as in part being
1409400	1414280	a history of a whole bunch of Jews banging their head against the brick wall of history,
1415080	1421400	saying it's not the Jews that are the result of your pain or causing your pain, but it's
1421400	1430360	actually this system. So I don't think we should any of us should embrace our ideas being distorted
1430360	1436360	and turned into like a warped mirror of themselves. But is there a way to do that without going,
1436360	1441080	it's mine, like this is my idea? I don't think it's about intellectual property. I think it's
1441080	1448920	about having a robust left that is doing system analysis. And, you know, and I think that when
1448920	1458600	that doesn't happen, conspiracy culture swirls because the center isn't holding, because there's
1458600	1467240	so much suffering and because all of the promises that capitalism has made about the meritocracy
1467240	1470760	and if you work hard, you're going to succeed and you'll be able to climb this ladder,
1471320	1477240	it's falling apart and people know that. And our education system doesn't explain what capitalism
1477240	1483720	is. It says it's all about sunshine and big max and freedom and getting the rewards that you
1483720	1488760	deserve. And so when the system fails, people are really, really vulnerable to somebody pulling
1488760	1495880	them aside and going, it's actually the Jews, or it's actually the CCP or it's this meeting
1495880	1504040	once a year. And so the need for that robust system analysis is urgent because I think it's the only
1504040	1510680	force that can drain power from this surging authoritarianism. You know, if they were just
1510680	1516840	taking the ideas and putting them to good use, then fine. Yes, always. It doesn't matter if you
1516840	1521800	get credit or not, you want them to disseminate. The problem is this, you know, I listened to
1521800	1527480	hundreds of hours of Steve Bannon to do, to write this book, unfortunately, and the most chilling
1527480	1532680	moments were when I was when I would hear him sounding like what the left used to sound like
1532680	1538280	and doesn't really sound like anymore because there is not as much of a anti-corporate left as
1538280	1542440	there used to be, let alone an anti-capitalist left. It's much more partisan and reactive.
1543320	1548520	It's part of the appeal of the likes of Steve Bannon and the very reactionary authoritarian
1548520	1553960	right is that they're saying, here's how to live and it will make you a better person, a stronger
1553960	1559000	person, a smarter person, a more worthy person. Whereas the left, we've retreated a lot into like,
1559000	1563240	you do what you want to do, except there is no you do what you want to do because if you
1563240	1568440	are perceived in the wrong way, particularly online, people jump down your throat.
1568440	1575880	Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, Bannon is different than some of the other people who are more like,
1575880	1580600	this is how to live. Like, he's less of a lifestyle guy. Like, he's not Jordan Peterson or...
1580600	1583000	I don't think anyone goes, how do I get the Steve Bannon look?
1583000	1588440	Exactly. No, he is more of an organizer. I mean, he is the guy who is organizing,
1588680	1594200	the takeover of your local Republican Party, your local school board, get those books banned.
1595400	1600440	He's very deliberately building a political coalition that he calls MAGA Plus, which is,
1601640	1607960	the plus is women who they haven't been able to really lock down enough to win the last couple
1607960	1616520	of elections. And so, in the same way that he peeled away some democratic voting working class
1616520	1621640	guys who were pissed off about having voted for Democrats three, four times, who promised that
1621640	1627000	they were going to renegotiate trade deals and then voted for Trump because he said he was going
1627000	1630600	to do it. And it wasn't the only reason why people voted for Trump, but it doesn't need to be that
1630600	1636520	many people who you peel away with these messages. He now sees that opportunity with who he calls
1636520	1644200	the warrior moms. So, it's interesting because I definitely think that there is an appeal around,
1645160	1649320	I'm going to help you learn how to live that certain people are offering on the right.
1650760	1655720	But I think with Bannon, what he's offering is a political program. He's offering a plan.
1656280	1663800	It's an activist space. His slogan is action, action, action. And he doesn't, he refers to
1663800	1669320	his listeners as the war room posse. And he makes them feel like they're not just listening or
1669320	1676040	watching, they are part of his army. But it's that thing which is, I want David from accounts to
1676040	1682440	feel like Ajax the conqueror. And maybe it is difficult to draw the line between political
1682440	1690600	organizing, lapping and entertainment. Andrew Tate, there's a Andrew Tate group chat called
1690600	1695880	the war room, which is again, very similar trying to say like, we're going to build you up and empower
1695960	1700280	you if you just do these things. Yeah. And I think that this is where
1701480	1709160	the left is at something of a disadvantage because it takes more time and it's more complicated to
1709160	1715320	build the kind of mass power that has any kind of chance of standing up to the sort of consolidated
1715320	1721320	wealth that we're talking about. Whereas Bannon is perfectly happy to just have a plan to get back
1721400	1727560	into the White House. And so there is a plan and it is take over politics at every level,
1728760	1737080	peel off part of your opposition by using all of this COVID residual anger and pivoting it
1737080	1742760	in the way that we've been talking about. So what is the left plan? Like, I mean, we can
1742760	1748200	diagnose, we can do systems analysis, but that's just going to make people feel helpless for the
1748200	1754040	most part because then they're going to better understand that as an individual, there's nothing
1754040	1762920	that they can do. They can only stand up to these systems in mass collective action. If there is a
1762920	1768360	conspiracy and there's just five guys who are responsible for all of the suffering in the world,
1768360	1774040	then like the bumper sticker says, make the Nuremberg code great again. Let's bring them up on
1774040	1780680	war crimes trials. I mean, that's part of their plan is a sort of a fantasy of justice. That's
1780680	1785320	also at the heart of QAnon is like there's going to be a great storm and all of the bad people
1785320	1789320	are going to get arrested and they're going to be brought up on charges and there will be
1789320	1795160	justice because we will replace them with the good people. The observation that January 6th
1795160	1802520	was people dressing up and storming the capital. It was like a sort of Comic-Con element of it
1802520	1811240	as well. You get to live this fantasy for a day, except it's real. Yeah. This is the Bannon playbook.
1812040	1821880	He wants people to inhabit their avatars and so many of these figures are very, very skilled from
1821880	1827240	the world of entertainment and reality television. Bannon has worked in Hollywood. He's worked in
1827240	1833160	video games. Trump obviously, reality television, Tate as well, former reality show star.
1834520	1839960	The only one who doesn't really have this history is Peterson. Joe Rogan also, former reality show.
1839960	1842840	Didn't he voice come at the frog? What? Didn't he voice come at the frog?
1844520	1850600	He's the only one who's just a natural at this. I always feel as a Canadian, I need to apologize
1850600	1855960	when I'm abroad. If I stop all this for everybody out there, we'd be here all day.
1859240	1865240	The left proposition is not just we're out here making a better argument about what is really
1865240	1873640	driving mass misery. We also have to connect that analysis with a credible organizing strategy
1874200	1879800	that shatters the sense that there's nothing you can do about these huge systems because it's a
1879800	1887800	hell of a lot easier to take on a cabal than it is to take on a system. That's why, if anything
1887800	1894840	has made me feel a little bit optimistic in recent days, it's been the UAW going out on strike,
1896280	1902600	the United Auto Workers in the States and the fact that there's a great new leader of that union,
1902600	1909800	Sean Fain, who was an insurgent candidate. He's on the news because he's taken on the big three
1909800	1917800	automakers and he's doing real left populism. He is saying these companies have recorded record
1917800	1922520	profits and they've given themselves massive wages and our workers haven't been able to keep up with
1922520	1929880	the cost of living increases and we're going to get them. Just having somebody out there who has
1929880	1936600	a clear left analysis and a plan about what to do about it, we are going to disrupt your assembly
1936600	1941640	lines. I feel like it makes the bannons of the world sort of shrivel up and die because they are
1941640	1949560	not died, but they can only sell the counterfeit if the real thing is an on offer or even in the
1949560	1958600	public sphere. When words and action momentarily are married in these moments of mass worker action
1958680	1963720	or the debt collective or tenant organizing or any of the ways that people are finding collective
1963720	1969800	power, that's going to do more to drain the power of right wing conspiracy culture than an army of
1969800	1976040	fact checkers and content moderators. I was thinking about one of the advantages that the
1976040	1983320	right has, which is they've got this screen-based ecosystem, whether it's YouTube or accounts on
1983320	1989560	Twitter, where they're bringing together a community and making it lonelier all the time.
1989560	1996600	So I was reminded of that bit where Anthony says of Cleopatra, she makes hungry where most she
1996600	2002200	satisfies. So it's satisfying this need for social connection because it's not the real thing,
2002200	2008440	you're getting hungry and hungry all the time. How does the left draw a balance between contesting
2008440	2018120	these spaces in a legacy media or social media ecology, but also just being in flesh space
2018120	2023960	where we can touch each other and make eye contact and engage with each other as human beings and not
2023960	2031320	digital avatars? That quote is so interesting because I feel like back to my first book,
2031320	2038840	No Logo, which I wrote before the explosion of personal branding and some of the things that
2038840	2047640	I revisit here, a lot of what I did in that book was track the way in which the first mega lifestyle
2047640	2055000	brands like Nike and Apple and Starbucks were co-opting revolutionary rhetoric, putting Martin
2055080	2064760	Luther King on Apple ads. Yes, this is for your time. It was weird. There was all of this
2064760	2069160	unease, all of the iconography of the 1960s, the anti-Vietnam War movement was suddenly a
2069160	2080360	Nike ad and Gandhi was from the grave shilling for Apple. On the one hand, you could say,
2080440	2085320	nothing means anything anymore, but that wasn't my feeling. My feeling was like in the 90s where
2085320	2089960	we had been told that nobody liked left ideas. I thought it was really exciting that these
2089960	2095240	companies with all of their market research had found that what people actually wanted was revolution
2095240	2098840	and obviously they weren't going to get it from their running shoes or their laptops,
2098840	2105240	so there would be that constant hunger cycle that you're using much more literary references for.
2106200	2111960	But so for capitalism, that's great because you'll just have to keep shopping. You'll get
2111960	2116520	like a little hit and then you'll crash again and you'll have to shop again in order to get
2116520	2121400	that feeling. I hate myself for the way in which I instinctively scroll through clothing when I
2121400	2125560	feel sad and it makes me feel worse and like, why am I doing this? It's just like my classic
2125560	2133960	depression activities. Yeah, exactly. Horrible. Well, and it's helpful to just be aware that
2133960	2140680	you're doing it because you're sad or you're doing it because you're insecure and that people shop
2140680	2147400	one of the times when you have the highest spike in consumption is when people are becoming
2147400	2152520	parents for the first time because they're panicked and they don't have people who
2152520	2156520	will help them figure out how to be parents anymore because if we don't live in communities,
2156520	2161960	we tend to be isolated and so you just think, if I were to just get this $1,000 bouncy chair,
2161960	2168040	everything would be fine. But I remember that from when I just, I mean, never have I been more of a
2168760	2172120	consumer drone than in those days. I mean, was it a fear that like bypassed your
2172120	2176280	and critical awareness of the thing you were doing? It was just... Well, it was really useful
2176280	2182280	to me to see that statistic, like that this is the time when consumption is higher than at any
2182280	2185880	point in our lives and not just because you need a whole bunch of new things. It's because
2186680	2190760	it's well beyond what you need and it's just fear. Yeah, it's just fear.
2191960	2195480	I know it keeps it in check a little bit. It doesn't keep it completely in check, obviously,
2196120	2200200	but it's still helpful to know. I mean, you were talking about the
2201960	2206040	symbols of revolution, language of revolution being co-opted. Yeah, let's come back to that.
2206040	2211400	90s capitalism. I didn't know that Nike had used Martin Luther King, but the thing...
2211400	2216760	Apple used Martin Luther King and Nike used a whole bunch of Vietnam War anthems.
2216760	2221000	Oh my God. Because then the thing that it made me think of was in this very direct way,
2221000	2226360	Nike revealing that it partnered with Colin Kaepernick all that time when he was being black
2226360	2231480	listed by the NFL. Because I remember the conversations going on at that time, which
2231480	2235320	for lots of people on the anti-racist level, lots of black people was a feeling of like,
2235320	2240520	well, at least someone's standing with us during this time because also this queasiness of going,
2241160	2245640	but you're doing it to sell your shoes. I mean, how did you make sense of moments like that?
2246200	2250040	Yeah. I mean, I was teaching a course at the time, so it was helpful. I was teaching a course
2250040	2254120	called the Corporate Self, an undergraduate course, so we were sort of processing all of that
2254120	2259320	Nike ads in real time. I mean, it's interesting because it's not unlike the people's reaction
2259320	2265560	to the Barbie movie, right? I don't know. Where it's like, oh, wow, all these feminist critiques
2265560	2268440	are in here and they keep talking about patriarchy, but ultimately...
2269480	2278360	I thought it, I really fucking hated the self-consciously woke dialogue. There's this
2278360	2282120	one moment where the teenage girl was like, white savior Barbie, and I was like, it's like they took
2282120	2289640	Tumblr from 2015 and chicken upside down all over the script. It was just so focus-grouped
2289640	2295000	and calculated to get everybody. Turned me off. It really turned me off.
2296600	2307240	And ultimately, just to be a boring lefty eco-feminist, it is an advertisement. It's an
2307240	2315800	extraordinarily historically good advertisement for a plastic doll. And even if you love the movie,
2315800	2323320	maybe especially if you love the movie, you should know that that will lead to materially,
2323320	2333240	this selling of many, many, many more plastic dolls. And so its success is a huge failure for
2333240	2339560	the earth. But at any rate, we were talking about them doing their market research for us
2340520	2345960	and the co-optation. Well, so yeah, I think you can get really down about the ways that
2345960	2350840	these ideas are being co-opted by the right, or you can be like, wow, these really are popular
2350840	2359960	ideas. We should be making more of them. And that the, you know, one of the things that's been,
2359960	2365080	I think, nice for me about the last few weeks of touring, I've been in the U.S. touring with the
2365080	2373720	book, just got here to the U.K. There haven't been that many posts, well, we're not post pandemic,
2373720	2380280	but since the beginning of the pandemic, there haven't been that many spaces for people to
2380280	2386760	gather as leftists collectively. And one of the things that's been helpful to name is the
2386760	2393480	particular experience that a lot of us had of going from the highs of the Bernie Sanders campaign
2394440	2401720	to lockdown, Biden, you know, Democratic Party rallying and just that, like the combination
2401720	2409640	of that extreme political disappointment and being isolated from each other, so not being able to
2410440	2416520	process it, re-strategize, think about what we want to do next. And instead, in that isolation
2416520	2420840	and in our disappointment, a lot of what we did was just attack each other. And sort of,
2420840	2427000	you know, I write in the book, we went from this, you know, this surfing this wave of not me, us,
2427000	2435000	and this kind of real joy of kind of a release from individualism and ego. I mean, that was what
2435000	2443240	was so powerful about being on the road with Bernie was, you know, the slogan, not me, us.
2445320	2449560	Originally, I think a lot of people just thought it was Bernie saying, this is not about me, this
2449560	2455160	is about us. But when you were out on the campaign, it took on this whole other life and meaning,
2455720	2461560	which was much more about, you know, what what Astro Taylor talks about with the debt collective,
2461560	2466600	where with something like medical debt or student debt, it's this private shame that people are
2466600	2474440	carrying. And it's just all me in the sense of my fault and my burden. But when you meet lots of
2474440	2481560	other people who are who have that same burden, you find it us and that us has power, like you
2481560	2486440	organize into a debtors union, then you're a problem for the creditors. And if you and in the
2486440	2492520	same way that when workers organize their problem for their bosses. So to go from those highs,
2492520	2497560	you know, of, you know, being in Las Vegas when Bernie won the strip, which was like,
2498200	2503240	I mean, I'm just, it was the happiest moment of my political life just because it's Vegas,
2503240	2508200	right? And it's shiny and gold and Trump. I mean, was it one of the moments of politics where you
2508200	2513320	feel like the boundaries of the self dissolve a bit? And it's like, well, just absolutely yes,
2513320	2518280	because you've got the nurses and you've got teachers and you have just so many different
2518280	2526360	movements coming together and just reaching towards each other. And and then the coinciding
2526360	2532360	of lockdown, I mean, we were so vividly remember being on my couch, I was still living in the
2532360	2539160	States at the time, and, and watching the whole Democratic Party just coalesce around Biden.
2539880	2546280	And, and then almost instantly, the Bernie movement just fractured and everybody started
2546280	2551880	starting their own podcasts and attacking each other. And hey, not too much about podcasts.
2553080	2558840	Listen, I mean, I got a cat to feed, right? But it was, you know, we were, we were sudden,
2558840	2563160	we went from not me, us to just being dropped in this ocean of me, me, me, me, me. And that's all
2563160	2567720	we knew how to do. And it was just heartbreaking. I really, I really want to talk about this,
2567720	2573000	because I think it's something where I feel, again, really personally conflicted about my own work,
2573000	2580600	because Novara came out of the student movement, we all met through occupying our university,
2580600	2587160	which was UCL, or, you know, the plate glass windows of Milbank, which was the Tory party HQ
2587160	2592120	being smashed. That was cool. That was my first year of university. And I just remember it was
2592120	2596680	me and my friend who were like, in Milbank. And she's, she looks like me. She's like my
2596680	2601320	doppelganger, but blonde and Irish, like we're just like same height, same face, but like two
2601320	2607000	different colorways. Like that was how we all met. And that was where the organization came from.
2607720	2613480	And we've always felt like we're part of a movement movement, but journalism is different
2613480	2617240	from being a propagandist for the movement. And there are all kinds of tensions
2617880	2625880	that come with it. And I think that I often bulk at the constraints of what I feel are
2625880	2630440	unfair expectations from parasocial relationships where I'm like, why is someone on Twitter yelling
2630440	2635240	at me like they know me or like they own me? But the fact is, is that it's not unreasonable to have
2635720	2640680	political expectations or editorial expectations of someone whose
2642520	2646760	public career is the result of coming from this movement. So I was wondering like,
2646760	2652120	how do you navigate that the sort of, you know, the rigors and the demands of journalism,
2652120	2657960	that you've got to go where the facts are leading you, the fact you've got political aims,
2657960	2661400	the fact that you want to think critically and independently, but you also want to be
2661480	2665000	accountable to people. How do you square all of these circles?
2665000	2670760	Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think there's a lot going on there. You know, I think left media should not
2670760	2678120	be propaganda. And we, you know, I like coming back to what we were talking about earlier about
2678120	2684120	facts do matter, research does matter. It's part of the reason why I always hated the idea that
2684680	2688760	you have are supposed to be a brand. Because what I know about being a brand is that
2689560	2696680	you repeat yourself endlessly. If you're a good brand, you've identified your core meaning and
2696680	2701800	you're just repeating and reinforcing. And you have message discipline, which is pretty much
2701800	2706680	the opposite of being a good journalist, a good investigator, which requires that you
2706680	2711640	follow your research wherever it leads. You have to be able to be changed by what you're learning.
2712520	2716760	And so I think these projects are really antithetical. That doesn't mean that you
2716760	2721880	don't have like an image in the world, but branding is a very particular thing. Branding is
2721880	2727080	chasing your own tail at infinitum. And that might be okay to sell running shoes, but it really is
2727080	2732840	not a good model for being a public intellectual or a journalist. And I think we should push back
2732840	2736440	on it. And I think also part of the cruelty that we've been talking about online is that
2737400	2741720	there's a cost to performing a thing version of yourself, which is what it means to be a brand.
2742440	2748200	You're out there saying, this is thing me. This is commodity version of me. People will believe
2748200	2752760	you and they will think that they can throw very hard things at you and that you won't bleed
2753480	2759080	because things don't bleed. And so I don't think we quite believe each other are real online.
2761240	2765240	And that's a problem. It's not the only reason why people are cruel. They're also racist. They're
2765240	2774680	also misogynist. But I think there is also this factor that is driving it. So we should try to
2774680	2780280	dething ourselves if we can. I mean, just to play devil's advocate on the difference between a
2781400	2787080	journalist and a propagandist, I was talking about this with my partner. And one of the things that
2787080	2791000	he was saying is, well, doesn't this keep you locked into very bourgeois norms? So if you say,
2791000	2794760	well, this is what a journalist does. And there are certain things that journalists does,
2794760	2800600	which cannot be subordinated to your political aims. Doesn't that make you a worse communist?
2800600	2804680	Doesn't this make you a worse socialist? Doesn't this make you worse at bringing
2805320	2811880	the world you want to see into existence? I think you need to be transparent about what
2811880	2814920	values you're holding yourself to, what standards you're holding yourself to.
2818280	2823480	And I don't think you do subscribe to the idea that you're objective, that you don't have politics.
2823480	2827880	No, you wear your politics on your sleeve, you're in it because you want to change the world.
2829080	2834280	But you're still accountable for what you say, and you're still going to hold yourself to standards
2834280	2840600	of accuracy and truth and probing. And why? Why does that matter? You also have to say why that
2840600	2847320	matters and why it makes for stronger movements and why movements always have strong movements,
2847320	2853800	always have powerful art, powerful journalism. It's an ecosystem, and this is a piece of the
2853800	2858200	ecosystem. I think where we get into trouble is when the rest of the ecosystem is not healthy.
2862120	2867800	I'm interested in the history of what Navarra came out of, of the movements Navarra came out of.
2867800	2876200	I probably became aware of you around the Corbyn movement and saw you as a kind of
2876200	2880920	the media arm of the Corbyn project. Maybe that's wrong, but that's the way I saw you.
2880920	2887960	Not that you were propagandist, I know it's always a little tinge, but you also have to be able to
2887960	2892680	do critique because if movements can't do critique and that it's going to be through the media,
2892680	2896920	that's how we're going to hear each other, then you're just going to keep making the same mistakes
2896920	2906040	over and over again. But what I'm describing around the burning moment, all of those podcasts
2906040	2912280	were relatively healthy when there was a political project that was healthy. It was when the political
2912280	2918680	project collapsed that it just seemed like the left was a bunch of podcasts. And I don't think
2918680	2924600	that that is a left. And I think that if people are, they're always going to be cruel online,
2924600	2931960	but I think these parasocial relationships take on an overinflated and unhealthy role
2931960	2936600	when they're subbing in for collective organizing that isn't in a healthy state.
2937480	2944920	And is that happening here? Well, I think that since the demise of the Corbyn movement, and
2944920	2952680	again, it was straight from Corbyn into lockdown and that was a grim six months. It was really
2952680	2961800	like a bereavement because not only was this central force of your life gone, you're also being
2961880	2966520	piled on with humiliation by everyone crowing and saying they were right about you all along.
2966520	2969960	And then you were separate from your comrades because you couldn't see each other and you could
2969960	2976680	only communicate online. Like it was a very grim time. And I think that just anecdotally,
2976680	2980680	there are lots of people trying different things and there's kind of like embryonic
2980680	2985800	experimentation going on. But certainly, I think with with Navarra, it is this
2986360	2994120	ongoing discussion about what does it mean to be a socialist media outlet, which takes
2994120	2999000	journalistic standards very seriously and take socialism very seriously. And there are conflicts
2999000	3005320	there, there are tensions there. But the more robust the socialist project is outside of Navarra,
3005320	3011880	I think that the clear your role is going to be. It's just it's when it isn't clear that there
3015960	3023800	you said it. I mean, I kind of want to talk a little bit about this thing of turning
3024840	3031640	oneself into a brand because we all do it. We all do it now that social media exists. Anyone who
3031640	3039560	has Instagram or TikTok or Twitter is doing brand them to some extent. What does it mean for
3040280	3047080	the left to be contesting so much of its politics through these digital avatars? I mean,
3047080	3050360	you know, one is that it stops people seeing each other as human beings. But what does it do
3050360	3057080	to the politics? Yeah, I don't think it's been great. I mean, in general, understatement of
3057080	3062920	the century. And I do want to say that these these political campaigns that we've both referenced,
3062920	3075320	I think that we should we should strive for more in terms of I think we should
3076200	3083160	expect from these political campaigns that when there are losses, they're not just abruptly
3083160	3091800	end and they're not be a process for trying to hold on to all of that organizing energy and to
3091800	3096200	think strategically about what the next stage was. I mean, I was a Bernie surrogate and
3098200	3101960	you know, I think there was like one email that we all got that was just like
3109960	3115000	I mean, I love the guy. I'm not blaming him. But you know, social relations have never been
3115000	3120360	his strength. But you know, I think we you know, if we are going to ask people to go all in for
3120360	3125960	these campaigns and these moments when we sent some opening, you know, they're not all going to win.
3125960	3131880	Most of them are going to fail. And there should be a strategy for holding that space so that we
3131880	3138600	don't all turn on each other afterwards. But the the branding piece of it and this is, you know,
3138600	3143240	a big part of the reason why I wanted to come back to these themes. And it's something that I talk
3143240	3149080	about with a lot of my comrades in the movement about the way the logic of personal branding
3149080	3155000	and even collective branding, because it isn't just the individual brands. It's also the movement
3155000	3165960	as brand that I think is part of why we've had these like peaks, peak peaks and big valleys where
3165960	3172200	it seems like everybody is talking about whatever the thing is. And and we have, you know, historic
3172200	3175560	numbers of people on the streets, you know, whether we're talking about climate strikes,
3175560	3180520	Black Lives Matter, me too, you know, it just seems like everybody is with the program. And then
3182680	3187880	and then and then the crash and then the internal divisions. And part of it, you know,
3187880	3193000	Keyanga Amada Taylor, who I quote in the book of Fairbitt is a, you know, wonderful colleague and
3193000	3199640	friend. She's written a fair bit about how why movements need more democracy so that it isn't
3199640	3205720	just, you know, I think it's important that we have ways of talking about this that deep
3205720	3210440	personalize it. I think people are trying to build movements with really inadequate tools.
3211080	3217480	And so we're on these corporate platforms and people get, you know, lifted up to leadership
3217480	3225560	positions because they are persuasive, because they're, you know, they're, they're, they're
3225560	3230600	great at messaging. There's whatever it is. Sometimes it's a little bit random, but they
3230600	3234120	aren't elected and there aren't mechanisms in place to hold them accountable. So, you know,
3234120	3238680	in the book, I talk about how that, you know, that happened to me with no logo. Like there was a
3238680	3246440	move that, that, that book predicted that there was going to be a large anti-corporate uprising.
3246440	3249880	There wasn't yet. There were just like, you know, you were talking about these sort of embryonic,
3249880	3253480	like little things that was like reclaim the streets. And there was like an anti-switch
3253560	3256920	shot movement, but there wasn't a big movement. And then when that book was at the press,
3257560	3262200	these huge protests started popping off all over the place in Seattle and then Genoa and so on.
3262200	3266520	And because I had written a book, I suddenly was, according to the media, the face of this
3266520	3270520	movement. And it was bullshit because I had just written a book. Nobody elected me.
3271400	3277800	Nobody could hold me accountable. And suddenly, because this is what corporate media wants,
3277800	3282200	they want like two or three people who are going to be the face of this thing. And, you know,
3282200	3286920	I suddenly was like, no logo was a brand. And the whole thing got completely out of my control.
3286920	3289240	And Vogue asked you to do shopping with the enemy.
3289960	3293320	Yes, I didn't do it. They asked me, there were all kinds of like, there was a,
3293320	3302600	there was advertising that got offers to do designer ad campaigns. And people did go create
3302600	3306760	no logo products. I think there's still a no logo craft beer. People send me pictures of it.
3307480	3313080	I don't know if it's any good. But, you know, I wanted to write about this from the inside and
3313080	3317560	not have it be like a call out, like, oh, that person, you know, wasn't accountable. I really
3317560	3323480	just think we need to have democratic movements. And in the absence of democratic movements,
3323480	3328280	people are still trying to build movements. And it's not work. These tools are failing us.
3328280	3331400	So we should try some new ones. And I think we are trying new ones. This is part of why
3331400	3334680	we're seeing a wave of union organizing. I mean, isn't it also about shifting
3335320	3340280	the kinds of political relationships we have with one another? Because if all of us are brands,
3340280	3344920	brands are always competing, and they're always competing for attention, and they're competing
3344920	3349800	for money. And if we turn ourselves into things, and we're having relationships as things, you
3349800	3353480	can't, you can't build a movement based on solidarity with that. But the relationship
3353480	3359560	between comrades, which is a word that you just used, is so different. And it's so rich and
3359560	3363320	layered. And you want, as you were saying before, you want your ideas to spread. Whereas the,
3363320	3368680	whereas the logic of capitalism and branding is, I want the credit. This is mine. It's an ownership
3368680	3374840	model, which is exactly the opposite of what you want. This is my most cancelable opinion.
3374840	3376920	Oh, dear. This is my most cancelable opinion, which is that...
3376920	3379880	You're going to get me canceled by property. Yeah, you're going to get canceled by property.
3379880	3384840	I'm so sorry. It's time somebody brought down Naomi Klein, and there's going to be this podcast.
3384840	3390120	My most cancelable opinion is that the anti-racist movement has become so concerned with
3390200	3396360	intellectual property. Whether that's, you know, having beef with POC, because, oh,
3396360	3401560	that lumps us all in together. Or whether that's saying, okay, well, if we use the slogan,
3401560	3408440	you can't use the slogan. And how different that was to the ethos of the Black Panther movement.
3408440	3411560	Black Panther movement is like, you want to call yourself the Yellow Panthers? Amazing.
3411560	3418120	Like you want to call yourself the White Panthers? Amazing. Whereas we're so concerned with drawing
3418120	3423320	these lines of separation in between, it's fundamentally liberal. It's liberal in the
3423320	3429240	sense that liberalism perceives other people always as a threat and an incursion rather than
3429240	3433800	what are the generative, creative relationships that occur between people.
3434840	3441720	And obviously, it comes from real injustices, right? I mean, it comes from real examples of
3441720	3446600	intellectual theft of Black women not being credited for intellectual contributions to
3446600	3453080	movements for many, many decades. So I don't think it's just liberalism. I think it's also
3453800	3457800	a needed corrective. It has been a needed corrective. And I think it is also a needed
3457800	3463480	corrective to talk about how we want ideas to spread. But I think even this idea of
3464200	3474360	credit is a tricky one because credit matters when you have a commodity and it's either about
3474360	3480200	your place within an attention economy or a literal economy where people make money from
3480200	3488760	doing these things. And of course, the appropriation of this stuff is wrong and it's bad. But to simply
3488760	3494760	receive credit is not the same as what is the basis of a movement which can really build.
3494760	3500840	And I'm not just talking about Black Lives Matter. I've also very much seen it with the
3501560	3508600	relentless focus on cultural appropriation from South Asian radicals in this country. And I go,
3508600	3515080	yes, I get it. I do get it. But okay, everyone recognizes that Henna comes from us. What next?
3515080	3519720	Like, why is recognition the thing we're striving for?
3520520	3529160	Well, you know, I think it comes down to people just trying to make a really screwed up system
3529800	3535080	work for them. And I think that if there is a genuine revolutionary project that has any
3535080	3542040	prospect of transforming this system to a more egalitarian one, there might be more openness
3542040	3547800	to challenging these ideas around intellectual credit and so on. But within capitalism,
3547800	3551400	someone's going to make money off of it. Somebody's going to get the credit. Somebody is going to be
3551400	3556360	on the cover of the magazine. And I think a lot of people feel like if they're not fighting for
3556360	3559560	it to be them, it's going to be somebody else. And they're right. They're absolutely right.
3560120	3567480	So I guess it all comes down to building that revolutionary project because without it,
3567480	3571240	I think we're just going to be fighting for our scraps.
3572280	3578200	I know this is a really big gear shift. But so Jewishness is really central to this book. It's
3578200	3584680	one of the threads which connects you and the other Naomi. It's central to the anti-Semitic
3584680	3590520	conspiracism of the globalists are doing this, that and the other. But then you also talk about
3590520	3595320	this doubleness of being both victim and perpetrator within the context of Israel. So
3595320	3601160	I guess can you talk me through how doubleness and the motif of the doppelganger brought you into
3601160	3609320	this sort of analysis of Jewishness, Zionism and Israel? Yeah. I came across a paper by
3609320	3616360	Caroline Rooney who's here in the UK who talked about Israel as a country with doppelganger politics
3616360	3625800	by which she meant that it was a nation that had like a fundamental split where the Israeli Jews
3627160	3633960	projected all of everything that they could not bear about themselves onto the Palestinian
3634920	3638680	and other. And then there's also like this sort of doppelganger at the heart of
3639800	3644600	the Zionist project, which is that of the new Jew versus the old Jew. So this is something,
3644600	3649080	you know, I quote Philip Roth, as I mentioned, with all apologies to my 20-year-old self who
3649080	3655560	hurled a Philip Roth book across my dorm room and vowed never ever to read another book by Philip
3655560	3662760	Roth. We will say things at least. But, you know, every, I was reading so much doppelganger
3662760	3670920	literature and I just kept seeing references to Operation Shiloh because 1993 doppelganger
3670920	3676440	masterpiece and I ended up finding it to be really, really useful because, you know, in part because of
3676440	3684360	that ridiculous seriousness thread, but also the ways in which it really engages with this sort of
3684360	3689800	the unshakable ethnic double, right, which is the double that is projected onto
3689800	3697480	people who are not white and Christian around the world, which is the double that isn't the
3697480	3702280	brand that you create that you think you have in the world. It's the one that other people create
3702280	3707640	and project onto you. So for Roth, it's Shiloh, who is the doppelganger of all Jews projected onto
3707640	3713960	them. But then it becomes, you know, a book about Zionism, limited in its critique, but
3713960	3719560	still interesting and he's very fascinated with the figure of the new Jew as a doppelganger of
3719560	3724760	the old Jew, of the diasporic Jew. So what's the new Jew and the old Jew? Well, the new, yeah. So
3724760	3733960	this is a project, a Zionism is to create a new Jew who is the, you know, muscle-bound, gun-toting,
3733960	3740840	strong Jew. Knows Krav Maga. I mean, there's, you know, there's, there's, there's, and I, you know,
3740840	3747560	I think that the critique from somebody like Roth, who is like a little, you know, it's an anti,
3747560	3753960	it's a kind of an, like an anti-literary, you know, you with your books who couldn't save
3753960	3762280	yourselves from, from the Holocaust, we new Jews will protect you. And so it's this, there's,
3762280	3767800	there's, there's that doppelganger in Israeli culture, old Jew, new Jew. And there's a way
3767800	3774120	that it blames the victims of the Holocaust for the Holocaust, mostly unspoken, sometimes spoken.
3774360	3779560	And, and then there, and this is what Rooney was writing about, the way
3781160	3788440	Israel settler colonialism is a doppelganger, becomes a doppelganger of the ways Jews were
3788440	3792040	treated in Europe, not, she's not talking about the Nazis and neither am I, but she is talking
3792040	3797320	about the pogroms, the ghettoization, all the enclosures, the second-class citizenship,
3797880	3802440	the apartheid system that, that is in Israel. You know, this has been some of the more
3802440	3806360	controversial parts of the book. It's a little bit of a twist for people who thought that the
3806360	3811000	book was just going to be about, you know, feeling superior to Naomi Wolfe and Steve Bannon.
3811000	3812840	Yeah, suddenly we're in Gaza.
3814200	3816040	So what happened when you were in Gaza?
3818120	3823880	Oh, that's a story. Yeah. So that's what I mean. So I was in Gaza,
3825320	3831240	shock doctrine had come out. And, you know, my previous books had been published in Hebrew.
3831800	3837000	And I'd been approached by some Israeli publishers to publish the shock doctrine.
3837000	3845160	It had, the shock doctrine has a chapter on Israel and its role in what I call the disaster
3845160	3851720	capitalism complex. And it looks at the export of all of these Israeli spy and surveillance
3851720	3859720	and military tools. So I wanted the book to come out in Hebrew, but I also had written in
3859720	3867240	support of BDS and was in contact with the BDS committee. And so we tried to figure out a way
3867240	3871560	for shock doctrine to come out in Hebrew and Arabic at the same time with an activist publisher
3871560	3876120	called Andalus that doesn't exist anymore, that up to that point had only published Arabic writing
3876120	3882920	and translation. So, you know, I launched the book on the West Bank. You know, we did a lot of
3882920	3888120	things to make, you know, to as much as possible have a book come out in Hebrew that did not
3888120	3892760	support the Israeli state. It's complicated because most arts organizations get money and so on. But
3892760	3898440	anyway, we did our best. It was blessed by the BDS committee. But before I went on the book tour,
3898440	3906120	I wanted to go to Gaza to do some reporting. And yeah, so there's a scene in the book about
3906120	3910920	coming back from Gaza through the era's checkpoint. We had no trouble getting into Gaza because at
3910920	3916600	that point, they didn't know who I was at the checkpoint going in. But coming back because
3916600	3926520	I had done a press conference in Gaza and talked about BDS and talked about, I mean, there had
3926520	3931640	just been a huge assault on Gaza a few months earlier. When we came back through the checkpoint,
3931640	3937640	they were waiting for us. And there was this really bizarre experience that we had where first
3937640	3946840	they kept us waiting for about three hours. It's very strange because there's no way to
3946840	3951400	communicate. There's just the wall. You're on the other side of the wall and there's surveillance
3951400	3956440	cameras everywhere. They see us. We're the only ones there and they won't open the gate to let us
3956440	3961240	through. But if you are there past curfew, then you can't get through and you're in this sort of
3962200	3968280	weird zone where there's nothing there. So finally, the door opens. We go through the
3968280	3974200	security check and then they take my husband, Avi, and there's a guy who introduces himself as
3974200	3978280	Ares from Ares. So you've got another doppelganger. Another doppelganger. They just follow me
3978280	3985560	everywhere. So Ares from Ares takes Avi upstairs and he meets General at his corner office.
3986360	3994440	And he gets this huge speech where they tell him that look out the window and there's a bunch of
3994440	3999960	like tanks doing a security exercise. And they say, do you know how close we were to sending
3999960	4004280	in ground troops to Gaza? Which at that point, there had never been ground troops sent into Gaza
4004280	4011480	since the blockade. And we were going to send them in to rescue you. You have no idea how much
4011560	4015960	danger you were in. We were in no danger. I mean, we were hosted by Palestinians,
4015960	4022840	like we were invited. And they said, we see everything, we hear everything,
4023400	4034760	and we were going to reinvade Gaza to rescue you and get your woman under control. Literally,
4034760	4040920	they said that to Avi about me, like we know what she's been saying. And we don't care what you say.
4041640	4045400	Because you're Jewish and we will rescue you. So they were saying, you have a doppelganger.
4048280	4052760	Just as the rest of the world only sees you as Shylock, we only see you as Jews. We don't care
4052760	4059560	about your politics or what you say. We will rescue you from the Palestinian enemy, even though you
4059560	4064520	think that they're your friends. It was just the biggest mindfuck you could possibly imagine.
4064520	4068680	And it's also deeply manipulative. It's like there'll be a ground invasion of Gaza.
4069640	4075160	Because of you and your supposed solidarity with these people, we're going to invade them
4075160	4081560	even more than we ordinarily do. I never told that story. I mean, I wrote about what we saw in
4081560	4086920	Gaza and reported on the aftermath of that invasion. There have been so many since. But I
4086920	4093720	never told the story of that particular gaslighting mission that they did with eras from eras.
4094680	4099560	And but to me, it's so, you know, I shared the story in the book and thanks for asking,
4099560	4105800	nobody's asked about it. Because we've got, we've got, I call it zionism
4105800	4110280	derangement syndrome in the UK, where if you try and make any arguments critical of zionism,
4110280	4115960	it gets pulled into Corbin and Semitism, the left. And it's just.
4118120	4122360	Well, there's something about the offer that they were saying, you know, that is really the,
4122440	4127560	you know, it's the, it's, it's, it's not just Israel that's making that offer. I think the UK
4127560	4132360	is making that offer with its militarized borders. It's, it's, you know, it's take the guns, take
4132360	4138840	the walls, take the prisons. We will keep you safe from the hordes. And, you know, when I look at
4138840	4143400	my doppelganger, you know, she seems to have thrown in with that ideology. She's got the guns and
4143400	4149640	she's, you know, talking about the wars on the border. And, you know, I think as the climate
4149640	4156120	crisis accelerates and the wars never end and poverty deepens, I mean, this is going to be the
4156120	4159480	offer to all of us. And we have to, we have to decide if we want to take the offer.
4160840	4167000	Yeah. I mean, I've got one, one last question, which is when so many different aspects of your
4167000	4173640	identity are attached to fucked up things. And in your case, it was, you know, your Jewishness
4173640	4179720	being invoked by this general to commit an appalling act of violence. But, you know, in my case, it
4179720	4187480	might be my womanhood being invoked to stomp on trans people or being a Westerner and what that means
4187480	4193960	for all of the, you know, extractive exploitative activities of, you know, Western corporations
4193960	4199880	and the things which fuel my own consumption. Yeah. When we're so tied to all of these things,
4199880	4204840	is it possible to have a stable identity? And is it even desirable to have one?
4204840	4211160	I think we are in a moment that we simply cannot bear as individuals. It's just too hard. I mean,
4211160	4223480	we are in this simultaneous unearthing, unveiling of, you know, unbearable networks of suffering
4223560	4231080	that sustain the lives of the privileged outside of the Shadowlands. You know, and I think COVID
4231080	4239960	acted as a unearthing and as a revealer of all the people who hold up our world and allowed
4239960	4245320	those of us who were able to be locked down to be locked down and bore all of the risk. And I think
4245320	4249400	that generated a certain kind of derangement that is part of what I'm tracking in the book
4249400	4253240	of a lot of privileged people claiming that they were victims of genocide and apartheid
4253320	4259240	and Jim Crow and slavery and all the crimes of the last 500 years were projected onto a vaccine app
4259240	4264520	or, you know, being made to wear masks. But I don't think any of us are really looking,
4264520	4272600	are really able to look at the, just the unbearability of our complicity in these,
4273480	4280120	these past, future and present networks of suffering, extinction,
4280920	4287800	dispossession, we can only bear it together. You know, we can only bear it in the sturdiest,
4289160	4294120	widest possible coalitions. Like I quote Ariel Angel, the editor of Jewish Courants at the end
4294120	4301240	of the book saying, you know, we're going to need each other. And part of recognizing that we will
4301240	4308040	need each other in the face of surging fascism and climate breakdown means that we are going to have
4308040	4313080	to get over ourselves a little bit, you know, whether it's our individual brands or our individual
4313080	4317320	identity groups, which does not mean erasure, which does not mean annihilate the ego,
4317320	4322920	or dissolve into some mush of no difference that pretends that we are all coming into coalition with
4322920	4329720	the same risks, debts and needs. No, but we will need each other. And we, you know, I do believe
4329720	4340360	that every, you know, victory for the fascist right is also a story of division, sectarianism,
4340360	4344360	failure to make a strategic alliances on the anti-fascist left. And we're on the,
4344360	4349160	we are on the knife edge. We are just on the knife edge. We can't afford to destroy each other.
4349960	4354440	Just a little sprinkle of ego death, just a tiny, like a little salt bay sprinkle.
4354440	4358360	Yeah, find your doppelganger and just, just get humble if you can.
4358360	4363000	Yeah, snog your doppelganger if you can. Naomi Klein, thank you so much for joining us.
4363000	4366120	Thank you, Ash. This was really, really deep. Thanks.
4366680	4368120	Well, have fun at the BBC.
4370120	4371160	This is a good way to start.
4373480	4379960	I'm Naomi Klein, and I am at Navar Media right now, having just done a wonderful in-depth interview.
4380600	4387320	And this is why I love Navar Media. And I listen regularly and watch to find out what the hell is
4387320	4393160	going on in the UK. It is so critical to have independent media that we can trust that goes
4393160	4398200	deep on the issues and also lets people stay up on the day-to-day twists and turns. It's going to
4398200	4404760	be especially important for your next election. So I'm incredibly grateful that Navar Media exists,
4404760	4411240	and it exists because people support it. So make sure to support Navar Media. We need
4411240	4416200	left institutions, and that means that we have to support them when they're doing such great work
4416200	4429640	as Navar Media is. Thanks.
