1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,940
We will need each other, and we, you know, I do believe that every, you know, victory

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:16,780
for the fascist right is also a story of division, sectarianism, failure to make strategic alliances

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,720
on the anti-fascist left, and we're on the, we are on the knife edge, we are just on the

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,720
knife edge.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,960
We can't afford to destroy each other.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,800
When we were all locked down and isolating, conspiracy theorists went on the march.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,200
The emergence of anti-vaccine scaremongering coupled with virulent antisemitism was disconcerting

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,000
for all of us.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,040
But it was even more nuts for Naomi Klein, journalist and author of The Shock Doctrine,

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,400
who found herself constantly getting mixed up with Naomi Wolfe, another author and academic.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,120
Naomi found herself being drawn into a strange mirror world as she tracked her doppelganger's

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,840
journey from feminist, academic and liberal darling to gun-toting anti-vaxxer, palling

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,840
around with Steve Bannon.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,240
What was it about COVID that strengthened the far right and how did all of us create doppelgangers

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,360
of ourselves online?

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,520
Stay tuned to find out as I talk to Naomi Klein for Downstream.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,000
So when did it stop being funny that you were being confused for Naomi Wolfe?

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,360
I mean, I still find it funny sometimes to be honest, especially because it still happens.

19
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,560
In fact, I was doing a TV interview in the States last week and the host had to do a

20
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
retake.

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
No.

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
And he didn't realize that he'd done it.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,200
And I was like, you have to stop now and redo that because you just called me Naomi Wolfe.

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Oh my God, you should have kept it in.

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm not going to name him, but he knows who he is.

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, I think, I mean, to be honest, it's always been a little cringy, you know, starting

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,360
from the very beginning, you know, I start the book with this story about being at Occupy

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:15,320
Wall Street and being in a public loo and hearing a couple of demonstrators talking

29
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,960
about an article that Naomi Klein had written and, oh my God, she doesn't understand our

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,640
demands or our movement.

31
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,240
And obviously that was lower stakes.

32
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,880
I mean, that was, they were talking about an article by Naomi Wolfe.

33
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,720
Did you call from inside the store like, sorry, you've got the wrong?

34
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,600
No, I mean, I froze, you know, like flashbacks to high school, mean girls, like, what have

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
I written?

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
You know?

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,720
And then as I listened more, I recognized the article that they were discussing and knew

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,080
that I had not written it.

39
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,400
And so I just very casually came out and made eye contact in the mirror and said, I think

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,040
you're talking about Naomi Wolfe.

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,720
Words I have had to say many times since then, so that was 2011.

42
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,240
But even then, I mean, it was funny and I would entertain my friends, you know, overdrinks

43
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:10,160
with these sorts of stories, they couldn't get enough of it.

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,280
But I mean, I would also get, you know, I'm going to be talking to Andrew Marr later today.

45
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,200
And I'm going to remind him that the last time he interviewed me, it was on the BBC

46
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,680
and he referred to me as Naomi Campbell.

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Naomi Campbell.

48
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,560
I was like, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,960
You broke so many barriers in fashion, you know.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,800
That one is harder because then I feel like, you know, the audience is really quite disappointed

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
when I come out, you know.

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,960
How do you feel about your feud with tower banks?

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,480
Yeah, the whole blood diamond thing.

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,200
Yeah, you really, I mean, in hindsight, except for most blood diamonds, really poor form

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,680
for the author of No Logo.

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,800
So there's something about the name Naomi that people do have trouble with.

57
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
But no.

58
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,160
So I mean, even back to Occupy Wall Street, it was, the stakes were lower, but it still

59
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,400
bothered me just for sort of niche reasons because that particular context, she had written

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,320
an article where just, you know, if you, I'm sure you remember from Occupy Wall Street,

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:15,400
there was a very, you know, there was a decision not to have a list of demands that politicians

62
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
could just meet and everyone would go home.

63
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,960
It was much, you know, it had a deeper critique of the system than that.

64
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,120
And what Wolf had done in the article that they were upset about was claim that she had

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,440
divined the demands of Occupy Wall Street and she came up with a list based, yes, based

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,920
on a random assortment of online communications that she'd had.

67
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,880
So even though that was like pretty low stakes, for me, it was quite a cringe because I do

68
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,680
try to be pretty careful not to do that sort of thing.

69
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,880
I mean, it was one of the things that really struck me about the book, which is that one

70
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,080
of the early chapters, when you're talking about being mixed up for Naomi Wolf.

71
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,960
Do you sort of really strive to talk about the rigor of your journalistic work and the

72
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,400
depth of the research and the scrutiny that you apply to your own writing?

73
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,920
Do you feel a bit defensive about this mix up and that you feel that you've got to put

74
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,320
all this distance between the two of you?

75
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,600
Well, I mean, if anything, I think I've put less distance between the two of us.

76
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,440
Like I've probably cemented the connection forever, I'll never be able to escape it.

77
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:31,400
And I do think that it is important to make a distinction between what investigative journalism

78
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,560
does, what rigorous research is, how we make sure that we don't go to press with speculation.

79
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,960
Because honestly, I think a lot of people are confused about that.

80
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,600
And part of what she does, and she's just a case study of a broader movement, which is

81
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,280
this conspiracy culture.

82
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,000
And I don't call it conspiracy theory because there really isn't a coherent theory.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,840
It's just jumping around.

84
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,360
She's more of a conspiracy influencer than she is a theorist.

85
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,120
I don't think it's really fair to theory to call her a theorist because the theories

86
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,840
are constantly contradicting each other, right?

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,120
One minute COVID is a bio weapon cooked up by the Chinese to depopulate the West and

88
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,080
the next minute it's nothing, don't worry about it, don't even put on a mask.

89
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,360
So like you presumably would have to choose, yeah, between the two.

90
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,640
But there is something about the fact that there are people who consume these things interchangeably,

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
right?

92
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,960
And I describe this as a doppelganger of journalism because it uses a bunch of the conventions,

93
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,480
breaking scoop, like, I've got the papers, smoking gun, all of this.

94
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,760
But because it's within the attention economy and the need to be first out of the gate to

95
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,560
get the clicks to get the cloud, you leap over all the guardrails.

96
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,200
So yeah, I spend some time in the book just sort of explaining what we try to do and whether

97
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,480
it's investigative journalism or academic research to check our facts based on the idea

98
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
that facts don't matter.

99
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,800
But it isn't so much about me putting distance between her because it's a doppelganger.

100
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,640
And doppelganger books are, you know, you have to see yourself in the mirror of your

101
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,080
doppelganger or you have failed.

102
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,680
Do you ever wonder who the mad woman in the attic is?

103
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
Like is it her or is it me?

104
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Absolutely.

105
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,200
There's been uncomfortable winces of recognition throughout this journey.

106
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:36,120
I mean, the moment when Naomi Wolfe is on BBC Radio and her book Outrageous just gets a

107
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
tractor driven through it.

108
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:45,240
So it turns out that she made this reading error and it meant that what was supposed to

109
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,440
be spectacular revelation was exactly wrong.

110
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:56,840
I felt such a pang of empathy when that happened because I thought, oh, my God, that could be

111
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,040
me one day.

112
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,440
And it was this horrible fear of seeing something that you've always had nightmares about

113
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,200
happening to someone else.

114
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,280
And then you want to put distance between them and you by going, how could you be so

115
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,600
stupid?

116
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,040
How could this happen to you?

117
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,680
I mean, did you ever have those moments of like empathetic recognition with her where

118
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,360
you go, oh, God, that could have been me.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,760
I mean, it's every writer's worst nightmare.

120
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,520
I mean, it's a little hard for me to just feel straight empathy because a lot of people

121
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,080
thought it was me who made that mistake.

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,920
So like, you know, I only found out that it happened because my feed was filled with people

123
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,480
going thoughts and prayers to Naomi.

124
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,120
I was like, oh, no, what has she done now?

125
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,000
And I'm always having to kind of reverse engineer whatever the scandal is based on.

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,440
People either literally thinking it's me or sort of sending mock sympathy.

127
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,600
But, you know, I like, as you know, in the book, I have a little maybe a little sort

128
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:11,400
of half-jokey equation about not only her, but many figures who who, you know, we've

129
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,560
many of us have had conversations like, whatever happened to that person, I thought,

130
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,600
I thought I knew who they were.

131
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,040
I thought I could trust them.

132
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,720
And now suddenly they're palling around with Tucker Carlson or Elon Musk or, you know,

133
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,480
whatever happened to Phil in the blanks.

134
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:35,880
And so I had this equation that might not be perfect for every person, but it is narcissism,

135
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,960
bracket grandiosity times social media addiction, which you and I have discussed.

136
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,560
I don't want that mirror being held up to me.

137
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,080
I don't want to see the faces in this.

138
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,960
Plus midlife crisis, which you don't have to worry about for a while.

139
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,680
I got 10 years.

140
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,120
Divided by public shaming equals right wing meltdown.

141
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,680
So I think that that, you know, I think that she should have been held accountable for those

142
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,440
for those major errors in outrageous.

143
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,880
And in general, book publishing, you know, doesn't fact check as much as they should.

144
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:19,240
I always, you know, I'm lucky to be one of the few writers who can afford to pay my own

145
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,240
fact checkers, but I pay my fact checkers out of out of my book advance, you know,

146
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,280
I pay my research assistants and then a whole separate process of going back over every single

147
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,800
fact because, because my first book made me a target, right?

148
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,560
I couldn't afford it for my first book.

149
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,840
But after that book, I, you know, I've, I've, I've had the fear of God

150
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,360
to not be in that situation where, where a reporter discovers that you have a huge

151
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,400
error in the middle of your book and the whole thing gets discredited.

152
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,200
So, but so I think accountability is good.

153
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,200
But what happened after that was just a disgusting pile on online where people were,

154
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,880
I mean, I think as you say, like putting that distance between them and her,

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,680
because everybody, it's everybody's worst nightmare and just having a lot of fun

156
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,680
shaming her and turning her into a spectacle.

157
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,920
And I think that that probably nudged her a little bit in the direction.

158
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,360
I mean, and I think she should be held accountable for these terrible decisions

159
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,400
she's made to align herself with some of the most dangerous men on the planet.

160
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,080
But, you know, I don't think it's great that people, you know, are so cruel to each other

161
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,240
online. That's my radical position today.

162
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,640
I mean, you're talking about the word accountability in some ways it's easier

163
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,360
to talk about accountability for Naomi Wolfe because she's this individual and we've seen

164
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,080
this descent into fact free conspiracism.

165
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,720
But the responsibility for cruelty online is a lot more diffuse and we can more easily dodge it.

166
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:04,920
Yeah. And, you know, the reason why I thought this might be a fun idea for a book and it got

167
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,080
less fun, you know, there's I have a quote early on in the book from Philip Roth about

168
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:18,120
from his really quite wonderful doppelganger novel Operation Shylock, which is about Philip Roth,

169
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,320
a character called Philip Roth who has a doppelganger called Philip Roth creating all kinds of mayhem.

170
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,560
And he says it's it's it's too ridiculous to take seriously and too serious to be ridiculous.

171
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,680
And when I started this, it was more on the ridiculous side of the ledger.

172
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,400
And then as things went on and she got closer and closer to Steve Bannon started

173
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,240
engaging in election denial, started taking pictures of herself with her guns, started

174
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,400
taking posting pictures of her new one, not so new anymore, but her husband is a

175
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,800
private detective slash mercenary who likes to post pictures of himself doing target practice

176
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,480
and so on. So it's gotten more serious than ridiculous just because it is part of a broader

177
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,800
fascist surge globally. So, yeah.

178
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:16,520
So you talked about that that seriousness and that kind of quite scary descent into fascism.

179
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,200
How can you stop people laughing? You know, when does when does the comedy stop and the sense of

180
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:30,120
urgency kick in? Well, you know, this is why I think that that sentence is really resonant,

181
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,920
because I feel like people have that same feeling about Trump a lot of the time, or at least they

182
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,640
did before where it was just like unclear and Boris Johnson and Duterte. I mean, these sort of

183
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:46,520
buffoonish figures. Berlusconi, I think was the. Oh, absolutely. The original, you know.

184
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:52,040
Bolsonaro is the only one who's not at all funny. I know. I mean, he is funny in that he just kept

185
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,680
getting COVID. That was it was like sideshow Bob stepping on the rakes. Like it wasn't a comedy

186
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,880
of his making. It was kind of God's comedy. Exactly. But he didn't seem to be playing

187
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:12,200
playing up the character. But yeah, I think, yeah, at what point do we stop? I think we're still

188
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:19,560
trying to figure out how to how to respond to the weight of our historical moment and,

189
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:26,920
frankly, failing most days, right? I think there are flashes. I don't know about you where I feel

190
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:36,040
like, okay, we're we're getting close to touching just how consequential the decisions we're making

191
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:43,640
are in these in these in these years of, you know, climate breakdown, surging, fascism,

192
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:52,440
border violence, just oligarchic concentration of I mean, wealth, it's a lot. It's a lot. And so

193
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,240
I mean, this, I think the through line of the book and the reason why I thought that doppelganger

194
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,440
doubles like the book, the through line of the book is less her than it is the way in which we

195
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:12,280
create doubles of ourselves. And our groups, you know, respond to each other in these in these

196
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:18,440
sorts of mirror world ways, we react to one another rather than behave based on legible

197
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,360
principles a lot of the time. And my analysis is that all of it is about not looking at what we

198
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,400
need to look at, right? That that, you know, the third section of the book is called the Shadowlands.

199
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,040
And I think that, you know, whether we're staring into our phones looking at our digital doubles,

200
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,600
you know, the way we create these little doppelgangers of ourselves to represent us,

201
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,400
which is, you know, why I thought it was interesting that I lost control over my digital

202
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,080
identity during COVID. And I thought, well, this is an interesting way in, you know, or the way we

203
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:58,680
sort of project all that we want to distance ourselves from onto the other as if we are the

204
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:05,080
ones who are really, you know, married to truth and facts and, you know, facing the weight of our

205
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,240
moment when we all know that we are distracting ourselves endlessly and looking away endlessly.

206
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,840
And, you know, it's, you know, there's more than one way to look away. Conspiracy culture

207
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,960
plays that role for a lot of people. It's, you know, just a decision to divorce from

208
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,280
any recognizable shared reality and just make up your own facts, make up your own reality. But,

209
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,280
you know. I mean, one of the things that I was reflecting on as I was reading this book was

210
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,680
my own career in the media, because when I started out, I was always paired up against

211
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:44,520
really old white guys. And that allowed me to have a sort of brand identity as young,

212
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,840
female, brown, left wing, disruptor. Oh my God, what is she going to do next? And then over time,

213
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,600
I started getting partnered with young, right wing women of color. So it was like they were

214
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:04,040
putting me up against my own Wario. And I then suddenly felt the sense of nausea where I was

215
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:11,480
like, have I contributed to creating this category of right wing talking head where they want the

216
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:19,880
one of color to play against type? And I've participated in the commodification of identity

217
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,800
to the extent that it becomes very powerful for the right. I mean, I felt quite kind of,

218
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,520
you know, disoriented by it. And I guess I was wondering, when you're looking at your

219
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,320
conspiratorial doppelganger, do you ever feel this little sense of responsibility going,

220
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,760
did I make this in some way? Like it's not just a mirror, did I create this mirror somehow?

221
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:49,880
You know, I think it is always worth interrogating, right? And looking at, you know, and sometimes

222
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:57,400
those winces can be really productive, because it pushes you to think about what is it that you're

223
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,840
doing and what, you know, what parts of it are most important to you, right? And if it's an easy

224
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,800
to doppelgang part of you, then you might want to lean into some of the other, because you aren't

225
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:16,280
just playing an identity game. You know, that's not the way I perceive your role in the media.

226
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,640
You're making arguments, and you're representing a set of values and beliefs. And

227
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,760
they can doppelgang your identity. But, you know, I think it's a lot harder to do that when you're,

228
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,640
you know, when you're making arguments that are genuine, challenged power.

229
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:44,120
And so I did interrogate, you know, it wasn't only Wolf who was doing a kind of fact, like,

230
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,640
you know, describing the book as a kind of fact-free remix of the shock doctrine specifically.

231
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,760
And here I'm not saying it was deliberate, but there was a way in which, I mean, I still,

232
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:05,240
like, every tour stop, every time I log on, I hear people who are furious that I

233
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,000
wrote the shock doctrine and have failed to recognize that the vaccines are the biggest

234
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,800
shock doctrine in world history, not for the reasons that I believe they are, because there

235
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,680
should never have been patents, and this was an opportunity for massive illegitimate enrichment,

236
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,280
and we should have, you know, they should have never been patented in the first place,

237
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,640
but because they were violating bodily sovereignty, and, you know, they believe that there has been

238
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:37,160
a genocide that has been covered up by the quote-unquote elites. There's some graffiti near my house,

239
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,160
where it says anti-vaxxer, and then next to it, I love my sperm, and then like a big picture of

240
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:51,000
sperm, and I was like... Yeah, so that's the shock doctrine I missed. Yeah, you're really low on

241
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,640
sperm, you really... But no, I think I did feel that, you know, when I started to hear people

242
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:06,040
using the shock doctrine to sell, you know, what I considered to be largely made-up theories about

243
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:16,200
how public health measures were an attempt by the CCP and Fauci and Gates to bring in

244
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,160
Chinese social credit, or whatever it was. I mean, the great reset, all of that.

245
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,760
Like, to be clear, I think there have been real examples of what I would call the shock doctrine

246
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,920
in disaster capitalism under cover of COVID. I'm very concerned about them. The NHS has been

247
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,000
attacked, you know, under cover of COVID. I live in Canada, the same thing has happened to our

248
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
public health care system. A lot of the attacks on the schools about COVID measures are really

249
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
just attacks on public schools by the same people who always attack public schools under cover of

250
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:52,760
emergency. But there is this kind of doppelganger of the shock doctrine out there, and I think for

251
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,360
a while it made me less willing to talk about that, because I couldn't figure out how to talk about

252
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,200
the shock doctrine, how to talk about my concerns about Bill Gates, which were not fantastical,

253
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,280
but very provable about what he was doing, providing cover for the drug companies to keep

254
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:17,880
their patents in place, and so on. Because it was just getting all, it was just a swirl of Bill Gates

255
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:25,960
tracking, you know, implants. And, you know, I was just getting like the algorithms were

256
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,480
starting to confuse me with Wolf. And I was just like, we're just a mess of Naomi is talking about

257
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,520
Bill Gates. So, but I think the worst thing you can do is let that doppelganger experience

258
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:47,800
silence you. You know, I regret not talking more about the patents during this period.

259
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:58,840
I regret any way in which the left has ceded territory to the fake populist right by not going

260
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,840
after corporate power and not making the connections with the logics of capitalism,

261
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,000
because that's just such a gift to the Steve Bannon's of the world who just suck it all up,

262
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,760
or Giorgio Malone, and then twist it and turn it into transphobia and xenophobia,

263
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,880
and, you know, an incredibly malevolent agenda. I mean, is there a way to sort of

264
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:29,640
reclaim the integrity of left-wing ideas without it being about insisting on your

265
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,400
intellectual property rights? Because the strength of the left has always come from the

266
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,160
dissemination of ideas in a very open way. The communist manifesto was meant to be passed

267
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,000
hand to hand from worker to worker. And then, you know, in some ways, shock doctrine being

268
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:51,640
appropriated by conspiracy theorists is testament to its success and its its meaning and its

269
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,520
power as an idea. So how do you how do you navigate that as someone who's on the left?

270
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:04,120
I mean, I agree. I mean, I think the left should be taking popular education as seriously as,

271
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,960
you know, it originally was with the original pamphleteers and the idea of

272
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,880
doing this kind of popular education in part because the alternative was conspiracy theory,

273
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,680
right? I mean, I have a section in the book that looks at anti-Semitism as the socialism of fools

274
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,760
and, you know, in part, you know, looks at the history of Marxist thought as in part being

275
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,280
a history of a whole bunch of Jews banging their head against the brick wall of history,

276
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,400
saying it's not the Jews that are the result of your pain or causing your pain, but it's

277
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:50,360
actually this system. So I don't think we should any of us should embrace our ideas being distorted

278
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,360
and turned into like a warped mirror of themselves. But is there a way to do that without going,

279
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,080
it's mine, like this is my idea? I don't think it's about intellectual property. I think it's

280
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:08,920
about having a robust left that is doing system analysis. And, you know, and I think that when

281
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:18,600
that doesn't happen, conspiracy culture swirls because the center isn't holding, because there's

282
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:27,240
so much suffering and because all of the promises that capitalism has made about the meritocracy

283
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,760
and if you work hard, you're going to succeed and you'll be able to climb this ladder,

284
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:37,240
it's falling apart and people know that. And our education system doesn't explain what capitalism

285
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:43,720
is. It says it's all about sunshine and big max and freedom and getting the rewards that you

286
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,760
deserve. And so when the system fails, people are really, really vulnerable to somebody pulling

287
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:55,880
them aside and going, it's actually the Jews, or it's actually the CCP or it's this meeting

288
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:04,040
once a year. And so the need for that robust system analysis is urgent because I think it's the only

289
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,680
force that can drain power from this surging authoritarianism. You know, if they were just

290
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:16,840
taking the ideas and putting them to good use, then fine. Yes, always. It doesn't matter if you

291
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,800
get credit or not, you want them to disseminate. The problem is this, you know, I listened to

292
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,480
hundreds of hours of Steve Bannon to do, to write this book, unfortunately, and the most chilling

293
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,680
moments were when I was when I would hear him sounding like what the left used to sound like

294
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:38,280
and doesn't really sound like anymore because there is not as much of a anti-corporate left as

295
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,440
there used to be, let alone an anti-capitalist left. It's much more partisan and reactive.

296
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,520
It's part of the appeal of the likes of Steve Bannon and the very reactionary authoritarian

297
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,960
right is that they're saying, here's how to live and it will make you a better person, a stronger

298
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,000
person, a smarter person, a more worthy person. Whereas the left, we've retreated a lot into like,

299
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,240
you do what you want to do, except there is no you do what you want to do because if you

300
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,440
are perceived in the wrong way, particularly online, people jump down your throat.

301
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,880
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, Bannon is different than some of the other people who are more like,

302
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,600
this is how to live. Like, he's less of a lifestyle guy. Like, he's not Jordan Peterson or...

303
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't think anyone goes, how do I get the Steve Bannon look?

304
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,440
Exactly. No, he is more of an organizer. I mean, he is the guy who is organizing,

305
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:34,200
the takeover of your local Republican Party, your local school board, get those books banned.

306
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,440
He's very deliberately building a political coalition that he calls MAGA Plus, which is,

307
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,960
the plus is women who they haven't been able to really lock down enough to win the last couple

308
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:56,520
of elections. And so, in the same way that he peeled away some democratic voting working class

309
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,640
guys who were pissed off about having voted for Democrats three, four times, who promised that

310
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:07,000
they were going to renegotiate trade deals and then voted for Trump because he said he was going

311
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,600
to do it. And it wasn't the only reason why people voted for Trump, but it doesn't need to be that

312
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:16,520
many people who you peel away with these messages. He now sees that opportunity with who he calls

313
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:24,200
the warrior moms. So, it's interesting because I definitely think that there is an appeal around,

314
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,320
I'm going to help you learn how to live that certain people are offering on the right.

315
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,720
But I think with Bannon, what he's offering is a political program. He's offering a plan.

316
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:43,800
It's an activist space. His slogan is action, action, action. And he doesn't, he refers to

317
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,320
his listeners as the war room posse. And he makes them feel like they're not just listening or

318
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:56,040
watching, they are part of his army. But it's that thing which is, I want David from accounts to

319
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:02,440
feel like Ajax the conqueror. And maybe it is difficult to draw the line between political

320
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:10,600
organizing, lapping and entertainment. Andrew Tate, there's a Andrew Tate group chat called

321
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,880
the war room, which is again, very similar trying to say like, we're going to build you up and empower

322
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,280
you if you just do these things. Yeah. And I think that this is where

323
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:29,160
the left is at something of a disadvantage because it takes more time and it's more complicated to

324
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:35,320
build the kind of mass power that has any kind of chance of standing up to the sort of consolidated

325
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:41,320
wealth that we're talking about. Whereas Bannon is perfectly happy to just have a plan to get back

326
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:47,560
into the White House. And so there is a plan and it is take over politics at every level,

327
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:57,080
peel off part of your opposition by using all of this COVID residual anger and pivoting it

328
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:02,760
in the way that we've been talking about. So what is the left plan? Like, I mean, we can

329
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,200
diagnose, we can do systems analysis, but that's just going to make people feel helpless for the

330
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,040
most part because then they're going to better understand that as an individual, there's nothing

331
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:22,920
that they can do. They can only stand up to these systems in mass collective action. If there is a

332
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:28,360
conspiracy and there's just five guys who are responsible for all of the suffering in the world,

333
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:34,040
then like the bumper sticker says, make the Nuremberg code great again. Let's bring them up on

334
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:40,680
war crimes trials. I mean, that's part of their plan is a sort of a fantasy of justice. That's

335
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:45,320
also at the heart of QAnon is like there's going to be a great storm and all of the bad people

336
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,320
are going to get arrested and they're going to be brought up on charges and there will be

337
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,160
justice because we will replace them with the good people. The observation that January 6th

338
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:02,520
was people dressing up and storming the capital. It was like a sort of Comic-Con element of it

339
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:11,240
as well. You get to live this fantasy for a day, except it's real. Yeah. This is the Bannon playbook.

340
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:21,880
He wants people to inhabit their avatars and so many of these figures are very, very skilled from

341
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,240
the world of entertainment and reality television. Bannon has worked in Hollywood. He's worked in

342
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,160
video games. Trump obviously, reality television, Tate as well, former reality show star.

343
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:39,960
The only one who doesn't really have this history is Peterson. Joe Rogan also, former reality show.

344
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,840
Didn't he voice come at the frog? What? Didn't he voice come at the frog?

345
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,600
He's the only one who's just a natural at this. I always feel as a Canadian, I need to apologize

346
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,960
when I'm abroad. If I stop all this for everybody out there, we'd be here all day.

347
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,240
The left proposition is not just we're out here making a better argument about what is really

348
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:13,640
driving mass misery. We also have to connect that analysis with a credible organizing strategy

349
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,800
that shatters the sense that there's nothing you can do about these huge systems because it's a

350
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:27,800
hell of a lot easier to take on a cabal than it is to take on a system. That's why, if anything

351
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:34,840
has made me feel a little bit optimistic in recent days, it's been the UAW going out on strike,

352
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:42,600
the United Auto Workers in the States and the fact that there's a great new leader of that union,

353
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,800
Sean Fain, who was an insurgent candidate. He's on the news because he's taken on the big three

354
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:57,800
automakers and he's doing real left populism. He is saying these companies have recorded record

355
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,520
profits and they've given themselves massive wages and our workers haven't been able to keep up with

356
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:09,880
the cost of living increases and we're going to get them. Just having somebody out there who has

357
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:16,600
a clear left analysis and a plan about what to do about it, we are going to disrupt your assembly

358
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,640
lines. I feel like it makes the bannons of the world sort of shrivel up and die because they are

359
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:29,560
not died, but they can only sell the counterfeit if the real thing is an on offer or even in the

360
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:38,600
public sphere. When words and action momentarily are married in these moments of mass worker action

361
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:43,720
or the debt collective or tenant organizing or any of the ways that people are finding collective

362
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,800
power, that's going to do more to drain the power of right wing conspiracy culture than an army of

363
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:56,040
fact checkers and content moderators. I was thinking about one of the advantages that the

364
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:03,320
right has, which is they've got this screen-based ecosystem, whether it's YouTube or accounts on

365
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,560
Twitter, where they're bringing together a community and making it lonelier all the time.

366
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:16,600
So I was reminded of that bit where Anthony says of Cleopatra, she makes hungry where most she

367
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,200
satisfies. So it's satisfying this need for social connection because it's not the real thing,

368
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,440
you're getting hungry and hungry all the time. How does the left draw a balance between contesting

369
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:38,120
these spaces in a legacy media or social media ecology, but also just being in flesh space

370
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,960
where we can touch each other and make eye contact and engage with each other as human beings and not

371
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:51,320
digital avatars? That quote is so interesting because I feel like back to my first book,

372
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:58,840
No Logo, which I wrote before the explosion of personal branding and some of the things that

373
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:07,640
I revisit here, a lot of what I did in that book was track the way in which the first mega lifestyle

374
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:15,000
brands like Nike and Apple and Starbucks were co-opting revolutionary rhetoric, putting Martin

375
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:24,760
Luther King on Apple ads. Yes, this is for your time. It was weird. There was all of this

376
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,160
unease, all of the iconography of the 1960s, the anti-Vietnam War movement was suddenly a

377
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:40,360
Nike ad and Gandhi was from the grave shilling for Apple. On the one hand, you could say,

378
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,320
nothing means anything anymore, but that wasn't my feeling. My feeling was like in the 90s where

379
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,960
we had been told that nobody liked left ideas. I thought it was really exciting that these

380
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,240
companies with all of their market research had found that what people actually wanted was revolution

381
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,840
and obviously they weren't going to get it from their running shoes or their laptops,

382
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:05,240
so there would be that constant hunger cycle that you're using much more literary references for.

383
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,960
But so for capitalism, that's great because you'll just have to keep shopping. You'll get

384
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,520
like a little hit and then you'll crash again and you'll have to shop again in order to get

385
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,400
that feeling. I hate myself for the way in which I instinctively scroll through clothing when I

386
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,560
feel sad and it makes me feel worse and like, why am I doing this? It's just like my classic

387
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:33,960
depression activities. Yeah, exactly. Horrible. Well, and it's helpful to just be aware that

388
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:40,680
you're doing it because you're sad or you're doing it because you're insecure and that people shop

389
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:47,400
one of the times when you have the highest spike in consumption is when people are becoming

390
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,520
parents for the first time because they're panicked and they don't have people who

391
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,520
will help them figure out how to be parents anymore because if we don't live in communities,

392
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,960
we tend to be isolated and so you just think, if I were to just get this $1,000 bouncy chair,

393
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:08,040
everything would be fine. But I remember that from when I just, I mean, never have I been more of a

394
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,120
consumer drone than in those days. I mean, was it a fear that like bypassed your

395
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,280
and critical awareness of the thing you were doing? It was just... Well, it was really useful

396
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:22,280
to me to see that statistic, like that this is the time when consumption is higher than at any

397
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,880
point in our lives and not just because you need a whole bunch of new things. It's because

398
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,760
it's well beyond what you need and it's just fear. Yeah, it's just fear.

399
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,480
I know it keeps it in check a little bit. It doesn't keep it completely in check, obviously,

400
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,200
but it's still helpful to know. I mean, you were talking about the

401
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,040
symbols of revolution, language of revolution being co-opted. Yeah, let's come back to that.

402
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,400
90s capitalism. I didn't know that Nike had used Martin Luther King, but the thing...

403
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,760
Apple used Martin Luther King and Nike used a whole bunch of Vietnam War anthems.

404
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,000
Oh my God. Because then the thing that it made me think of was in this very direct way,

405
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,360
Nike revealing that it partnered with Colin Kaepernick all that time when he was being black

406
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,480
listed by the NFL. Because I remember the conversations going on at that time, which

407
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,320
for lots of people on the anti-racist level, lots of black people was a feeling of like,

408
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,520
well, at least someone's standing with us during this time because also this queasiness of going,

409
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:25,640
but you're doing it to sell your shoes. I mean, how did you make sense of moments like that?

410
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,040
Yeah. I mean, I was teaching a course at the time, so it was helpful. I was teaching a course

411
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,120
called the Corporate Self, an undergraduate course, so we were sort of processing all of that

412
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,320
Nike ads in real time. I mean, it's interesting because it's not unlike the people's reaction

413
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:45,560
to the Barbie movie, right? I don't know. Where it's like, oh, wow, all these feminist critiques

414
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,440
are in here and they keep talking about patriarchy, but ultimately...

415
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:58,360
I thought it, I really fucking hated the self-consciously woke dialogue. There's this

416
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,120
one moment where the teenage girl was like, white savior Barbie, and I was like, it's like they took

417
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:09,640
Tumblr from 2015 and chicken upside down all over the script. It was just so focus-grouped

418
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,000
and calculated to get everybody. Turned me off. It really turned me off.

419
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:27,240
And ultimately, just to be a boring lefty eco-feminist, it is an advertisement. It's an

420
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:35,800
extraordinarily historically good advertisement for a plastic doll. And even if you love the movie,

421
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:43,320
maybe especially if you love the movie, you should know that that will lead to materially,

422
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:53,240
this selling of many, many, many more plastic dolls. And so its success is a huge failure for

423
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,560
the earth. But at any rate, we were talking about them doing their market research for us

424
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,960
and the co-optation. Well, so yeah, I think you can get really down about the ways that

425
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,840
these ideas are being co-opted by the right, or you can be like, wow, these really are popular

426
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:19,960
ideas. We should be making more of them. And that the, you know, one of the things that's been,

427
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,080
I think, nice for me about the last few weeks of touring, I've been in the U.S. touring with the

428
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:33,720
book, just got here to the U.K. There haven't been that many posts, well, we're not post pandemic,

429
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:40,280
but since the beginning of the pandemic, there haven't been that many spaces for people to

430
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,760
gather as leftists collectively. And one of the things that's been helpful to name is the

431
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,480
particular experience that a lot of us had of going from the highs of the Bernie Sanders campaign

432
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:01,720
to lockdown, Biden, you know, Democratic Party rallying and just that, like the combination

433
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:09,640
of that extreme political disappointment and being isolated from each other, so not being able to

434
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,520
process it, re-strategize, think about what we want to do next. And instead, in that isolation

435
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,840
and in our disappointment, a lot of what we did was just attack each other. And sort of,

436
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:27,000
you know, I write in the book, we went from this, you know, this surfing this wave of not me, us,

437
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and this kind of real joy of kind of a release from individualism and ego. I mean, that was what

438
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:43,240
was so powerful about being on the road with Bernie was, you know, the slogan, not me, us.

439
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,560
Originally, I think a lot of people just thought it was Bernie saying, this is not about me, this

440
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,160
is about us. But when you were out on the campaign, it took on this whole other life and meaning,

441
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,560
which was much more about, you know, what what Astro Taylor talks about with the debt collective,

442
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,600
where with something like medical debt or student debt, it's this private shame that people are

443
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:14,440
carrying. And it's just all me in the sense of my fault and my burden. But when you meet lots of

444
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:21,560
other people who are who have that same burden, you find it us and that us has power, like you

445
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,440
organize into a debtors union, then you're a problem for the creditors. And if you and in the

446
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,520
same way that when workers organize their problem for their bosses. So to go from those highs,

447
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,560
you know, of, you know, being in Las Vegas when Bernie won the strip, which was like,

448
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,240
I mean, I'm just, it was the happiest moment of my political life just because it's Vegas,

449
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,200
right? And it's shiny and gold and Trump. I mean, was it one of the moments of politics where you

450
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,320
feel like the boundaries of the self dissolve a bit? And it's like, well, just absolutely yes,

451
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,280
because you've got the nurses and you've got teachers and you have just so many different

452
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:06,360
movements coming together and just reaching towards each other. And and then the coinciding

453
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:12,360
of lockdown, I mean, we were so vividly remember being on my couch, I was still living in the

454
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:19,160
States at the time, and, and watching the whole Democratic Party just coalesce around Biden.

455
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,280
And, and then almost instantly, the Bernie movement just fractured and everybody started

456
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,880
starting their own podcasts and attacking each other. And hey, not too much about podcasts.

457
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:38,840
Listen, I mean, I got a cat to feed, right? But it was, you know, we were, we were sudden,

458
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,160
we went from not me, us to just being dropped in this ocean of me, me, me, me, me. And that's all

459
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,720
we knew how to do. And it was just heartbreaking. I really, I really want to talk about this,

460
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:53,000
because I think it's something where I feel, again, really personally conflicted about my own work,

461
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,600
because Novara came out of the student movement, we all met through occupying our university,

462
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:07,160
which was UCL, or, you know, the plate glass windows of Milbank, which was the Tory party HQ

463
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,120
being smashed. That was cool. That was my first year of university. And I just remember it was

464
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,680
me and my friend who were like, in Milbank. And she's, she looks like me. She's like my

465
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,320
doppelganger, but blonde and Irish, like we're just like same height, same face, but like two

466
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:27,000
different colorways. Like that was how we all met. And that was where the organization came from.

467
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,480
And we've always felt like we're part of a movement movement, but journalism is different

468
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,240
from being a propagandist for the movement. And there are all kinds of tensions

469
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:45,880
that come with it. And I think that I often bulk at the constraints of what I feel are

470
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,440
unfair expectations from parasocial relationships where I'm like, why is someone on Twitter yelling

471
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,240
at me like they know me or like they own me? But the fact is, is that it's not unreasonable to have

472
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,680
political expectations or editorial expectations of someone whose

473
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,760
public career is the result of coming from this movement. So I was wondering like,

474
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,120
how do you navigate that the sort of, you know, the rigors and the demands of journalism,

475
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,960
that you've got to go where the facts are leading you, the fact you've got political aims,

476
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,400
the fact that you want to think critically and independently, but you also want to be

477
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,000
accountable to people. How do you square all of these circles?

478
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,760
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think there's a lot going on there. You know, I think left media should not

479
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:38,120
be propaganda. And we, you know, I like coming back to what we were talking about earlier about

480
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:44,120
facts do matter, research does matter. It's part of the reason why I always hated the idea that

481
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,760
you have are supposed to be a brand. Because what I know about being a brand is that

482
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:56,680
you repeat yourself endlessly. If you're a good brand, you've identified your core meaning and

483
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,800
you're just repeating and reinforcing. And you have message discipline, which is pretty much

484
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,680
the opposite of being a good journalist, a good investigator, which requires that you

485
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,640
follow your research wherever it leads. You have to be able to be changed by what you're learning.

486
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,760
And so I think these projects are really antithetical. That doesn't mean that you

487
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:21,880
don't have like an image in the world, but branding is a very particular thing. Branding is

488
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,080
chasing your own tail at infinitum. And that might be okay to sell running shoes, but it really is

489
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:32,840
not a good model for being a public intellectual or a journalist. And I think we should push back

490
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,440
on it. And I think also part of the cruelty that we've been talking about online is that

491
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,720
there's a cost to performing a thing version of yourself, which is what it means to be a brand.

492
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:48,200
You're out there saying, this is thing me. This is commodity version of me. People will believe

493
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,760
you and they will think that they can throw very hard things at you and that you won't bleed

494
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:59,080
because things don't bleed. And so I don't think we quite believe each other are real online.

495
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,240
And that's a problem. It's not the only reason why people are cruel. They're also racist. They're

496
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:14,680
also misogynist. But I think there is also this factor that is driving it. So we should try to

497
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,280
dething ourselves if we can. I mean, just to play devil's advocate on the difference between a

498
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,080
journalist and a propagandist, I was talking about this with my partner. And one of the things that

499
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,000
he was saying is, well, doesn't this keep you locked into very bourgeois norms? So if you say,

500
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,760
well, this is what a journalist does. And there are certain things that journalists does,

501
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:40,600
which cannot be subordinated to your political aims. Doesn't that make you a worse communist?

502
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,680
Doesn't this make you a worse socialist? Doesn't this make you worse at bringing

503
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:51,880
the world you want to see into existence? I think you need to be transparent about what

504
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,920
values you're holding yourself to, what standards you're holding yourself to.

505
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:03,480
And I don't think you do subscribe to the idea that you're objective, that you don't have politics.

506
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,880
No, you wear your politics on your sleeve, you're in it because you want to change the world.

507
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:14,280
But you're still accountable for what you say, and you're still going to hold yourself to standards

508
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:20,600
of accuracy and truth and probing. And why? Why does that matter? You also have to say why that

509
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:27,320
matters and why it makes for stronger movements and why movements always have strong movements,

510
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:33,800
always have powerful art, powerful journalism. It's an ecosystem, and this is a piece of the

511
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,200
ecosystem. I think where we get into trouble is when the rest of the ecosystem is not healthy.

512
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:47,800
I'm interested in the history of what Navarra came out of, of the movements Navarra came out of.

513
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:56,200
I probably became aware of you around the Corbyn movement and saw you as a kind of

514
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,920
the media arm of the Corbyn project. Maybe that's wrong, but that's the way I saw you.

515
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:07,960
Not that you were propagandist, I know it's always a little tinge, but you also have to be able to

516
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,680
do critique because if movements can't do critique and that it's going to be through the media,

517
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,920
that's how we're going to hear each other, then you're just going to keep making the same mistakes

518
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:26,040
over and over again. But what I'm describing around the burning moment, all of those podcasts

519
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:32,280
were relatively healthy when there was a political project that was healthy. It was when the political

520
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:38,680
project collapsed that it just seemed like the left was a bunch of podcasts. And I don't think

521
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:44,600
that that is a left. And I think that if people are, they're always going to be cruel online,

522
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:51,960
but I think these parasocial relationships take on an overinflated and unhealthy role

523
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,600
when they're subbing in for collective organizing that isn't in a healthy state.

524
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:04,920
And is that happening here? Well, I think that since the demise of the Corbyn movement, and

525
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:12,680
again, it was straight from Corbyn into lockdown and that was a grim six months. It was really

526
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:21,800
like a bereavement because not only was this central force of your life gone, you're also being

527
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:26,520
piled on with humiliation by everyone crowing and saying they were right about you all along.

528
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,960
And then you were separate from your comrades because you couldn't see each other and you could

529
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:36,680
only communicate online. Like it was a very grim time. And I think that just anecdotally,

530
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,680
there are lots of people trying different things and there's kind of like embryonic

531
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,800
experimentation going on. But certainly, I think with with Navarra, it is this

532
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:54,120
ongoing discussion about what does it mean to be a socialist media outlet, which takes

533
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:59,000
journalistic standards very seriously and take socialism very seriously. And there are conflicts

534
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,320
there, there are tensions there. But the more robust the socialist project is outside of Navarra,

535
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:11,880
I think that the clear your role is going to be. It's just it's when it isn't clear that there

536
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:23,800
you said it. I mean, I kind of want to talk a little bit about this thing of turning

537
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:31,640
oneself into a brand because we all do it. We all do it now that social media exists. Anyone who

538
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:39,560
has Instagram or TikTok or Twitter is doing brand them to some extent. What does it mean for

539
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:47,080
the left to be contesting so much of its politics through these digital avatars? I mean,

540
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,360
you know, one is that it stops people seeing each other as human beings. But what does it do

541
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:57,080
to the politics? Yeah, I don't think it's been great. I mean, in general, understatement of

542
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:02,920
the century. And I do want to say that these these political campaigns that we've both referenced,

543
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:15,320
I think that we should we should strive for more in terms of I think we should

544
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:23,160
expect from these political campaigns that when there are losses, they're not just abruptly

545
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:31,800
end and they're not be a process for trying to hold on to all of that organizing energy and to

546
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,200
think strategically about what the next stage was. I mean, I was a Bernie surrogate and

547
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,960
you know, I think there was like one email that we all got that was just like

548
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:55,000
I mean, I love the guy. I'm not blaming him. But you know, social relations have never been

549
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,360
his strength. But you know, I think we you know, if we are going to ask people to go all in for

550
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:05,960
these campaigns and these moments when we sent some opening, you know, they're not all going to win.

551
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:11,880
Most of them are going to fail. And there should be a strategy for holding that space so that we

552
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:18,600
don't all turn on each other afterwards. But the the branding piece of it and this is, you know,

553
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,240
a big part of the reason why I wanted to come back to these themes. And it's something that I talk

554
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:29,080
about with a lot of my comrades in the movement about the way the logic of personal branding

555
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:35,000
and even collective branding, because it isn't just the individual brands. It's also the movement

556
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:45,960
as brand that I think is part of why we've had these like peaks, peak peaks and big valleys where

557
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,200
it seems like everybody is talking about whatever the thing is. And and we have, you know, historic

558
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,560
numbers of people on the streets, you know, whether we're talking about climate strikes,

559
00:52:55,560 --> 00:53:00,520
Black Lives Matter, me too, you know, it just seems like everybody is with the program. And then

560
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,880
and then and then the crash and then the internal divisions. And part of it, you know,

561
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:13,000
Keyanga Amada Taylor, who I quote in the book of Fairbitt is a, you know, wonderful colleague and

562
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,640
friend. She's written a fair bit about how why movements need more democracy so that it isn't

563
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:25,720
just, you know, I think it's important that we have ways of talking about this that deep

564
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,440
personalize it. I think people are trying to build movements with really inadequate tools.

565
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:37,480
And so we're on these corporate platforms and people get, you know, lifted up to leadership

566
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:45,560
positions because they are persuasive, because they're, you know, they're, they're, they're

567
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:50,600
great at messaging. There's whatever it is. Sometimes it's a little bit random, but they

568
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,120
aren't elected and there aren't mechanisms in place to hold them accountable. So, you know,

569
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,680
in the book, I talk about how that, you know, that happened to me with no logo. Like there was a

570
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:06,440
move that, that, that book predicted that there was going to be a large anti-corporate uprising.

571
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,880
There wasn't yet. There were just like, you know, you were talking about these sort of embryonic,

572
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,480
like little things that was like reclaim the streets. And there was like an anti-switch

573
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,920
shot movement, but there wasn't a big movement. And then when that book was at the press,

574
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,200
these huge protests started popping off all over the place in Seattle and then Genoa and so on.

575
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,520
And because I had written a book, I suddenly was, according to the media, the face of this

576
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,520
movement. And it was bullshit because I had just written a book. Nobody elected me.

577
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:37,800
Nobody could hold me accountable. And suddenly, because this is what corporate media wants,

578
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,200
they want like two or three people who are going to be the face of this thing. And, you know,

579
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:46,920
I suddenly was like, no logo was a brand. And the whole thing got completely out of my control.

580
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,240
And Vogue asked you to do shopping with the enemy.

581
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,320
Yes, I didn't do it. They asked me, there were all kinds of like, there was a,

582
00:54:53,320 --> 00:55:02,600
there was advertising that got offers to do designer ad campaigns. And people did go create

583
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,760
no logo products. I think there's still a no logo craft beer. People send me pictures of it.

584
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:13,080
I don't know if it's any good. But, you know, I wanted to write about this from the inside and

585
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,560
not have it be like a call out, like, oh, that person, you know, wasn't accountable. I really

586
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:23,480
just think we need to have democratic movements. And in the absence of democratic movements,

587
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:28,280
people are still trying to build movements. And it's not work. These tools are failing us.

588
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,400
So we should try some new ones. And I think we are trying new ones. This is part of why

589
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,680
we're seeing a wave of union organizing. I mean, isn't it also about shifting

590
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:40,280
the kinds of political relationships we have with one another? Because if all of us are brands,

591
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:44,920
brands are always competing, and they're always competing for attention, and they're competing

592
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,800
for money. And if we turn ourselves into things, and we're having relationships as things, you

593
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,480
can't, you can't build a movement based on solidarity with that. But the relationship

594
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:59,560
between comrades, which is a word that you just used, is so different. And it's so rich and

595
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,320
layered. And you want, as you were saying before, you want your ideas to spread. Whereas the,

596
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,680
whereas the logic of capitalism and branding is, I want the credit. This is mine. It's an ownership

597
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:14,840
model, which is exactly the opposite of what you want. This is my most cancelable opinion.

598
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,920
Oh, dear. This is my most cancelable opinion, which is that...

599
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,880
You're going to get me canceled by property. Yeah, you're going to get canceled by property.

600
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,840
I'm so sorry. It's time somebody brought down Naomi Klein, and there's going to be this podcast.

601
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,120
My most cancelable opinion is that the anti-racist movement has become so concerned with

602
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:36,360
intellectual property. Whether that's, you know, having beef with POC, because, oh,

603
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:41,560
that lumps us all in together. Or whether that's saying, okay, well, if we use the slogan,

604
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:48,440
you can't use the slogan. And how different that was to the ethos of the Black Panther movement.

605
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,560
Black Panther movement is like, you want to call yourself the Yellow Panthers? Amazing.

606
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:58,120
Like you want to call yourself the White Panthers? Amazing. Whereas we're so concerned with drawing

607
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,320
these lines of separation in between, it's fundamentally liberal. It's liberal in the

608
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:09,240
sense that liberalism perceives other people always as a threat and an incursion rather than

609
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,800
what are the generative, creative relationships that occur between people.

610
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:21,720
And obviously, it comes from real injustices, right? I mean, it comes from real examples of

611
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:26,600
intellectual theft of Black women not being credited for intellectual contributions to

612
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:33,080
movements for many, many decades. So I don't think it's just liberalism. I think it's also

613
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,800
a needed corrective. It has been a needed corrective. And I think it is also a needed

614
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:43,480
corrective to talk about how we want ideas to spread. But I think even this idea of

615
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:54,360
credit is a tricky one because credit matters when you have a commodity and it's either about

616
00:57:54,360 --> 00:58:00,200
your place within an attention economy or a literal economy where people make money from

617
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:08,760
doing these things. And of course, the appropriation of this stuff is wrong and it's bad. But to simply

618
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:14,760
receive credit is not the same as what is the basis of a movement which can really build.

619
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:20,840
And I'm not just talking about Black Lives Matter. I've also very much seen it with the

620
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:28,600
relentless focus on cultural appropriation from South Asian radicals in this country. And I go,

621
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:35,080
yes, I get it. I do get it. But okay, everyone recognizes that Henna comes from us. What next?

622
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,720
Like, why is recognition the thing we're striving for?

623
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:49,160
Well, you know, I think it comes down to people just trying to make a really screwed up system

624
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:55,080
work for them. And I think that if there is a genuine revolutionary project that has any

625
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:02,040
prospect of transforming this system to a more egalitarian one, there might be more openness

626
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:07,800
to challenging these ideas around intellectual credit and so on. But within capitalism,

627
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,400
someone's going to make money off of it. Somebody's going to get the credit. Somebody is going to be

628
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,360
on the cover of the magazine. And I think a lot of people feel like if they're not fighting for

629
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,560
it to be them, it's going to be somebody else. And they're right. They're absolutely right.

630
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:27,480
So I guess it all comes down to building that revolutionary project because without it,

631
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,240
I think we're just going to be fighting for our scraps.

632
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:38,200
I know this is a really big gear shift. But so Jewishness is really central to this book. It's

633
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:44,680
one of the threads which connects you and the other Naomi. It's central to the anti-Semitic

634
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:50,520
conspiracism of the globalists are doing this, that and the other. But then you also talk about

635
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:55,320
this doubleness of being both victim and perpetrator within the context of Israel. So

636
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:01,160
I guess can you talk me through how doubleness and the motif of the doppelganger brought you into

637
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:09,320
this sort of analysis of Jewishness, Zionism and Israel? Yeah. I came across a paper by

638
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:16,360
Caroline Rooney who's here in the UK who talked about Israel as a country with doppelganger politics

639
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:25,800
by which she meant that it was a nation that had like a fundamental split where the Israeli Jews

640
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:33,960
projected all of everything that they could not bear about themselves onto the Palestinian

641
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,680
and other. And then there's also like this sort of doppelganger at the heart of

642
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,600
the Zionist project, which is that of the new Jew versus the old Jew. So this is something,

643
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,080
you know, I quote Philip Roth, as I mentioned, with all apologies to my 20-year-old self who

644
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:55,560
hurled a Philip Roth book across my dorm room and vowed never ever to read another book by Philip

645
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:02,760
Roth. We will say things at least. But, you know, every, I was reading so much doppelganger

646
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:10,920
literature and I just kept seeing references to Operation Shiloh because 1993 doppelganger

647
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,440
masterpiece and I ended up finding it to be really, really useful because, you know, in part because of

648
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:24,360
that ridiculous seriousness thread, but also the ways in which it really engages with this sort of

649
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:29,800
the unshakable ethnic double, right, which is the double that is projected onto

650
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:37,480
people who are not white and Christian around the world, which is the double that isn't the

651
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:42,280
brand that you create that you think you have in the world. It's the one that other people create

652
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,640
and project onto you. So for Roth, it's Shiloh, who is the doppelganger of all Jews projected onto

653
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,960
them. But then it becomes, you know, a book about Zionism, limited in its critique, but

654
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:59,560
still interesting and he's very fascinated with the figure of the new Jew as a doppelganger of

655
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:04,760
the old Jew, of the diasporic Jew. So what's the new Jew and the old Jew? Well, the new, yeah. So

656
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:13,960
this is a project, a Zionism is to create a new Jew who is the, you know, muscle-bound, gun-toting,

657
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:20,840
strong Jew. Knows Krav Maga. I mean, there's, you know, there's, there's, there's, and I, you know,

658
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:27,560
I think that the critique from somebody like Roth, who is like a little, you know, it's an anti,

659
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:33,960
it's a kind of an, like an anti-literary, you know, you with your books who couldn't save

660
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:42,280
yourselves from, from the Holocaust, we new Jews will protect you. And so it's this, there's,

661
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:47,800
there's, there's that doppelganger in Israeli culture, old Jew, new Jew. And there's a way

662
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:54,120
that it blames the victims of the Holocaust for the Holocaust, mostly unspoken, sometimes spoken.

663
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:59,560
And, and then there, and this is what Rooney was writing about, the way

664
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:08,440
Israel settler colonialism is a doppelganger, becomes a doppelganger of the ways Jews were

665
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,040
treated in Europe, not, she's not talking about the Nazis and neither am I, but she is talking

666
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:17,320
about the pogroms, the ghettoization, all the enclosures, the second-class citizenship,

667
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,440
the apartheid system that, that is in Israel. You know, this has been some of the more

668
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,360
controversial parts of the book. It's a little bit of a twist for people who thought that the

669
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:31,000
book was just going to be about, you know, feeling superior to Naomi Wolfe and Steve Bannon.

670
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,840
Yeah, suddenly we're in Gaza.

671
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,040
So what happened when you were in Gaza?

672
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:43,880
Oh, that's a story. Yeah. So that's what I mean. So I was in Gaza,

673
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:51,240
shock doctrine had come out. And, you know, my previous books had been published in Hebrew.

674
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:57,000
And I'd been approached by some Israeli publishers to publish the shock doctrine.

675
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:05,160
It had, the shock doctrine has a chapter on Israel and its role in what I call the disaster

676
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:11,720
capitalism complex. And it looks at the export of all of these Israeli spy and surveillance

677
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:19,720
and military tools. So I wanted the book to come out in Hebrew, but I also had written in

678
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:27,240
support of BDS and was in contact with the BDS committee. And so we tried to figure out a way

679
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:31,560
for shock doctrine to come out in Hebrew and Arabic at the same time with an activist publisher

680
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:36,120
called Andalus that doesn't exist anymore, that up to that point had only published Arabic writing

681
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:42,920
and translation. So, you know, I launched the book on the West Bank. You know, we did a lot of

682
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:48,120
things to make, you know, to as much as possible have a book come out in Hebrew that did not

683
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:52,760
support the Israeli state. It's complicated because most arts organizations get money and so on. But

684
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:58,440
anyway, we did our best. It was blessed by the BDS committee. But before I went on the book tour,

685
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:06,120
I wanted to go to Gaza to do some reporting. And yeah, so there's a scene in the book about

686
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:10,920
coming back from Gaza through the era's checkpoint. We had no trouble getting into Gaza because at

687
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,600
that point, they didn't know who I was at the checkpoint going in. But coming back because

688
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:26,520
I had done a press conference in Gaza and talked about BDS and talked about, I mean, there had

689
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:31,640
just been a huge assault on Gaza a few months earlier. When we came back through the checkpoint,

690
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:37,640
they were waiting for us. And there was this really bizarre experience that we had where first

691
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:46,840
they kept us waiting for about three hours. It's very strange because there's no way to

692
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:51,400
communicate. There's just the wall. You're on the other side of the wall and there's surveillance

693
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,440
cameras everywhere. They see us. We're the only ones there and they won't open the gate to let us

694
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:01,240
through. But if you are there past curfew, then you can't get through and you're in this sort of

695
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:08,280
weird zone where there's nothing there. So finally, the door opens. We go through the

696
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:14,200
security check and then they take my husband, Avi, and there's a guy who introduces himself as

697
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,280
Ares from Ares. So you've got another doppelganger. Another doppelganger. They just follow me

698
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:25,560
everywhere. So Ares from Ares takes Avi upstairs and he meets General at his corner office.

699
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:34,440
And he gets this huge speech where they tell him that look out the window and there's a bunch of

700
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:39,960
like tanks doing a security exercise. And they say, do you know how close we were to sending

701
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:44,280
in ground troops to Gaza? Which at that point, there had never been ground troops sent into Gaza

702
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:51,480
since the blockade. And we were going to send them in to rescue you. You have no idea how much

703
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:55,960
danger you were in. We were in no danger. I mean, we were hosted by Palestinians,

704
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:02,840
like we were invited. And they said, we see everything, we hear everything,

705
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:14,760
and we were going to reinvade Gaza to rescue you and get your woman under control. Literally,

706
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:20,920
they said that to Avi about me, like we know what she's been saying. And we don't care what you say.

707
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:25,400
Because you're Jewish and we will rescue you. So they were saying, you have a doppelganger.

708
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:32,760
Just as the rest of the world only sees you as Shylock, we only see you as Jews. We don't care

709
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:39,560
about your politics or what you say. We will rescue you from the Palestinian enemy, even though you

710
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:44,520
think that they're your friends. It was just the biggest mindfuck you could possibly imagine.

711
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,680
And it's also deeply manipulative. It's like there'll be a ground invasion of Gaza.

712
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:55,160
Because of you and your supposed solidarity with these people, we're going to invade them

713
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:01,560
even more than we ordinarily do. I never told that story. I mean, I wrote about what we saw in

714
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:06,920
Gaza and reported on the aftermath of that invasion. There have been so many since. But I

715
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:13,720
never told the story of that particular gaslighting mission that they did with eras from eras.

716
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:19,560
And but to me, it's so, you know, I shared the story in the book and thanks for asking,

717
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:25,800
nobody's asked about it. Because we've got, we've got, I call it zionism

718
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:30,280
derangement syndrome in the UK, where if you try and make any arguments critical of zionism,

719
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:35,960
it gets pulled into Corbin and Semitism, the left. And it's just.

720
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:42,360
Well, there's something about the offer that they were saying, you know, that is really the,

721
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:47,560
you know, it's the, it's, it's, it's not just Israel that's making that offer. I think the UK

722
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:52,360
is making that offer with its militarized borders. It's, it's, you know, it's take the guns, take

723
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:58,840
the walls, take the prisons. We will keep you safe from the hordes. And, you know, when I look at

724
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:03,400
my doppelganger, you know, she seems to have thrown in with that ideology. She's got the guns and

725
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:09,640
she's, you know, talking about the wars on the border. And, you know, I think as the climate

726
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:16,120
crisis accelerates and the wars never end and poverty deepens, I mean, this is going to be the

727
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:19,480
offer to all of us. And we have to, we have to decide if we want to take the offer.

728
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:27,000
Yeah. I mean, I've got one, one last question, which is when so many different aspects of your

729
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,640
identity are attached to fucked up things. And in your case, it was, you know, your Jewishness

730
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:39,720
being invoked by this general to commit an appalling act of violence. But, you know, in my case, it

731
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:47,480
might be my womanhood being invoked to stomp on trans people or being a Westerner and what that means

732
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:53,960
for all of the, you know, extractive exploitative activities of, you know, Western corporations

733
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:59,880
and the things which fuel my own consumption. Yeah. When we're so tied to all of these things,

734
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,840
is it possible to have a stable identity? And is it even desirable to have one?

735
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:11,160
I think we are in a moment that we simply cannot bear as individuals. It's just too hard. I mean,

736
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:23,480
we are in this simultaneous unearthing, unveiling of, you know, unbearable networks of suffering

737
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:31,080
that sustain the lives of the privileged outside of the Shadowlands. You know, and I think COVID

738
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:39,960
acted as a unearthing and as a revealer of all the people who hold up our world and allowed

739
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:45,320
those of us who were able to be locked down to be locked down and bore all of the risk. And I think

740
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:49,400
that generated a certain kind of derangement that is part of what I'm tracking in the book

741
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:53,240
of a lot of privileged people claiming that they were victims of genocide and apartheid

742
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:59,240
and Jim Crow and slavery and all the crimes of the last 500 years were projected onto a vaccine app

743
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:04,520
or, you know, being made to wear masks. But I don't think any of us are really looking,

744
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:12,600
are really able to look at the, just the unbearability of our complicity in these,

745
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:20,120
these past, future and present networks of suffering, extinction,

746
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:27,800
dispossession, we can only bear it together. You know, we can only bear it in the sturdiest,

747
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:34,120
widest possible coalitions. Like I quote Ariel Angel, the editor of Jewish Courants at the end

748
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:41,240
of the book saying, you know, we're going to need each other. And part of recognizing that we will

749
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:48,040
need each other in the face of surging fascism and climate breakdown means that we are going to have

750
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:53,080
to get over ourselves a little bit, you know, whether it's our individual brands or our individual

751
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:57,320
identity groups, which does not mean erasure, which does not mean annihilate the ego,

752
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:02,920
or dissolve into some mush of no difference that pretends that we are all coming into coalition with

753
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:09,720
the same risks, debts and needs. No, but we will need each other. And we, you know, I do believe

754
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:20,360
that every, you know, victory for the fascist right is also a story of division, sectarianism,

755
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,360
failure to make a strategic alliances on the anti-fascist left. And we're on the,

756
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:29,160
we are on the knife edge. We are just on the knife edge. We can't afford to destroy each other.

757
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:34,440
Just a little sprinkle of ego death, just a tiny, like a little salt bay sprinkle.

758
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:38,360
Yeah, find your doppelganger and just, just get humble if you can.

759
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:43,000
Yeah, snog your doppelganger if you can. Naomi Klein, thank you so much for joining us.

760
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,120
Thank you, Ash. This was really, really deep. Thanks.

761
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,120
Well, have fun at the BBC.

762
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:51,160
This is a good way to start.

763
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:59,960
I'm Naomi Klein, and I am at Navar Media right now, having just done a wonderful in-depth interview.

764
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:07,320
And this is why I love Navar Media. And I listen regularly and watch to find out what the hell is

765
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:13,160
going on in the UK. It is so critical to have independent media that we can trust that goes

766
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:18,200
deep on the issues and also lets people stay up on the day-to-day twists and turns. It's going to

767
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:24,760
be especially important for your next election. So I'm incredibly grateful that Navar Media exists,

768
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:31,240
and it exists because people support it. So make sure to support Navar Media. We need

769
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:36,200
left institutions, and that means that we have to support them when they're doing such great work

770
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:49,640
as Navar Media is. Thanks.
