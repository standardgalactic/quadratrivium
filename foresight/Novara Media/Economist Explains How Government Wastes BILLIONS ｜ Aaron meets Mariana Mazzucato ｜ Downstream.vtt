00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
Why do we only take things seriously when it's about war?

00:03.200 --> 00:07.520
And this is an important question today given that we have a terrible tragic war happening.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.520
But look what happened even in Germany.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.720
After months saying there was no money and there was a lot of pressure in government

00:12.720 --> 00:18.240
having to cut its budget, 100 billion was found overnight for the war effort.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.800
That happens all the time with war because we take it seriously.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.640
What do management consultants do?

00:29.600 --> 00:35.520
I think it's an important question because this is a global industry worth as much as a trillion

00:36.080 --> 00:39.520
dollars. And yet if you ask somebody like my dad, he drives a taxi for a living,

00:39.520 --> 00:43.520
or as a management consultant, he wouldn't have the faintest idea.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.400
Yet they play an increasingly prominent role in the public sector with extraordinarily large

00:48.400 --> 00:53.360
public contracts, whether it's test and trace or delivering healthcare websites to the United States.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.280
And of course, they're in business too.

00:56.240 --> 01:02.160
A new book by Mariana Matzikato, The Big Con, makes some pretty provocative statements.

01:02.160 --> 01:06.000
It says that actually, consultants don't just undermine democracy,

01:06.000 --> 01:12.160
they lead to less effective government. Mariana Matzikato, welcome to Downstream.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.920
Thank you. I'm very happy to be here.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.200
How are you doing more generally at the moment?

01:15.760 --> 01:17.120
Oh god, you really want to know?

01:17.840 --> 01:23.200
Oh my god, actually fine. I'm thrilled because this week I got to speak a lot with the Prime

01:23.200 --> 01:27.120
Minister of Barbados, Mia Motley, who I think is the hero of the 21st century.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.800
That's true. She's in the UK at the moment, right?

01:28.800 --> 01:32.960
Well, actually, so I was just in Barbados. I was in Barbados two weeks ago working with her,

01:32.960 --> 01:37.680
but she was supposed to be in London this week, but we ended up having her virtually.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.840
She was at the first event we had for this book, the launch event at the RSA.

01:41.840 --> 01:46.000
She was in dialogue with me about why we need not only financial space,

01:46.000 --> 01:50.560
which is what her big global mission is about, but also the kind of fiscal space and state

01:50.560 --> 01:55.680
capacity, which our new book kind of looks at why we don't have that. It was a great conversation.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.520
So your new book, you have many books. They're all very good. I have to say,

01:59.520 --> 02:03.040
actually, this is one of my favourites, the big con.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.560
But you're only halfway through, I can tell.

02:04.560 --> 02:07.920
No, no, no. I've made notes. No, no, no. I finished this last night.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.240
And it's going to sound strange how a book about the consulting industry is quite riveting.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.960
I think pretty people watching this probably won't believe me.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.720
They think I might be trying to flatter you, but it is because there are so many amazing stories.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.960
But let's start from the top. So what are consultants and what do they do?

02:25.920 --> 02:29.680
So first of all, there's different types of consultants. Some are more on the counting side,

02:29.680 --> 02:33.680
some are more on the strategy side. So Deloitte versus McKinsey.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.480
But there's also other types of consultants, which we talk about in the book,

02:38.480 --> 02:43.120
even though we don't focus on them, which have been organizations like Circo and G4S,

02:43.120 --> 02:47.440
where the government has actually decided to outsource a lot of its activities to those

02:47.440 --> 02:52.320
companies. We kind of treat them differently, but they're all part of the same phenomena of

02:52.320 --> 02:57.360
basically the decapacitation, if that's a word. I don't know if that sounds more Italian than

02:57.360 --> 03:01.520
English of government. So what do they do? They consult, they advise.

03:03.040 --> 03:07.680
But we look at it as an industry. This is a very important point. So there's many different types

03:07.680 --> 03:12.720
of consultants. You might have a head teacher of a school who might consult. A nurse could

03:12.720 --> 03:17.600
consult. A doctor could consult. Academics, myself, we could consult. But that's based on

03:17.600 --> 03:25.200
our expertise. It's not actually core to our lives. I might consult based on 20 years of research

03:25.200 --> 03:29.760
in an area. Again, a head teacher might have great knowledge about the schooling system.

03:29.760 --> 03:36.880
We look at a business model of the consulting industry as a sector, which is making lots of

03:36.880 --> 03:41.600
money consulting and where that business model has lots of different problems. It has conflicts of

03:41.600 --> 03:46.720
interest. It has lack of transparency and kind of a veil of secrecy. And especially we look at

03:47.520 --> 03:52.400
its role in, even though it's not its fault, because we look also at governments and we ask,

03:52.400 --> 03:58.560
why do you allow yourself to get captured in some ways by consultants? So easily we look at

03:58.560 --> 04:03.360
the co-evolution between consulting and some of modern problems in capitalism today from

04:03.360 --> 04:07.520
financialization to outsourcing. So you said there's a big sector. Some people watching this

04:07.520 --> 04:11.600
will be familiar with the names, McKinsey, Deloitte, et cetera. How big is it? What kind of numbers

04:11.600 --> 04:18.320
are we talking about? Close to a trillion per year. Wow. Yeah. And also it's rising. So the

04:18.320 --> 04:23.040
subtitle here, turn it around so I can remember what our subtitle is. The big con, how the consulting

04:23.040 --> 04:27.680
industry weakens our businesses and infantilizes our governments and warps our economies. The

04:27.680 --> 04:35.360
infantilizes our governments, but came from a quote by a Tory, so conservative Lord, Lord Agnew,

04:35.360 --> 04:40.720
who during COVID on the back of all the contracts that he was witnessing that the government was

04:40.720 --> 04:45.760
using to bring in consultants, you might remember that Deloitte was charged with the test and trace

04:45.760 --> 04:52.880
system, but also with Brexit, lots of money went to consultants. He said, oh my God, we are infantilizing

04:53.440 --> 05:01.280
Whitehall. In other words, if we keep outsourcing the role of government, we will stop learning.

05:01.280 --> 05:05.760
We will actually become like babies who haven't learned yet. We won't be doing,

05:05.760 --> 05:09.680
so we're not learning by doing. And this is actually something I've been talking about for

05:09.680 --> 05:14.880
decades. So it was very, not surprised, but it was very interesting that it was actually coming

05:14.880 --> 05:19.760
from the conservative side of government because it's not necessarily intuitive that that's where

05:19.760 --> 05:24.000
it would have come from. The numbers here are really impressive in terms of the growth. And

05:24.000 --> 05:28.080
it's something I'm pulling out of the book. This isn't my own personal research. This is so memorable.

05:28.080 --> 05:32.560
It's a fact. When Margaret Thatcher becomes Prime Minister in 1979, the British state is spending

05:32.560 --> 05:38.720
£6 million a year on consultants. When she leaves in 1990, so we're talking 30 years plus,

05:39.280 --> 05:44.880
£246 million. So it's gone up more than 40 times. And it's obviously gone up considerably more than

05:44.880 --> 05:49.680
then. This is hardly shrinking the state, is it? Well, that's what's so interesting. First of all,

05:50.560 --> 05:55.760
you mentioned Thatcher. So that's the bit that might be intuitive. You might think, okay,

05:55.840 --> 06:00.560
a government, a Reaganite government, a Thatcherite government, which is, I don't want to say

06:00.560 --> 06:05.440
anti-state because actually both of them spent a lot on things like war, right? I mean, actually

06:05.440 --> 06:09.920
what Reagan shrunk was the welfare state. My first book, The Entrepreneurial State, I actually looked

06:09.920 --> 06:16.000
at state investment in the US also during the Reagan years actually rising around whether it's

06:16.000 --> 06:20.160
the military industrial complex, but even the National Institutes of Health, which in the

06:20.240 --> 06:26.160
United States spent billions just last year, £42 billion on drug innovation, that happened also

06:26.160 --> 06:30.960
under Ronald Reagan. So we should also just remember that that's sort of been a propaganda

06:31.760 --> 06:36.240
that they put out, but didn't necessarily believe themselves. There was lots of state

06:36.240 --> 06:40.480
investment in both of those governments. It was actually more a war on the welfare state

06:40.480 --> 06:45.120
and really taking away a lot of the social fabric of society, which we've also seen recently in

06:45.120 --> 06:51.280
the UK with austerity for the last 10 years, all the cuts to very, very concrete areas,

06:51.280 --> 06:55.920
whether it's after school clubs, youth centers, mental health, I'm talking about what I just

06:55.920 --> 07:02.560
noticed in my community, let alone the kind of more macroeconomic figures, that's very different

07:03.120 --> 07:06.480
from just saying anti-state, right? Because there was actually lots of investment that

07:06.480 --> 07:12.320
went elsewhere. Anyway, so what's interesting is if you look at kind of a more conservative,

07:12.320 --> 07:16.800
in quotes, neoliberal government, you might intuitively think they want to reduce state

07:16.800 --> 07:21.760
investment and bring in the private sector, both through privatization, but also consultification

07:21.760 --> 07:27.440
of government. So that figure you just mentioned from £6 to £246 million is part of that. But then

07:27.440 --> 07:32.480
there's two questions. One, the one you just said that cost a lot of money. So in terms of actual

07:32.480 --> 07:37.360
expenditure by the state, it didn't necessarily reduce it, but was that really the point of

07:37.360 --> 07:42.640
Thatcher's government? I would argue no. It was actually to dismantle in some ways the ambition

07:42.640 --> 07:47.040
of the state or the structures of the state. And by bringing in consultants, regardless of how

07:47.040 --> 07:54.320
much it costs, and it costs a lot, you are helping to render the state actually in some ways weaker,

07:54.320 --> 07:58.720
at least the structures you might not necessarily care about, you know, health, education, public

07:58.720 --> 08:04.960
transport, again, very different on the military. And yet, one of the things we talk about in the

08:04.960 --> 08:10.560
book is how the real door opened to the consultants actually under new labor. So if you don't really

08:10.560 --> 08:15.760
have a strong idea of what the state is for, you want the state, so it's not the neoliberal idea

08:15.760 --> 08:21.440
of no state, you want the state, but you want it to look efficient and responsible and business

08:21.440 --> 08:27.520
friendly, then ultimately, you bring in business sector metrics into the state apparatus. So

08:27.520 --> 08:33.120
cost-benefit analysis, net present value in the whole idea in economics, which is that at best

08:33.120 --> 08:38.560
the state should fix market failures. So all my work has been saying that that's actually not very

08:38.560 --> 08:43.520
smart. What we actually need for all the problems we have, whether it's climate, health, digital,

08:43.520 --> 08:49.520
is co-creating and co-shaping not just the market, but the economy. Economic growth has not just a

08:49.520 --> 08:55.040
rate, but a direction. The sustainable development goals are 17 of them. That's about directionality,

08:55.040 --> 08:58.240
whether it's about hunger, poverty, climate, the digital divide, health.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.840
Is the UN sustainable development goals?

08:59.840 --> 09:03.440
Yeah, sorry, I always forget that not everyone knows about the SDGs. My kids actually went to

09:03.440 --> 09:06.480
state schools here in London where they sung about the SDGs. Oh, wow, that's progress.

09:06.480 --> 09:10.160
So I think, actually, interestingly, young kids probably know more about the sustainable

09:10.160 --> 09:15.920
development goals than you and me. But yeah, anyway, so the 17 sustainable development goals,

09:15.920 --> 09:21.760
very important, we've had them since 2015, not that long. They require huge ambition,

09:21.760 --> 09:25.520
they require mission, they require collaboration, collective intelligence,

09:25.520 --> 09:31.200
co-investment, so on and so forth. And what my work has been looking at since the entrepreneurial

09:31.200 --> 09:38.480
state is how if we don't have a proper understanding of the state as anything more than fixing

09:38.480 --> 09:43.440
market failures, we will always be too little, too late. We will always be just reacting.

09:43.440 --> 09:48.960
We will at best be filling the gap so that literally even public space will be just the

09:48.960 --> 09:53.920
space that you're allowed to fill up when private space is not there. Think of it even

09:54.000 --> 09:59.040
architecturally in some ways, but really in terms of even public goods and economics,

09:59.040 --> 10:03.360
the word public good sounds good. There's two words, one is good. If you actually look at the

10:03.360 --> 10:08.480
framing of it in economics, it's fixing a market failure problem that occurs when we have positive

10:08.480 --> 10:13.680
externalities. The new labor thing is really interesting for me because obviously they spent

10:13.680 --> 10:18.720
a great deal of money on things like the NHS compared to the Tories, historic amounts of money,

10:18.720 --> 10:23.280
they reduced child poverty, pensioner poverty, so people say, how could you say this? But actually,

10:23.280 --> 10:27.280
when you go into the nuts and bolts of how they did government, so for instance, I find this

10:27.280 --> 10:32.880
fascinating, you talk about this new delivery unit which is created under Tony Blair, which basically

10:32.880 --> 10:39.920
seems to me to be saying tacitly that government should just be done by management consultancy,

10:39.920 --> 10:43.760
or it should be a major part of the state's capacity, and it's not something which is just

10:43.760 --> 10:48.560
bolted on or an afterthought, it's central to how new labor wants to run things.

10:48.560 --> 10:53.840
Yeah, so one of the things I was just talking to Rosie about, she's my co-author, she's actually

10:53.840 --> 10:58.240
one of my PhD students at the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, is that in some

10:58.240 --> 11:03.040
ways you could sum up what you've just said as the fact that new labor had an idea of

11:03.040 --> 11:08.160
private public partnerships, not public private partnerships, right? So a public private partnerships,

11:08.160 --> 11:12.480
I would argue, is what we had with the moon landing. It was a public idea, there was strong

11:12.560 --> 11:18.480
public directionality, but ultimately there was 400,000 people involved, so many different

11:18.480 --> 11:23.920
private sector industries from nutrition, materials, electronics, software, it wasn't just aerospace,

11:24.720 --> 11:30.320
and what government had to do was to redesign all its different tools at the time, especially not

11:30.320 --> 11:35.760
only procurement, so government as purchaser, to catalyze as much bottom-up experimentation

11:35.760 --> 11:40.240
towards that goal, and the goal was getting to the moon and back in a short amount of time.

11:40.240 --> 11:44.240
I would argue that what new labor did was kind of forget, you know, what's the actual mission,

11:44.240 --> 11:48.480
the moonshot around health, around public education, around public transport. If you're

11:48.480 --> 11:53.840
going to bring in the private sector, you better make sure you're very clear what the public goal

11:53.840 --> 11:58.800
is, so you're working together to actually deliver on the moonshot, as opposed to just what we end

11:58.800 --> 12:04.640
up having, which is a lot of private activity in areas that used to be publicly run, and it's not

12:04.640 --> 12:09.040
about saying that's wrong, I think it's actually wrong to say it's about private or nationalization,

12:09.760 --> 12:13.600
kind of in a Corbynite kind of way, I think that's where Corbyn went wrong, it's about

12:14.160 --> 12:19.600
how do you actually organize that partnership, so it's truly about actually doing something

12:19.600 --> 12:26.160
good, purpose-oriented for people. Let's fast forward to Keir Starmer, because this morning

12:26.160 --> 12:33.200
he's talked about missions rather than pledges, now a cynic would say well he's exhausted the

12:33.200 --> 12:36.640
rhetoric of pledges, because of course he's broken so many from his leadership election,

12:36.640 --> 12:41.680
but for somebody like yourself, actually no this is substantially different, this means

12:41.680 --> 12:48.560
something quite different, but reading his missions, crime, decarbonization, they seem quite

12:48.560 --> 12:53.520
sort of ambiguous, is the point of a mission that's actually quite specific and measurable?

12:53.520 --> 12:58.720
So I mean I've had the honor to, I don't want to say be responsible, but for having written

12:58.720 --> 13:03.440
about missions and having actually seen it put into policy, so I first wrote about it,

13:03.440 --> 13:07.440
actually for a long time, but when I first wrote about it where it became policy was 2017

13:07.440 --> 13:12.080
for the European Commission, I said look guys, you're just talking all this talk about climate,

13:12.080 --> 13:16.480
about inclusion, it's not getting us any more inclusive or sustainable, they said what would

13:16.480 --> 13:20.240
a mission-oriented approach look like, and I wrote two reports on the back of which the

13:20.240 --> 13:26.400
European Union now has five missions and a large chunk of the horizon program, which was 90 billion

13:26.400 --> 13:31.040
euros, is now targeted through these missions instrument, so what's a mission at least in

13:31.040 --> 13:34.800
my approach, as you begin with the challenge, we talked about the sustainable development goals,

13:34.800 --> 13:40.560
but they're very broad, right, turning them into moonshots, so SDG Sustainable Development Goal

13:40.560 --> 13:45.440
13, you can turn it into something much more clear that you can actually answer yes or no,

13:45.440 --> 13:49.520
did you achieve it, similar to going to the moon and back in a short amount of time, very clear,

13:49.520 --> 13:55.440
you can answer yes or no, so whether it's net zero in a particular region, whether it's getting all

13:55.440 --> 13:59.920
the plastic out of the ocean if we're looking at SDG 14, but the main thing is to frame it,

13:59.920 --> 14:05.360
so it actually requires investment and innovation across multiple sectors of the economy, because

14:05.360 --> 14:10.560
the old industrial strategy in the UK was very similar to what we've seen globally, which is it

14:10.560 --> 14:15.600
was just a list of sectors, so in the UK under Vince Cable, it was aerospace, automobiles,

14:15.600 --> 14:19.760
the financial sector, the creative industry and finance, don't ask me how I remember that because

14:19.760 --> 14:23.920
I don't remember what I did yesterday, anyway, so the idea of a mission-oriented approach

14:23.920 --> 14:28.560
for industrial strategy would be to say why did you just make up those random five sectors,

14:28.640 --> 14:33.520
did they just lobby their way up, why not think of actually challenges like clean growth,

14:33.520 --> 14:39.360
healthy aging, sustainable mobility and so on, and they get all your different sectors to work

14:39.360 --> 14:44.160
together towards particular missions underneath that, and then again change those tools on the

14:44.160 --> 14:50.640
ground to foster that investment towards that, but that requires knowledge, capacity, implementation

14:51.280 --> 14:56.240
ability to actually then change the current status of like procurement, which is just money

14:56.240 --> 15:00.080
being given from the public sector, the private sector, to be outcomes-oriented,

15:00.080 --> 15:05.040
something by the way that many countries rediscovered with COVID, outcomes-oriented procurement,

15:05.040 --> 15:09.680
it's often a wartime tool, which is interesting, right, wars, people want to win wars, so they

15:09.680 --> 15:15.520
take them seriously, if you look at the public-private partnership in a war, when I've learned this in

15:15.520 --> 15:19.840
the US, when the Ministry of Defense, the Department of Defense funds health, sometimes they do,

15:19.840 --> 15:24.400
because soldiers get sick in the war, they don't get messed about by the pharmaceutical industry

15:24.400 --> 15:27.600
because they want to win the war, they want the soldiers to have access

15:27.600 --> 15:32.160
to medicines that the Ministry of Defense funded. When it's the Ministry of Health,

15:32.160 --> 15:37.200
in normal times, somehow we forget that the prices of the drugs should reflect that public

15:37.200 --> 15:41.600
contribution, that the intellectual property rights should not be abused to just become

15:41.600 --> 15:46.800
extraction tools by the sector and so on, so a missions approach has to lead to change,

15:46.800 --> 15:51.120
it should be a source of discomfort, I often tell ministers and policy makers, if you're

15:51.120 --> 15:55.120
getting really cozy with this idea, and it's just kind of a blah, blah, blah, you obviously don't

15:55.920 --> 15:59.840
understand it, because it should actually create change in how you work with the private sector,

15:59.840 --> 16:05.840
you need conditions attached, for example. In France under COVID, the Finance Minister Bruno

16:05.840 --> 16:11.440
Lemaire put strong conditions on Renault and Air France to get access to the COVID-19

16:11.440 --> 16:16.880
bailout program. Why? Because they had a very clear mission around, or challenge, actually around

16:16.880 --> 16:22.000
clean growth, they had to commit to lowering their carbon emissions to get any public money.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.560
In this country, where we're not used to having that conditionality, EZJet got $600 million,

16:26.560 --> 16:31.520
no conditions attached. So Keir Starmer, if he's interested in missions, has to then immediately

16:31.520 --> 16:36.640
talk about a new social contract with business. Let me stick a pin in this, I actually got a

16:36.640 --> 16:40.000
question if you're about China now you've said all that, but these are the missions from Keir Starmer.

16:40.640 --> 16:44.560
Secure the highest sustained growth in the G7, I mean at least that's measurable, right?

16:44.560 --> 16:50.000
But then build an NHS fit for the future, make Britain's streets safe, break down the barriers

16:50.000 --> 16:56.480
to opportunity at every stage, make Britain a clean energy superpower. Those last four just seem

16:57.840 --> 17:03.440
so ambiguous and the line, you can only manage what you measure. How do you measure progress in

17:03.440 --> 17:07.920
any of those things? Or am I being unfair? Are those the kinds of things that you would call

17:07.920 --> 17:11.920
missions? I would call those mission areas. So I think it's actually, well, first of all,

17:12.640 --> 17:17.680
we should congratulate him for actually even having a strategy for basically looking at those

17:17.680 --> 17:23.680
areas as ways that we would redirect an economy. Because now we have a problem with growth, but

17:23.680 --> 17:28.480
in general, the problem in the UK was not lack of growth, it was a problematic form of growth.

17:28.480 --> 17:34.880
It's a form of growth that is led by consumption, not investment. That consumption is led by private

17:34.880 --> 17:41.120
debt, not real incomes have not been rising very much in this country. So there's a lot of

17:41.200 --> 17:46.160
credit and private debt in the system to the point that private debt to disposable income

17:46.160 --> 17:50.480
in the UK is close to what it was just before the financial crisis. And that's what caused the

17:50.480 --> 17:55.280
financial crisis. So you'd think people would be like, oh, problems. Very few people are talking

17:55.280 --> 18:00.960
about this. Labor is not talking about it. Neither are the Tories. So the unsustainable level of

18:00.960 --> 18:04.480
private debt, which is interesting if you think about it, because we always talk about public debt.

18:05.840 --> 18:10.880
So it's very important, I think, to have those mission areas as a way to talk about

18:10.880 --> 18:15.680
the need to have investment-led growth, because all those areas are going to require investment.

18:15.680 --> 18:20.880
We've also had financialized growth in this country, where a lot of companies are making

18:20.880 --> 18:25.040
profits, but not necessarily reinvesting those profits into the economy. So anyway,

18:25.040 --> 18:30.640
so as soon as you talk about those bold areas, the question is, what does that then mean for

18:30.640 --> 18:34.240
the design of policy? What does it mean for an industrial strategy? What does it mean for

18:34.240 --> 18:39.200
procurement strategy? And I think the challenge is, so the first one I would say is not even a

18:39.200 --> 18:44.080
mission area. That's just economic growth. And that's going to happen as a result if you get the

18:44.080 --> 18:48.720
other stuff right. If you have an innovation policy and industrial strategy that catalyze and

18:48.720 --> 18:53.440
excite a lot of different actors, that then invest, collaborate, do those moonshots across

18:53.440 --> 18:58.880
different spaces, growth will hopefully result from that, because they all require investment

18:58.880 --> 19:04.160
and innovation, which can lead to productivity increases, for example. But the other ones could

19:04.160 --> 19:09.520
be mission areas. But the question is, what are they? So keeping streets safe. I mean,

19:09.520 --> 19:13.440
this is something that I think is incredibly important, because I've seen how in London,

19:13.440 --> 19:19.120
and I just happen to live in London, on the back of all the austerity that we had in this country,

19:19.120 --> 19:25.200
the social fabric at the community level was really broken. And so the rise in knife crime,

19:25.200 --> 19:30.160
for example. So you could have a mission at the city level, because a lot of these missions might be

19:30.880 --> 19:34.960
talked about nationally, but then they have to resonate with communities, where you might have

19:36.400 --> 19:39.840
citizen assemblies, you might have different types of democratic for also where

19:40.640 --> 19:44.880
people think about those missions. I only say that because I've worked on missions also in Camden,

19:44.880 --> 19:48.720
where I live, and we have the Camden Renewal Commission that I co-chair with Georgia Gould,

19:48.720 --> 19:53.440
and one of our missions that we thought about for Camden actually did have to do with use safety.

19:53.440 --> 19:57.680
And the idea there would be, how do we look at, for example, knife crime, not just from policing,

19:58.240 --> 20:02.640
right? So that's the kind of result. But if knife crime is actually the symptom

20:03.200 --> 20:07.280
of lots of other problems, think of all the social and economic determinants of crime,

20:07.280 --> 20:12.000
where a lot of the both victims, but also the perpetrators often come from broken homes,

20:12.000 --> 20:16.320
homes where there's a lot of problems, how can you really think of that problem in a way that

20:16.320 --> 20:21.600
bring lots of different branches of government together to think holistically with an all-of-

20:21.600 --> 20:26.560
government approach? That's a key factor in a mission-oriented approach. As I just mentioned

20:26.560 --> 20:32.080
before, going to the moon was not just aerospace. Solving climate is surely not just for the department

20:32.080 --> 20:37.040
of energy. Solving issues around well-being is definitely not just for the Department of Health.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.880
So it's not just about intersectoral that I talked about before. It's really that

20:40.880 --> 20:44.960
all-of-government approach. And that really then helps government become more dynamic,

20:44.960 --> 20:48.480
and that comes back to the book, because what we say in the book is that we don't have dynamic

20:48.480 --> 20:52.880
governments. We often have rigid, siloed governments, governments that have stopped

20:52.880 --> 20:58.080
in sourcing the capacity and capability they need to govern modern-day complex challenges with

20:58.080 --> 21:03.200
other actors. And if you have consulted that capacity, if you're asking Deloitte to do your

21:03.200 --> 21:08.800
test and trace, where Deloitte had no expertise whatsoever on test and trace, so it's not surprising

21:08.800 --> 21:13.280
it went belly up, then you have a problem, because you stop learning by doing. You've stopped the

21:13.280 --> 21:17.760
doing. How do they get these jobs? Because like you say, Deloitte had no, I mean nobody had any

21:17.760 --> 21:22.320
expertise in test and trace. Maybe a few countries in East Asia after the SARS epidemic.

21:22.320 --> 21:30.080
But so they've got no technical expertise in whole swathes of what they make money from.

21:30.080 --> 21:34.160
So what's their pitch? We've got no experience. Give us a multi-billion-pound contract.

21:34.160 --> 21:39.200
Well, I mean it just, I'm going to answer that question, but just to almost play,

21:39.200 --> 21:43.280
not devil's advocate, but just to put another thing on the table. At the same time that Deloitte

21:43.280 --> 21:51.280
did test and trace, which went very badly in the UK, the NHS did the vaccine roll out through a

21:51.280 --> 21:56.480
decentralized network of GP practices, and not only went well, it also became something

21:56.480 --> 22:01.200
we talked about. The politicians talked about it successful. So then the real question is,

22:01.200 --> 22:06.960
why didn't they invest more in this decentralized network of GP practices? Why did we not actually

22:06.960 --> 22:12.400
wake up and say, wow, what a great success story, and let's actually increase the investments

22:12.400 --> 22:17.040
within the NHS instead of doing what we're seeing today, which is that the real investments

22:18.000 --> 22:22.800
are not only not increasing, but there's a lot of stress within the system. We have junior doctors

22:22.800 --> 22:28.480
on strike, nurses on strike all over the UK. So this is also a very interesting question,

22:29.120 --> 22:35.360
because it's the parallel of the question you've asked. Now, what we look at is, why are we hiring?

22:35.360 --> 22:40.240
It's your question. Consultants in areas that they have no expertise in. We saw this also in

22:40.240 --> 22:46.160
Australia, where they spent over six million on McKinsey to do their climate strategy, and it was

22:46.160 --> 22:50.800
then reported to be a very faulty, problematic climate strategy. And the question there that we

22:50.800 --> 22:54.480
posed in the book is, well, there was also expertise within the government. It wasn't

22:54.480 --> 23:00.000
perfect expertise, but they have this organization called CSIRO, which actually has a lot of climate

23:00.000 --> 23:05.840
capabilities. So what is this kind of almost allergy to using not only your internal expertise,

23:05.840 --> 23:10.480
but not to actually invest in that expertise and just need that rubber stamp? Because that's what

23:11.360 --> 23:16.960
ultimately it is, a rubber stamp of McKinsey or Deloitte that makes both governments and businesses,

23:17.600 --> 23:23.680
one of the subtitles is weakens our businesses. Why is that? And we look at two different issues.

23:23.680 --> 23:31.120
One is that this dismantling of state capacity has also led to gaps where sometimes literally

23:31.120 --> 23:35.840
even just numbers of people don't exist. I experienced this with the COVID-19 recovery in

23:35.840 --> 23:42.000
Italy, where the Treasury basically outsourced the recovery to, I keep talking about McKinsey,

23:42.000 --> 23:45.920
but there's lots of these consulting companies. It's BCG, Bain, Pricewaterhouse, Cooper's and

23:45.920 --> 23:51.440
so on. BCG's Boston Consulting Group. Yeah, Boston Consulting Group. And so one thing is that as a

23:51.440 --> 23:56.000
consequence of not just the austerity, but the dismantling of state capacity, there often is

23:56.000 --> 24:00.800
the need to bring in others to help you out. But when those others don't have the expertise,

24:00.800 --> 24:04.080
that's the real kind of interesting challenge. Because of course, there's lots of expertise

24:04.080 --> 24:07.760
in universities, for example. And I'm not just saying this because I'm an academic, but I know

24:07.760 --> 24:12.320
some top climate experts around the world, like at the Potsdam Institute in Germany,

24:12.320 --> 24:17.360
they have amazing climate science. That would be a more natural place to go to for climate

24:17.360 --> 24:23.280
expertise. But the rubber stamp of the consulting companies is something that is looked upon as

24:23.280 --> 24:30.640
justifying as making good a government that is fearful, especially on the back of so much

24:30.640 --> 24:35.040
kind of government bashing, that somehow there isn't that expertise inside government.

24:37.040 --> 24:42.400
And also sometimes to make uncomfortable decisions. So this is also something that we don't blame

24:42.400 --> 24:47.120
consultants. We say that both with businesses and government, sometimes letting someone else,

24:47.120 --> 24:52.000
not so much take the blame, but have their kind of brand on it, allows you to maybe do some

24:52.000 --> 24:56.880
controversial activities in the private sector. We look, for example, at the downsizing trend,

24:56.880 --> 25:03.920
the financialization trend, by saying, oh, it was recommended by or rubber stamped by a consulting

25:03.920 --> 25:10.640
company, it might go down the throat easier. And so in that case, we say government, sorry,

25:10.640 --> 25:14.480
businesses should actually own up to the decisions they're made, as opposed to just

25:14.480 --> 25:19.120
requiring that rubber stamp of the consulting company. But also there's a risk averseness,

25:19.120 --> 25:23.360
there's a fear of making mistakes. And what's interesting, I've talked about this in other

25:23.360 --> 25:28.320
books, that whereas we celebrate risk taking and making mistakes in the private sector,

25:28.320 --> 25:32.960
as soon as a civil servant makes a mistake, bang front page of the Daily Mail, in this country,

25:32.960 --> 25:36.640
there's other, actually, there's not that many tabloids around the world, this country has a

25:37.920 --> 25:43.600
tabloid industry. That's about it, right? Sorry? Built in Germany. Exactly. New York Posts.

25:43.600 --> 25:48.800
Yeah, I mean, there are, but it's just incredible here, just the power they have. We've learned it

25:48.800 --> 25:56.320
in the recent Harry and Meghan discussions. But it's not just the tabloids, it's public

25:56.320 --> 26:02.080
servants, civil servants are not allowed to make mistakes, which is a problem. This is something

26:02.080 --> 26:07.440
we talk about. Trial and error and error, you would not learn how to ride a bike if you did not

26:07.440 --> 26:14.480
fall off. So the fact that governments, part of the consequence of outsourcing, privatizing,

26:14.480 --> 26:20.880
of consultifying is, in fact, what Lord Agnew, the conservative Lord who made this accusation,

26:20.880 --> 26:26.080
you know, that Whitehall was getting infantilized. Infantilized means you're kind of becoming a

26:26.080 --> 26:32.160
baby, you're not learning, you're not growing up, you're still an infant. And this was a Tory Lord

26:32.160 --> 26:38.160
saying Whitehall was being infantilized. And so, you know, this is one of the biggest problems that

26:38.160 --> 26:42.880
even though you might be doing it out of fear, because you'd prefer someone else to be taking

26:42.880 --> 26:47.360
the risk so you don't get blamed when things go wrong, you ultimately will get addicted.

26:47.360 --> 26:52.960
You will require that help constantly, right? Because you're not growing up,

26:52.960 --> 26:57.520
you're not building that capacity. And this is one of the things we talk about. We say that,

26:57.520 --> 27:01.520
you know, the reason, the sector, because it's the consulting industry that we

27:01.520 --> 27:06.720
kind of focus on, not just consultants, it's problematic is that the business model itself

27:06.720 --> 27:12.880
kind of relies on that next contract following. Whereas if you're a really good therapist,

27:12.880 --> 27:16.000
for example, you don't want your client to be in therapy their whole life, that probably means

27:16.000 --> 27:20.080
you're a bad therapist. The principal agent problem. Exactly. Exactly. Could you explain

27:20.080 --> 27:24.160
this quickly, the principal agent problem? Well, it's just about incentives. I mean,

27:24.160 --> 27:27.600
if, you know, I mean, the principal agent problem can be applied to different types of

27:27.600 --> 27:34.080
problems. But in this case, it's that if there is, we would call it asymmetric information in

27:34.080 --> 27:40.160
terms of a market failure, then the agent that you are, if you want, you know, consulting for

27:40.160 --> 27:45.040
doesn't necessarily have knowledge about, you know, the contract in this case. And in fact,

27:45.040 --> 27:48.720
this is one of the things we talk about, which is that there is a veil of secrecy and lack of

27:48.720 --> 27:54.240
transparency in the contract. So in South Africa, for example, you might have, what we have had,

27:54.240 --> 27:59.600
consultants who the same consultant is advising SCOM, which is a state-owned energy company.

27:59.600 --> 28:03.360
And it's also advising the Ministry of Finance, which in theory is regulating

28:04.080 --> 28:08.640
SCOM, right? So you can't be on both sides of the street. And if you are, that better be very

28:08.640 --> 28:13.600
transparent and known to the government. And so one of the, you know, this kind of conflict of

28:13.600 --> 28:19.440
interest. Was that legal? Well, that's what's really striking, actually, that it's legal.

28:19.440 --> 28:24.720
And we talk about all the different consultants who are both advising the fossil fuel industry,

28:24.720 --> 28:29.920
while at the same time advising on ESG metrics, right? As though it's all fine and the same.

28:29.920 --> 28:34.800
Of course, it's not. You can't be helping and actually in some ways fostering a fossil fuel

28:34.800 --> 28:40.560
industry to be increasingly successful in making record-level profits today, while, you know,

28:40.560 --> 28:45.040
on the other side of the street pretending that you're an expert around environmental and social

28:45.040 --> 28:50.320
governance metrics, which is all about companies actually becoming greener or societal, you know,

28:50.800 --> 28:55.120
more good for society. There's lots of amazing stories in the book. And like I said at the

28:55.120 --> 29:01.680
top, that's why it's really riveting these case studies of failure. But one of the more dazzling

29:01.680 --> 29:07.120
ones is the story of healthcare.gov, of course tied up with ObamaCare. Can you tell us a little

29:07.120 --> 29:12.640
bit about healthcare.gov, why it failed, and what that has to do with consultants?

29:12.640 --> 29:16.880
Sure. I mean, it's actually part of a much bigger problem because one of the capabilities we say

29:16.880 --> 29:21.360
that has been decimated within governments is actually their ability to govern digital platforms.

29:22.560 --> 29:28.400
And one of the areas by consequence that is increasingly consultified, so consultants are

29:28.400 --> 29:33.600
being brought into, has to do with precisely that area, the kind of, let's just call it,

29:33.600 --> 29:41.840
the digital area of government. Now, this is not a small problem in 21st century, 22nd century

29:41.840 --> 29:47.200
soon. Capitalism, if you don't know how to govern digital platforms, you won't be able to have a

29:47.200 --> 29:52.240
climate strategy, a health strategy. Think of the infodemic side of COVID-19. In fact, I did a

29:52.240 --> 29:56.800
report on which countries globally did better in COVID-19. It actually was countries that actually

29:56.800 --> 30:01.920
had invested in areas including digital platforms because of that very important information,

30:02.480 --> 30:06.320
processing side of things, including by the way, Test and Trace, which we touched on before.

30:06.320 --> 30:12.400
So healthcare.gov, of course, is famous because the U.S. government, as we know, doesn't really

30:12.400 --> 30:17.520
have a public health program. A lot of people in the U.S. die actually not because they're sick,

30:17.520 --> 30:22.080
but because they can't afford healthcare. This is one of the reasons I'm very proud to live in

30:22.080 --> 30:29.200
Europe. The NHS in the U.K. is very important in terms of giving everyone access to healthcare.

30:29.920 --> 30:37.360
Now, the problem is that what was also called Obamacare, so Obama finally gets through a program

30:37.360 --> 30:43.520
which, by the way, Hillary Clinton had tried to get through when her husband was president,

30:43.520 --> 30:53.760
it had a web site where people could access in order to sign up for healthcare in the U.S. from

30:53.760 --> 31:01.440
the Obamacare program, and as soon as it opened up, it basically crashed and government was blamed,

31:01.440 --> 31:07.920
but actually it wasn't government that had governed it, it had been outsourced, it had been

31:07.920 --> 31:14.720
outsourced to private actors, and this is a huge problem, first of all, because it's central,

31:14.720 --> 31:19.680
like how you actually govern the digital side of a program, whether it's health or climate,

31:20.640 --> 31:25.760
so if you are outsourcing your core, that's a problem. If you're outsourcing something that's

31:25.760 --> 31:34.640
peripheral, perhaps it doesn't matter, catering or something. This is actually not just around

31:34.640 --> 31:40.560
health, as I just mentioned. If you look at the weakening of government, it's precisely around

31:40.560 --> 31:44.320
those kind of areas, and so unless they're investing in their own digital capacity,

31:44.320 --> 31:49.280
they won't be stronger and they will become increasingly needing to have others to come

31:49.600 --> 31:53.520
in, but in that particular case, also, those that had been brought in to do the digital side

31:53.520 --> 31:59.680
weren't very capable. It costs $1.7 billion. $1.7 billion for a website is just extraordinary,

31:59.680 --> 32:04.960
and on the first day of opening, six people could use it. People, like you say, blamed the state,

32:05.600 --> 32:07.520
but they should have been blaming management consultancies.

32:09.600 --> 32:15.200
Yeah, I mean, that's again the irony, because I just mentioned before that part of the answer to why

32:15.200 --> 32:21.360
governments are allowing consultants to have so much power is the risk, the kind of worry

32:21.360 --> 32:26.720
of getting things wrong and thinking that somehow management consultant will not only bring in maybe

32:26.720 --> 32:31.200
some expertise, which as I just mentioned often, we don't have, but also get the blame if things

32:31.200 --> 32:35.200
go wrong, and yet things continue to go wrong and they're not actually held accountable.

32:35.200 --> 32:41.360
So even how those contracts are designed, they've actually kind of become almost risk-free for the

32:41.360 --> 32:46.400
consultants, and so it's not only costing government a lot of money. In theory, they're

32:46.400 --> 32:52.480
sometimes pitching it as though it's going to help them cost less, so reduce deficits by letting

32:52.480 --> 32:58.000
others undertake public programs. So we have kind of three different problems. It's costing a lot

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
of money. It's actually not delivering, and when things go belly up, the blame comes back to

33:02.000 --> 33:08.960
government. So it's actually a toxic cocktail, and you'd think that it would be better known how

33:08.960 --> 33:13.280
problematic this is. And I think one of the things we were kind of pleasantly surprised,

33:13.280 --> 33:19.120
but not so surprised, is just how much the book has spoken to people both in the business community

33:19.120 --> 33:25.520
and government communities at different level, city, local, regional, national, global, precisely

33:25.520 --> 33:31.520
because it's almost scandalous at every level. I must say though that we're not there to blame

33:31.520 --> 33:36.320
consultants. In fact, we spoke to many different consultants, especially young kind of 30-year-old

33:36.320 --> 33:42.000
consultants who go into the industry also wanting to do good. This isn't a book about the bad guys

33:42.000 --> 33:50.720
trying to do terrible things around the world, and they are disillusioned when you see that kind

33:50.720 --> 33:56.720
of operating on both sides of the street or the not hypocrisy, but that kind of treating any of

33:56.720 --> 34:02.160
the latest trends, whether it's ESG and climate or shareholder value maximization on kind of the

34:02.160 --> 34:07.200
other extreme in terms of problematic tendencies and modern-day corporate governance is almost

34:07.920 --> 34:12.800
equally available places to kind of leech onto to provide your consulting services,

34:12.800 --> 34:17.040
you start to lose faith that this is actually really about making the world a better place.

34:17.840 --> 34:24.400
We do make some specific recommendations at the end because it's not enough just to complain and

34:24.400 --> 34:30.000
to kind of denounce, and we talk about the need to make contracts much more transparent, precisely

34:30.000 --> 34:34.160
on all the different types of areas that you're consulting in so you can see those conflicts of

34:34.160 --> 34:39.280
interest, making contracts so they actually embed learning precisely so you don't have those kind

34:39.280 --> 34:44.080
of repeat contracts so that you actually show that you're cumulatively adding value so the

34:44.080 --> 34:49.760
organization in question ultimately shouldn't need you. That example I gave from therapy before,

34:49.760 --> 34:53.120
if you have someone in therapy their entire life, you're probably not doing your job very well,

34:54.880 --> 34:59.920
and I think if you look at all the different problems we have globally, they do require

34:59.920 --> 35:04.240
lots of different actors where the consultants might have a role, but first of all we need to

35:04.240 --> 35:08.480
make sure they actually have expertise in that area so we should definitely become much more aware

35:09.120 --> 35:14.080
where those areas of expertise lie, but also how do we make sure the ecosystem between these

35:14.080 --> 35:18.000
different actors is truly kind of a symbiotic mutualistic one and not a parasitic one?

35:18.640 --> 35:22.960
Consultancy is one of those things where I mean I I'd obviously heard of it before I graduated,

35:23.680 --> 35:27.520
I'll start that again. Consultancy is a strange one because I'd heard of the term before I

35:27.520 --> 35:33.040
graduated, I graduated in 2007, bad luck, so it was a really interesting year because at the

35:33.040 --> 35:36.960
start of the year as an undergraduate everybody you know all you could hear at University College

35:36.960 --> 35:43.840
London where you teach, McKinsey, Deloitte, Macquarie, HSBC, Banco Santander, everybody had an internship

35:43.840 --> 35:48.320
with a bank or a consultancy and then within a year it dropped like a lead balloon so it was

35:48.320 --> 35:54.560
really fascinating to see that, but if I said to my dad as a graduate, oh I've got a job as a

35:54.560 --> 35:59.760
consultant, he would say what the hell is that? What do you do? I mean he thinks that anyway

35:59.760 --> 36:05.120
actually with Navarra Media, but it's one of those things where I had a pet theory which is

36:06.320 --> 36:13.520
particularly in Anglo-America since the late 1990s we have a massive overproduction of very clever

36:13.520 --> 36:18.320
generalist graduate students, humanities in particular but also you know in the sciences

36:18.320 --> 36:21.600
and they don't really know what they're going to do, they're sort of aimless, very ambitious,

36:22.160 --> 36:27.520
very conscientious people and it seems to me lots of those people gravitated towards

36:28.080 --> 36:32.560
consultancy as a job and it almost seems to me and obviously I don't think you've written that

36:32.560 --> 36:38.080
in the book, it almost strikes me as a shame because having this concentration of people that

36:38.080 --> 36:43.440
want to do problem solving, highly competent, it seems like a massive misallocation of human

36:43.440 --> 36:47.760
resources basically. But we do talk about that in the book, we say wouldn't it be great if all this

36:48.640 --> 36:52.720
desire to do good in the world actually also resulted in more of these young

36:52.720 --> 36:56.880
people going into government and we also talk about this self-fulfilling prophecy that the

36:56.880 --> 37:01.840
more we've had this kind of backlash against government, what Tony Jutt in his book, Ill

37:01.840 --> 37:07.040
Ferris the Land, calls a discursive battle like literally just talking about administration instead

37:07.040 --> 37:11.520
of kind of like a ministry out there trying to do really difficult things or what I've talked about

37:11.680 --> 37:18.480
market fixing, not market shaping, de-risking, not taking risks, simply enabling, redistributing

37:18.480 --> 37:22.560
and regulating instead of being a true value creator. It's not actually a coincidence that it

37:22.560 --> 37:27.360
becomes much more sexy to go into the McKinsey's, the Macquarie's even though I have a whole

37:27.360 --> 37:32.240
theory about Macquarie anyway, but the Goldman Sachs isn't the Googles, right? So there is that

37:32.240 --> 37:36.080
self-fulfilling prophecy and it's not a surprise I've actually taken the time to set up a whole

37:36.080 --> 37:40.720
institute for innovation and public purpose at UCL which is all about rethinking the state,

37:41.360 --> 37:47.200
bringing purpose to the center of policy making, but also really having a theory of value creation

37:47.200 --> 37:51.280
with the state at the center, not to say the state is more important than any other actor,

37:51.280 --> 37:55.680
but it's very, it's important in terms of leading at least in democratically elected

37:55.680 --> 38:00.160
societies and then using all the tools that has to bring together that kind of stakeholder value,

38:00.160 --> 38:05.360
lots of different actors to solve really complex problems, drive collective intelligence,

38:05.360 --> 38:09.200
the sexy word, but that needs to be embedded in the contracts. You can't have collective

38:09.200 --> 38:13.360
intelligence if again intellectual property rights are abused. They're currently too wide,

38:13.360 --> 38:19.440
too strong, too upstream and yet an intellectual property right is a contract that for 17 years,

38:19.440 --> 38:24.240
the state has given to the private sector. So you need to govern that in the public interest

38:25.280 --> 38:29.600
and the capacity to do so I think has withered away to govern those particular contracts,

38:29.600 --> 38:34.160
but any contract whether it's a procurement contract or an intellectual property right

38:34.160 --> 38:38.400
should have the public interest at the center because that's the point of government. It's not

38:38.400 --> 38:42.480
just to help companies make profits. Do you think there's been a cultural shift as well,

38:42.480 --> 38:46.960
which is the fault here? So I'm a materialist, you have a materialist explanation for all this

38:46.960 --> 38:53.360
happening, but as an ancillary point, if you're an ambitious young person in the 50s, 60s and you

38:53.360 --> 38:56.960
want to change the world, you'd go work for a big government ministry and you would say,

38:56.960 --> 39:04.240
I want to go work for the department of X or I want to go work for NASA. And after the 60s,

39:04.560 --> 39:09.040
there's this idea that actually particularly progressives thought, oh, if you want to change

39:09.040 --> 39:13.760
the world, you need to be like Jane Jacobs or you need to be like Ralph Nader. You need to be on the

39:13.760 --> 39:18.560
outside, right? You need to be lobbying. You need to be lobbying and you need to be this active

39:18.560 --> 39:22.960
interest representation, but not institutional power. Do you think there was a kind of

39:24.640 --> 39:29.920
a big social error? Actually, all of a sudden, tons of talented people stopped going into

39:29.920 --> 39:33.520
precisely institutions when we need them to be? I don't know. I mean, first of all,

39:33.520 --> 39:37.280
I don't want to exaggerate the point about the people who are working in government. I mean,

39:37.280 --> 39:41.360
I work with governments globally, including in the UK, and it's full of incredibly,

39:41.360 --> 39:45.440
not only smart, but people really with ethics at the center, they go into government because

39:45.440 --> 39:49.600
they're interested in, you know, to put it simply, making the world a better place.

39:49.600 --> 39:55.520
I think what's happened though is that there's so much backlash on government. There's such a

39:55.520 --> 39:59.440
cartoon image, you know, I talk about this in the entrepreneurial state, like the kind of

39:59.440 --> 40:05.280
Kafkaian bureaucrat and then the cool, you know, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk today, that actually,

40:05.280 --> 40:09.360
what we've seen is also a hemorrhaging of that talent. I mean, so in other words, it's been a

40:09.360 --> 40:16.960
much more explicit, intentional problem than sort of what you just described. Also, in the 1960s,

40:16.960 --> 40:21.040
I learned this when I was running Mission Economy, the average age in the mission control room for

40:21.040 --> 40:28.160
Apollo was 26. So crazy. Very, very young, average age. There was younger people. And yet,

40:28.160 --> 40:32.400
at that time already, a lot of this outsourcing was happening to the consultants, literally,

40:32.400 --> 40:37.360
actually to McKinsey. In that particular case, McKinsey began in the mid-20s. And the head of

40:37.360 --> 40:42.800
procurement for NASA, this guy, Ernest Brackett, said, if we continue this, we won't even, you know,

40:42.800 --> 40:46.400
not only won't we know how to get to the moon, but we won't even know how to write

40:46.400 --> 40:49.920
the contracts with the private sector because they were working with lots of private sector

40:49.920 --> 40:56.560
companies. And his quote was, we will get captured by brochuremanship. It's endearing because they

40:56.560 --> 41:00.480
didn't really have PowerPoints at the time that these consultants have today. They had

41:00.480 --> 41:06.400
sexy brochures. So the idea that you would get captured by the brochure was not to say, oh,

41:06.400 --> 41:09.440
we don't want to work at the private sector. It was more like, we won't know which private

41:09.440 --> 41:12.400
sector companies to work with. And I would actually argue that's what we have today.

41:12.960 --> 41:20.000
We have, definitely, if you look at the contracts, we have a very unbalanced power in terms of even

41:20.000 --> 41:25.040
the legal expertise. But the problem is not that there's not enough public or private investment,

41:25.040 --> 41:30.000
is that partnership is not, it's not a dynamic one. It's not purpose-oriented. It's not fair.

41:30.000 --> 41:35.200
It's not just. There's often, again, socialization of risk, privatization of rewards. And you can

41:35.200 --> 41:40.880
fix that in the contracts. NASA actually had a clause in its contracts, no excess profits.

41:40.880 --> 41:45.200
It's great. Not no profits. You don't get to the moon with philanthropy, charity. Of course,

41:45.200 --> 41:50.400
you can make profits, but not excess. In excess of what? Of what you've done. So as soon as you

41:50.400 --> 41:55.280
have a whole kind of narrative and discourse that all the value is getting created in the private

41:55.280 --> 42:00.640
sector and the state is just there to facilitate, enable, work on the sides, then it's much easier

42:00.640 --> 42:05.440
to get these very problematic contracts that socialize risks and privatize rewards and allow

42:05.440 --> 42:09.920
excess profits to be earned by some who are doing good stuff, but not everything.

42:10.720 --> 42:15.680
So somebody watching this from the left might think, oh, this is just social democracy, very

42:15.680 --> 42:20.480
vanilla. I actually think you understate your radicalism. I think it's very radical.

42:20.480 --> 42:23.440
Well, no, because that's why people don't like this, by the way. I got a lot of hate.

42:24.320 --> 42:27.840
The whole thing about not private-public partnership, but public-private partnership,

42:27.840 --> 42:32.880
and you might not agree with this, I think in some ways is reminiscent of the better

42:32.880 --> 42:37.680
features of the Chinese system, because there was a great talk by Eric X. Lee, who talks about

42:37.680 --> 42:44.240
the Chinese Communist Party. And he made a point on a separate interview, and he said,

42:44.240 --> 42:49.760
China has a market economy. We have private firms that try and make profit. He says the

42:49.760 --> 42:54.560
point is the interest of those firms, the interest of capital more generally to make profits,

42:54.560 --> 42:59.120
does not supersede political authority. Political authority always supersede, and obviously that

42:59.120 --> 43:03.760
has bad expressions of manifestations. But the point is political authority always supersedes

43:03.760 --> 43:09.200
the private interests of businesses or capital. And that's basically what you're saying, isn't

43:09.200 --> 43:12.400
it? This idea that political authority, democratically accountable.

43:12.400 --> 43:17.200
Yeah, because it's a democratically accountable thing in terms of not being a China fan.

43:17.200 --> 43:22.320
But the same theme is there, right? That political authority, with that accountability

43:22.320 --> 43:27.280
from people and the mandate from people, sets the agenda around, like you say, particular missions.

43:28.160 --> 43:31.520
And that supersedes the interest of capital. That's hugely radical, isn't it?

43:31.520 --> 43:35.120
So I once gave an interview, actually. I can't remember. I think it was to the Financial Times

43:35.120 --> 43:38.880
where I said that China is learning from the United States at the same time that the United

43:38.880 --> 43:44.480
States is unlearning from itself. So again, everything that's smart in our smartphones

43:44.480 --> 43:48.080
and not stupid was actually invested in by government, mission-oriented government,

43:48.080 --> 43:52.880
the internet, GPS, touchscreen, and Siri, all fruits of government investments.

43:53.600 --> 43:58.800
In some cases with private sector collaboration, but it was actually through a public sector

43:58.800 --> 44:03.520
problem that was required. So the internet came about because we needed the satellites to communicate,

44:04.880 --> 44:10.560
GPS, the Navy invested in it to know where all the ships were in the seas. So it's not actually,

44:10.560 --> 44:15.600
I mean, today it feels more like maybe a Chinese or kind of a top-down planning system. But that's

44:15.600 --> 44:21.280
actually how the United States developed. They talk Jefferson, but act Hamilton. People should

44:21.280 --> 44:26.080
only understand that because now the Hamilton musical. But basically, Hamilton was a very

44:26.080 --> 44:30.800
important US politician who at the time advocated for an industrial strategy whereas Jefferson was

44:30.800 --> 44:36.320
more free marketeer. The US has always talked the talk of the free market, but acted actually on a

44:36.320 --> 44:43.440
much more visible hand, not the invisible hand. Where I think, so the work on missions coming back

44:43.440 --> 44:49.360
to here is a speech this morning is all about that. In other words, or it should be about that.

44:49.360 --> 44:53.840
I mean, he's using the word. I'm very curious to know and perhaps work with them on actually

44:53.840 --> 45:00.720
making this real, the how. The how is harder than just the word. It's all about actually having a

45:00.720 --> 45:05.040
plan that's really difficult. Remember Kennedy said, we're going to the moon because it's hard,

45:05.040 --> 45:09.920
not because it's easy. So this isn't about one side facilitating. I'm Italian, facilitating

45:09.920 --> 45:14.320
means making something easier for someone else, like the word de-risking. So it's not about making

45:14.320 --> 45:18.960
it easier de-risking someone else. It's about tackling those really difficult challenges

45:18.960 --> 45:24.960
together. Now that requires a goal. That's going to be the end goal, but the how along the way

45:24.960 --> 45:29.600
really matters. How you design the financial institution with conditionality. You're not just

45:29.600 --> 45:34.080
giving out money. It's conditional on change happening within different sectors. You don't do

45:34.080 --> 45:38.000
it top down and tell them what to do because that could hurt innovation, but you do it with a strong

45:38.000 --> 45:42.800
direction. That's that public-private versus private-public bit that we talked about before.

45:42.800 --> 45:47.040
It means learning how to do, again, outcomes-oriented budgeting. So you're not just giving a bit of

45:47.040 --> 45:51.280
money here and there, but you actually have a goal where the budget itself, even at the city

45:51.280 --> 45:55.440
level, zero knife crime requires its own budget. You can't just give a bit of money here, a bit of

45:55.440 --> 46:02.320
money there, and then stir the soup and hope for the best. So I think what's interesting in China,

46:02.320 --> 46:07.120
though, is that they obviously have very clear targets. They had such high poverty that they

46:07.120 --> 46:12.000
really alleviated a lot of people out of poverty. They also are spending a huge amount on greening

46:12.000 --> 46:16.720
their entire manufacturing base because they have a huge pollution problem. So they don't

46:16.720 --> 46:21.040
have that myth of, oh, this is just going to happen through the free market. One of their

46:21.040 --> 46:24.640
problems, though, is they don't really have what I talk about in the entrepreneurial state,

46:24.640 --> 46:29.200
a decentralized network of different types of public actors. They have very large, for example,

46:29.200 --> 46:34.400
the Chinese Development Bank, which gave huge amounts of money to Huawei. Huawei would not exist

46:34.400 --> 46:39.680
without a guaranteed loan that was over $5 billion from the Chinese Development Bank.

46:39.680 --> 46:44.880
By the way, Elon Musk got over $5 billion from the US government for his different companies,

46:44.880 --> 46:49.120
including in the early stage of Tesla. It was a guaranteed loan from government.

46:50.640 --> 46:56.640
But in China, you have just these big chunks of money from institutions like the Chinese

46:56.640 --> 47:01.440
Development Bank. In the US, they had DARPA, the National Science Foundation, the Small

47:01.440 --> 47:08.080
Business Innovation Research Program, the Venture Capital Arm of the CIA, Incutel. But it has,

47:08.080 --> 47:11.760
at least in the US, been more around their military industrial complex. And what I've been arguing

47:11.760 --> 47:16.240
for is, why do we only take things seriously when it's about war? And this is an important

47:16.240 --> 47:20.320
question today, given that we have a terrible tragic war happening. But look what happened

47:20.320 --> 47:24.720
even in Germany. After months saying there was no money and there was a lot of pressure in government

47:24.720 --> 47:30.800
having to cut its budget, $100 billion was found overnight for the war effort. That happens all

47:30.800 --> 47:36.960
the time with war, because we take it seriously. And I'm very anti-war, at any war, but isn't it

47:36.960 --> 47:40.720
interesting that for war money comes out of the woodwork? Why doesn't it come out of the woodwork

47:40.720 --> 47:45.280
when we have war on poverty, when we want to strengthen our health systems, when we want net

47:45.280 --> 47:50.880
zero targets, when we have these social problems in our streets? So really, what I've been talking

47:50.880 --> 47:55.760
about for a long time is the need to create a mission-oriented economy around our social

47:55.760 --> 48:00.480
challenges, starting with the SDGs that we talked about. And with this book, the big con

48:00.480 --> 48:06.160
talks about is that that requires capacity. And if we continue to consultify that capacity,

48:06.160 --> 48:11.040
you won't know how to implement. You won't know how to work with others. And that's important,

48:11.040 --> 48:15.760
because I sometimes get accused as being just kind of folklorically loving the state. I'm like,

48:15.760 --> 48:19.840
no, I'm the state's kind of, I don't want to say biggest enemy, but biggest provocateur saying,

48:19.840 --> 48:26.800
what are you doing? You can't become agile, flexible, capable, and creative unless you

48:26.800 --> 48:30.640
actually invest internally in becoming a learning organization.

48:31.200 --> 48:32.240
You said you have haters.

48:32.880 --> 48:34.000
Well, who are they?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.560
Oh, God. I find them very hard to believe.

48:36.560 --> 48:43.360
If you're a woman, if you are progressive, if you're lucky enough to actually get media attention,

48:43.360 --> 48:50.240
but especially, this is the big bit, have impact. So different governments or even businesses

48:50.240 --> 48:55.840
start to implement some of your ideas. Are you dangerous? If you're just ranting and no one's

48:55.840 --> 49:01.360
listening, you're less dangerous. So I think when your ideas start to have impact, and I feel very

49:01.360 --> 49:05.680
honored because I'm not the only one who has some good ideas, I feel honored that I've had the

49:05.680 --> 49:10.000
opportunity to work with governments carefully, because it's not just about going to lecture,

49:10.000 --> 49:14.640
doing a TED Talk, and then leaving. Again, that's why I set up a whole institute to take care,

49:14.640 --> 49:19.760
have teams that help governments implement new policies, but also train, because that's the

49:19.760 --> 49:25.120
main thing we do. We have an educational program. You are much more dangerous to those who

49:25.680 --> 49:31.040
would love to see the state less able, less, not so much large, because I've never been about large

49:31.040 --> 49:38.480
versus small state, but a more capable state, a state that is truly purpose-oriented,

49:38.480 --> 49:44.800
a state that knows how to get a good deal in a contract is not great news for those who are

49:44.800 --> 49:48.400
making either a lot of money or having a lot of power by having a weak state.

49:48.400 --> 49:52.320
So do you think that some of the people you take target on this book, and I know you've said

49:52.320 --> 49:57.680
already, many good consultants, and you can see the role for certain services not being

49:57.680 --> 50:02.880
within a firm or inside a public agency, Navarra Media has an accountant. We don't have an accountant

50:02.880 --> 50:05.600
inside the organization. That's something that somebody else does, for instance.

50:06.880 --> 50:08.480
Is accounting your core business?

50:08.480 --> 50:10.400
Precisely, right. That's exactly why I would.

50:10.400 --> 50:11.360
Yeah, exactly.

50:11.360 --> 50:16.400
Is governing a digital platform, a core business of a government in order to make sure that the

50:16.400 --> 50:20.400
next pandemic, it can actually deal with the infodemic side of the crisis, of course.

50:21.120 --> 50:24.880
This is a trillion-dollar industry, though. So, like you say, you putting this in the

50:24.880 --> 50:29.760
crosshairs, and you are an influential person, that must put a mark on your back a little bit

50:29.760 --> 50:33.600
with some of these people. I mean, I've read the write-up in the Financial Times, for instance,

50:33.600 --> 50:37.440
perfectly civilized and polite, but there was clearly an undercurrent, which is,

50:37.440 --> 50:39.280
don't make too much noise about this industry.

50:39.280 --> 50:41.360
Oh, really? I haven't read that. Have you not read it?

50:41.360 --> 50:43.760
Have they made threats? They're going to come and knock on the door?

50:43.760 --> 50:47.760
Not threats. Not threats, but there's huge vested interest, basically.

50:47.760 --> 50:48.400
Of course.

50:48.480 --> 50:48.960
Oh, no, of course.

50:48.960 --> 50:49.760
Not having this conversation.

50:49.760 --> 50:52.000
Yeah, I thought that was actually quite funny, to be honest. I mean,

50:52.000 --> 50:56.880
the comments that were so defensive, and then all you had to read was the comments that came

50:56.880 --> 51:02.480
afterwards by others. I mean, I almost didn't have to reply. I think the fact that we purposefully,

51:02.480 --> 51:08.560
we say this several times in the book, that this is just as much a challenge to those that are

51:08.560 --> 51:14.720
hiring and that have stopped investing within their own capacity as it is to those that are

51:14.720 --> 51:19.040
making a lot of money by profiting from those that don't have that capacity.

51:19.040 --> 51:22.320
It's really a wake-up call to everyone, because I truly believe that in the long run,

51:22.880 --> 51:27.520
we all will benefit. The planet will benefit, the sustainability of the planet,

51:27.520 --> 51:31.680
but also all these problems we have around inequality will benefit if we actually have

51:31.680 --> 51:33.440
more capable actors all around.

51:34.320 --> 51:37.200
Mariana, thank you so much for joining us this evening.

51:37.200 --> 51:37.600
Thank you.

51:38.400 --> 51:39.520
It's a great book.

51:39.520 --> 51:40.000
Thanks so much.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.640
Congratulations.

51:44.720 --> 51:46.640
Thank you.
