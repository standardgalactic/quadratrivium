0	7320	The most shocking part of this book and of the two year reporting project that went into it was the aid section because everywhere I went.
7880	16260	I saw that aid was not benefiting largely there was small parts of it were benefiting the poor.
16260	25820	But largely was benefiting the richest people in the world the corporations and the local elite the second part of that is that this is not a mistake.
26140	39740	Originally when I first started reporting I was like okay well that they've obviously not thought this out when you start looking at the history of it and you look at how a developed out of full of formal colonialism you realize this has been designed from the start.
44540	54820	Most people understand that corporations have a lot of power too much power over all of our lives often private business interests can subvert democracy and the kinds of governments.
54940	61060	An act in the kinds of policies that people want but that can often be a vague feeling a suspicion.
61540	78060	I guess today has some meat to put on the bones whoever Matt cannot has been a journalist in this field for more than a decade looking at how private business often supersedes and undermines the will of peoples around the world.
78380	90300	Matt cannot welcome to downstream thank you for having me good to be with you but we're very happy to have you back on the bar after many years and we've got you back on to talk about your new book new ish book.
90700	99700	Silent coup how corporations over through democracy that's obviously the theme of a lot of the questions I'm gonna ask today really what's happened to moxie and what's the role of.
100180	108060	Private sector before we go any further tell our audience our viewers our listeners a little bit about yourself why are you an authority on the silent coup.
108420	119820	Good question because my day job is working for the classified UK and we focus on British foreign policy so this is a bit of a departure from that but essentially in 2014.
120820	131580	I started as a fellow at the center for investigative journalism in London and at the same time and another journalist called Claire provost is the co-author of the book she started as a fellow as well.
132060	143940	And she'd left the Guardian to take the fellowship I'd recently left the financial times and we started talking because we had two years of the contract was two years and the guy who gave it to us said.
144460	154140	You don't have to report to me you do what you want and you got a travel budget as well so we start thinking big we thought what are the biggest issues of the day in the world clear been covering aid.
154460	160620	In at the Guardian I've been covering sort of the World Bank and other places in in Washington when I was with the F.T.
161620	177300	And we just it was kind of a meeting of minds and we both kind of agreed that this is the biggest issue of the day in my opinion and hers and I think if you read the book is quite persuasive argument it should be everyone's opinion because what you've seen over the last
177300	185980	particularly since the second world war but this is a battle that's been raging since for four hundred years because that's when the first joint stock up modern joint stock company was invented in England actually.
186100	199220	And what you've seen is corporations have just gradually been trying to get as much power as they can from the state originally corporations were chartered by the crown so it was a privilege to create a corporation it wasn't a right.
199660	208420	Then there was a civil rights battle particularly wage particularly in the 19th century where lots of legislation came into place to unleash the corporation from the state in the UK.
208860	221260	Then later the US and then after the second world war this really went international that was the age of the multinational pretty much in the context of the Bretton Woods institutions which were created in nineteen forty four.
221660	230980	And that was the IMF and the World Bank principally but also later on the general agreement on trade and terrorist gap which became particularly important in sort of greasing the entry of.
231100	248380	Which is now WTO exactly in 1995 it became WTO it originally was gonna be a WTO but it took a long time gap the formation of gap was was a kind of stop gap and what it became was just rounds of talks so you had like a Kennedy round in the sixties where all countries got together and try to reduce tariffs mutually.
248660	254220	It wasn't that successful it wasn't certain rounds were successful the Uruguay round led to the WTO in the nineties.
254820	267220	But anyway so that whole architecture allowed corporations to really go international and the other part of this story which is really a visit to the thesis and I think understanding where we are today is that.
267740	272420	After the second world war formal empires were collapsing at quite a quick clip.
273060	280460	Particularly in the fifties and sixties and the people who have been in power for centuries the imperial powers and their financial sectors.
280740	294900	What's that they were thinking how are we gonna maintain our control of the world where we don't have a formal empire where we can't position garrisons of troops in a foreign place that can just take out a leader if we don't like if they start nationalizing our assets or wherever it was.
295380	307020	And there was quite a lot of conscious policy making at that time to try and create and this sounds like tinfoil hat stuff but it's all there in black and white in the archives of places like the world bank the IMF and other places.
307580	319580	So essentially they wanted to create a supranational system whereby they could bypass rebellious peoples bypass newly liberated countries bypass liberation movements in the developing world.
320060	338580	So they set about about that task in the book it's opens with what is called the investor state dispute settlement system and that is the first project that we started at the center for investing so that again the investor state dispute settlement system is called I SDS and it is.
339580	361580	The conspiracy theory theorist in me thinks that they give these institutions these kind of hard to say names and accurate long acronyms so people just switch off and that is the first reaction you get when you discuss these things but then you start explaining what this is you say okay well this is a shadow legal system whereby multinational corporations can sue states for enacting policies they
361580	383100	don't like which infringe on their quite and quite investor rights and it happens all over the world they're in shrine this system is enshrined in free trade agreements which are a bit of a misnomer because free trade agreement makes you think it's all about mutual lowering of tariffs but actually in embedded in these trade agreements a huge amounts of legal mechanisms whereby corporations can enforce their will.
383340	412580	On the countries that are part of that that agreement one of these is the ISDS system so NAFTA has ISDS provisions in it plenty of other free trade agreements so when the EU makes a trade agreement with the country in sub-Saharan Africa has ISDS and exactly and is the other part of this is what I call bilateral investment treaties or bits and they're all over the world between two countries and they just sort of their regime an investment regime that both countries have to apply abide by but ISDS is enshrined in nearly all of those.
412860	431300	So and is and is enforced so in the case of a corporation that wants to use a bit of BIT for example you can just create a shell company in a in a country that has a BIT with the country you want to sue and just and just see them that way that happens all the time so there's this whole web.
431780	444980	Of treaties agreements which enshrined this ISDS system and what it means effectively away from all the acronyms all the boring stuff is that corporations can sue some of the poorest countries in the world for huge amounts money billions of dollars often.
445420	460660	For for for enacting policies like not allowing the company an environmental permit to dig for gold for example that was one case we looked in our salvo there was one case in Egypt where a French water company sued the Egyptian government for raising the minimum wage.
460860	473540	So anything that a corporation doesn't like that government does they can potentially sue for now you would think that that is a massive attack on democracy and it is because the second part of it is.
474260	481380	It's not just the cases that get to court now these case most of these cases are heard at play school the international set center.
481700	493180	The settlement of investment disputes exit which is part of the world bank so that one again because we can have lots of these the investor limited exit international center.
493940	511340	For the settlement of investment disputes right exit it's an arm of the world bank it was created in 1966 at the height of what I'm talking about the height of the colonization and newly independent governments and what it is is the main venue where these cases are heard by.
512420	518660	It's also a kangaroo court there's so much to get out on this stuff but it's also kangaroo court because it's these decisions are made by three arbitrators.
519140	534460	One appointed by the company one appointed by the government and one agreed on by both these arbitrators have to have no there's no threshold for legal history or any kind of professional attainment but we found that a lot of them have.
535500	547140	Come from the from US administrations there are plenty that came from the Bush administration and other and the Clinton administration so and the decision and it's hugely secretive a lot of the documents you can't get your hands on.
547540	557940	But to go back to my point is that it's not just the cases that I heard it exit and and this wealth transfer to the developer to the corporations that is the major issue.
558220	566660	Regulatory chill and policy making sure is the major issue because if you have this huge infrastructure in place this huge web.
566900	577940	Of economic arrangements whereby multinationals can sue you it means that impacts on your thinking when you're devising policies in your countries and this is we saw this in a very specific way.
578220	585620	In places like Guatemala for example there was a case where we got free to information act documents from the Guatemalan government.
586220	594100	Showing internal deliberations about whether they should grant a might a multinational mining company an environmental permit next to this community and it was gonna be.
594380	607340	Effecting their their their community and their environment you think when a government is delivering whether to grant an environmental permit their main priority would be what impact does this have on our people.
607540	622820	But actually the internal deliberations within the Guatemalan government were about are we gonna get sued by that company if we need that policy they eventually gave them the environmental permit and that happens all over the world this chill this policy making chill and it's by design corporations wanna have an insurance mechanism.
623020	630500	Where they can get their profits and get there the policies they want in place above the heads of national governments.
631020	639060	You also use the example of South Africa yeah which is incredible so you have obviously post apartheid South Africa we've transitioned to democracy.
639340	648580	And in the mid nineteen nineties they're saying and companies which have mining rights in the country obviously it's been a phenomenal producer of gold diamonds etc over the years of Africa.
648700	656300	They're saying twenty six percent of kind of management or ownership needs to be in the hands of black South Africans.
656900	678060	And this is pushed back by Italian investors and so I think this is incredible moment where we're told in the west on our South Africa has transitioned to democratic government but in fact democratic elected government with an overwhelming mandate which what the ANC has in the nineteen nineties and it's basically one party state still is to an extent but with democratic legitimacy they can't do what they want.
678460	688340	Because of this regulatory chill you talk about can you talk about the example of South Africa a little bit yeah I mean this was the craziest case we looked at because we went to South Africa to report.
688620	704900	On the ground from what on what happened in that case and essentially it's like you say after apartheid black empowerment policies were bought in to make just the historical injustices of apartheid one of them was the all companies had to give a.
705220	714020	Percentage of their company to historically disadvantaged people so black people now this Italian company didn't like that and they said we're gonna and we're gonna take you to exit.
714820	727300	And essentially the whole case was kept really quiet by the South African government because they didn't wanna incentivize other companies to do it so it was really under the radar not many people in South Africa knew about this case.
727620	739240	And what happened was there was a settlement out of court where the government the government just want to keep it quiet so they said okay well you don't have to abide by this regulation so this Italian company didn't have to do it.
739680	748320	But afterwards the South African government tried to escape from the system completely and that in itself was interesting because a lot of what.
749080	765160	The systems are about is locking countries into these these systems and allowing no way out so one of the interesting parts of the bilateral investment treaties is that they have things called or they often have things called sunset clauses where even if you cancel them.
766040	773080	You can't that doesn't come in for 10 years by which time that these these people are hoping they'll be a different government doesn't have the same.
774080	781480	Predelection to get to get out it's interesting it's what what Thomas Roman called the he called it the golden straight jacket, but it's obviously not golden but.
782520	800000	But the South Africans were trying at interesting in Latin America the liberation governments of Korea Maduro sorry Chateau is in Venezuela and ever more as they all tried to leave as well during the sort of first pink tide in the 2000s and they found it very difficult as well.
801000	825000	And in fact I went to interview ever more at his house in Bolivia last year and he was talking about this system because he nationalized a lot of companies one of which was a British power company called rural act and rural act took Bolivia to one of these tribunals at this one was actually at the Hague and one tens of millions of.
826000	837000	Pounds from the Bolivian government so it's all over the world it's enshrined in these bilateral investment treaties in the case of South Africa another interesting part of it is we were talking to people that have been in the government at that time post apartheid.
838000	845000	And it said that actually these bilateral investment treaties were just presented as a bit of diplomatic goodwill so Mandela would go to Belgium.
846000	853000	And they'd say OK welcome back into the fold you're being reintegrated into into the global economy let's just sign this nice bit of paper this is what happened.
854000	864000	And then 1015 years later they get hit with all these suits that they didn't even know where it was possible to activate through these agreements and that's often how it how it's done it's a hugely secretive.
865000	866000	And.
868000	874000	Quietly done system which is why people like you who know you know about economics you know about these things a lot of the people.
875000	881000	Who I explained this to this sort of like why do I not know about this and I think that's by design they don't want people to talk about it.
882000	889000	But if you talk to governments that are trying to go against corporate rule within their own countries but also also internationally they all know about it.
890000	903000	Yeah so that's why ever Morales was talking about it when I was asking about corporate power because for him it was an extremely powerful way that corporations could override his decisions.
904000	914000	There are enforcement mechanisms that it's not like you can just say OK we're not going to listen to you if arbitration if they could if you're called to an arbitration you don't recognize it they can start taking your assets internationally.
914000	926000	There's a lot of ways of enforcing this system on developing countries so it's not like somewhere it's not like domestically where you could just used to be able to nationalize something and then you could.
927000	935000	You should pay compensation but you that would be negotiated this is like this international court would decide and you have to pay otherwise we'll start stripping you.
936000	950000	So what what I mean you sort of you alluded to it there but what would happen if they didn't pay so let's say Bolivia takes mining company owned by the US away from them court says no you need to.
951000	958000	They take it in public ownership and the court said this is quite reasonable one right rather than the case of the Italians in South Africa which is completely unacceptable I think.
959000	967000	They say no you have to give it back to them and they say no they find them a couple hundred million dollars they say well we don't recognize this court or this fine what happens then.
968000	976000	Well there's there's that there's actual legal systems in place where they can they can take your assets internationally so if you have.
977000	985000	Any kind of government assets in foreign countries they can be taken if you have boats in international waters they can be taken becomes illegal matter but also.
986000	994000	You can be massively punished by the Bretton Woods institutions themselves because it is part of the World Bank but also so the IMF.
995000	1005000	They can they can do really punitive things that mean that you basically can't function your credit lines will be pulled you won't be able to get liquidity if you need it in the time of crisis all these all these things.
1005000	1012000	All these things that make someone like everyone else who you who you would not expect to abide by a system that he doesn't think is just.
1013000	1023000	He abided by and they did pay it and there were negotiations that the company really didn't get the fee that they wanted but they got millions and interestingly.
1024000	1028000	For while we were working on this I actually sent a freedom of information that request to the British government.
1029000	1036000	About the role that case to get emails between the embassy in London during this case and it showed that the.
1037000	1046000	The embassy in Bolivia will lobbying on behalf of the relay which actually is is unlawful because governments are not meant to be involved in these.
1047000	1055000	In these investor state dispute settlement systems and there was one there's one email that was headlined lobby on rural that was a British embassy email.
1056000	1059000	Like all these things nothing ever happened because they just ignored our article.
1060000	1061000	Well so this again the British embassy.
1062000	1065000	Yeah in Bolivia was lobbying on the behalf of a private company.
1066000	1068000	In it who was in a dispute with the Bolivian government.
1071000	1081000	It's not it's not it's not lawful and it's the exit system and the investor state dispute settlement system is meant to be outside of state.
1082000	1087000	Control and outside of state influence but in this case it wasn't and it was extremely obvious.
1088000	1092000	I mean it was interesting that they released that email to me because I think they probably just didn't know that they weren't allowed to lobby because.
1093000	1095000	A lot of their part of their job is to lobby for business.
1096000	1098000	Most journalists don't cover this stuff right.
1099000	1103000	They don't even know if it's legal or not and even if it is illegal who the hell's going to talk about it exactly.
1104000	1106000	If it's not Matt Kennard or somebody at Navarra media or you know.
1107000	1121000	I mean can I just say one more really messed up part of this which is for me is kind of maybe the most messed up part is that there's been a whole industry now created around this investor state dispute settlement system called third party financing.
1122000	1130000	Which is whereby there are boutique financial firms now which their sole purpose is to lend money to.
1131000	1139000	Corporations who are suing states and those those claims against states are the collateral that they give the loan to and they say will give you millions.
1140000	1150000	To it to pay for the legal fees or whatever it is actually it's not only just to pay for the cost of the case is to set you to expand in the case of rural like they were they were funded by a third party finance and the five party finance said we.
1151000	1162000	We will help rural like expand but what they what the deal is that if they if they if they win the case against the state these companies these are financial companies get a cut of that award.
1163000	1172000	And we're talking about sometimes billions as I said Occidental Petroleum a case against Exidor which was quite famous they got billions of dollars there's a case now against Honduras.
1174000	1178000	Which whereby they denied a company.
1180000	1190000	The right to build a special economic zone in Honduras and they're getting sued for eleven billion dollars Honduras tiny little country in Central America being sued because they won't build a special economic zone.
1191000	1205000	By the company I think I don't know the specifics but I think they'd probably come to some agreement or that they've left a million dollars yeah but the other point of this is you said that okay maybe the rural case there's a case for getting compensation okay that's true but.
1206000	1215000	Part of capitalism is rests on the fact that you take a risk when you invest right course and the higher the risk the bigger the return so if you go to Congo.
1216000	1230000	And you go in you want to get a diamond mine or whatever it is then you might get you might get expropriated but that's what part that's why you go there because you the potential for huge rewards this ensures you against that it's a massive insurance mechanism whereby corporations.
1231000	1238000	The whole of capitalism and it's totally it's capitalist model and the funny thing about the ISDS system is you know when you talk to people on the inside about all these different.
1239000	1250000	Systems that the benefit corporate power around the world most of them have quite a sophisticated and persuasive ideology built up on top of them to justify them to.
1251000	1253000	The general public but also to the people working in within them.
1254000	1266000	In this case of the ISDS system is barely anything like even talking to people that people say the one thing they say is this is about increasing investment to developing well because corporations are going to be much less scared to go and invest in a developing world.
1266000	1270000	If they can be sure that they'll get compensated if bad things happen to them.
1270000	1284000	But that doesn't make that just doesn't hold up because Brazil is one country which is never which never signed up to exit and there's never been hit with one of these cases because it doesn't include them in it in their different agreements.
1284000	1286000	Has Brazil ever had a problem with foreign direct investment.
1286000	1287000	I don't think so.
1287000	1290000	There's no colliery colliery.
1291000	1308000	So yeah it is a naked attempt to ensure companies against risk and a naked attempt to allow corporations to go over the heads of national governments and it's not a coincidence that was created in 1966.
1308000	1317000	Because that was the 60s was really the time when large parts of Africa Asia were really becoming free of the imperial powers.
1318000	1321000	The winds of change exactly as Wilson said yeah.
1321000	1336000	So and they will they thought well we can't have that we got to create a system whereby we can maintain that imperial control and maintain the control of the investors maintain the control of the corporations without having to have formal garrisons of troops or whatever it is.
1336000	1339000	In those countries and they did it successful.
1339000	1354000	Two thousand twenty three it has taken off its it's gone wild because what we saw we sort of did analysis of how many cases there had been since it was created in 1966 and it picked up massively after the end of the cold war because.
1355000	1364000	It was resurgent rampant capitalism there was no other poll for countries to organize around so they had to be integrated into the system they had there was nowhere else they could go.
1365000	1380000	And Eastern Europe with the ISDS was a massive part of all the agreements that they that they signed so I mean part of the rest of the rest of the book is also about this system of the countries that come out of the cold are integrated into but this is a major part of it.
1381000	1383000	I mean we can go on to some of the others now.
1383000	1391000	You said about Honduras a moment ago so I had to check Honduras is GDP is GDP is twenty nine billion dollars so eleven billion dollars is quite a lot.
1391000	1400000	You know the UK GDP is about three trillion two point eight trillion dollars so you're looking at almost half of that economic output in a year.
1401000	1408000	What you're describing with these with these agreements is like you say just a clarification on my part.
1408000	1417000	There's an insulation from any downside whatsoever and like you say normally there is risk with capital if you go and invest in an ISA or a pension you will be told quite explicitly.
1418000	1423000	You're not guaranteed to return here you may even lose your initial investment but what we have here is basically.
1424000	1431000	The equivalent of you can go and open a shop on the high street and even if nobody turns up even if you don't sell anything you can't lose money don't worry.
1431000	1438000	And that isn't that isn't what capitalism is meant to be and I'm not defending capitalism or attacking capitalism but that's merely a description of this system here.
1438000	1448000	What you're describing really is a complete and that obviously is thread runs throughout the book is really a complete subversion of democracy and it is interesting for me in this country people have talked about taking back control.
1449000	1456000	And it seems very obvious that for much the global south and it should be said a lot of the global north to me just mentioned Eastern Europe.
1457000	1461000	But other places as well as we'll go on to discuss.
1462000	1476000	Democracy is a mirage it doesn't exist with this stuff and often you would have heard over the last couple of decades particularly since early 2000s with the protests against WTO and so on we have neocolonialism but it sounds to me you're just describing colonialism.
1477000	1481000	Yeah so what is it is it neocolonialism doesn't sound there's anything particularly neo about it.
1481000	1488000	Yeah well there's this whole school of thought called post-colonialism I just don't I don't see it.
1489000	1510000	I think that it's the same dynamics but altered for a new reality so they had to abide by the newly independent and peoples and the new liberation movements which which took off after the second war they would have liked not to do that but they had to adjust for a new reality and they did and they did it.
1511000	1521000	Undercover I mean no one knows about this ISDS system no one knows about the reality of aid which is another major strand talk about that yeah hold your fire no one but but but literally.
1522000	1534000	The left and the right the left's maybe worse than right in terms of misunderstanding what aid is but that they they not only adjusted they repackaged it as saying we're helping the developing world and we're helping you to develop.
1535000	1545000	And you see that across the board and what's quite interesting is obviously when you look at the archives which we did and you look at the internal deliberations it's the opposite they're talking quite consciously about.
1546000	1551000	Inshrining and maintaining their control it's just that the public posture was about.
1552000	1563000	All these wonderful things that we wanted to give people and that was and this is a major another part of this corporate coup is that it is huge part of it is is about.
1564000	1572000	What that what is called corporate social responsibility which is propaganda propaganda it's about presenting this corporate system.
1572000	1582000	And it's corporate colonialism as a wonderful benefit for the rest of humanity now I covered the mining industry at the financial times for a year.
1582000	1585000	And it was amazing it's I went to one of the mining conferences in.
1586000	1603000	In South Africa and all these presentations by mining companies and it was you barely know that these mining companies were digging for gold or anything nearly 90% of what they talked about was all the wonderful things that they were bringing to the local communities it would just be slides of schools and hospitals and all this stuff it was.
1604000	1613000	It sounds like I'm exaggerating but I'm not it was literally like I was just in like a Oxfam international conference or something but that is that was a really really.
1613000	1620000	Conscious decision by the corporate sector particularly mining in the 90s because they were having trouble with what they called a social license.
1620000	1631000	They were it was operations on the ground were becoming more and more difficult because their reputation was so bad and people didn't wanted to kick them out so they thought we're gonna have to get that social license back so they launched this huge corporate social responsibility.
1632000	1641000	Thing but that's all what that's also what happened after the second world war with development the word development they said that they started saying well we want the world to develop we want you poor people have to develop.
1642000	1655000	And it has to be a but what does development mean it's export orientated growth has to be that you don't exist for these institutions if you're a subsistence farmer and you've been doing it for a thousand years doesn't matter what you only exist if you are producing.
1655000	1670000	Produce for the market so they really re orientated all these economies in the name of development to benefit the benefit that the global market to benefit the benefit these companies and the system but yeah it's a it's a massive.
1671000	1677000	It's a massive illusion that the post colonialism ever happened we live in the midst of it.
1678000	1685000	So I think lots of people instinctively will they want all these facts and details now that's really interesting but they said that kind of tallies with what I.
1686000	1694000	I suspected let's get into the nuts and bolts of this because you say a lot of this happens in the crucible of the sort of the end of colonialism one point oh.
1695000	1700000	Obviously the British Empire really is collapsing in the fifties and sixties I mean really after the mid 1950s.
1701000	1706000	And it's around this time we hear about a guy called Herman Yosef ABS German banker.
1707000	1709000	Can you explain who he is and why he's important.
1710000	1711000	Yeah he's a very.
1713000	1721000	I think I don't know now in Germany but at the time he was a very prominent figure in Germany and in in 1957 he went to.
1722000	1734000	A conference of industrialists in San Francisco and presented a proposal for what I'm talking about what I talked about which is this investor state dispute settlement system it wasn't called that then but what he said was we need to.
1735000	1748000	Ensure that essentially this sounds over the top but essentially people don't have control of their own resources because it's a problem for us and he referenced things like the the coup in Iran in 1953.
1749000	1756000	The following year which was done by MI6 and CIA because the Democratic Prime Minister had nationalized the Anglo-Iranian oil company.
1757000	1758000	Just for our audience is the man called Mossadegh.
1759000	1765000	Mossadegh yeah he was taken out in a joint CIA MI6 coup Iran's never been a democracy again.
1766000	1769000	He was a moderate I mean it was it was part of this Cold War thing of trying to.
1770000	1773000	He's probably centre right actually you know like yeah but he was called National Front.
1773000	1781000	The red line for these people was you can't you can't have use your resources for your own people he wanted to give a little higher percentage to.
1782000	1790000	The Iranian state therefore the Iranian people at the detriment to the detriment of the British investors not allowed.
1791000	1797000	Following year CIA takes out the Social Democratic President of Guatemala in 1954.
1798000	1810000	At the behest of the United Fruit Company because again Arbenz the president had had the temerity to say that maybe we could distribute a little bit of fallow land back to some peasants not allowed will take you out.
1811000	1819000	Suez crisis nine fifty six NASA nationalizes the Suez Canal in UK France Israel invade.
1820000	1827000	Again so he's referencing all these things he's saying look we don't want to have to have a system where we have to go in hard like this.
1828000	1833000	We need a system that works above these people's heads so it doesn't matter if these people get in power they have no power anyway.
1834000	1837000	The investor state dispute settlement system is a major part of that.
1838000	1853000	But another part of it is we could move on to this is is is aid and creating global economies that rely and are based around attracting investment.
1854000	1857000	Sorry shall I go on in a minute or do you want to come back on that.
1858000	1861000	I like this style you have like sorry don't need to say sorry Matt.
1862000	1870000	Well I just want to stick with Herman Yosef Abbs for a second because this is the world that we live in right we think of a 21st century capitalism and so on.
1871000	1885000	But Yosef Abbs is working for Deutsche Bank in the late 1930s right under the Third Reich and that is the world that we still live in very much colonial powers the idea of white supremacy European hegemony markets and us making profits here in Europe and North America.
1886000	1890000	Matter far more than people in Africa and South America and Asia.
1891000	1901000	And I think it's really important to name names I mean you've got him there's a few others too and I suppose what will will turn to those but it's it's still very much their world and this idea of.
1902000	1911000	You write about a Magna Carta moment for global capitalism inherently tied to ideas of pre-war colonialism like there's just such a clear continuation.
1912000	1920000	Let's talk about aid because that is something that our audience probably thinks okay it's got some downsides but it's generally good why are you not such a fan of overseas development aid.
1921000	1931000	Well put it like this okay this is why we say to people because I think that there's no topic that the left gets more wrong than aid David Cameron not known as a great.
1932000	1944000	Advocate for the poor is he in 2010 the austerity government that he began then with George George Osborne was what created one of the worst crisis for the British poor for generations.
1945000	1953000	At the same time he went on TV and was talking up how he was dedicating 0.7% of GDP to aid.
1954000	1965000	Now how do you square those two things why does he why is he hammering the poor here to the point where I don't know what I can't remember what the status I think it's caught for a million people that they or a hundred thousand people that might have died because of austerity.
1966000	1979000	We think at least 150,000 excess deaths yeah excess deaths but yeah he's while he's doing that and enacting those policies he's he's promising that will give maintain a certain level of GDP towards aid for foreigners it's not because.
1980000	1994000	He cares about the point of developing world is because aid is a massive subsidy to his friends in the corporate sector and is a massive tool for geopolitical control as well that's the other thing because a lot of the work I do with the classified actually is about aid programs.
1995000	1997000	So for example I've done.
1998000	2012000	Did one recently about how British aid had been used to set up an anti government coalition in Venezuela or about how aid had been used to try to persuade Bolsonaro's Brazil to privatize oil and gas.
2013000	2027000	It's just that there's one organization particularly called the conflict stability and security fund which I'd say tell people to look into again and another acronym and another long name that sounds boring but again it's just a massive slush fund.
2028000	2033000	For the state to enact its geopolitical control that's one element of it the other element of it is the.
2035000	2054000	Subsidies corporate corporations and you see this all across the board there's one institution which we focus on particularly which is emblematic of this system a system which is the international finance corporation again another arm of the world bank again created in this in the context of these newly independent countries in 1956.
2055000	2059000	In this case and the idea was.
2061000	2072000	To invest in private companies so the World Bank before had been it was about transfer of capital to governments and this was about how in the name of development and then it's a stated goal of.
2073000	2082000	Alleviating global poverty they would invest in private corporations the argument being that they'd invest in corporations that would otherwise not want to go to certain places.
2084000	2092000	But I spent years looking at the IFC eventually and went to countless countries and it's an absolute.
2093000	2104000	Joke racket from Miami also known as Burma we went we went there to report on the IFC I'll just give you this one example and the IFC had invested this is a.
2105000	2115000	One of the poorest countries have ever been to dirt poor I think the fewest doctors a person in the world maybe and then they'd poured capital into this five star hotel.
2116000	2121000	Built by this Malaysian oligarch and you sort of see went from the street we went to the hotel.
2122000	2134000	Poor people everywhere people real sort of destitution and then you'd walk through these doors and it's just this air conditioned beautiful hotel with like huge buffet.
2135000	2145000	All these men and women in suit all these men in suits and it and that is that it that was copied around the world wherever I went I went to a diamond mine in Tanzania.
2146000	2155000	There's lots of good stories here so slow down yeah the one that really caught my imagination was that we the British taxpayer were paying for gated communities.
2156000	2165000	Which I just found so mad we're paying for social and economic apartheid in the third world or developing countries in the name of development.
2166000	2179000	And I found myself this is the thing that should the left is quite bad on this I read that I read a few other things too so it's all about separate things here the World Bank and what it does let's put a pin in that for a moment and what you know the British government does with its own overseas aid.
2179000	2186000	I read that thing about the British overseas aid and I felt my inner forage come out you know just scrap international aid.
2187000	2193000	And I think if you tell most people that our international aid is just a scam to a significant extent not all of it.
2194000	2206000	They sort of look at you rather strangely but the reality is of course we should be spending money on reproductive rights contraception clean drinking water education programs of course but that's not the majority of aid is it.
2207000	2219000	Like you say there is a segment of it and I know people in the industry and there's really good people that work in it and the bit that is really important is disaster relief so for example when I worked for the Financial Times they sent me to Haiti after the earthquake.
2220000	2230000	And organizations like Oxfam and which is funded by the UK government and lots of other groups were doing vital work to keep people alive you know this is like it was apocalypse there.
2231000	2242000	But that's actually quite a small section of it and the real money is going towards subsidizing corporations and it's a massive asset revenue stream for them.
2243000	2247000	So much money is being pumped into it and barely anyone is covering it.
2248000	2256000	The other the other part of this as well is that I mentioned Oxfam I should talk a bit about how corporations have colonized civil society as well particularly in aid.
2256000	2270000	One example which was pretty shocking for me at the time I'm not shocked by this kind of stuff now but we went to El Salvador in 2000 2016 I think it was and we did a story about this poor community that lived on top of an aquifer.
2271000	2282000	And they couldn't afford the water that they were sitting on because the prices were too high yet down the road there were all these multinationals bottling drinks like Coke and Fanta that we drink here.
2282000	2296000	So we did this story for the guardian and so I contacted Sab Miller which is one of the companies that bottles Coke and said look we've talked to all these poor people that they're really struggling and you're getting and you're bottling these drinks down the road.
2297000	2306000	They said they said they got really angry with me one of the most aggressive PR teams I've ever dealt with and then they said look read this report that we that we authored with Oxfam.
2307000	2318000	So I sort of thought okay and then they sent me this report which had the Sab Miller and Oxfam's logo on the same thing which was basically exculpating them of any any problems and any crimes in in in that area.
2319000	2332000	So I kind of put up some resistance to it but I think most journalists receiving that would see the sort of logo of Oxfam and think okay well if Oxfam is saying they're right and then they are right but that's but that happens all the time.
2332000	2346000	What is Oxfam saying that what Oxfam most people in Oxfam don't enter that game to provide a cloak fundamentally for multinationals destroying people's lives in the global south so how has that happened.
2347000	2360000	Well because of the budget problems and also it's just a it's a function of the same dynamic that we've talked about corporations have invested every part of our society that's basically zero parts of our society that have escaped corporate power because they have all the money.
2361000	2370000	And they've used these corporations to to sort of a version of greenwashing obviously it's not about the environment although that also exists but.
2371000	2382000	With aid organizations and humanitarian organizations it gives them the perfect foil to do whatever they want and in the case of Oxfam it gets worse this story by the way so we publish the story eventually.
2383000	2391000	And it's quite hard hitting story goes on for the Guardian so obviously goes under the Gates Foundation logo so then you see that that happens.
2392000	2400000	And the Gates Foundation is not a benign institution is part of this whole system is it's got a very particular way of looking at development which is.
2401000	2405000	It's the godfather of this whole system it's the don't call the only of this whole system.
2405000	2422000	Exactly but and then so and then two days after that there's an there's a article in the Guardian on the development side with the Bill Gates logo which is a 900 word interview with the Latin American division head of Sam Miller.
2422000	2429000	Wow basically talking about our article not by not naming it but defending Sam Miller's record in El Salvador.
2430000	2441000	Yeah well saying that water stress is what these corporations also always do they say it's about corruption you know these sort of words they use to blame the victim rather than them and then one more thing.
2441000	2447000	And so then I see then I start doing a bit of research and I see that Sam Miller funds part of the Guardian's website.
2448000	2455000	So they so I don't I don't know if Sam Miller called up and said we found part of your website but but so we want to we want to write a reply.
2456000	2464000	But also that was my question do you think because obviously there is a right there's but there's a right to editorial rights giving somebody the right to reply you should do that if they've made your misgivings.
2465000	2466000	It wasn't presented like that.
2467000	2475000	No it was presented as just it happened to be they've happened to publish this interview it wasn't even so it wasn't an advertorial it wasn't a right of reply it was just a.
2476000	2485000	Will interview this person about water stress in Latin America happened to be two days after we published this article so so they've infested the NGOs they've infested.
2486000	2489000	The media because obviously the progressive press.
2489000	2494000	The progressive press is often worse like in terms of I don't know if you've seen recently I saw some.
2495000	2509000	Navarra journalist tweeting about the new statesman and BAE systems yes there's a whole section but it in some ways the Guardian and the and the new statesman are worse than the right wing media in terms of doing this doing the bidding of corporations.
2509000	2518000	But yeah so it's a panorama where they've just taken over it's very very few spaces now where you can have an independent.
2519000	2526000	Right do give me a given opinion independent of media power where I'm sorry of corporate power that being a media.
2527000	2528000	Universities whatever it is.
2529000	2532000	Hold on it's not an opinion even you were reporting facts that's true.
2533000	2545000	You're reporting facts and if you report facts all of a sudden some miller can place a interview within 48 hours I mean that's mad I know and also if you think about that what that means in reality that is the Guardian has given the last word.
2546000	2555000	To one of the richest corporations in the world we're doing awful things there over the voices of some of the poorest people in the world that we'd originally platformed and that was how it ended.
2555000	2567000	And this happens all the time the point is I wasn't working for the Guardian then and also I didn't really care about pissing them off by publicizing it so I did publicize it at the time but I think most people just would they wouldn't even.
2568000	2574000	They wouldn't even look at it or they wouldn't even realize it happened they wouldn't do the research to see all these different pressure points which had been activated.
2575000	2577000	Or if you did bring it up Matt frankly it's career suicide.
2578000	2580000	Let's be honest there's a reason why.
2581000	2588000	Might sound like it's cope from me but there's a reason why people like you and me appear don't really appear on the BBC definitely.
2589000	2595000	Sky generally I mean I got I only get a call from BBC or sky so they can attack me for something yeah I mean I've got to defend somebody.
2596000	2604000	They don't say what's your view on XYZ and there's a reason for that because when you're honest about this stuff it's it's it's not really good for you know getting you up the greasy pole.
2605000	2614000	You're saying about the media do you think it's got worse with this stuff because I'm from the Guardian I don't stick on the Guardian too much but it's really interesting because we don't have many progressive print publications in this country it's one of them.
2615000	2621000	And it feels to me like 15 20 years ago it was substantially better on this stuff and now it's a lot worse do you think that's right.
2621000	2635000	I think it is across the board is not just corporations is also its coverage of the security state for example which is what I cover day to day that's just been completely jettisoned any kind of critical coverage of the military or intelligence agencies.
2636000	2640000	It doubles up with the corporate corporations but I think that you've seen.
2641000	2660000	These interests really ramp up their attacks on independent spaces so the Guardian as you say actually 20 years ago was actually not bad like it wasn't perfect far from it but it had space for Maverick reporters people doing truthful independent reporting regularly yeah.
2660000	2671000	And that's been completely lost and I think that part of it is that a lot of stuff in terms of the corporations for example when they sign I remember when it was sort of the advent of this corporate takeover of the Guardian.
2672000	2683000	The Guardian would always say when they started doing these sites into in an alliance with the corporations well we signed contracts where the corporations say they have no say over our editorial line or and I think that's probably true.
2684000	2695000	But that's the react that that's the direct relationship when you've been 20 years later when you've got like dozens of companies just all over just with their logo all over your website has a.
2695000	2705000	It has an effect on a sort of more general level it's not and it's not conscious it's not like they're saying do this do that it's just because you know those logos are there you know you work within a new framework.
2705000	2713000	So that that that power is felt in a much more insidious way and I think that's how it's worked I think that's also how it worked with the security state as well because.
2713000	2723000	I mean actually in the case of the security state with the gun is quite interesting like in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations we looked at the D notice committee meetings which for viewers the D notice committee is this.
2724000	2736000	Media censorship organization run by the Ministry of Defense and they meet every six months at the M.O.D. with a small collection of journalists and basically discuss about what they can and can't publish.
2737000	2740000	The Guardian which very British self censorship right.
2741000	2747000	It's not like you know Stalin was like you can't write in America I've talked to some American jealous about they just think.
2748000	2759000	I mean American journalism is far from perfect but they literally can't understand how we put up with that they say you meet with the state and in his formal way like people do it but behind closed doors you know it's kind of embarrassing.
2760000	2768000	But anyway so the those D notice committee meeting showed that during the Snowden revelations they were the intelligence apparatus.
2769000	2778000	And the M.O.D. were freaking out big time because they were ignoring the notices which were being sent out the Guardian were and then nice to cut a long story short.
2779000	2786000	Russ Bridger who was editor at the time agreed to add the deputy editor Paul Johnson to the D notice committee and he joined.
2787000	2795000	So that was about bringing them in house you know about cultivating them and then soon after that the first ever interview of a sitting head of M.I. five was granted to the Guardian.
2796000	2805000	Soon after that the first interview of the sitting head of M.I. six was granted to the Guardian so you can we did it in the first article we did for declassified myself and Mark Curtis.
2806000	2808000	We kind of delineated how this had happened.
2809000	2821000	And I think that it's the same corporations independent spaces are a real threat especially ones with resources because the Guardian not only had the predilection to expose the security state and corporations but it also had the resources.
2822000	2832000	It's a big newspaper global newspaper with a good reputation when you got those two things combined it's a threat to these power's interests so they had to take them take them down and essentially as a critical.
2833000	2836000	Sort of independent media outlet it doesn't exist anymore in my opinion.
2837000	2849000	They barely do stories that the of the caliber that they used to do at all and it's kind of just become a bit of a tabloid the uninteresting newspaper in my opinion.
2850000	2856000	There's also a broader point here let's just stick with the media for a moment about how for most of the last century.
2857000	2864000	Broadly anybody with capital obviously it tends to be wealthier people but it could be a trade union as well right or the Scott trust in the case of the Guardian.
2865000	2872000	If you have lots of money you can start a newspaper and it can wash its own face through selling copies of that newspaper if it can find a market the market mechanism would pay for news.
2873000	2875000	Clearly in the last couple of decades that stopped because of the internet.
2876000	2888000	Now it still applies to some things monthly publications or weekly papers or whatever New York Times is doing great with its 10 million online subscribers but generally speaking I do have a daily newspaper with the market mechanisms kind of disappeared.
2889000	2897000	And what that means now is that news outlets are generally owned by Dr. Rich where that's Bezos with the Washington Post you know would they have done Watergate with Bezos in charge.
2898000	2910000	Right or the observer in the 1980s showing that actually the BBC going back for decades have been vetting thousands of people to see their speed see their political connections fundamentally if you were going to be going to be anybody in the BBC.
2911000	2920000	Right the way from its beginning right the way through to the late 1980s probably still what we don't know you were basically vetted and if you would you know if you're strong left wing connections.
2921000	2931000	No you wouldn't get senior jobs that was that was that was exposed by the observer you have the story about the Israeli nuclear weapons program okay the paper was owned by Murdoch.
2932000	2941000	But the point was that these papers were trying to sell news they were trying to make money and I think we're in a world now where I don't think legacy journalism does that anymore.
2942000	2947000	I genuinely think when Adam and my legacy journalism does basically basically does PR.
2948000	2960000	I agree and we're in a really new world but don't you think it's very strange that that dynamic has has taken place at the same time as the media has opened up and democratized you would have thought the opposite pressure would be so the fact that.
2960000	2970000	So the fact that Navarra exists or declassified we couldn't have existed 20 years ago but so the media's been massively democratized by the internet by social media.
2971000	2981000	So you would have thought that the pressure that would put on the legacy media was that they had to open up because otherwise they're going to get outflanked but actually they become more and more closed and more and more establishment friendly while.
2982000	2988000	Alternative media what's called alternative media is blossomed I can't get my head around why that is but I totally agree with you I think that.
2989000	2997000	The mainstream media is something very insidious and sinister has happened to it in the last 20 years because even if you remember during the war in Iraq.
2998000	3009000	Like what the media was like the guard the mirror under Piers Morgan who is a controversial figure but he it was incredible I remember that there were.
3010000	3020000	I bought it every day during that build up to the war in Iraq where he had the headlines were made out of oil companies logos or pictures of George Bush and Tony blow blood all over their hands stuff you would never ever see now.
3021000	3034000	No I actually think that there was a concerted effort by the state to make sure that never happened again because it was the media opposition and the mainstream media opposition to Iraq was a real problem for them executing that war.
3036000	3039000	And probably stopped any movement on to Iran.
3040000	3052000	The subsequent people said oh well the war happened anyway yeah but we never went to Iran in under a milliband labor refused to bomb Syria etc you can agree or disagree with those decisions but the point is they didn't happen and I think the trajectory.
3053000	3065000	Was diverted because of like say media intervention I think hostility from the public which to an extent was reflected in the media and now it isn't and it is weird now we're in the early 2020s all the media talks about and I know some of our viewers and our listeners care about this stuff.
3066000	3078000	It talks about cake it talks about speeding finds like and of course that stuff matters of course it matters it doesn't matter half as much as the stories you're talking about and they're not being relayed in legacy media for a reason.
3079000	3083000	So let's put a pin in the media conversation because we could talk about that all day people who are listening watching.
3084000	3093000	Remember 20 minutes ago as I mentioned the fact that the British overseas development aid budget was investing in gated communities believe in El Salvador.
3095000	3104000	I mean this really underscores an important point doesn't it that you know we had NGOs people at the Guardian quite and quite progressive saying we have to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid.
3105000	3114000	But it's about what you're spending where and who benefits rather than the amount of money like I don't want to be giving money to gated communities in El Salvador I would rather that number be lower I would like it to be zero.
3116000	3133000	Yeah yeah I mean I think if people understood where where aid money was going the whole budget would be stopped tomorrow because the right the interesting thing about aid is that the right is very critical of it and if you read the Daily Mail there was they launched campaigns to get the.
3135000	3158000	But their perception of aid and their analysis of aid is extremely thin and the major arguments that I've been making that should be made by the left are just non existent you can't hear them in the in the media at all partly because the place that you would normally hear them would be the Guardian or you expect to hear them but the whole of its development website is funded by the Gates Foundation.
3159000	3165000	So to go back to the gated communities in El Salvador one of the interesting facets of this whole thing is that.
3167000	3184000	The system that is being erected around the world and has been erected which is corporate rule has created an extremely divided society here but also around the world everywhere you go there's huge levels of inequality so you now have a class of people in all these places that need to.
3185000	3194000	Fence himself off from the rest of society to fence themselves off from the results of this system so yes El Salvador.
3195000	3209000	Is a is an extremely poor country we went there in our reporting but it's got little oasis of of huge wealth and that's where the British money is going because they think that there needs to be places for.
3210000	3224000	The rich to live because that's part of their development model for example in another example was my and my and the five star hotel which they were funding we talked to the head of the IFC which is the private sector lending arm of the world bank when we were in my and my we said.
3225000	3232000	You at least justify why you're spending aid money on on a five star hotel and he said well look.
3232000	3239000	The opening up to the rest of the world they need when a businessman goes to my and my he needs a place he's gonna feel comfortable to stay.
3239000	3252000	So you can make go negotiate with people to do business deals and that's their argument they don't like and it makes sense I guess on some level but when you look at a society like my and my problems it has the scale of the problems.
3252000	3267000	The last thing that you you would you'd locate as a thing that they needed was a five star hotel for rich people to go and invest in fact what they need is a development model that does not rely solely on the vagaries of internet of foreign direct investment which is what they're building.
3268000	3278000	That I mean for me that the most shocking part of this book and the two year reporting project that went into it was the aid section because everywhere I went.
3278000	3287000	I saw that aid was not benefiting largely there was small parts of it that were benefiting the poor.
3288000	3298000	But largely was benefiting the richest people in the world the corporations and the local elite and secondly the second part of that is that this is not a mistake.
3298000	3303000	Originally when I first started reporting I was like okay well that they've obviously not thought this out.
3303000	3313000	But when you start looking at the history of it and you look at how a developed out of full of formal colonialism you realize this is all the design this is been designed from the start.
3313000	3321000	This is the plan this is the plan the IFC for example the but the institution which I looked at most and which I've described the arm of the World Bank which was created in 1956.
3321000	3333000	We went to the World Bank archives in Washington DC and we looked at what the discussions were about why they were creating the IFC and it was explicitly talked about as a arm of the.
3334000	3345000	A tool in the Cold War they wanted to expand capitalism in places which were which could fall to communism so the best way to do that is to make the private sector as big as possible right.
3345000	3354000	So they'd say we need this corporation to go in and but now the IFC is an investment bank people on the we talked to people on the inside who anonymously.
3354000	3364000	And they said the IFC effectively functions as an investment bank and it's a money earner for the World Bank group as well so it's been completely perverted from any kind of development goal.
3364000	3376000	A few points so I think most people that when they hear the words international development they think kids getting books at school like I said clean drinking water maybe an infrastructure project right a road.
3377000	3380000	But they wouldn't hear in their mind.
3380000	3392000	Yeah five-star hotel where businessmen can have a cup of coffee and make a business man fucking ridiculous frankly but like you say hey it goes I think hand in hand with an idea that the more privatization the more inequality the better.
3392000	3400000	And I think as an appendage to that like the continuation with with colonialism.
3401000	3406000	With regards to sorry I'm coming back here so I had a really interesting question for you.
3406000	3410000	We're gonna talk about the diamond mine that's it.
3410000	3416000	And I suppose as an outgrowth of that as well I mean you said that a lot of this is based upon anti-communism and our position of communism during the Cold War.
3416000	3421000	At the end of the 1950s so you got Mossadegh Arbenz and Guatemala.
3421000	3425000	And NASA in Egypt and these guys weren't particularly left wing but.
3425000	3431000	I mean actually Arbenz basically just a social democrat but the point is social democracy outside of the West wasn't allowed.
3431000	3438000	But it wasn't just communism's what I mean it was very much a concern that global South countries would have nationalism.
3438000	3443000	Right this force which is apparently so normal in the West you're allowed to be a nationalist in the UK or France the US.
3443000	3454000	But the minute you have a nationalism from a third world country it was just that we cannot have that so I think for an audience as well just to because they might say well good anti-communism well no this is fundamentally about creating obstacles to.
3454000	3458000	Nationalism and to the idea of.
3458000	3467000	You know popular sovereignty and again there's something actually I think the left's been very weak on you know the left says all nationalism is bad well actually nationalism has created an incredible.
3467000	3475000	Countervailing force against oppression against imperialism for the majority of the world over the last hundred years so maybe don't phrase things like that.
3475000	3482000	You mentioned the World Bank I mean wow some of the stories about the World Bank just and this idea of it being an investment fund.
3482000	3486000	Can you touch upon one project in particular in Tanzania.
3486000	3489000	Yeah this was a day.
3489000	3495000	The other bizarre part of this whole system is you would expect a diamond mine.
3495000	3497000	To.
3497000	3511000	If it was owned by a major company like the beers they would have they would not need like non-commercial loans at favorable rates from a development institution to expand you would have thought that they were integrated enough into the world of finance that they could get the the loans that they wanted.
3511000	3515000	But essentially in this in this case.
3515000	3517000	This diamond mine.
3517000	3527000	Which is now owned by Petra Diamonds which is listed in London said that they hadn't made a profit in like 10 or 15 years which again I was dubious of because it's very nice to say that if you're in Tanzania whose.
3527000	3534000	HMRC is probably like five or six guys in a room and you've got like all these powerful accountants that can do.
3534000	3539000	Interesting accounting to make sure you don't get a profit that you have to pay a tax on.
3539000	3541000	I'm not saying that's what they did but.
3541000	3548000	That that is a massive power imbalance that you see around the world where you have the corporate accountants and it's not HMRC in this country right.
3548000	3552000	I mean that's I don't think anybody would dispute that Tanzania's ability to collect tax is quite limited.
3552000	3553000	Exactly.
3553000	3561000	But anyway they said they hadn't so they they they took money from the World Bank and the IFC to develop this diamond mine.
3561000	3569000	And I went along there and again it's like so much of this new geography corporate geography around the world where.
3569000	3575000	You go to a place that Tanzania which is not one of the poorest African countries but is pretty poor when you go there.
3575000	3587000	And you arrive at so you're seeing all this sort of poverty around and then you arrive at this it's a campus that this this diamond mine is not just a mine it's got like a hospital and school.
3587000	3597000	And you go through the metal gates and and it's just like perfectly tarmac roads hospital that works school.
3597000	3608000	People like looking happy and and that's what and so you go there then you get taken by PR person around and they're telling you all the wonderful things.
3609000	3619000	But the funny thing is that when I interviewed the finance person at that mine he said to me we didn't need the IFCs and non-commercial loans we could have easily done it without.
3619000	3624000	But we liked having the imprimatur of the World Bank on our company.
3624000	3626000	It was good for our respectability.
3626000	3629000	It was good for our legitimacy.
3629000	3631000	We'd be exploiting people the World Bank's helping us.
3631000	3632000	Exactly.
3632000	3637000	And and and then add that to the fact it's a diamond mine.
3637000	3639000	So how does that benefit development?
3639000	3643000	It's a private diamond diamond mine hasn't paid tax in over a decade.
3643000	3652000	And the World Bank's argument is well it creates jobs and it develops the hamlets around the campus.
3652000	3660000	So part of the whole propaganda tour I was taken on was I was taken to a local school which had been built by company.
3660000	3666000	It was like 50 kids packed into a little like brick brick school tiny brick school.
3666000	3673000	And then I interviewed some some of the teachers and they actually were quite outspoken to me.
3673000	3681000	They said well they might have built us this but they didn't like where's the where's the money for the central government.
3681000	3689000	They were aware of what I'm talking about which is that they they avoid all this paying any tax to the central government and then act like they're the saviors of the local community by building these.
3690000	3692000	Pretty threadbare schools.
3692000	3708000	And that is kind of what we saw all around the world that the arguments are so thin for why they're investing in these these these high end capitalist exploration endeavors like a diamond mine or a five star hotel.
3708000	3712000	It's all about creating jobs for the local local community.
3712000	3718000	Why can't you create a job for the local community by by building something that's socially useful for for poor people.
3718000	3723000	If it was publicly owned or at least if the state even if the state just has a 30 percent share.
3723000	3725000	Let's have a compromise here like there's still the jobs.
3725000	3732000	Yeah but this is a very important point that you bring up about the IFC because the IFC doesn't just invest in private corporations to go into new markets.
3732000	3736000	They have an advisory arm which is advising governments to privatize everything.
3736000	3744000	And it's a famous case where they got the the the main hospital in the suit to private Oxfam did a whole report about this.
3744000	3749000	The IFC helped the suit to privatize their hospital their main hospital.
3749000	3758000	And then it started eating up like huge amounts of their health budget per year extraordinary sums.
3758000	3760000	And that is kind of replicated around the world.
3760000	3766000	They're advising governments to privatize certain things and then investing in companies that might benefit from those privatizations.
3766000	3767000	It's a conflict of interest.
3767000	3768000	Clearly right.
3768000	3771000	I mean that's clear as day as well with the World Bank.
3771000	3772000	This was another one Matt.
3772000	3774000	It just my jaw dropped.
3774000	3775000	Right.
3775000	3776000	And I'm quite.
3776000	3780000	I'm sure people who are familiar with the war and I'm quite skeptical of many things and a bit of a cynic even.
3780000	3790000	But this idea that the World Bank invests to an extraordinary extent in companies registered in tax domains where they'll pay less tax.
3790000	3797000	So for instance companies which are operating in Africa but they'll be domiciled and somewhere like the Mauritius because it's really a tax haven.
3797000	3801000	Now I'm not saying they're evading tax but it's legal tax avoidance.
3801000	3806000	And I find it incredible that the World Bank's development model would accept the possibility.
3806000	3812000	We're helping a country develop by investing in a business which is in tax haven.
3812000	3814000	Can you explain that to me at least?
3814000	3829000	Well we went to Mauritius actually because Mauritius is kind of an emblematic example of this whole system as well because when it achieved independence it was written off as kind of a basket case.
3829000	3837000	It had no real resources or obvious way to develop out of the poverty that was in.
3837000	3842000	And then it was the World Bank promote this whole idea of it becoming a tax haven.
3842000	3850000	And now when you go there there's a huge financial district, insurance companies, all these international companies there.
3850000	3856000	And we were looking at a company called Malawi Mangos which is registered in Mauritius and we tried to get their accounts.
3856000	3863000	You can't get their accounts in Mauritius because another part of this is that tax havens are secrecy jurisdictions.
3863000	3868000	So we couldn't get any, even when we were in Mauritius we went to their company's house and we couldn't get any details.
3868000	3870000	But the IFC had invested in Malawi Mangos.
3871000	3873000	Which is meant to be dealing with Malawi.
3873000	3874000	Yeah exactly.
3874000	3876000	But they're registered in Mauritius.
3876000	3884000	And yeah I mean to be honest with you, I think that the World Bank don't care because it's part of the whole model that they're promoting.
3884000	3898000	They are promoting a corporate agenda and their whole model is rests on the fact that the only way the world can develop is by attracting foreign direct investment and attracting foreign corporations to go and invest there.
3898000	3910000	Now if you believe that's the whole of the riddle of development, then tax havens are a benefit because they help corporations and anything that's good for corporations is good for development because there's no other way to develop.
3910000	3912000	And I think that's what they think.
3912000	3921000	I mean they wouldn't say that publicly, they would say but they have no regulations in place to stop investments in companies that are registered in tax havens.
3921000	3924000	For example Malawi Mangos and there's plenty of others.
3925000	3926000	But that's correct.
3926000	3928000	I mean that is really low hanging fruit Matt.
3928000	3932000	Like it's one thing having investments which don't find a big social return.
3932000	3939000	But the idea that oh we're going to help Malawi by helping a company registered in Mauritius which doesn't even pay tax to Malawi.
3939000	3940000	It's mad.
3940000	3950000	Like the United States government is very good on businesses which make profit in its jurisdiction which basically tax dodges much better than we are in this country by the way.
3950000	3955000	And yet or even US nationals who live abroad they find them and they get them to pay the money.
3955000	3959000	But then the whole model of development which is really being pushed by the United States overseas.
3959000	3966000	I mean heaven forbid the US is being hypocritical of course but this just strikes me as like utterly brazen.
3966000	3971000	Like how can you have a developmental model which doesn't even involve businesses which you want to grow if you believe in the private sector.
3971000	3975000	Clearly those businesses should be paying tax to pay for state services.
3975000	3976000	Clearly.
3976000	3978000	But that doesn't even seem to be included there.
3978000	3979000	No.
3979000	3980000	I mean I can't tell you.
3980000	3981000	I mean I agree with you.
3981000	3982000	It's shocking.
3982000	3990000	But then it's shocking that an aid organization whose stated goal is to alleviate global poverty is investing in a diamond mine in Tanzania.
3990000	3991000	It makes no sense.
3991000	3996000	Or a five star hotel or a shopping center in El Salvador or a gated community in El Salvador.
3996000	4004000	Every country in the world there's these bizarre projects and it goes to the fact that it's an extremist point of view.
4005000	4013000	Extreme economic ideology that has proven to be a disaster pretty much everywhere it's been practiced because you talk about nationalism.
4013000	4014000	Right.
4014000	4018000	And I agree with you that it's often especially in the developing world.
4018000	4020000	Those kind of economic nationalism is a good thing.
4020000	4021000	Resource.
4021000	4023000	I used to work 100% when I worked at the Financial Times.
4023000	4033000	One of the funniest things about it was whenever any government talked about using the resources for themselves nationalizing a mining company or taxing those corporations high.
4034000	4039000	It was called resource nationalism and that was a pejorative.
4039000	4042000	It was seen as oh no that's a bad thing.
4042000	4044000	You shouldn't be in control of your resources.
4044000	4046000	And that's how it goes around the world.
4046000	4052000	In Latin America in the 50s and 60s import substitution model was really successful.
4052000	4062000	Massive keeping out products so you could develop your infant industries without flooding your own market with foreign goods.
4062000	4063000	It's good.
4063000	4066000	It's a good thing and it helped develop domestic economies.
4066000	4076000	That was completely destroyed in the 70s and 80s by these aid institutions or the Bretton Woods institutions which we're told were about development.
4076000	4086000	And that's what I think that a realization people need to understand is that the word development is a very different thing if you work within these institutions.
4086000	4089000	It's not helping the poor develop.
4089000	4093000	It's greasing the entry of corporate corporations into the developing world.
4093000	4099000	That is the major role because they believe that's the only way that the developing world can develop.
4099000	4101000	And it's not coincidence that they believe that.
4101000	4107000	They believe that because essentially they're promoting an ideology which benefits the richest people in the world.
4107000	4110000	They were set up by the US and the UK essentially.
4110000	4113000	I think most people say they're skeptics of sort of trade and aid.
4113000	4116000	They're skeptics but they'll say look it's a mixed bag.
4116000	4125000	But from what you're describing you know the existing trade and aid model which we have with the World Bank with the IMF with aid agencies with various NGOs.
4125000	4129000	It looks like to me a machine to generate inequality.
4129000	4135000	It's like an algorithm to create as much inequality as possible and you compare that to what's going on for instance in China.
4135000	4137000	State led hundreds of millions of people brought out of poverty.
4137000	4143000	Now I'm not saying China is perfect but you've got two quite different paradigms there and it's quite obvious which one works.
4143000	4150000	Another example of this is I always think what must be amazing working in the World Bank and being an economist
4150000	4153000	and trying to develop all these theories about how you get out of poverty.
4153000	4159000	And then looking at Evan Morales' Bolivia that started in 2005.
4159000	4165000	Their model was to nationalise huge amounts of companies straight away within a hundred days.
4165000	4172000	They were later praised by the World Bank and IMF for their economic success.
4172000	4176000	Growth rates, high, massive poverty reduction programme.
4176000	4181000	That was all done with policies which were the opposite of what the IMF and the World Bank tell you to do.
4181000	4189000	And it's like you say it's very, very bizarre that people don't look at that and think well maybe we're promoting the wrong policies.
4189000	4190000	They do the opposite.
4190000	4194000	They say we'll push it harder when countries come out of the cold.
4194000	4202000	So for example in Myanmar we went an interesting time because it was a time when they thought democracy was on the path towards democracy.
4202000	4206000	And obviously Myanmar's been out in the cold for decades.
4206000	4212000	And we were talking to all these institutions about what policies they were instituting.
4212000	4214000	And it was all the same ones I've been talking about.
4214000	4218000	It was signed bilateral investment treaties in Shrine, ISDS.
4218000	4222000	Sign up for IFC loans to get foreign corporations to enter.
4222000	4225000	Open an SEZ special economic zone which we went to.
4225000	4229000	There was one called Tilawa which was being set up actually by the Japanese aid agency.
4229000	4234000	Because the other point is we should come on special economic zones but they are often funded by aid organisations as well.
4234000	4238000	Building a special economic zone is our aid money has been used for.
4238000	4248000	All these things, the menu of policies that the World Bank, IMF, regional development banks push on countries when they come in being reintegrated
4248000	4254000	are all the ones that show as you say very very little success in developing countries.
4254000	4264000	And the reason, I mean I don't think it's a conspiracy to say the reason that they hold to these quite extremist ideas that don't benefit the majority
4264000	4267000	is because they're never meant to.
4267000	4269000	They're meant to benefit corporate power.
4269000	4271000	They're meant to benefit the 1%.
4271000	4274000	That was why they were set up in the first place.
4275000	4277000	I'll just finish with this.
4277000	4284000	The person that talks about this quite eloquently is Joseph Stiglitz who was a chief economist at the World Bank for a long time
4284000	4288000	and he wrote that famous book Globalisation and it's discontent.
4288000	4293000	Now he's kind of still thinks that there was an idealistic thread and it went wrong.
4293000	4297000	But if you read about the people that are in control now, he calls them extremists.
4297000	4305000	They were people that during his time, he saw that they were taking over the levers of power within the World Bank particularly
4305000	4313000	and pushing an extremist agenda which is still in place and should be got rid of
4313000	4316000	because the other thing is development sounds boring when you set to people
4316000	4319000	but what it describes is how the majority of humanity run their economies.
4319000	4326000	It's extremely important what theories are being promoted because it has a massive impact on billions of people.
4327000	4333000	It's like you said before, the left, I don't think engage as much as they should on these issues
4333000	4339000	because these were all issues that exercised the left in the 90s at the end of the Cold War
4339000	4344000	and particularly you had Seattle, every WTO meeting was there were huge protests
4344000	4349000	and then that all stopped with September 11th and the drive to war in Iraq.
4349000	4353000	The left's attention moved away from what was called the anti-globalisation movement
4353000	4361000	which was a misnomer but it was a big movement globally towards the anti-war movement and the war on terror
4361000	4368000	and I think that maybe that's dissipating a bit but I think the left needs to re-engage with these issues
4368000	4372000	because for me having written this book and having looked into this stuff
4372000	4377000	I think that there's no way you can understand politics today here globally
4377000	4382000	without seeing it through the lens of corporate power and how they've taken over
4382000	4385000	and cannibalised the state that created them.
4385000	4389000	Let's talk about Europe quickly because there's a bank, there's an equivalent to the World Bank,
4389000	4394000	it's called the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, the EBRD
4394000	4398000	and it's funded by European Union member states, i.e. their taxpayers.
4398000	4405000	So explain to me how Europe's taxpayers, including British taxpayers, helped fund the expansion of Little.
4405000	4410000	So the EBRD is another interesting institution which was set up at an interesting time,
4410000	4414000	it was set up in April 1991 at the end of the Cold War
4414000	4418000	and what it was about was essentially the same as the World Bank,
4418000	4421000	it was about integrating the World Bank after the Second World War,
4421000	4426000	it was about integrating Eastern Europe, former Soviet bloc, into the capitalist system
4426000	4433000	and it was on the principle of the same as the IFC, we all invest in the private sector
4433000	4436000	which might otherwise not want to go to these new markets.
4436000	4443000	Now, like with the IFC, it's just become a complete racket and joke.
4443000	4452000	They've spent a billion dollars giving little money to expand into Eastern Europe.
4452000	4457000	This is a huge, massively rich corporation, it does not need non-commercial loans
4457000	4460000	to expand into different places anywhere.
4460000	4465000	We say we, but again, just to be clear, this is taxpayer money coming from the UK or France,
4465000	4469000	it's been giving to Little this huge multinational to expand and to make more money.
4469000	4477000	Yeah, and Little has huge, the other part of this is that a lot of the companies that have invested in
4477000	4480000	have huge controversies about how they treat workers.
4480000	4484000	Little particularly in Eastern Europe, we went to Poland and a couple of other places
4484000	4489000	and talked to workers who worked for Little and they said that their conditions were bad
4489000	4497000	and that the company was actually uniquely bad in comparison to other ones.
4497000	4503000	So it's not just, it's aid money that they don't need, taxpayer money to expand that they don't need
4503000	4511000	and the company itself is particularly and uniquely bad treatment of its workers.
4511000	4516000	So it makes no sense, sorry to go back to the same point, but it doesn't make sense
4516000	4524000	if your understanding of aid and development is the one that comes straight from the World Bank.
4524000	4531000	If you believe that they're telling the truth and that their aim is to alleviate global poverty,
4531000	4533000	yeah, it doesn't make sense.
4533000	4536000	If you start looking into it and understanding that that's a lie
4536000	4540000	and it's about greasing the entry of corporations into new markets
4540000	4545000	and it's also about enshrining capitalism as a system all over the world,
4545000	4549000	Eastern Europe, but in Latin America, Africa and Asia, then it makes sense.
4549000	4555000	Not even capitalism, right? Because as you talk about in the book, Little's growth meant that
4555000	4560000	smaller retailers, you know, grosses, etc. closed down outdoor food markets,
4560000	4563000	which by the way were selling produce at a cheaper rate.
4563000	4567000	So it's not like they were breaking up food cooperatives or something like that.
4567000	4569000	There was a very different kind.
4569000	4572000	There was a particular kind of capitalism, I should say, which was being imposed on
4572000	4573000	Central and Eastern Europe.
4573000	4576000	And it seems to me that basically the EBRD and the European Union,
4576000	4580000	the Big Wigs of Brussels and Strasbourg and yes, I sound like Farage, sorry.
4580000	4583000	Sometimes people disagree with the right about something.
4583000	4585000	They basically want to European Walmart.
4585000	4587000	So it's like a status symbol.
4587000	4590000	We have a single market, so we have to have like across the whole continent,
4590000	4593000	because we believe in this federal project of like a European Walmart.
4593000	4595000	Who's going to pay for it? European taxpayer.
4595000	4600000	Meanwhile, you've got, you know, Little execs making big, big bucks.
4600000	4602000	And it's insane, Matt.
4602000	4604000	The idea that expansion is being funded by the taxpayer.
4604000	4605000	Final question.
4605000	4608000	She spoke about it earlier and obviously you're very passionate about it,
4608000	4609000	especially economic zones.
4609000	4610000	Where do these fit?
4610000	4614000	We associate them with China, but clearly they're quite integrated with trade and aid.
4614000	4619000	Yeah, I mean, it's all part of the same menu of policy prescriptions,
4619000	4623000	which is offered by the World Bank.
4623000	4628000	Yeah, this was my most interesting part of the book for me personally to report,
4628000	4632000	because I just think it's kind of a parable for the whole story.
4632000	4635000	Because what I'll just explain what a special economic zone is.
4635000	4644000	A special economic zone is a territory which is chiseled off from the national territory in terms of tax regime,
4644000	4647000	import, export, tariffs, customs, all that.
4647000	4653000	All the stuff that a national government imposes on corporations when they work in a country is off.
4653000	4655000	You know, those laws don't apply.
4655000	4660000	So we call them in a book, Corporate Utopias, and that's essentially what they were, what they are.
4660000	4665000	They were created, actually, funnily enough, and this was a really interesting part of the story,
4665000	4672000	which was the first special economic zone ever, or so-called, was in Shannon in Ireland, in West Ireland,
4672000	4674000	and we went to Shannon to report it.
4674000	4683000	And this was a sort of really mercurial entrepreneur called Brendan O'Regan.
4683000	4684000	He's quite famous in Western Ireland.
4684000	4689000	He had this idea that Shannon needed to have a new development model off,
4689000	4696000	because it was a famous airport, and it was an airport that refueled airplanes that were transatlantic flights.
4696000	4700000	And when technology developed enough that an airplane could go further,
4700000	4705000	they were basically going to be out of any kind of work.
4705000	4710000	So he said, well, what we should do is we should create this little zone where corporations could do what they want.
4710000	4712000	They don't have to pay the tax to the government.
4712000	4717000	They don't have to do all the import, export duties and customs, and they did it.
4717000	4721000	And that was in 1956, and it has absolutely exploded.
4721000	4729000	And as you mentioned, China, it's basically the model which has propelled China to economic superpower status,
4729000	4731000	and they're quite aware of that.
4731000	4739000	The funny thing was, when we were in Shannon, the head of the Shannon Chamber of Commerce said that Chinese dignitaries often come.
4740000	4744000	And Xi Jinping was there, not that long ago.
4744000	4747000	Yeah, and they said, I think it was Xi.
4747000	4759000	They said that it was either him or a previous leader made a request when they came that they wanted to stop in the taxi to the hotel when he came to Shannon
4759000	4763000	on Tully Glass Hill, which is this hill overlooking this.
4763000	4764000	I've been there.
4764000	4768000	It's just a nondescript hill overlooking a grey industrial estate in Western Ireland.
4768000	4778000	And the second most powerful man in the world requested that the taxi could stop on the way to the hotel so he could have a moment of pause for reflection to look at the Shannon economic zone,
4778000	4782000	especially economic zone, because the Chinese are like, this is where it all began.
4782000	4788000	But it's become a, as I said, it's gone all over the world, and it's come to Britain.
4788000	4796000	Two years ago, Rishi Sunak, oh, sorry, it wasn't Rishi Sunak then, but the UK government announced that we're going to have 13 free ports here.
4796000	4800000	And it's the same special economic zone idea.
4800000	4803000	Corporations won't have to abide by national laws.
4803000	4816000	And I think that what you've seen with the development of the special economic zone is more and more pressure to create a global economy and national laws in corporate interest,
4816000	4822000	because often policies which are trialled in special economic zones are then become national policies.
4822000	4827000	And in fact, we use the term in the book, special economic world, we're living in a special economic world now.
4827000	4839000	The race to the bottom means that every, the most successful countries for attracting foreign direct investments are the ones that have bad labor laws, bad environmental regulations,
4839000	4847000	all the stuff that we think of as the basis of a civilized society, that's what you can't have if you want to attract foreign direct investment.
4847000	4852000	And as I've said, the World Bank, IMF, that's the only way you can develop is to attract foreign direct investment.
4852000	4857000	So special economic zones are kind of, for me, the emblematic case.
4857000	4861000	And I'll just finish with this, that I went to Cambodia.
4861000	4873000	I think this was probably the most profound reporting trip that I made during the, but I went to Cambodia to report on, from two special economic zones in one in Nong Pen and one in the place called Bavette,
4873000	4876000	which is on the border with Vietnam.
4876000	4879000	And actually, they're often built on the borders because of trade.
4879000	4888000	And Bavette actually, just because everyone's talking about Henry Kissinger at the moment, Bavette was one of the places that he destroyed an operation menu during the Vietnam War.
4888000	4891000	But I actually, they wouldn't let me in.
4891000	4894000	And then I snuck it, the one in Bavette, they wouldn't let me in.
4894000	4900000	And then they snuck in and started interviewing workers within the special economic zone.
4900000	4906000	And it was an incredible experience because they basically said, like, we can't organize here.
4906000	4911000	So part of the special economic zone is about warehousing workers.
4912000	4920000	And they said, if we try and organize, they will sack us or even we might be the victims of physical violence.
4920000	4937000	And what I was told was that often in places, especially in economic zones in Cambodia, but it happens around the world, is that workers will just erupt in violent outbreaks because they're not allowed to organize in a legitimate way.
4937000	4939000	There's just constant violence.
4939000	4941000	They'll start smashing up the machines.
4941000	4943000	They'll beat up their manager, whatever it is.
4943000	4947000	And that happened all over Cambodia and the world.
4947000	4960000	And it really did show me the power of unions and how important they are to a civilized society because most of the unions in Cambodia, even the ones that did operate, were called yellow unions.
4960000	4963000	They were co-opted by the corporations or the state.
4963000	4978000	And I did interview some independent unions and they were just working within extremely difficult conditions in terms of repression from the state, repression from the corporations.
4978000	4982000	But they were winning.
4982000	4985000	The minimum wage when I was there was being raised.
4985000	4993000	And it was a kind of amazing experience in the context of all this corporate power and the context of working within special economic zones.
4993000	4994000	They were winning.
4994000	4997000	So that was quite a hopeful way to end it.
4997000	5010000	And I think that we haven't touched on this, but I want to just say it before we end that a major part of this is not just corporations exerting their power.
5010000	5021000	A major part of this is states exerting power on behalf of corporations because everywhere I went in the world, whether it be peasants in Tanzania,
5021000	5028000	poor people in Colombia being victimized by paramilitaries, wherever it was, I'd say, OK, well, look,
5028000	5031000	you're being oppressed by this corporation because you're standing up for your rights.
5031000	5033000	What's your government doing for you?
5033000	5034000	And they will say, oh, that'd be silly.
5034000	5036000	The government works for the corporation.
5036000	5037000	Every single one.
5037000	5038000	That's how it works.
5038000	5041000	The government is not working for the people.
5041000	5047000	The government is working to help the corporation enforce their rule in that person's country.
5047000	5053000	And that's a very important conceptual understanding to come to because it's the opposite of what we're told,
5053000	5060000	which is that the state and the corporation are two adversarial power centers and they duke it out, but they don't.
5060000	5065000	The corporation has a super national system, which we talked about, which operates above national governments,
5065000	5070000	but even the national governments themselves have become completely infested with corporate power.
5070000	5072000	And in some ways, it's very explicit.
5072000	5079000	For example, in the UK, the Department of Trade and Industry has a whole taxpayer funded body called the Defence and Security Organization,
5079000	5083000	which is role is to promote arms companies around the world, private arms companies.
5083000	5086000	We pay for that, mainly BAE systems.
5086000	5088000	But that's a very explicit bit.
5088000	5091000	It operates on a much more implicit level across the board as well.
5091000	5102000	So I think that the left going forward needs to understand that if we don't see the level of power that corporations have accrued
5102000	5113000	and understand how they're exerting it, then we're going to be fighting the wrong battles because the corporations want us to be talking,
5113000	5115000	want a certain discourse on the left.
5115000	5129000	I think the discourse we have now, the culture war is a function of the corporate takeover of our whole discourse in that it's really conducive to corporations just working in the background
5129000	5139000	and not really talking about them and no one really operating any kind of pressures on them to stop the cannibalization of all our resources.
5140000	5144000	Corporate friendly identity politics has taken off and I don't think that's a coincidence.
5144000	5151000	I think it's very conducive to certain interests that we constantly talk about culture war issues.
5151000	5153000	And that's the left and the right.
5153000	5157000	And we ignore bigger structural economic issues at our peril.
5157000	5160000	Matt Kennard, that was a great conversation.
5160000	5162000	Thank you so much for joining us on Downstream.
