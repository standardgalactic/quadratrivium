WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.940
We will need each other, and we, you know, I do believe that every, you know, victory

00:06.940 --> 00:16.780
for the fascist right is also a story of division, sectarianism, failure to make strategic alliances

00:16.780 --> 00:20.720
on the anti-fascist left, and we're on the, we are on the knife edge, we are just on the

00:20.720 --> 00:21.720
knife edge.

00:21.720 --> 00:28.960
We can't afford to destroy each other.

00:28.960 --> 00:33.800
When we were all locked down and isolating, conspiracy theorists went on the march.

00:33.800 --> 00:40.200
The emergence of anti-vaccine scaremongering coupled with virulent antisemitism was disconcerting

00:40.200 --> 00:42.000
for all of us.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.040
But it was even more nuts for Naomi Klein, journalist and author of The Shock Doctrine,

00:48.040 --> 00:54.400
who found herself constantly getting mixed up with Naomi Wolfe, another author and academic.

00:54.400 --> 01:00.120
Naomi found herself being drawn into a strange mirror world as she tracked her doppelganger's

01:00.120 --> 01:06.840
journey from feminist, academic and liberal darling to gun-toting anti-vaxxer, palling

01:06.840 --> 01:09.840
around with Steve Bannon.

01:09.840 --> 01:16.240
What was it about COVID that strengthened the far right and how did all of us create doppelgangers

01:16.240 --> 01:18.360
of ourselves online?

01:18.360 --> 01:23.520
Stay tuned to find out as I talk to Naomi Klein for Downstream.

01:23.520 --> 01:29.000
So when did it stop being funny that you were being confused for Naomi Wolfe?

01:29.000 --> 01:35.360
I mean, I still find it funny sometimes to be honest, especially because it still happens.

01:35.360 --> 01:41.560
In fact, I was doing a TV interview in the States last week and the host had to do a

01:41.560 --> 01:42.560
retake.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.560
No.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.560
And he didn't realize that he'd done it.

01:44.560 --> 01:48.200
And I was like, you have to stop now and redo that because you just called me Naomi Wolfe.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.800
Oh my God, you should have kept it in.

01:50.840 --> 01:53.040
I'm not going to name him, but he knows who he is.

01:55.320 --> 02:02.000
Yeah, I think, I mean, to be honest, it's always been a little cringy, you know, starting

02:02.000 --> 02:06.360
from the very beginning, you know, I start the book with this story about being at Occupy

02:06.360 --> 02:15.320
Wall Street and being in a public loo and hearing a couple of demonstrators talking

02:15.320 --> 02:19.960
about an article that Naomi Klein had written and, oh my God, she doesn't understand our

02:20.000 --> 02:21.640
demands or our movement.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.240
And obviously that was lower stakes.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.880
I mean, that was, they were talking about an article by Naomi Wolfe.

02:25.880 --> 02:31.720
Did you call from inside the store like, sorry, you've got the wrong?

02:31.720 --> 02:38.600
No, I mean, I froze, you know, like flashbacks to high school, mean girls, like, what have

02:38.600 --> 02:39.600
I written?

02:39.600 --> 02:40.600
You know?

02:40.600 --> 02:44.720
And then as I listened more, I recognized the article that they were discussing and knew

02:44.720 --> 02:46.080
that I had not written it.

02:46.080 --> 02:51.400
And so I just very casually came out and made eye contact in the mirror and said, I think

02:51.400 --> 02:53.040
you're talking about Naomi Wolfe.

02:53.040 --> 02:58.720
Words I have had to say many times since then, so that was 2011.

02:58.720 --> 03:04.240
But even then, I mean, it was funny and I would entertain my friends, you know, overdrinks

03:04.240 --> 03:10.160
with these sorts of stories, they couldn't get enough of it.

03:10.160 --> 03:16.280
But I mean, I would also get, you know, I'm going to be talking to Andrew Marr later today.

03:16.280 --> 03:20.200
And I'm going to remind him that the last time he interviewed me, it was on the BBC

03:20.200 --> 03:22.680
and he referred to me as Naomi Campbell.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.680
Naomi Campbell.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.560
I was like, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

03:26.560 --> 03:30.960
You broke so many barriers in fashion, you know.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.800
That one is harder because then I feel like, you know, the audience is really quite disappointed

03:34.800 --> 03:35.800
when I come out, you know.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.960
How do you feel about your feud with tower banks?

03:38.760 --> 03:40.480
Yeah, the whole blood diamond thing.

03:40.480 --> 03:45.200
Yeah, you really, I mean, in hindsight, except for most blood diamonds, really poor form

03:45.200 --> 03:46.680
for the author of No Logo.

03:46.680 --> 03:49.800
So there's something about the name Naomi that people do have trouble with.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.800
But no.

03:50.800 --> 03:57.160
So I mean, even back to Occupy Wall Street, it was, the stakes were lower, but it still

03:57.160 --> 04:02.400
bothered me just for sort of niche reasons because that particular context, she had written

04:02.400 --> 04:08.320
an article where just, you know, if you, I'm sure you remember from Occupy Wall Street,

04:08.320 --> 04:15.400
there was a very, you know, there was a decision not to have a list of demands that politicians

04:15.400 --> 04:17.400
could just meet and everyone would go home.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.960
It was much, you know, it had a deeper critique of the system than that.

04:20.960 --> 04:25.120
And what Wolf had done in the article that they were upset about was claim that she had

04:25.120 --> 04:30.440
divined the demands of Occupy Wall Street and she came up with a list based, yes, based

04:30.440 --> 04:35.920
on a random assortment of online communications that she'd had.

04:35.920 --> 04:40.880
So even though that was like pretty low stakes, for me, it was quite a cringe because I do

04:40.880 --> 04:44.680
try to be pretty careful not to do that sort of thing.

04:44.680 --> 04:48.880
I mean, it was one of the things that really struck me about the book, which is that one

04:48.880 --> 04:55.080
of the early chapters, when you're talking about being mixed up for Naomi Wolf.

04:55.080 --> 05:01.960
Do you sort of really strive to talk about the rigor of your journalistic work and the

05:01.960 --> 05:08.400
depth of the research and the scrutiny that you apply to your own writing?

05:08.400 --> 05:12.920
Do you feel a bit defensive about this mix up and that you feel that you've got to put

05:12.920 --> 05:15.320
all this distance between the two of you?

05:15.320 --> 05:19.600
Well, I mean, if anything, I think I've put less distance between the two of us.

05:19.600 --> 05:24.440
Like I've probably cemented the connection forever, I'll never be able to escape it.

05:24.440 --> 05:31.400
And I do think that it is important to make a distinction between what investigative journalism

05:31.400 --> 05:38.560
does, what rigorous research is, how we make sure that we don't go to press with speculation.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.960
Because honestly, I think a lot of people are confused about that.

05:41.960 --> 05:48.600
And part of what she does, and she's just a case study of a broader movement, which is

05:48.600 --> 05:50.280
this conspiracy culture.

05:50.280 --> 05:54.000
And I don't call it conspiracy theory because there really isn't a coherent theory.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.840
It's just jumping around.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.360
She's more of a conspiracy influencer than she is a theorist.

05:59.360 --> 06:05.120
I don't think it's really fair to theory to call her a theorist because the theories

06:05.120 --> 06:07.840
are constantly contradicting each other, right?

06:07.840 --> 06:14.120
One minute COVID is a bio weapon cooked up by the Chinese to depopulate the West and

06:14.120 --> 06:18.080
the next minute it's nothing, don't worry about it, don't even put on a mask.

06:18.080 --> 06:23.360
So like you presumably would have to choose, yeah, between the two.

06:24.360 --> 06:30.640
But there is something about the fact that there are people who consume these things interchangeably,

06:30.640 --> 06:31.640
right?

06:31.640 --> 06:36.960
And I describe this as a doppelganger of journalism because it uses a bunch of the conventions,

06:36.960 --> 06:42.480
breaking scoop, like, I've got the papers, smoking gun, all of this.

06:42.480 --> 06:47.760
But because it's within the attention economy and the need to be first out of the gate to

06:47.760 --> 06:52.560
get the clicks to get the cloud, you leap over all the guardrails.

06:52.560 --> 06:58.200
So yeah, I spend some time in the book just sort of explaining what we try to do and whether

06:58.200 --> 07:03.480
it's investigative journalism or academic research to check our facts based on the idea

07:03.480 --> 07:05.480
that facts don't matter.

07:05.480 --> 07:10.800
But it isn't so much about me putting distance between her because it's a doppelganger.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.640
And doppelganger books are, you know, you have to see yourself in the mirror of your

07:14.640 --> 07:17.080
doppelganger or you have failed.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.680
Do you ever wonder who the mad woman in the attic is?

07:19.680 --> 07:21.280
Like is it her or is it me?

07:21.280 --> 07:22.280
Absolutely.

07:22.760 --> 07:26.200
There's been uncomfortable winces of recognition throughout this journey.

07:26.760 --> 07:36.120
I mean, the moment when Naomi Wolfe is on BBC Radio and her book Outrageous just gets a

07:36.680 --> 07:38.680
tractor driven through it.

07:38.680 --> 07:45.240
So it turns out that she made this reading error and it meant that what was supposed to

07:45.240 --> 07:48.440
be spectacular revelation was exactly wrong.

07:49.320 --> 07:56.840
I felt such a pang of empathy when that happened because I thought, oh, my God, that could be

07:56.840 --> 07:58.040
me one day.

07:58.040 --> 08:04.440
And it was this horrible fear of seeing something that you've always had nightmares about

08:04.440 --> 08:06.200
happening to someone else.

08:06.200 --> 08:12.280
And then you want to put distance between them and you by going, how could you be so

08:12.280 --> 08:12.600
stupid?

08:12.600 --> 08:14.040
How could this happen to you?

08:14.040 --> 08:18.680
I mean, did you ever have those moments of like empathetic recognition with her where

08:18.680 --> 08:20.360
you go, oh, God, that could have been me.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.760
I mean, it's every writer's worst nightmare.

08:26.520 --> 08:30.520
I mean, it's a little hard for me to just feel straight empathy because a lot of people

08:30.520 --> 08:33.080
thought it was me who made that mistake.

08:33.080 --> 08:38.920
So like, you know, I only found out that it happened because my feed was filled with people

08:38.920 --> 08:41.480
going thoughts and prayers to Naomi.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.120
I was like, oh, no, what has she done now?

08:44.120 --> 08:49.000
And I'm always having to kind of reverse engineer whatever the scandal is based on.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.440
People either literally thinking it's me or sort of sending mock sympathy.

08:56.840 --> 09:02.600
But, you know, I like, as you know, in the book, I have a little maybe a little sort

09:02.600 --> 09:11.400
of half-jokey equation about not only her, but many figures who who, you know, we've

09:12.040 --> 09:15.560
many of us have had conversations like, whatever happened to that person, I thought,

09:15.560 --> 09:16.600
I thought I knew who they were.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.040
I thought I could trust them.

09:18.040 --> 09:23.720
And now suddenly they're palling around with Tucker Carlson or Elon Musk or, you know,

09:23.720 --> 09:25.480
whatever happened to Phil in the blanks.

09:27.240 --> 09:35.880
And so I had this equation that might not be perfect for every person, but it is narcissism,

09:36.360 --> 09:41.960
bracket grandiosity times social media addiction, which you and I have discussed.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.560
I don't want that mirror being held up to me.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.080
I don't want to see the faces in this.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.960
Plus midlife crisis, which you don't have to worry about for a while.

09:49.960 --> 09:50.680
I got 10 years.

09:52.040 --> 09:56.120
Divided by public shaming equals right wing meltdown.

09:56.120 --> 10:02.680
So I think that that, you know, I think that she should have been held accountable for those

10:02.920 --> 10:06.440
for those major errors in outrageous.

10:06.440 --> 10:11.880
And in general, book publishing, you know, doesn't fact check as much as they should.

10:11.880 --> 10:19.240
I always, you know, I'm lucky to be one of the few writers who can afford to pay my own

10:19.240 --> 10:23.240
fact checkers, but I pay my fact checkers out of out of my book advance, you know,

10:23.240 --> 10:28.280
I pay my research assistants and then a whole separate process of going back over every single

10:28.280 --> 10:33.800
fact because, because my first book made me a target, right?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.560
I couldn't afford it for my first book.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.840
But after that book, I, you know, I've, I've, I've had the fear of God

10:41.400 --> 10:46.360
to not be in that situation where, where a reporter discovers that you have a huge

10:46.360 --> 10:49.400
error in the middle of your book and the whole thing gets discredited.

10:50.280 --> 10:54.200
So, but so I think accountability is good.

10:54.200 --> 11:00.200
But what happened after that was just a disgusting pile on online where people were,

11:00.200 --> 11:05.880
I mean, I think as you say, like putting that distance between them and her,

11:07.000 --> 11:12.680
because everybody, it's everybody's worst nightmare and just having a lot of fun

11:13.240 --> 11:16.680
shaming her and turning her into a spectacle.

11:16.680 --> 11:20.920
And I think that that probably nudged her a little bit in the direction.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.360
I mean, and I think she should be held accountable for these terrible decisions

11:24.360 --> 11:27.400
she's made to align herself with some of the most dangerous men on the planet.

11:28.920 --> 11:33.080
But, you know, I don't think it's great that people, you know, are so cruel to each other

11:33.080 --> 11:35.240
online. That's my radical position today.

11:35.240 --> 11:39.640
I mean, you're talking about the word accountability in some ways it's easier

11:39.640 --> 11:44.360
to talk about accountability for Naomi Wolfe because she's this individual and we've seen

11:44.840 --> 11:49.080
this descent into fact free conspiracism.

11:49.080 --> 11:55.720
But the responsibility for cruelty online is a lot more diffuse and we can more easily dodge it.

11:55.720 --> 12:04.920
Yeah. And, you know, the reason why I thought this might be a fun idea for a book and it got

12:04.920 --> 12:11.080
less fun, you know, there's I have a quote early on in the book from Philip Roth about

12:11.080 --> 12:18.120
from his really quite wonderful doppelganger novel Operation Shylock, which is about Philip Roth,

12:18.680 --> 12:23.320
a character called Philip Roth who has a doppelganger called Philip Roth creating all kinds of mayhem.

12:23.320 --> 12:29.560
And he says it's it's it's too ridiculous to take seriously and too serious to be ridiculous.

12:30.120 --> 12:34.680
And when I started this, it was more on the ridiculous side of the ledger.

12:34.680 --> 12:39.400
And then as things went on and she got closer and closer to Steve Bannon started

12:40.360 --> 12:45.240
engaging in election denial, started taking pictures of herself with her guns, started

12:45.240 --> 12:51.400
taking posting pictures of her new one, not so new anymore, but her husband is a

12:51.400 --> 12:57.800
private detective slash mercenary who likes to post pictures of himself doing target practice

12:57.800 --> 13:03.480
and so on. So it's gotten more serious than ridiculous just because it is part of a broader

13:03.560 --> 13:07.800
fascist surge globally. So, yeah.

13:09.080 --> 13:16.520
So you talked about that that seriousness and that kind of quite scary descent into fascism.

13:18.840 --> 13:24.200
How can you stop people laughing? You know, when does when does the comedy stop and the sense of

13:24.200 --> 13:30.120
urgency kick in? Well, you know, this is why I think that that sentence is really resonant,

13:30.120 --> 13:34.920
because I feel like people have that same feeling about Trump a lot of the time, or at least they

13:34.920 --> 13:39.640
did before where it was just like unclear and Boris Johnson and Duterte. I mean, these sort of

13:39.640 --> 13:46.520
buffoonish figures. Berlusconi, I think was the. Oh, absolutely. The original, you know.

13:46.520 --> 13:52.040
Bolsonaro is the only one who's not at all funny. I know. I mean, he is funny in that he just kept

13:52.040 --> 13:58.680
getting COVID. That was it was like sideshow Bob stepping on the rakes. Like it wasn't a comedy

13:58.680 --> 14:05.880
of his making. It was kind of God's comedy. Exactly. But he didn't seem to be playing

14:05.880 --> 14:12.200
playing up the character. But yeah, I think, yeah, at what point do we stop? I think we're still

14:12.200 --> 14:19.560
trying to figure out how to how to respond to the weight of our historical moment and,

14:20.200 --> 14:26.920
frankly, failing most days, right? I think there are flashes. I don't know about you where I feel

14:26.920 --> 14:36.040
like, okay, we're we're getting close to touching just how consequential the decisions we're making

14:36.040 --> 14:43.640
are in these in these in these years of, you know, climate breakdown, surging, fascism,

14:44.200 --> 14:52.440
border violence, just oligarchic concentration of I mean, wealth, it's a lot. It's a lot. And so

14:53.400 --> 14:59.240
I mean, this, I think the through line of the book and the reason why I thought that doppelganger

15:00.200 --> 15:04.440
doubles like the book, the through line of the book is less her than it is the way in which we

15:04.440 --> 15:12.280
create doubles of ourselves. And our groups, you know, respond to each other in these in these

15:12.280 --> 15:18.440
sorts of mirror world ways, we react to one another rather than behave based on legible

15:18.440 --> 15:24.360
principles a lot of the time. And my analysis is that all of it is about not looking at what we

15:24.360 --> 15:29.400
need to look at, right? That that, you know, the third section of the book is called the Shadowlands.

15:29.400 --> 15:34.040
And I think that, you know, whether we're staring into our phones looking at our digital doubles,

15:34.040 --> 15:38.600
you know, the way we create these little doppelgangers of ourselves to represent us,

15:39.720 --> 15:45.400
which is, you know, why I thought it was interesting that I lost control over my digital

15:45.400 --> 15:51.080
identity during COVID. And I thought, well, this is an interesting way in, you know, or the way we

15:51.080 --> 15:58.680
sort of project all that we want to distance ourselves from onto the other as if we are the

15:58.680 --> 16:05.080
ones who are really, you know, married to truth and facts and, you know, facing the weight of our

16:05.080 --> 16:09.240
moment when we all know that we are distracting ourselves endlessly and looking away endlessly.

16:09.240 --> 16:14.840
And, you know, it's, you know, there's more than one way to look away. Conspiracy culture

16:14.840 --> 16:19.960
plays that role for a lot of people. It's, you know, just a decision to divorce from

16:19.960 --> 16:24.280
any recognizable shared reality and just make up your own facts, make up your own reality. But,

16:25.160 --> 16:30.280
you know. I mean, one of the things that I was reflecting on as I was reading this book was

16:31.160 --> 16:36.680
my own career in the media, because when I started out, I was always paired up against

16:36.680 --> 16:44.520
really old white guys. And that allowed me to have a sort of brand identity as young,

16:44.520 --> 16:50.840
female, brown, left wing, disruptor. Oh my God, what is she going to do next? And then over time,

16:50.840 --> 16:56.600
I started getting partnered with young, right wing women of color. So it was like they were

16:56.600 --> 17:04.040
putting me up against my own Wario. And I then suddenly felt the sense of nausea where I was

17:04.040 --> 17:11.480
like, have I contributed to creating this category of right wing talking head where they want the

17:11.480 --> 17:19.880
one of color to play against type? And I've participated in the commodification of identity

17:19.880 --> 17:25.800
to the extent that it becomes very powerful for the right. I mean, I felt quite kind of,

17:25.800 --> 17:30.520
you know, disoriented by it. And I guess I was wondering, when you're looking at your

17:31.080 --> 17:35.320
conspiratorial doppelganger, do you ever feel this little sense of responsibility going,

17:35.320 --> 17:40.760
did I make this in some way? Like it's not just a mirror, did I create this mirror somehow?

17:43.640 --> 17:49.880
You know, I think it is always worth interrogating, right? And looking at, you know, and sometimes

17:49.880 --> 17:57.400
those winces can be really productive, because it pushes you to think about what is it that you're

17:57.400 --> 18:04.840
doing and what, you know, what parts of it are most important to you, right? And if it's an easy

18:04.840 --> 18:09.800
to doppelgang part of you, then you might want to lean into some of the other, because you aren't

18:09.800 --> 18:16.280
just playing an identity game. You know, that's not the way I perceive your role in the media.

18:18.040 --> 18:23.640
You're making arguments, and you're representing a set of values and beliefs. And

18:24.600 --> 18:30.760
they can doppelgang your identity. But, you know, I think it's a lot harder to do that when you're,

18:32.360 --> 18:35.640
you know, when you're making arguments that are genuine, challenged power.

18:36.280 --> 18:44.120
And so I did interrogate, you know, it wasn't only Wolf who was doing a kind of fact, like,

18:44.120 --> 18:49.640
you know, describing the book as a kind of fact-free remix of the shock doctrine specifically.

18:50.200 --> 18:54.760
And here I'm not saying it was deliberate, but there was a way in which, I mean, I still,

18:55.400 --> 19:05.240
like, every tour stop, every time I log on, I hear people who are furious that I

19:06.280 --> 19:11.000
wrote the shock doctrine and have failed to recognize that the vaccines are the biggest

19:11.000 --> 19:15.800
shock doctrine in world history, not for the reasons that I believe they are, because there

19:15.800 --> 19:20.680
should never have been patents, and this was an opportunity for massive illegitimate enrichment,

19:20.680 --> 19:24.280
and we should have, you know, they should have never been patented in the first place,

19:24.280 --> 19:29.640
but because they were violating bodily sovereignty, and, you know, they believe that there has been

19:29.640 --> 19:37.160
a genocide that has been covered up by the quote-unquote elites. There's some graffiti near my house,

19:37.160 --> 19:43.160
where it says anti-vaxxer, and then next to it, I love my sperm, and then like a big picture of

19:43.160 --> 19:51.000
sperm, and I was like... Yeah, so that's the shock doctrine I missed. Yeah, you're really low on

19:51.000 --> 19:57.640
sperm, you really... But no, I think I did feel that, you know, when I started to hear people

19:57.640 --> 20:06.040
using the shock doctrine to sell, you know, what I considered to be largely made-up theories about

20:06.120 --> 20:16.200
how public health measures were an attempt by the CCP and Fauci and Gates to bring in

20:16.840 --> 20:21.160
Chinese social credit, or whatever it was. I mean, the great reset, all of that.

20:22.920 --> 20:26.760
Like, to be clear, I think there have been real examples of what I would call the shock doctrine

20:26.760 --> 20:30.920
in disaster capitalism under cover of COVID. I'm very concerned about them. The NHS has been

20:30.920 --> 20:35.000
attacked, you know, under cover of COVID. I live in Canada, the same thing has happened to our

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
public health care system. A lot of the attacks on the schools about COVID measures are really

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
just attacks on public schools by the same people who always attack public schools under cover of

20:45.000 --> 20:52.760
emergency. But there is this kind of doppelganger of the shock doctrine out there, and I think for

20:52.760 --> 20:58.360
a while it made me less willing to talk about that, because I couldn't figure out how to talk about

20:58.360 --> 21:04.200
the shock doctrine, how to talk about my concerns about Bill Gates, which were not fantastical,

21:04.280 --> 21:10.280
but very provable about what he was doing, providing cover for the drug companies to keep

21:10.280 --> 21:17.880
their patents in place, and so on. Because it was just getting all, it was just a swirl of Bill Gates

21:17.880 --> 21:25.960
tracking, you know, implants. And, you know, I was just getting like the algorithms were

21:25.960 --> 21:31.480
starting to confuse me with Wolf. And I was just like, we're just a mess of Naomi is talking about

21:31.480 --> 21:38.520
Bill Gates. So, but I think the worst thing you can do is let that doppelganger experience

21:39.640 --> 21:47.800
silence you. You know, I regret not talking more about the patents during this period.

21:49.160 --> 21:58.840
I regret any way in which the left has ceded territory to the fake populist right by not going

21:58.840 --> 22:04.840
after corporate power and not making the connections with the logics of capitalism,

22:06.120 --> 22:11.000
because that's just such a gift to the Steve Bannon's of the world who just suck it all up,

22:11.000 --> 22:16.760
or Giorgio Malone, and then twist it and turn it into transphobia and xenophobia,

22:16.760 --> 22:21.880
and, you know, an incredibly malevolent agenda. I mean, is there a way to sort of

22:22.680 --> 22:29.640
reclaim the integrity of left-wing ideas without it being about insisting on your

22:29.640 --> 22:33.400
intellectual property rights? Because the strength of the left has always come from the

22:33.400 --> 22:39.160
dissemination of ideas in a very open way. The communist manifesto was meant to be passed

22:39.160 --> 22:45.000
hand to hand from worker to worker. And then, you know, in some ways, shock doctrine being

22:45.800 --> 22:51.640
appropriated by conspiracy theorists is testament to its success and its its meaning and its

22:51.640 --> 22:56.520
power as an idea. So how do you how do you navigate that as someone who's on the left?

22:57.320 --> 23:04.120
I mean, I agree. I mean, I think the left should be taking popular education as seriously as,

23:04.120 --> 23:09.960
you know, it originally was with the original pamphleteers and the idea of

23:10.600 --> 23:15.880
doing this kind of popular education in part because the alternative was conspiracy theory,

23:15.880 --> 23:22.680
right? I mean, I have a section in the book that looks at anti-Semitism as the socialism of fools

23:22.680 --> 23:28.760
and, you know, in part, you know, looks at the history of Marxist thought as in part being

23:29.400 --> 23:34.280
a history of a whole bunch of Jews banging their head against the brick wall of history,

23:35.080 --> 23:41.400
saying it's not the Jews that are the result of your pain or causing your pain, but it's

23:41.400 --> 23:50.360
actually this system. So I don't think we should any of us should embrace our ideas being distorted

23:50.360 --> 23:56.360
and turned into like a warped mirror of themselves. But is there a way to do that without going,

23:56.360 --> 24:01.080
it's mine, like this is my idea? I don't think it's about intellectual property. I think it's

24:01.080 --> 24:08.920
about having a robust left that is doing system analysis. And, you know, and I think that when

24:08.920 --> 24:18.600
that doesn't happen, conspiracy culture swirls because the center isn't holding, because there's

24:18.600 --> 24:27.240
so much suffering and because all of the promises that capitalism has made about the meritocracy

24:27.240 --> 24:30.760
and if you work hard, you're going to succeed and you'll be able to climb this ladder,

24:31.320 --> 24:37.240
it's falling apart and people know that. And our education system doesn't explain what capitalism

24:37.240 --> 24:43.720
is. It says it's all about sunshine and big max and freedom and getting the rewards that you

24:43.720 --> 24:48.760
deserve. And so when the system fails, people are really, really vulnerable to somebody pulling

24:48.760 --> 24:55.880
them aside and going, it's actually the Jews, or it's actually the CCP or it's this meeting

24:55.880 --> 25:04.040
once a year. And so the need for that robust system analysis is urgent because I think it's the only

25:04.040 --> 25:10.680
force that can drain power from this surging authoritarianism. You know, if they were just

25:10.680 --> 25:16.840
taking the ideas and putting them to good use, then fine. Yes, always. It doesn't matter if you

25:16.840 --> 25:21.800
get credit or not, you want them to disseminate. The problem is this, you know, I listened to

25:21.800 --> 25:27.480
hundreds of hours of Steve Bannon to do, to write this book, unfortunately, and the most chilling

25:27.480 --> 25:32.680
moments were when I was when I would hear him sounding like what the left used to sound like

25:32.680 --> 25:38.280
and doesn't really sound like anymore because there is not as much of a anti-corporate left as

25:38.280 --> 25:42.440
there used to be, let alone an anti-capitalist left. It's much more partisan and reactive.

25:43.320 --> 25:48.520
It's part of the appeal of the likes of Steve Bannon and the very reactionary authoritarian

25:48.520 --> 25:53.960
right is that they're saying, here's how to live and it will make you a better person, a stronger

25:53.960 --> 25:59.000
person, a smarter person, a more worthy person. Whereas the left, we've retreated a lot into like,

25:59.000 --> 26:03.240
you do what you want to do, except there is no you do what you want to do because if you

26:03.240 --> 26:08.440
are perceived in the wrong way, particularly online, people jump down your throat.

26:08.440 --> 26:15.880
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, Bannon is different than some of the other people who are more like,

26:15.880 --> 26:20.600
this is how to live. Like, he's less of a lifestyle guy. Like, he's not Jordan Peterson or...

26:20.600 --> 26:23.000
I don't think anyone goes, how do I get the Steve Bannon look?

26:23.000 --> 26:28.440
Exactly. No, he is more of an organizer. I mean, he is the guy who is organizing,

26:28.680 --> 26:34.200
the takeover of your local Republican Party, your local school board, get those books banned.

26:35.400 --> 26:40.440
He's very deliberately building a political coalition that he calls MAGA Plus, which is,

26:41.640 --> 26:47.960
the plus is women who they haven't been able to really lock down enough to win the last couple

26:47.960 --> 26:56.520
of elections. And so, in the same way that he peeled away some democratic voting working class

26:56.520 --> 27:01.640
guys who were pissed off about having voted for Democrats three, four times, who promised that

27:01.640 --> 27:07.000
they were going to renegotiate trade deals and then voted for Trump because he said he was going

27:07.000 --> 27:10.600
to do it. And it wasn't the only reason why people voted for Trump, but it doesn't need to be that

27:10.600 --> 27:16.520
many people who you peel away with these messages. He now sees that opportunity with who he calls

27:16.520 --> 27:24.200
the warrior moms. So, it's interesting because I definitely think that there is an appeal around,

27:25.160 --> 27:29.320
I'm going to help you learn how to live that certain people are offering on the right.

27:30.760 --> 27:35.720
But I think with Bannon, what he's offering is a political program. He's offering a plan.

27:36.280 --> 27:43.800
It's an activist space. His slogan is action, action, action. And he doesn't, he refers to

27:43.800 --> 27:49.320
his listeners as the war room posse. And he makes them feel like they're not just listening or

27:49.320 --> 27:56.040
watching, they are part of his army. But it's that thing which is, I want David from accounts to

27:56.040 --> 28:02.440
feel like Ajax the conqueror. And maybe it is difficult to draw the line between political

28:02.440 --> 28:10.600
organizing, lapping and entertainment. Andrew Tate, there's a Andrew Tate group chat called

28:10.600 --> 28:15.880
the war room, which is again, very similar trying to say like, we're going to build you up and empower

28:15.960 --> 28:20.280
you if you just do these things. Yeah. And I think that this is where

28:21.480 --> 28:29.160
the left is at something of a disadvantage because it takes more time and it's more complicated to

28:29.160 --> 28:35.320
build the kind of mass power that has any kind of chance of standing up to the sort of consolidated

28:35.320 --> 28:41.320
wealth that we're talking about. Whereas Bannon is perfectly happy to just have a plan to get back

28:41.400 --> 28:47.560
into the White House. And so there is a plan and it is take over politics at every level,

28:48.760 --> 28:57.080
peel off part of your opposition by using all of this COVID residual anger and pivoting it

28:57.080 --> 29:02.760
in the way that we've been talking about. So what is the left plan? Like, I mean, we can

29:02.760 --> 29:08.200
diagnose, we can do systems analysis, but that's just going to make people feel helpless for the

29:08.200 --> 29:14.040
most part because then they're going to better understand that as an individual, there's nothing

29:14.040 --> 29:22.920
that they can do. They can only stand up to these systems in mass collective action. If there is a

29:22.920 --> 29:28.360
conspiracy and there's just five guys who are responsible for all of the suffering in the world,

29:28.360 --> 29:34.040
then like the bumper sticker says, make the Nuremberg code great again. Let's bring them up on

29:34.040 --> 29:40.680
war crimes trials. I mean, that's part of their plan is a sort of a fantasy of justice. That's

29:40.680 --> 29:45.320
also at the heart of QAnon is like there's going to be a great storm and all of the bad people

29:45.320 --> 29:49.320
are going to get arrested and they're going to be brought up on charges and there will be

29:49.320 --> 29:55.160
justice because we will replace them with the good people. The observation that January 6th

29:55.160 --> 30:02.520
was people dressing up and storming the capital. It was like a sort of Comic-Con element of it

30:02.520 --> 30:11.240
as well. You get to live this fantasy for a day, except it's real. Yeah. This is the Bannon playbook.

30:12.040 --> 30:21.880
He wants people to inhabit their avatars and so many of these figures are very, very skilled from

30:21.880 --> 30:27.240
the world of entertainment and reality television. Bannon has worked in Hollywood. He's worked in

30:27.240 --> 30:33.160
video games. Trump obviously, reality television, Tate as well, former reality show star.

30:34.520 --> 30:39.960
The only one who doesn't really have this history is Peterson. Joe Rogan also, former reality show.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.840
Didn't he voice come at the frog? What? Didn't he voice come at the frog?

30:44.520 --> 30:50.600
He's the only one who's just a natural at this. I always feel as a Canadian, I need to apologize

30:50.600 --> 30:55.960
when I'm abroad. If I stop all this for everybody out there, we'd be here all day.

30:59.240 --> 31:05.240
The left proposition is not just we're out here making a better argument about what is really

31:05.240 --> 31:13.640
driving mass misery. We also have to connect that analysis with a credible organizing strategy

31:14.200 --> 31:19.800
that shatters the sense that there's nothing you can do about these huge systems because it's a

31:19.800 --> 31:27.800
hell of a lot easier to take on a cabal than it is to take on a system. That's why, if anything

31:27.800 --> 31:34.840
has made me feel a little bit optimistic in recent days, it's been the UAW going out on strike,

31:36.280 --> 31:42.600
the United Auto Workers in the States and the fact that there's a great new leader of that union,

31:42.600 --> 31:49.800
Sean Fain, who was an insurgent candidate. He's on the news because he's taken on the big three

31:49.800 --> 31:57.800
automakers and he's doing real left populism. He is saying these companies have recorded record

31:57.800 --> 32:02.520
profits and they've given themselves massive wages and our workers haven't been able to keep up with

32:02.520 --> 32:09.880
the cost of living increases and we're going to get them. Just having somebody out there who has

32:09.880 --> 32:16.600
a clear left analysis and a plan about what to do about it, we are going to disrupt your assembly

32:16.600 --> 32:21.640
lines. I feel like it makes the bannons of the world sort of shrivel up and die because they are

32:21.640 --> 32:29.560
not died, but they can only sell the counterfeit if the real thing is an on offer or even in the

32:29.560 --> 32:38.600
public sphere. When words and action momentarily are married in these moments of mass worker action

32:38.680 --> 32:43.720
or the debt collective or tenant organizing or any of the ways that people are finding collective

32:43.720 --> 32:49.800
power, that's going to do more to drain the power of right wing conspiracy culture than an army of

32:49.800 --> 32:56.040
fact checkers and content moderators. I was thinking about one of the advantages that the

32:56.040 --> 33:03.320
right has, which is they've got this screen-based ecosystem, whether it's YouTube or accounts on

33:03.320 --> 33:09.560
Twitter, where they're bringing together a community and making it lonelier all the time.

33:09.560 --> 33:16.600
So I was reminded of that bit where Anthony says of Cleopatra, she makes hungry where most she

33:16.600 --> 33:22.200
satisfies. So it's satisfying this need for social connection because it's not the real thing,

33:22.200 --> 33:28.440
you're getting hungry and hungry all the time. How does the left draw a balance between contesting

33:28.440 --> 33:38.120
these spaces in a legacy media or social media ecology, but also just being in flesh space

33:38.120 --> 33:43.960
where we can touch each other and make eye contact and engage with each other as human beings and not

33:43.960 --> 33:51.320
digital avatars? That quote is so interesting because I feel like back to my first book,

33:51.320 --> 33:58.840
No Logo, which I wrote before the explosion of personal branding and some of the things that

33:58.840 --> 34:07.640
I revisit here, a lot of what I did in that book was track the way in which the first mega lifestyle

34:07.640 --> 34:15.000
brands like Nike and Apple and Starbucks were co-opting revolutionary rhetoric, putting Martin

34:15.080 --> 34:24.760
Luther King on Apple ads. Yes, this is for your time. It was weird. There was all of this

34:24.760 --> 34:29.160
unease, all of the iconography of the 1960s, the anti-Vietnam War movement was suddenly a

34:29.160 --> 34:40.360
Nike ad and Gandhi was from the grave shilling for Apple. On the one hand, you could say,

34:40.440 --> 34:45.320
nothing means anything anymore, but that wasn't my feeling. My feeling was like in the 90s where

34:45.320 --> 34:49.960
we had been told that nobody liked left ideas. I thought it was really exciting that these

34:49.960 --> 34:55.240
companies with all of their market research had found that what people actually wanted was revolution

34:55.240 --> 34:58.840
and obviously they weren't going to get it from their running shoes or their laptops,

34:58.840 --> 35:05.240
so there would be that constant hunger cycle that you're using much more literary references for.

35:06.200 --> 35:11.960
But so for capitalism, that's great because you'll just have to keep shopping. You'll get

35:11.960 --> 35:16.520
like a little hit and then you'll crash again and you'll have to shop again in order to get

35:16.520 --> 35:21.400
that feeling. I hate myself for the way in which I instinctively scroll through clothing when I

35:21.400 --> 35:25.560
feel sad and it makes me feel worse and like, why am I doing this? It's just like my classic

35:25.560 --> 35:33.960
depression activities. Yeah, exactly. Horrible. Well, and it's helpful to just be aware that

35:33.960 --> 35:40.680
you're doing it because you're sad or you're doing it because you're insecure and that people shop

35:40.680 --> 35:47.400
one of the times when you have the highest spike in consumption is when people are becoming

35:47.400 --> 35:52.520
parents for the first time because they're panicked and they don't have people who

35:52.520 --> 35:56.520
will help them figure out how to be parents anymore because if we don't live in communities,

35:56.520 --> 36:01.960
we tend to be isolated and so you just think, if I were to just get this $1,000 bouncy chair,

36:01.960 --> 36:08.040
everything would be fine. But I remember that from when I just, I mean, never have I been more of a

36:08.760 --> 36:12.120
consumer drone than in those days. I mean, was it a fear that like bypassed your

36:12.120 --> 36:16.280
and critical awareness of the thing you were doing? It was just... Well, it was really useful

36:16.280 --> 36:22.280
to me to see that statistic, like that this is the time when consumption is higher than at any

36:22.280 --> 36:25.880
point in our lives and not just because you need a whole bunch of new things. It's because

36:26.680 --> 36:30.760
it's well beyond what you need and it's just fear. Yeah, it's just fear.

36:31.960 --> 36:35.480
I know it keeps it in check a little bit. It doesn't keep it completely in check, obviously,

36:36.120 --> 36:40.200
but it's still helpful to know. I mean, you were talking about the

36:41.960 --> 36:46.040
symbols of revolution, language of revolution being co-opted. Yeah, let's come back to that.

36:46.040 --> 36:51.400
90s capitalism. I didn't know that Nike had used Martin Luther King, but the thing...

36:51.400 --> 36:56.760
Apple used Martin Luther King and Nike used a whole bunch of Vietnam War anthems.

36:56.760 --> 37:01.000
Oh my God. Because then the thing that it made me think of was in this very direct way,

37:01.000 --> 37:06.360
Nike revealing that it partnered with Colin Kaepernick all that time when he was being black

37:06.360 --> 37:11.480
listed by the NFL. Because I remember the conversations going on at that time, which

37:11.480 --> 37:15.320
for lots of people on the anti-racist level, lots of black people was a feeling of like,

37:15.320 --> 37:20.520
well, at least someone's standing with us during this time because also this queasiness of going,

37:21.160 --> 37:25.640
but you're doing it to sell your shoes. I mean, how did you make sense of moments like that?

37:26.200 --> 37:30.040
Yeah. I mean, I was teaching a course at the time, so it was helpful. I was teaching a course

37:30.040 --> 37:34.120
called the Corporate Self, an undergraduate course, so we were sort of processing all of that

37:34.120 --> 37:39.320
Nike ads in real time. I mean, it's interesting because it's not unlike the people's reaction

37:39.320 --> 37:45.560
to the Barbie movie, right? I don't know. Where it's like, oh, wow, all these feminist critiques

37:45.560 --> 37:48.440
are in here and they keep talking about patriarchy, but ultimately...

37:49.480 --> 37:58.360
I thought it, I really fucking hated the self-consciously woke dialogue. There's this

37:58.360 --> 38:02.120
one moment where the teenage girl was like, white savior Barbie, and I was like, it's like they took

38:02.120 --> 38:09.640
Tumblr from 2015 and chicken upside down all over the script. It was just so focus-grouped

38:09.640 --> 38:15.000
and calculated to get everybody. Turned me off. It really turned me off.

38:16.600 --> 38:27.240
And ultimately, just to be a boring lefty eco-feminist, it is an advertisement. It's an

38:27.240 --> 38:35.800
extraordinarily historically good advertisement for a plastic doll. And even if you love the movie,

38:35.800 --> 38:43.320
maybe especially if you love the movie, you should know that that will lead to materially,

38:43.320 --> 38:53.240
this selling of many, many, many more plastic dolls. And so its success is a huge failure for

38:53.240 --> 38:59.560
the earth. But at any rate, we were talking about them doing their market research for us

39:00.520 --> 39:05.960
and the co-optation. Well, so yeah, I think you can get really down about the ways that

39:05.960 --> 39:10.840
these ideas are being co-opted by the right, or you can be like, wow, these really are popular

39:10.840 --> 39:19.960
ideas. We should be making more of them. And that the, you know, one of the things that's been,

39:19.960 --> 39:25.080
I think, nice for me about the last few weeks of touring, I've been in the U.S. touring with the

39:25.080 --> 39:33.720
book, just got here to the U.K. There haven't been that many posts, well, we're not post pandemic,

39:33.720 --> 39:40.280
but since the beginning of the pandemic, there haven't been that many spaces for people to

39:40.280 --> 39:46.760
gather as leftists collectively. And one of the things that's been helpful to name is the

39:46.760 --> 39:53.480
particular experience that a lot of us had of going from the highs of the Bernie Sanders campaign

39:54.440 --> 40:01.720
to lockdown, Biden, you know, Democratic Party rallying and just that, like the combination

40:01.720 --> 40:09.640
of that extreme political disappointment and being isolated from each other, so not being able to

40:10.440 --> 40:16.520
process it, re-strategize, think about what we want to do next. And instead, in that isolation

40:16.520 --> 40:20.840
and in our disappointment, a lot of what we did was just attack each other. And sort of,

40:20.840 --> 40:27.000
you know, I write in the book, we went from this, you know, this surfing this wave of not me, us,

40:27.000 --> 40:35.000
and this kind of real joy of kind of a release from individualism and ego. I mean, that was what

40:35.000 --> 40:43.240
was so powerful about being on the road with Bernie was, you know, the slogan, not me, us.

40:45.320 --> 40:49.560
Originally, I think a lot of people just thought it was Bernie saying, this is not about me, this

40:49.560 --> 40:55.160
is about us. But when you were out on the campaign, it took on this whole other life and meaning,

40:55.720 --> 41:01.560
which was much more about, you know, what what Astro Taylor talks about with the debt collective,

41:01.560 --> 41:06.600
where with something like medical debt or student debt, it's this private shame that people are

41:06.600 --> 41:14.440
carrying. And it's just all me in the sense of my fault and my burden. But when you meet lots of

41:14.440 --> 41:21.560
other people who are who have that same burden, you find it us and that us has power, like you

41:21.560 --> 41:26.440
organize into a debtors union, then you're a problem for the creditors. And if you and in the

41:26.440 --> 41:32.520
same way that when workers organize their problem for their bosses. So to go from those highs,

41:32.520 --> 41:37.560
you know, of, you know, being in Las Vegas when Bernie won the strip, which was like,

41:38.200 --> 41:43.240
I mean, I'm just, it was the happiest moment of my political life just because it's Vegas,

41:43.240 --> 41:48.200
right? And it's shiny and gold and Trump. I mean, was it one of the moments of politics where you

41:48.200 --> 41:53.320
feel like the boundaries of the self dissolve a bit? And it's like, well, just absolutely yes,

41:53.320 --> 41:58.280
because you've got the nurses and you've got teachers and you have just so many different

41:58.280 --> 42:06.360
movements coming together and just reaching towards each other. And and then the coinciding

42:06.360 --> 42:12.360
of lockdown, I mean, we were so vividly remember being on my couch, I was still living in the

42:12.360 --> 42:19.160
States at the time, and, and watching the whole Democratic Party just coalesce around Biden.

42:19.880 --> 42:26.280
And, and then almost instantly, the Bernie movement just fractured and everybody started

42:26.280 --> 42:31.880
starting their own podcasts and attacking each other. And hey, not too much about podcasts.

42:33.080 --> 42:38.840
Listen, I mean, I got a cat to feed, right? But it was, you know, we were, we were sudden,

42:38.840 --> 42:43.160
we went from not me, us to just being dropped in this ocean of me, me, me, me, me. And that's all

42:43.160 --> 42:47.720
we knew how to do. And it was just heartbreaking. I really, I really want to talk about this,

42:47.720 --> 42:53.000
because I think it's something where I feel, again, really personally conflicted about my own work,

42:53.000 --> 43:00.600
because Novara came out of the student movement, we all met through occupying our university,

43:00.600 --> 43:07.160
which was UCL, or, you know, the plate glass windows of Milbank, which was the Tory party HQ

43:07.160 --> 43:12.120
being smashed. That was cool. That was my first year of university. And I just remember it was

43:12.120 --> 43:16.680
me and my friend who were like, in Milbank. And she's, she looks like me. She's like my

43:16.680 --> 43:21.320
doppelganger, but blonde and Irish, like we're just like same height, same face, but like two

43:21.320 --> 43:27.000
different colorways. Like that was how we all met. And that was where the organization came from.

43:27.720 --> 43:33.480
And we've always felt like we're part of a movement movement, but journalism is different

43:33.480 --> 43:37.240
from being a propagandist for the movement. And there are all kinds of tensions

43:37.880 --> 43:45.880
that come with it. And I think that I often bulk at the constraints of what I feel are

43:45.880 --> 43:50.440
unfair expectations from parasocial relationships where I'm like, why is someone on Twitter yelling

43:50.440 --> 43:55.240
at me like they know me or like they own me? But the fact is, is that it's not unreasonable to have

43:55.720 --> 44:00.680
political expectations or editorial expectations of someone whose

44:02.520 --> 44:06.760
public career is the result of coming from this movement. So I was wondering like,

44:06.760 --> 44:12.120
how do you navigate that the sort of, you know, the rigors and the demands of journalism,

44:12.120 --> 44:17.960
that you've got to go where the facts are leading you, the fact you've got political aims,

44:17.960 --> 44:21.400
the fact that you want to think critically and independently, but you also want to be

44:21.480 --> 44:25.000
accountable to people. How do you square all of these circles?

44:25.000 --> 44:30.760
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think there's a lot going on there. You know, I think left media should not

44:30.760 --> 44:38.120
be propaganda. And we, you know, I like coming back to what we were talking about earlier about

44:38.120 --> 44:44.120
facts do matter, research does matter. It's part of the reason why I always hated the idea that

44:44.680 --> 44:48.760
you have are supposed to be a brand. Because what I know about being a brand is that

44:49.560 --> 44:56.680
you repeat yourself endlessly. If you're a good brand, you've identified your core meaning and

44:56.680 --> 45:01.800
you're just repeating and reinforcing. And you have message discipline, which is pretty much

45:01.800 --> 45:06.680
the opposite of being a good journalist, a good investigator, which requires that you

45:06.680 --> 45:11.640
follow your research wherever it leads. You have to be able to be changed by what you're learning.

45:12.520 --> 45:16.760
And so I think these projects are really antithetical. That doesn't mean that you

45:16.760 --> 45:21.880
don't have like an image in the world, but branding is a very particular thing. Branding is

45:21.880 --> 45:27.080
chasing your own tail at infinitum. And that might be okay to sell running shoes, but it really is

45:27.080 --> 45:32.840
not a good model for being a public intellectual or a journalist. And I think we should push back

45:32.840 --> 45:36.440
on it. And I think also part of the cruelty that we've been talking about online is that

45:37.400 --> 45:41.720
there's a cost to performing a thing version of yourself, which is what it means to be a brand.

45:42.440 --> 45:48.200
You're out there saying, this is thing me. This is commodity version of me. People will believe

45:48.200 --> 45:52.760
you and they will think that they can throw very hard things at you and that you won't bleed

45:53.480 --> 45:59.080
because things don't bleed. And so I don't think we quite believe each other are real online.

46:01.240 --> 46:05.240
And that's a problem. It's not the only reason why people are cruel. They're also racist. They're

46:05.240 --> 46:14.680
also misogynist. But I think there is also this factor that is driving it. So we should try to

46:14.680 --> 46:20.280
dething ourselves if we can. I mean, just to play devil's advocate on the difference between a

46:21.400 --> 46:27.080
journalist and a propagandist, I was talking about this with my partner. And one of the things that

46:27.080 --> 46:31.000
he was saying is, well, doesn't this keep you locked into very bourgeois norms? So if you say,

46:31.000 --> 46:34.760
well, this is what a journalist does. And there are certain things that journalists does,

46:34.760 --> 46:40.600
which cannot be subordinated to your political aims. Doesn't that make you a worse communist?

46:40.600 --> 46:44.680
Doesn't this make you a worse socialist? Doesn't this make you worse at bringing

46:45.320 --> 46:51.880
the world you want to see into existence? I think you need to be transparent about what

46:51.880 --> 46:54.920
values you're holding yourself to, what standards you're holding yourself to.

46:58.280 --> 47:03.480
And I don't think you do subscribe to the idea that you're objective, that you don't have politics.

47:03.480 --> 47:07.880
No, you wear your politics on your sleeve, you're in it because you want to change the world.

47:09.080 --> 47:14.280
But you're still accountable for what you say, and you're still going to hold yourself to standards

47:14.280 --> 47:20.600
of accuracy and truth and probing. And why? Why does that matter? You also have to say why that

47:20.600 --> 47:27.320
matters and why it makes for stronger movements and why movements always have strong movements,

47:27.320 --> 47:33.800
always have powerful art, powerful journalism. It's an ecosystem, and this is a piece of the

47:33.800 --> 47:38.200
ecosystem. I think where we get into trouble is when the rest of the ecosystem is not healthy.

47:42.120 --> 47:47.800
I'm interested in the history of what Navarra came out of, of the movements Navarra came out of.

47:47.800 --> 47:56.200
I probably became aware of you around the Corbyn movement and saw you as a kind of

47:56.200 --> 48:00.920
the media arm of the Corbyn project. Maybe that's wrong, but that's the way I saw you.

48:00.920 --> 48:07.960
Not that you were propagandist, I know it's always a little tinge, but you also have to be able to

48:07.960 --> 48:12.680
do critique because if movements can't do critique and that it's going to be through the media,

48:12.680 --> 48:16.920
that's how we're going to hear each other, then you're just going to keep making the same mistakes

48:16.920 --> 48:26.040
over and over again. But what I'm describing around the burning moment, all of those podcasts

48:26.040 --> 48:32.280
were relatively healthy when there was a political project that was healthy. It was when the political

48:32.280 --> 48:38.680
project collapsed that it just seemed like the left was a bunch of podcasts. And I don't think

48:38.680 --> 48:44.600
that that is a left. And I think that if people are, they're always going to be cruel online,

48:44.600 --> 48:51.960
but I think these parasocial relationships take on an overinflated and unhealthy role

48:51.960 --> 48:56.600
when they're subbing in for collective organizing that isn't in a healthy state.

48:57.480 --> 49:04.920
And is that happening here? Well, I think that since the demise of the Corbyn movement, and

49:04.920 --> 49:12.680
again, it was straight from Corbyn into lockdown and that was a grim six months. It was really

49:12.680 --> 49:21.800
like a bereavement because not only was this central force of your life gone, you're also being

49:21.880 --> 49:26.520
piled on with humiliation by everyone crowing and saying they were right about you all along.

49:26.520 --> 49:29.960
And then you were separate from your comrades because you couldn't see each other and you could

49:29.960 --> 49:36.680
only communicate online. Like it was a very grim time. And I think that just anecdotally,

49:36.680 --> 49:40.680
there are lots of people trying different things and there's kind of like embryonic

49:40.680 --> 49:45.800
experimentation going on. But certainly, I think with with Navarra, it is this

49:46.360 --> 49:54.120
ongoing discussion about what does it mean to be a socialist media outlet, which takes

49:54.120 --> 49:59.000
journalistic standards very seriously and take socialism very seriously. And there are conflicts

49:59.000 --> 50:05.320
there, there are tensions there. But the more robust the socialist project is outside of Navarra,

50:05.320 --> 50:11.880
I think that the clear your role is going to be. It's just it's when it isn't clear that there

50:15.960 --> 50:23.800
you said it. I mean, I kind of want to talk a little bit about this thing of turning

50:24.840 --> 50:31.640
oneself into a brand because we all do it. We all do it now that social media exists. Anyone who

50:31.640 --> 50:39.560
has Instagram or TikTok or Twitter is doing brand them to some extent. What does it mean for

50:40.280 --> 50:47.080
the left to be contesting so much of its politics through these digital avatars? I mean,

50:47.080 --> 50:50.360
you know, one is that it stops people seeing each other as human beings. But what does it do

50:50.360 --> 50:57.080
to the politics? Yeah, I don't think it's been great. I mean, in general, understatement of

50:57.080 --> 51:02.920
the century. And I do want to say that these these political campaigns that we've both referenced,

51:02.920 --> 51:15.320
I think that we should we should strive for more in terms of I think we should

51:16.200 --> 51:23.160
expect from these political campaigns that when there are losses, they're not just abruptly

51:23.160 --> 51:31.800
end and they're not be a process for trying to hold on to all of that organizing energy and to

51:31.800 --> 51:36.200
think strategically about what the next stage was. I mean, I was a Bernie surrogate and

51:38.200 --> 51:41.960
you know, I think there was like one email that we all got that was just like

51:49.960 --> 51:55.000
I mean, I love the guy. I'm not blaming him. But you know, social relations have never been

51:55.000 --> 52:00.360
his strength. But you know, I think we you know, if we are going to ask people to go all in for

52:00.360 --> 52:05.960
these campaigns and these moments when we sent some opening, you know, they're not all going to win.

52:05.960 --> 52:11.880
Most of them are going to fail. And there should be a strategy for holding that space so that we

52:11.880 --> 52:18.600
don't all turn on each other afterwards. But the the branding piece of it and this is, you know,

52:18.600 --> 52:23.240
a big part of the reason why I wanted to come back to these themes. And it's something that I talk

52:23.240 --> 52:29.080
about with a lot of my comrades in the movement about the way the logic of personal branding

52:29.080 --> 52:35.000
and even collective branding, because it isn't just the individual brands. It's also the movement

52:35.000 --> 52:45.960
as brand that I think is part of why we've had these like peaks, peak peaks and big valleys where

52:45.960 --> 52:52.200
it seems like everybody is talking about whatever the thing is. And and we have, you know, historic

52:52.200 --> 52:55.560
numbers of people on the streets, you know, whether we're talking about climate strikes,

52:55.560 --> 53:00.520
Black Lives Matter, me too, you know, it just seems like everybody is with the program. And then

53:02.680 --> 53:07.880
and then and then the crash and then the internal divisions. And part of it, you know,

53:07.880 --> 53:13.000
Keyanga Amada Taylor, who I quote in the book of Fairbitt is a, you know, wonderful colleague and

53:13.000 --> 53:19.640
friend. She's written a fair bit about how why movements need more democracy so that it isn't

53:19.640 --> 53:25.720
just, you know, I think it's important that we have ways of talking about this that deep

53:25.720 --> 53:30.440
personalize it. I think people are trying to build movements with really inadequate tools.

53:31.080 --> 53:37.480
And so we're on these corporate platforms and people get, you know, lifted up to leadership

53:37.480 --> 53:45.560
positions because they are persuasive, because they're, you know, they're, they're, they're

53:45.560 --> 53:50.600
great at messaging. There's whatever it is. Sometimes it's a little bit random, but they

53:50.600 --> 53:54.120
aren't elected and there aren't mechanisms in place to hold them accountable. So, you know,

53:54.120 --> 53:58.680
in the book, I talk about how that, you know, that happened to me with no logo. Like there was a

53:58.680 --> 54:06.440
move that, that, that book predicted that there was going to be a large anti-corporate uprising.

54:06.440 --> 54:09.880
There wasn't yet. There were just like, you know, you were talking about these sort of embryonic,

54:09.880 --> 54:13.480
like little things that was like reclaim the streets. And there was like an anti-switch

54:13.560 --> 54:16.920
shot movement, but there wasn't a big movement. And then when that book was at the press,

54:17.560 --> 54:22.200
these huge protests started popping off all over the place in Seattle and then Genoa and so on.

54:22.200 --> 54:26.520
And because I had written a book, I suddenly was, according to the media, the face of this

54:26.520 --> 54:30.520
movement. And it was bullshit because I had just written a book. Nobody elected me.

54:31.400 --> 54:37.800
Nobody could hold me accountable. And suddenly, because this is what corporate media wants,

54:37.800 --> 54:42.200
they want like two or three people who are going to be the face of this thing. And, you know,

54:42.200 --> 54:46.920
I suddenly was like, no logo was a brand. And the whole thing got completely out of my control.

54:46.920 --> 54:49.240
And Vogue asked you to do shopping with the enemy.

54:49.960 --> 54:53.320
Yes, I didn't do it. They asked me, there were all kinds of like, there was a,

54:53.320 --> 55:02.600
there was advertising that got offers to do designer ad campaigns. And people did go create

55:02.600 --> 55:06.760
no logo products. I think there's still a no logo craft beer. People send me pictures of it.

55:07.480 --> 55:13.080
I don't know if it's any good. But, you know, I wanted to write about this from the inside and

55:13.080 --> 55:17.560
not have it be like a call out, like, oh, that person, you know, wasn't accountable. I really

55:17.560 --> 55:23.480
just think we need to have democratic movements. And in the absence of democratic movements,

55:23.480 --> 55:28.280
people are still trying to build movements. And it's not work. These tools are failing us.

55:28.280 --> 55:31.400
So we should try some new ones. And I think we are trying new ones. This is part of why

55:31.400 --> 55:34.680
we're seeing a wave of union organizing. I mean, isn't it also about shifting

55:35.320 --> 55:40.280
the kinds of political relationships we have with one another? Because if all of us are brands,

55:40.280 --> 55:44.920
brands are always competing, and they're always competing for attention, and they're competing

55:44.920 --> 55:49.800
for money. And if we turn ourselves into things, and we're having relationships as things, you

55:49.800 --> 55:53.480
can't, you can't build a movement based on solidarity with that. But the relationship

55:53.480 --> 55:59.560
between comrades, which is a word that you just used, is so different. And it's so rich and

55:59.560 --> 56:03.320
layered. And you want, as you were saying before, you want your ideas to spread. Whereas the,

56:03.320 --> 56:08.680
whereas the logic of capitalism and branding is, I want the credit. This is mine. It's an ownership

56:08.680 --> 56:14.840
model, which is exactly the opposite of what you want. This is my most cancelable opinion.

56:14.840 --> 56:16.920
Oh, dear. This is my most cancelable opinion, which is that...

56:16.920 --> 56:19.880
You're going to get me canceled by property. Yeah, you're going to get canceled by property.

56:19.880 --> 56:24.840
I'm so sorry. It's time somebody brought down Naomi Klein, and there's going to be this podcast.

56:24.840 --> 56:30.120
My most cancelable opinion is that the anti-racist movement has become so concerned with

56:30.200 --> 56:36.360
intellectual property. Whether that's, you know, having beef with POC, because, oh,

56:36.360 --> 56:41.560
that lumps us all in together. Or whether that's saying, okay, well, if we use the slogan,

56:41.560 --> 56:48.440
you can't use the slogan. And how different that was to the ethos of the Black Panther movement.

56:48.440 --> 56:51.560
Black Panther movement is like, you want to call yourself the Yellow Panthers? Amazing.

56:51.560 --> 56:58.120
Like you want to call yourself the White Panthers? Amazing. Whereas we're so concerned with drawing

56:58.120 --> 57:03.320
these lines of separation in between, it's fundamentally liberal. It's liberal in the

57:03.320 --> 57:09.240
sense that liberalism perceives other people always as a threat and an incursion rather than

57:09.240 --> 57:13.800
what are the generative, creative relationships that occur between people.

57:14.840 --> 57:21.720
And obviously, it comes from real injustices, right? I mean, it comes from real examples of

57:21.720 --> 57:26.600
intellectual theft of Black women not being credited for intellectual contributions to

57:26.600 --> 57:33.080
movements for many, many decades. So I don't think it's just liberalism. I think it's also

57:33.800 --> 57:37.800
a needed corrective. It has been a needed corrective. And I think it is also a needed

57:37.800 --> 57:43.480
corrective to talk about how we want ideas to spread. But I think even this idea of

57:44.200 --> 57:54.360
credit is a tricky one because credit matters when you have a commodity and it's either about

57:54.360 --> 58:00.200
your place within an attention economy or a literal economy where people make money from

58:00.200 --> 58:08.760
doing these things. And of course, the appropriation of this stuff is wrong and it's bad. But to simply

58:08.760 --> 58:14.760
receive credit is not the same as what is the basis of a movement which can really build.

58:14.760 --> 58:20.840
And I'm not just talking about Black Lives Matter. I've also very much seen it with the

58:21.560 --> 58:28.600
relentless focus on cultural appropriation from South Asian radicals in this country. And I go,

58:28.600 --> 58:35.080
yes, I get it. I do get it. But okay, everyone recognizes that Henna comes from us. What next?

58:35.080 --> 58:39.720
Like, why is recognition the thing we're striving for?

58:40.520 --> 58:49.160
Well, you know, I think it comes down to people just trying to make a really screwed up system

58:49.800 --> 58:55.080
work for them. And I think that if there is a genuine revolutionary project that has any

58:55.080 --> 59:02.040
prospect of transforming this system to a more egalitarian one, there might be more openness

59:02.040 --> 59:07.800
to challenging these ideas around intellectual credit and so on. But within capitalism,

59:07.800 --> 59:11.400
someone's going to make money off of it. Somebody's going to get the credit. Somebody is going to be

59:11.400 --> 59:16.360
on the cover of the magazine. And I think a lot of people feel like if they're not fighting for

59:16.360 --> 59:19.560
it to be them, it's going to be somebody else. And they're right. They're absolutely right.

59:20.120 --> 59:27.480
So I guess it all comes down to building that revolutionary project because without it,

59:27.480 --> 59:31.240
I think we're just going to be fighting for our scraps.

59:32.280 --> 59:38.200
I know this is a really big gear shift. But so Jewishness is really central to this book. It's

59:38.200 --> 59:44.680
one of the threads which connects you and the other Naomi. It's central to the anti-Semitic

59:44.680 --> 59:50.520
conspiracism of the globalists are doing this, that and the other. But then you also talk about

59:50.520 --> 59:55.320
this doubleness of being both victim and perpetrator within the context of Israel. So

59:55.320 --> 01:00:01.160
I guess can you talk me through how doubleness and the motif of the doppelganger brought you into

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:09.320
this sort of analysis of Jewishness, Zionism and Israel? Yeah. I came across a paper by

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:16.360
Caroline Rooney who's here in the UK who talked about Israel as a country with doppelganger politics

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:25.800
by which she meant that it was a nation that had like a fundamental split where the Israeli Jews

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:33.960
projected all of everything that they could not bear about themselves onto the Palestinian

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.680
and other. And then there's also like this sort of doppelganger at the heart of

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.600
the Zionist project, which is that of the new Jew versus the old Jew. So this is something,

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.080
you know, I quote Philip Roth, as I mentioned, with all apologies to my 20-year-old self who

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:55.560
hurled a Philip Roth book across my dorm room and vowed never ever to read another book by Philip

01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:02.760
Roth. We will say things at least. But, you know, every, I was reading so much doppelganger

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:10.920
literature and I just kept seeing references to Operation Shiloh because 1993 doppelganger

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:16.440
masterpiece and I ended up finding it to be really, really useful because, you know, in part because of

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:24.360
that ridiculous seriousness thread, but also the ways in which it really engages with this sort of

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:29.800
the unshakable ethnic double, right, which is the double that is projected onto

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:37.480
people who are not white and Christian around the world, which is the double that isn't the

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.280
brand that you create that you think you have in the world. It's the one that other people create

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.640
and project onto you. So for Roth, it's Shiloh, who is the doppelganger of all Jews projected onto

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:53.960
them. But then it becomes, you know, a book about Zionism, limited in its critique, but

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:59.560
still interesting and he's very fascinated with the figure of the new Jew as a doppelganger of

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:04.760
the old Jew, of the diasporic Jew. So what's the new Jew and the old Jew? Well, the new, yeah. So

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:13.960
this is a project, a Zionism is to create a new Jew who is the, you know, muscle-bound, gun-toting,

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:20.840
strong Jew. Knows Krav Maga. I mean, there's, you know, there's, there's, there's, and I, you know,

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:27.560
I think that the critique from somebody like Roth, who is like a little, you know, it's an anti,

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:33.960
it's a kind of an, like an anti-literary, you know, you with your books who couldn't save

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:42.280
yourselves from, from the Holocaust, we new Jews will protect you. And so it's this, there's,

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.800
there's, there's that doppelganger in Israeli culture, old Jew, new Jew. And there's a way

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:54.120
that it blames the victims of the Holocaust for the Holocaust, mostly unspoken, sometimes spoken.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:59.560
And, and then there, and this is what Rooney was writing about, the way

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:08.440
Israel settler colonialism is a doppelganger, becomes a doppelganger of the ways Jews were

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.040
treated in Europe, not, she's not talking about the Nazis and neither am I, but she is talking

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:17.320
about the pogroms, the ghettoization, all the enclosures, the second-class citizenship,

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:22.440
the apartheid system that, that is in Israel. You know, this has been some of the more

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.360
controversial parts of the book. It's a little bit of a twist for people who thought that the

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.000
book was just going to be about, you know, feeling superior to Naomi Wolfe and Steve Bannon.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.840
Yeah, suddenly we're in Gaza.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.040
So what happened when you were in Gaza?

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.880
Oh, that's a story. Yeah. So that's what I mean. So I was in Gaza,

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:51.240
shock doctrine had come out. And, you know, my previous books had been published in Hebrew.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:57.000
And I'd been approached by some Israeli publishers to publish the shock doctrine.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:05.160
It had, the shock doctrine has a chapter on Israel and its role in what I call the disaster

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:11.720
capitalism complex. And it looks at the export of all of these Israeli spy and surveillance

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:19.720
and military tools. So I wanted the book to come out in Hebrew, but I also had written in

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:27.240
support of BDS and was in contact with the BDS committee. And so we tried to figure out a way

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.560
for shock doctrine to come out in Hebrew and Arabic at the same time with an activist publisher

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:36.120
called Andalus that doesn't exist anymore, that up to that point had only published Arabic writing

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:42.920
and translation. So, you know, I launched the book on the West Bank. You know, we did a lot of

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:48.120
things to make, you know, to as much as possible have a book come out in Hebrew that did not

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.760
support the Israeli state. It's complicated because most arts organizations get money and so on. But

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:58.440
anyway, we did our best. It was blessed by the BDS committee. But before I went on the book tour,

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:06.120
I wanted to go to Gaza to do some reporting. And yeah, so there's a scene in the book about

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:10.920
coming back from Gaza through the era's checkpoint. We had no trouble getting into Gaza because at

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:16.600
that point, they didn't know who I was at the checkpoint going in. But coming back because

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:26.520
I had done a press conference in Gaza and talked about BDS and talked about, I mean, there had

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.640
just been a huge assault on Gaza a few months earlier. When we came back through the checkpoint,

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:37.640
they were waiting for us. And there was this really bizarre experience that we had where first

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:46.840
they kept us waiting for about three hours. It's very strange because there's no way to

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.400
communicate. There's just the wall. You're on the other side of the wall and there's surveillance

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:56.440
cameras everywhere. They see us. We're the only ones there and they won't open the gate to let us

01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:01.240
through. But if you are there past curfew, then you can't get through and you're in this sort of

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:08.280
weird zone where there's nothing there. So finally, the door opens. We go through the

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:14.200
security check and then they take my husband, Avi, and there's a guy who introduces himself as

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.280
Ares from Ares. So you've got another doppelganger. Another doppelganger. They just follow me

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:25.560
everywhere. So Ares from Ares takes Avi upstairs and he meets General at his corner office.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:34.440
And he gets this huge speech where they tell him that look out the window and there's a bunch of

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.960
like tanks doing a security exercise. And they say, do you know how close we were to sending

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:44.280
in ground troops to Gaza? Which at that point, there had never been ground troops sent into Gaza

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:51.480
since the blockade. And we were going to send them in to rescue you. You have no idea how much

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:55.960
danger you were in. We were in no danger. I mean, we were hosted by Palestinians,

01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:02.840
like we were invited. And they said, we see everything, we hear everything,

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:14.760
and we were going to reinvade Gaza to rescue you and get your woman under control. Literally,

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:20.920
they said that to Avi about me, like we know what she's been saying. And we don't care what you say.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.400
Because you're Jewish and we will rescue you. So they were saying, you have a doppelganger.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:32.760
Just as the rest of the world only sees you as Shylock, we only see you as Jews. We don't care

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:39.560
about your politics or what you say. We will rescue you from the Palestinian enemy, even though you

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.520
think that they're your friends. It was just the biggest mindfuck you could possibly imagine.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.680
And it's also deeply manipulative. It's like there'll be a ground invasion of Gaza.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:55.160
Because of you and your supposed solidarity with these people, we're going to invade them

01:07:55.160 --> 01:08:01.560
even more than we ordinarily do. I never told that story. I mean, I wrote about what we saw in

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:06.920
Gaza and reported on the aftermath of that invasion. There have been so many since. But I

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:13.720
never told the story of that particular gaslighting mission that they did with eras from eras.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:19.560
And but to me, it's so, you know, I shared the story in the book and thanks for asking,

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:25.800
nobody's asked about it. Because we've got, we've got, I call it zionism

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:30.280
derangement syndrome in the UK, where if you try and make any arguments critical of zionism,

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.960
it gets pulled into Corbin and Semitism, the left. And it's just.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.360
Well, there's something about the offer that they were saying, you know, that is really the,

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.560
you know, it's the, it's, it's, it's not just Israel that's making that offer. I think the UK

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.360
is making that offer with its militarized borders. It's, it's, you know, it's take the guns, take

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:58.840
the walls, take the prisons. We will keep you safe from the hordes. And, you know, when I look at

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.400
my doppelganger, you know, she seems to have thrown in with that ideology. She's got the guns and

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:09.640
she's, you know, talking about the wars on the border. And, you know, I think as the climate

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:16.120
crisis accelerates and the wars never end and poverty deepens, I mean, this is going to be the

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.480
offer to all of us. And we have to, we have to decide if we want to take the offer.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:27.000
Yeah. I mean, I've got one, one last question, which is when so many different aspects of your

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.640
identity are attached to fucked up things. And in your case, it was, you know, your Jewishness

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:39.720
being invoked by this general to commit an appalling act of violence. But, you know, in my case, it

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:47.480
might be my womanhood being invoked to stomp on trans people or being a Westerner and what that means

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:53.960
for all of the, you know, extractive exploitative activities of, you know, Western corporations

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:59.880
and the things which fuel my own consumption. Yeah. When we're so tied to all of these things,

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.840
is it possible to have a stable identity? And is it even desirable to have one?

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:11.160
I think we are in a moment that we simply cannot bear as individuals. It's just too hard. I mean,

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:23.480
we are in this simultaneous unearthing, unveiling of, you know, unbearable networks of suffering

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:31.080
that sustain the lives of the privileged outside of the Shadowlands. You know, and I think COVID

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:39.960
acted as a unearthing and as a revealer of all the people who hold up our world and allowed

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:45.320
those of us who were able to be locked down to be locked down and bore all of the risk. And I think

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.400
that generated a certain kind of derangement that is part of what I'm tracking in the book

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:53.240
of a lot of privileged people claiming that they were victims of genocide and apartheid

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:59.240
and Jim Crow and slavery and all the crimes of the last 500 years were projected onto a vaccine app

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.520
or, you know, being made to wear masks. But I don't think any of us are really looking,

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:12.600
are really able to look at the, just the unbearability of our complicity in these,

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:20.120
these past, future and present networks of suffering, extinction,

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:27.800
dispossession, we can only bear it together. You know, we can only bear it in the sturdiest,

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:34.120
widest possible coalitions. Like I quote Ariel Angel, the editor of Jewish Courants at the end

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:41.240
of the book saying, you know, we're going to need each other. And part of recognizing that we will

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:48.040
need each other in the face of surging fascism and climate breakdown means that we are going to have

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:53.080
to get over ourselves a little bit, you know, whether it's our individual brands or our individual

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.320
identity groups, which does not mean erasure, which does not mean annihilate the ego,

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:02.920
or dissolve into some mush of no difference that pretends that we are all coming into coalition with

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:09.720
the same risks, debts and needs. No, but we will need each other. And we, you know, I do believe

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:20.360
that every, you know, victory for the fascist right is also a story of division, sectarianism,

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:24.360
failure to make a strategic alliances on the anti-fascist left. And we're on the,

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:29.160
we are on the knife edge. We are just on the knife edge. We can't afford to destroy each other.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:34.440
Just a little sprinkle of ego death, just a tiny, like a little salt bay sprinkle.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.360
Yeah, find your doppelganger and just, just get humble if you can.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.000
Yeah, snog your doppelganger if you can. Naomi Klein, thank you so much for joining us.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.120
Thank you, Ash. This was really, really deep. Thanks.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.120
Well, have fun at the BBC.

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.160
This is a good way to start.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:59.960
I'm Naomi Klein, and I am at Navar Media right now, having just done a wonderful in-depth interview.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:07.320
And this is why I love Navar Media. And I listen regularly and watch to find out what the hell is

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:13.160
going on in the UK. It is so critical to have independent media that we can trust that goes

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.200
deep on the issues and also lets people stay up on the day-to-day twists and turns. It's going to

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:24.760
be especially important for your next election. So I'm incredibly grateful that Navar Media exists,

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:31.240
and it exists because people support it. So make sure to support Navar Media. We need

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:36.200
left institutions, and that means that we have to support them when they're doing such great work

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:49.640
as Navar Media is. Thanks.
